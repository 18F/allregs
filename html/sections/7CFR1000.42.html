                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transfers and diversions to pool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant or a handler described in Sec.  1135.11 of this chapter to another pool plant shall be classified as Class I milk unless the handlers both request the same classification in another class. In either case, the classification shall be subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The skim milk and butterfat classified in each class shall be limited to the amount of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, remaining in such class at the receiving plant after the computations pursuant to Sec.  1000.44(a)(9) and the corresponding step of Sec.  1000.44(b);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the transferring plant received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec.  1000.44(a)(3) or the corresponding step of Sec.  1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred shall be classified so as to allocate the least possible Class I utilization to such other source milk; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the transferring handler received during the month other source milk to be allocated pursuant to Sec.  1000.44(a)(8) or (9) or the corresponding steps of Sec.  1000.44(b), the skim milk or butterfat so transferred, up to the total of the skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in such receipts of other source milk, shall not be classified as Class I milk to a greater extent than would be the case if the other source milk had been received at the receiving plant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfers and diversions to a plant regulated under another Federal order. Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the form of a fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product from a pool plant to a plant regulated under another Federal order shall be classified in the following manner. Such classification shall apply only to the skim milk or butterfat that is in excess of any receipts at the pool plant from a plant regulated under another Federal order of skim milk and butterfat, respectively, in fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products, respectively, that are in the same category as described in paragraph (b)(1) or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As Class I milk, if transferred as packaged fluid milk products;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If transferred or diverted in bulk form, classification shall be in the classes to which allocated under the other order:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the operators of both plants so request in their reports of receipts and utilization filed with their respective market administrators, transfers in bulk form shall be classified as other than Class I to the extent that such utilization is available for such classification pursuant to the allocation provisions of the other order;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If diverted, the diverting handler must request a classification other than Class I. If the plant receiving the

diverted milk does not have sufficient utilization available for the requested classification and some of the diverted milk is consequently assigned to Class I use, the diverting handler shall be given the option of designating the entire load of diverted milk as producer milk at the plant physically receiving the milk. Alternatively, if the diverting handler so chooses, it may designate which dairy farmers whose milk was diverted during the month will be designated as producers under the order physically receiving the milk. If the diverting handler declines to accept either of these options, the market administrator will prorate the portion of diverted milk in excess of Class II, III, and IV use among all the dairy farmers whose milk was received from the diverting handler on the last day of the month, then the second-to-last day, and continuing in that fashion until the excess diverted milk has been assigned as producer milk under the receiving order; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If information concerning the classes to which such transfers or diversions were allocated under the other order is not available to the market administrator for the purpose of establishing classification under this paragraph, classification shall be Class I, subject to adjustment when such information is available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transfers and diversions to producer-handlers and to exempt plants. Skim milk or butterfat that is transferred or diverted from a pool plant to a producer-handler under any Federal order or to an exempt plant shall be classified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As Class I milk if transferred or diverted to a producer-handler;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As Class I milk if transferred to an exempt plant in the form of a packaged fluid milk product; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with the utilization assigned to it by the market administrator if transferred or diverted in the form of a bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product to an exempt plant. For this purpose, the receiving handler's utilization of skim milk and butterfat in each class, in series beginning with Class IV, shall be assigned to the extent possible to its receipts of skim milk and butterfat, in bulk fluid cream products, and bulk fluid milk products, respectively, pro rata to each source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfers and diversions to other nonpool plants. Skim milk or butterfat transferred or diverted in the following forms from a pool plant to a nonpool plant that is not a plant regulated under another order, an exempt plant, or a producer-handler plant shall be classified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As Class I milk, if transferred in the form of a packaged fluid milk product; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As Class I milk, if transferred or diverted in the form of a bulk fluid milk product or transferred in the form of a bulk fluid cream product, unless the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(A) and (B) of this section are met, transfers or diversions in bulk form shall be classified on the basis of the assignment of the nonpool plant's utilization, excluding the milk equivalent of both nonfat milk solids and concentrated milk used in the plant during the month, to its receipts as set forth in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) through (viii) of this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The transferring handler or diverting handler claims such classification in such handler's report of receipts and utilization filed pursuant to Sec.  ----.30 of each Federal milk order for the month within which such transaction occurred; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The nonpool plant operator maintains books and records showing the utilization of all skim milk and butterfat received at such plant which are made available for verification purposes if requested by the market administrator;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Route disposition in the marketing area of each Federal milk order from the nonpool plant and transfers of packaged fluid milk products from such nonpool plant to plants fully regulated thereunder shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Pro rata to receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from pool plants;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from plants regulated under other Federal orders;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Pro rata to receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from pool plants; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from plants regulated under other Federal orders;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any remaining Class I disposition of packaged fluid milk products from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of packaged fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from pool plants and plants regulated under other Federal orders;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Transfers of bulk fluid milk products from the nonpool plant to a plant regulated under any Federal order, to the extent that such transfers to the regulated plant exceed receipts of fluid milk products from such plant and are allocated to Class I at the receiving plant, shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Pro rata to receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from pool plants; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pro rata to any remaining unassigned receipts of fluid milk products at such nonpool plant from plants regulated under other Federal orders;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any remaining unassigned Class I disposition from the nonpool plant shall be assigned to the extent possible in the following sequence:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To such nonpool plant's receipts from dairy farmers who the market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for such nonpool plant; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To such nonpool plant's receipts of Grade A milk from plants not fully regulated under any Federal order which the market administrator determines constitute regular sources of Grade A milk for such nonpool plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any remaining unassigned receipts of bulk fluid milk products at the nonpool plant from pool plants and plants regulated under other Federal orders shall be assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible first to any remaining Class I utilization and then to all other utilization, in sequence beginning with Class IV at such nonpool plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Receipts of bulk fluid cream products at the nonpool plant from pool plants and plants regulated under other Federal orders shall be assigned, pro rata among such plants, to the extent possible to any remaining utilization, in sequence beginning with Class IV at such nonpool plant; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> In determining the nonpool plant's utilization for purposes of this paragraph, any fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream products transferred from such nonpool plant to a plant not fully regulated under any Federal order shall be classified on the basis of the second plant's utilization using the same assignment priorities at the second plant that are set forth in this paragraph.</p>
