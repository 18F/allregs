                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of section. This section applies to any free writing prospectus with respect to securities of any issuer (except as set forth in Rule 164 (Sec. 230.164)) that are the subject of a registration statement that has been filed under the Act. Such a free writing prospectus that satisfies the conditions of this section may include information the substance of which is not included in the registration statement. Such a free writing prospectus that satisfies the conditions of this section will be a prospectus permitted under section 10(b) of the Act for purposes of sections 2(a)(10), 5(b)(1), and 5(b)(2) of the Act and will, for purposes of considering it a prospectus, be deemed to be public, without regard to its method of use or distribution, because it is related to the public offering of securities that are the subject of a filed registration statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Permitted use of free writing prospectus. Subject to the conditions of this paragraph (b) and satisfaction of the conditions set forth in paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section, a free writing prospectus may be used under

this section and Rule 164 in connection with a registered offering of securities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility and prospectus conditions for seasoned issuers and well-known seasoned issuers. Subject to the provisions of Rule 164(e), (f), and (g), the issuer or any other offering participant may use a free writing prospectus in the following offerings after a registration statement relating to the offering has been filed that includes a prospectus that, other than by reason of this section or Rule 431, satisfies the requirements of section 10 of the Act:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Offerings of securities registered on Form S-3 (Sec. 239.33 of this chapter) pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1, I.B.2, I.C., or I.D. thereof or on Form SF-3 (Sec. 239.45 of this chapter);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Offerings of securities registered on Form F-3 (Sec. 239.13 of this chapter) pursuant to General Instruction I.A.5, I.B.1, I.B.2, or I.C. thereof;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any other offering not excluded from reliance on this section and Rule 164 of securities of a well-known seasoned issuer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any other offering not excluded from reliance on this section and Rule 164 of securities of an issuer eligible to use Form S-3 or Form F-3 for primary offerings pursuant to General Instruction I.B.1 of such Forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility and prospectus conditions for non-reporting and unseasoned issuers. If the issuer does not fall within the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then, subject to the provisions of Rule 164(e), (f), and (g), any person participating in the offer or sale of the securities may use a free writing prospectus as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the free writing prospectus is or was prepared by or on behalf of or used or referred to by an issuer or any other offering participant, if consideration has been or will be given by the issuer or other offering participant for the dissemination (in any format) of any free writing prospectus (including any published article, publication, or advertisement), or if section 17(b) of the Act requires disclosure that consideration has been or will be given by the issuer or other offering participant for any activity described therein in connection with the free writing prospectus, then a registration statement relating to the offering must have been filed that includes a prospectus that, other than by reason of this section or Rule 431, satisfies the requirements of section 10 of the Act, including a price range where required by rule, and the free writing prospectus shall be accompanied or preceded by the most recent such prospectus; provided, however, that use of the free writing prospectus is not conditioned on providing the most recent such prospectus if a prior such prospectus has been provided and there is no material change from the prior prospectus reflected in the most recent prospectus; provided further, that after effectiveness and availability of a final prospectus meeting the requirements of section 10(a) of the Act, no such earlier prospectus may be provided in satisfaction of this condition, and such final prospectus must precede or accompany any free writing prospectus provided after such availability, whether or not an earlier prospectus had been previously provided.</p><p class="depth4">Notes to paragraph (b)(2)(i) of Rule 433.</p><p class="depth4">1. The condition that a free writing prospectus shall be accompanied or preceded by the most recent prospectus satisfying the requirements of section 10 of the Act would be satisfied if a free writing prospectus that is an electronic communication contained an active hyperlink to such most recent prospectus; and</p><p class="depth4">2. A communication for which disclosure would be required under section 17(b) of the Act as a result of consideration given or to be given, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of an issuer or other offering participant is an offer by the issuer or such other offering participant as the case may be and is, if written, a free writing prospectus of the issuer or other offering participant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section does not apply, a registration statement relating to the offering has been filed that includes a prospectus that, other than by reason of this section or Rule 431 satisfies the requirements of section 10 of the Act, including a price range where required by rule. For purposes of paragraph (f) of this section, the prospectus included in the registration statement relating to the offering that has been filed does not have to include a price range otherwise required by rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Successors. A successor issuer will be considered to satisfy the applicable provisions of this paragraph (b) if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its predecessor and it, taken together, satisfy the conditions, provided that the succession was primarily for the purpose of changing the state or other jurisdiction of incorporation of the predecessor or forming a holding company and the assets and liabilities of the successor at the time of succession were substantially the same as those of the predecessor; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All predecessors met the conditions at the time of succession and the issuer has continued to do so since the succession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information in a free writing prospectus. (1) A free writing prospectus used in reliance on this section may include information the substance of which is not included in the registration statement but such information shall not conflict with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A free writing prospectus used in reliance on this section may include information the substance of which is not included in the registration statement but such information shall not conflict with:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Information contained in the filed registration statement, including any prospectus or prospectus supplement that is part of the registration statement (including pursuant to Rule 430B (Sec. 230.430B), Rule 430C (Sec. 230.430C) or Rule 430D (Sec. 230.430D) and not superseded or modified; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Information contained in the issuer's periodic and current reports filed or furnished to the Commission pursuant to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m or 78o(d)) that are incorporated by reference into the registration statement and not superseded or modified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> A free writing prospectus used in reliance on this section shall contain substantially the following legend:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A free writing prospectus used in reliance on this section shall contain substantially the following legend:</p><p class="depth4">The issuer has filed a registration statement (including a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this communication relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus in that registration statement and other documents the issuer has filed with the SEC for more complete information about the issuer and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC Web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, the issuer, any underwriter or any dealer participating in the offering will arrange to send you the prospectus if you request it by calling toll-free 1-8[xx-xxx-xxxx].</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The legend also may provide an e-mail address at which the documents can be requested and may indicate that the documents also are available by accessing the issuer's Web site and provide the Internet address and the particular location of the documents on the Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing conditions. (1) Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(3), (d)(4), (d)(5), (d)(6), (d)(7), (d)(8), and (f) of this section, the following shall be filed with the Commission under this section by a means reasonably calculated to result in filing no later than the date of first use.

the road show and not separately is deemed to be part of the road show.

If the road show is written and not required to be filed, such a simultaneous communication is also not required to be filed. Otherwise, a written communication that is an offer contained in a separate file from a road show, whether or not the road show is a written communication, or otherwise transmitted separately from a road show, will be a free writing prospectus subject to any applicable filing conditions of paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Treatment of information on, or hyperlinked from, an issuer's Web site. (1) An offer of an issuer's securities that is contained on an issuer's Web site or hyperlinked by the issuer from the issuer's Web site to a third party's Web site is a written offer of such securities by the issuer and, unless otherwise exempt or excluded from the requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act, the filing conditions of paragraph (d) of this section apply to such offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An offer of an issuer's securities that is contained on an issuer's Web site or hyperlinked by the issuer from the issuer's Web site to a third party's Web site is a written offer of such securities by the issuer and, unless otherwise exempt or excluded from the requirements of section 5(b)(1) of the Act, the filing conditions of paragraph (d) of this section apply to such offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, historical issuer information that is identified as such and located in a separate section of the issuer's Web site containing historical issuer information, that has not been incorporated by reference into or otherwise included in a prospectus of the issuer for the offering and that has not otherwise been used or referred to in connection with the offering, will not be considered a current offer of the issuer's securities and therefore will not be a free writing prospectus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Free writing prospectuses published or distributed by media. Any written offer for which an issuer or any other offering participant or any person acting on its behalf provided, authorized, or approved information that is prepared and published or disseminated by a person unaffiliated with the issuer or any other offering participant that is in the business of publishing, radio or television broadcasting or otherwise disseminating written communications would be considered at the time of publication or dissemination to be a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or such other offering participant for purposes of this section subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditions of paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section will not apply and the conditions of paragraphs (c)(2) and (d) of this section will be deemed to be satisfied if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No payment is made or consideration given by or on behalf of the issuer or other offering participant for the written communication or its dissemination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer or other offering participant in question files the written communication with the Commission, and includes in the filing the legend required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section, within four business days after the issuer or other offering participant becomes aware of the publication, radio or television broadcast, or other dissemination of the written communication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The filing obligation under paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section shall be subject to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issuer or other offering participant shall not be required to file a free writing prospectus if the substance of that free writing prospectus has previously been filed with the Commission;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any filing made pursuant to paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section may include information that the issuer or offering participant in question reasonably believes is necessary or appropriate to correct information included in the communication; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In lieu of filing the actual written communication as published or disseminated as required by paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section, the issuer or offering participant in question may file a copy of the materials provided to the media, including transcripts of interviews or similar materials, provided the copy or transcripts contain all the information provided to the media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (f) of this section, an issuer that is in the business of publishing or radio or television broadcasting may rely on this paragraph (f) as to any publication or radio or television broadcast that is a free writing prospectus in respect of an offering of securities of the issuer if the issuer or an affiliate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is the publisher of a bona fide newspaper, magazine, or business or financial publication of general and regular circulation or bona fide broadcaster of news including business and financial news;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has established policies and procedures for the independence of the content of the publications or broadcasts from the offering activities of the issuer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Publishes or broadcasts the communication in the ordinary course.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Record retention.

For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An issuer free writing prospectus means a free writing prospectus prepared by or on behalf of the issuer or used or referred to by the issuer and, in the case of an asset-backed issuer, prepared by or on behalf of a depositor, sponsor, or servicer (as defined in Item 1101 of Regulation AB) or affiliated depositor or used or referred to by any such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Issuer information means material information about the issuer or its securities that has been provided by or on behalf of the issuer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A written communication or information is prepared or provided by or on behalf of a person if the person or an agent or representative of the person authorizes the communication or information or approves the communication or information before it is used.
