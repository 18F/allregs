                                Sec. 785.47  Where records show insubstantial or insignificant periods
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In recording working time under the Act, insubstantial or  insignificant periods of time beyond the scheduled working hours, which  cannot as a practical administrative matter be precisely recorded for  payroll purposes, may be disregarded. The courts have held that such  trifles are de minimis. (Anderson v. Mt. Clemens Pottery Co., 328 U.S.  680 (1946)) This rule applies only where there are uncertain and  indefinite periods of time involved of a few seconds or minutes  duration, and where the failure to count such time is due to  considerations justified by industrial realities. An employer may not  arbitrarily fail to count as hours worked any part, however small, of  the employee's fixed or regular working time or practically  ascertainable period of time he is regularly required to spend on duties  assigned to him. See Glenn L. Martin Nebraska Co. v. Culkin, 197 F. 2d  981, 987 (C.A. 8, 1952), cert. denied, 344 U.S. 866 (1952), rehearing  denied, 344 U.S. 888 (1952), holding that working time amounting to $1  of additional compensation a week is ``not a trivial matter to a  workingman,'' and was not de minimis; Addison v. Huron Stevedoring  Corp., 204 F. 2d 88, 95 (C.A. 2, 1953), cert. denied 346 U.S. 877,  holding that ``To disregard workweeks for which less than a dollar is  due will produce capricious and unfair results.'' Hawkins v. E. I. du  Pont de Nemours & Co., 12 W.H. Cases 448, 27 Labor Cases, para. 69,094  (E.D. Va., 1955), holding that 10 minutes a day is not de minimis.</p>
