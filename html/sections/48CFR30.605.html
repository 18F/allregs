a revised method of computing the increase or decrease in contract and subcontract price and cost accumulations); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request that the contractor submit a DCI proposal by a specified date if the CFAO determines that the GDM proposal is not sufficient to resolve the cost impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Detailed cost-impact proposal.
