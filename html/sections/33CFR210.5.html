                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Preface to rules--(1) Jurisdiction for considering appeals. The Corps of Engineers Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as the ``Board'') shall consider and determine appeals from decisions of contracting officers pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563, 41 U.S.C. 601-613) relating to: (i) Civil Works Contracts of the Corps of Engineers, (ii) contracts made by any other executive agency when such agency or the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy has designated the Board to decide the appeal, or (iii) with the approval of the Chief of Engineers, contracts made by any other agency when such agency has designated the Board to decide the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Jurisdiction for considering appeals. The Corps of Engineers Board of Contract Appeals (referred to herein as the ``Board'') shall consider and determine appeals from decisions of contracting officers pursuant to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 (Pub. L. 95-563, 41 U.S.C. 601-613) relating to: (i) Civil Works Contracts of the Corps of Engineers, (ii) contracts made by any other executive agency when such agency or the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy has designated the Board to decide the appeal, or (iii) with the approval of the Chief of Engineers, contracts made by any other agency when such agency has designated the Board to decide the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Location and organization of the Board. (i) The Board's address is Room 4108, Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20314, telephone (202) 272-0369.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Board's address is Room 4108, Pulaski Building, 20 Massachusetts Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20314, telephone (202) 272-0369.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Board consists of a chairman, vice chairman, and other members, all of whom are attorneys at law duly licensed by a state, commonwealth, territory, or the District of Columbia. In general, the appeals are assigned to a panel of at least three members who decide the case by a majority vote. Board members are designated Administrative Judges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Applicability of the Contract Disputes Act of 1978. (i) If a contract with an executive agency was awarded before 1 March 1979, and if the contracting officer's final decision was issued 1 March 1979 or thereafter, the contractor may elect to proceed under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a contract with an executive agency was awarded before 1 March 1979, and if the contracting officer's final decision was issued 1 March 1979 or thereafter, the contractor may elect to proceed under the Contract Disputes Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a contract with an executive agency was awarded on 1 March 1979 or

thereafter, the Contract Disputes Act is automatically applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All other appeals are not subject to the Contract Disputes Act of 1978 and are controlled by the Board's rules published 14 January 1975 (33 CFR 210.4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the Contract Disputes Act is applicable to the appeal, the contractor can elect an accelerated procedure if the disputed amount is $50,000 or less. If the disputed amount is $10,000 or less the contractor has a further right to elect a small claims (expedited) procedure. Both of these procedures are described in Rule 12. Particular note should be made of the 180 day limit on processing accelerated procedure cases and the 120 day limit on processing small claims (expedited) procedure cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General guidelines. (i) Emphasis is placed upon the sound administration of these rules in specific cases, because it is impracticable to articulate a rule to fit every possible circumstance which may be encountered. These rules will be interpreted so as to secure a just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emphasis is placed upon the sound administration of these rules in specific cases, because it is impracticable to articulate a rule to fit every possible circumstance which may be encountered. These rules will be interpreted so as to secure a just and inexpensive determination of appeals without unnecessary delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Preliminary procedures are available to encourage full disclosure of relevant and material facts, and to discourage unwarranted surprise. The parties are expected to cooperate and to voluntarily comply with the intent of such procedures without resort to the Board except on controversial questions. The Board expects the parties to exchange complicated exhibits prior to hearing in order to expedite the hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whenever reference is made to contractor, appellant, contracting officer, respondent, and parties, this shall include respective counsel for the parties as soon as appropriate notices of appearance have been filed with the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rule 1, Appeals, how taken. (1) Notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. A copy thereof shall be furnished to the contracting officer from whose decision the appeal is taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notice of an appeal shall be in writing and mailed or otherwise furnished to the Board within 90 days from the date of receipt of a contracting officer's decision. A copy thereof shall be furnished to the contracting officer from whose decision the appeal is taken.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the contractor has submitted a claim of $50,000 or less to the contracting officer and has requested a written decision within 60 days from receipt of the request, and the contracting officer has not done so, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, citing the failure of the contracting officer to issue a decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where the contractor has submitted a claim to the contracting officer and the contracting officer has failed to issue a decision within a reasonable time, the contractor may file a notice of appeal as provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, citing the failure to issue a decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Upon docketing of appeals filed pursuant to paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the Board may, at its option, stay further proceedings pending issuance of a final decision by the contracting officer within such period of time as is determined by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In lieu of filing a notice of appeal under paragraph (b)(2) or (3) of this section, the contractor may request the Board to direct the contracting officer to issue a decision in a specified period of time, as determined by the Board, in the event of undue delay on the part of the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rule 2, Notice of appeal, contents of. A notice of appeal should indicate that an appeal is being taken and should identify the contract (by number), the agency involved in the dispute, the decision from which the appeal is taken, and the amount in dispute, if known. The notice of appeal should be signed personally by the appellant (the contractor taking the appeal), or by the appellant's duly authorized representative or attorney. The complaint referred to in Rule 6 may be filed with the notice of appeal, or the appellant may designate the notice of appeal as a complaint, if it otherwise fulfills the requirements of a complaint.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rule 3, Docketing of appeals. When a notice of appeal in any form has been received by the Board, it shall be docketed promptly. Notice in writing shall be given to the appellant with a copy of these rules, and to the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Rule 4, Preparation, content, organization, forwarding, and status of appeal file--(1) Duties of Contracting Officer. Within 30 days of receipt of an appeal,

or notice that an appeal has been filed, the contracting officer shall assemble and transmit to the Board an appeal file consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Duties of Contracting Officer. Within 30 days of receipt of an appeal,

or notice that an appeal has been filed, the contracting officer shall assemble and transmit to the Board an appeal file consisting of all documents pertinent to the appeal, including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The decision from which the appeal is taken;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The contract including specifications and pertinent amendments, plans and drawings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All correspondence between the parties relevant to the appeal, including the letter or letters of claim in response to which the decision was issued;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transcripts of any testimony taken during the course of proceedings, and affidavits or statements of any witnesses on the matter in dispute made prior to the filing of the notice of appeal with the Board; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any additional information considered relevant to the appeal.
Within the same time above specified the contracting officer shall furnish the appellant a copy of each document he transmits to the Board, except those in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section. As to the latter, a list furnished appellant indicating specific contractual documents transmitted will suffice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Duties of the appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of a copy of the appeal file assembled by the contracting officer, the appellant shall transmit to the Board any documents not contained therein which he considers relevant to the appeal, and furnish two copies of such documents to the government trial attorney.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Organization of appeal file. Documents in the appeal file may be originals or legible facsimiles or authenticated copies, and shall be arranged in chronological order where practicable, numbered sequentially, tabbed, and indexed to identify the contents of the file.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Lengthy documents. Upon request by either party, the Board may waive the requirement to furnish to the other party copies of bulky, lengthy, or out-of-size documents in the appeal file when inclusion would be burdensome. At the time a party files with the Board a document as to which such a waiver has been granted he shall notify the other party that the document or a copy is available for inspection at the offices of the Board or of the party filing same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Status of documents in appeal file. Documents contained in the appeal file are considered, without further action by the parties, as part of the record upon which the Board will render its decision. However, a party may object, for reasons stated, to consideration of a particular document or documents reasonably in advance of hearing or, if there is no hearing, of settling the record. If such objection is made the Board shall remove the document or documents from the appeal file and permit the party offering the document to move its admission as evidence in accordance with Rules 13 and 20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Notwithstanding the foregoing, the filing of the Rule 4 (1) and (2) documents may be dispensed with by the Board either upon request of the appellant in his notice of appeal or thereafter upon stipulation of the parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Rule 5, Motions. (1) Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board shall be promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded on application of either party. However, the Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on both the merits and the motion. The Board shall have the right at any time and on its own initiative to raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a particular case, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any motion addressed to the jurisdiction of the Board shall be promptly filed. Hearing on the motion shall be afforded on application of either party. However, the Board may defer its decision on the motion pending hearing on both the merits and the motion. The Board shall have the right at any time and on its own initiative to raise the issue of its jurisdiction to proceed with a particular case, and shall do so by an appropriate order, affording the parties an opportunity to be heard thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Board may entertain and rule upon other appropriate motions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Rule 6, Pleadings--(1) Appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an original and two copies of a complaint setting forth simple, concise and direct statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the complaint, the Board shall serve a copy of it upon the Government. Should the complaint not be received within 30 days, appellant's claim and appeal

may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its complaint and the Government shall be so notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appellant. Within 30 days after receipt of notice of docketing of the appeal, the appellant shall file with the Board an original and two copies of a complaint setting forth simple, concise and direct statements of each of its claims. Appellant shall also set forth the basis, with appropriate reference to contract provisions, of each claim and the dollar amount claimed, to the extent known. This pleading shall fulfill the generally recognized requirements of a complaint, although no particular form is required. Upon receipt of the complaint, the Board shall serve a copy of it upon the Government. Should the complaint not be received within 30 days, appellant's claim and appeal

may, if in the opinion of the Board the issues before the Board are sufficiently defined, be deemed to set forth its complaint and the Government shall be so notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Government. Within 30 days from receipt of the complaint, or the aforesaid notice from the Board, the Government shall prepare and file with the Board an original and two copies of an answer thereto. The answer shall set forth simple, concise and direct statements of Government's defenses to each claim asserted by appellant, including any affirmative defenses available. Upon receipt of the answer, the Board shall serve a copy upon appellant. Should the answer not be received within 30 days, the Board may, in its discretion, enter a general denial on behalf of the Government, and the appellant shall be so notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rule 7, Amendments of pleadings or record. The Board upon its own initiative or upon application by a party may order a party to make a more definite statement of the complaint or answer, or to reply to an answer. The Board may, in its discretion, and within the proper scope of the appeal, permit either party to amend its pleading upon conditions fair to both parties. When issues within the proper scope of the appeal, but not raised by the pleadings, are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, or by permission of the Board, they shall be treated in all respects as if they had been raised therein. In such instances, motions to amend the pleadings to conform to the proof may be entered, but are not required. If evidence is objected to at a hearing on the ground that it is not within the issues raised by the pleadings, it may be admitted within the proper scope of the appeal, provided, however, that the objecting party may be granted a continuance if necessary to enable it to meet such evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule 8, Hearing election. After filing of the Government's answer or notice from the Board that it has entered a general denial on behalf of the Government, each party shall advise whether it desires a hearing as prescribed in Rules 17 through 25, or whether it elects to submit its case on the record without a hearing, as prescribed in Rule 11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Rule 9, Prehearing briefs. Based on an examination of the pleadings, and its determination of whether the arguments and authorities addressed to the issues are adequately set forth therein, the Board may, in its discretion, require the parties to submit prehearing briefs in any case in which a hearing has been elected pursuant to Rule 8. If the Board does not require prehearing briefs either party may, in its discretion and upon appropriate and sufficient notice to the other party, furnish a prehearing brief to the Board. In any case where a prehearing brief is submitted, it shall be furnished so as to be received by the Board at least 15 days prior to the date set for hearing, and a copy shall simultaneously be furnished to the other party as previously arranged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Rule 10, Prehearing or presubmission conference. (1) Whether the case is to be submitted pursuant to Rule 11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 through 25, the Board may upon its own initiative, or upon the application of either party, arrange a telephone conference or call upon the parties to appear before an administrative judge or examiner of the Board for a conference to consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Whether the case is to be submitted pursuant to Rule 11, or heard pursuant to Rules 17 through 25, the Board may upon its own initiative, or upon the application of either party, arrange a telephone conference or call upon the parties to appear before an administrative judge or examiner of the Board for a conference to consider:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Simplification, clarification, or severing of the issues;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The possibility of obtaining stipulations, admissions, agreements and rulings on admissibility of documents, understandings on matters already of record, or similar agreements that will avoid unnecessary proof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Agreements and rulings to facilitate discovery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Limitation of the number of expert witnesses, or avoidance of similar cumulative evidence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The possibility of agreement disposing of any or all of the issues in dispute; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Such other matters as may aid in the disposition of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The administrative judge or examiner of the Board shall make such rulings and orders as may be appropriate to aid in the disposition of the appeal. The results of pre-trial conferences, including any rulings and orders, shall be reduced to writing by the administrative judge or examiner and

this writing shall thereafter constitute a part of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Rule 11, Submission without a hearing. Either party may elect to waive a hearing and to submit its case upon the record before the Board, as settled pursuant to Rule 13. Submission of a case without hearing does not relieve the parties from the necessity of proving the facts supporting their allegations or defenses. Affidavits, depositions, admissions, answers to interrogatories, and stipulations may be employed to supplement other documentary evidence in the Board record. The Board may permit such submissions to be supplemented by oral argument (transcribed if requested), and by briefs arranged in accordance with Rule 23.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Rule 12, Optional SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED procedures. These procedures are available solely at the election of the appellant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sub-Rule 12.1 Elections to utilize SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) and ACCELERATED procedures. (i) In appeals where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear in sub-Rule 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect the ACCELERATED procedure rather than the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure for any appeal eligible for the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In appeals where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under a SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 120 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear in sub-Rule 12.2 of this Rule. An appellant may elect the ACCELERATED procedure rather than the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure for any appeal eligible for the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In appeals where the amount in dispute is $50,000 or less, the appellant may elect to have the appeal processed under an ACCELERATED procedure requiring decision of the appeal, whenever possible, within 180 days after the Board receives written notice of the appellant's election to utilize this procedure. The details of this procedure appear in sub-Rule 12.3 of this Rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The appellant's election of either the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure may be made by written notice within 60 days after receipt of notice of docketing, unless such period is extended by the Board for good cause. The election may not be withdrawn except with permission of the Board and for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sub-Rule 12.2, The SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure. (i) In cases proceeding under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following time periods shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In cases proceeding under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the following time periods shall apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Within 10 days from the Government's first receipt from either the appellant or the Board of a copy of the appellant's notice of election of the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure, the Government shall send the Board a copy of the contract, the contracting officer's final decision, and the appellant's claim letter or letters, if any; remaining documents required under Rule 4 shall be submitted in accordance with times specified in that rule unless the Board otherwise directs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Within 15 days after the Board has acknowledged receipt of appellant's notice of election, the assigned administrative judge shall take the following actions, if feasible, in an informal meeting or a telephone conference with both parties: (1) Identify and simplify the issues; (2) establish a simplified procedure appropriate to the particular appeal involved; (3) determine whether either party wants a hearing, and if so, fix a time and place therefor; (4) require the Government to furnish all the additional documents relevant to the appeal; and (5) establish an expedited schedule for resolution of the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pleadings, discovery, and other prehearing activity will be allowed only as consistent with the requirement to conduct the hearing on the date scheduled, or if no hearing is scheduled, to close the record on a date that will allow decisions within the 120-day limit. The Board, in its discretion, may impose shortened time periods for any actions prescribed or allowed under these rules, as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within the 120-day limit, allowing whatever time, up to 30 days, that the Board considers necessary for the preparation of the decision after closing the record and the filing of briefs, if any.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Written decision by the Board in cases processed under the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure will

be short and contain only summary findings of fact and conclusions. Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single administrative judge. If there has been a hearing, the administrative judge presiding at the hearing may, in the judge's discretion, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments as deemed appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes and to establish the starting date for the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 29.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A decision against the Government or the contractor shall have no value as precedent, and in the absence of fraud shall be final and conclusive and may not be appealed or set aside.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Sub-Rule 12.3, The ACCELERATED procedure. (i) In cases proceeding under the ACCELERATED procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs. The Board, in its discretion, may shorten time periods prescribed or allowed elsewhere in these Rules, including Rule 4, as necessary to enable the Board to decide the appeal within 180 days after the Board has received the appellant's notice of election of the ACCELERATED procedure, and may reserve 30 days for preparation of the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In cases proceeding under the ACCELERATED procedure, the parties are encouraged, to the extent possible consistent with adequate presentation of their factual and legal positions, to waive pleadings, discovery, and briefs.

Decisions will be rendered for the Board by a single Administrative Judge with the concurrence of the Chairman or the Vice Chairman or other designated Administrative Judge, or by a majority among these two and an additional designated member in case of desagreement. Alternatively, in cases where the amount in dispute is $10,000 or less as to which the Accelerated procedure has been elected and in which there has been a hearing, the single Administrative Judge presiding at the hearing may, with the concurrence of both parties, at the conclusion of the hearing and after entertaining such oral arguments as he deems appropriate, render on the record oral summary findings of fact, conclusions, and a decision of the appeal. Whenever such an oral decision is rendered, the Board will subsequently furnish the parties a typed copy of such oral decision for record and payment purposes and to establish the date of commencement of the period for filing a motion for reconsideration under Rule 29.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sub-Rule 12.4, Motions for reconsideration in Rule 12 Cases. Motions for Reconsideration of cases decided under either the SMALL CLAIMS (EXPEDITED) procedure or the ACCELERATED procedure need not be decided within the original 120-day or 180-day limit, but all such motions shall be processed and decided rapidly so as to fulfill the intent of this Rule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Rule 13, Settling the record. (1) The record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, hearing exhibits, post-hearing briefs, and documents which the Board has specifically designated be made a part of the record. The record will, at all reasonable times, be available for inspection by the parties at the office of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The record upon which the Board's decision will be rendered consists of the documents furnished under Rules 4 and 12, to the extent admitted in evidence, and the following items, if any: pleadings, prehearing conference memoranda or orders, prehearing briefs, depositions or interrogatories received in evidence, admissions, stipulations, transcripts of conferences and hearings, hearing exhibits, post-hearing briefs, and documents which the Board has specifically designated be made a part of the record.

The Board may in any case require either party, with appropriate notice to the other party, to submit additional evidence on any matter relevant to the appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Rule 14, Discovery--depositions--(1) General policy and protective orders. The

parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary discovery procedures. In connection with any deposition or other discovery procedure, the Board may make any order required to protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment, or undue burden or expense. Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General policy and protective orders.

Those orders may include limitations on the scope, method, time and place for discovery, and provisions for protecting the secrecy of confidential information or documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When depositions permitted. After an appeal has been docketed and complaint filed, the parties may mutually agree to, or the Board may, upon application of either party, order the taking of testimony of any person by deposition upon oral examination or written interrogatories before any officer authorized to administer oaths at the place of examination, for use as evidence or for purpose of discovery. The application for order shall specify whether the purpose of the deposition is discovery or for use as evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Orders on depositions. The time, place, and manner of taking depositions shall be as mutually agreed by the parties, or failing such agreement, governed by order of the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Use as evidence. No testimony taken by depositions shall be considered as part of the evidence in the hearing of an appeal until such testimony is offered and received in evidence at such hearing. It will not ordinarily be received in evidence if the deponent is present and can testify at the hearing. In such instances, however, the deposition may be used to contradict or impeach the testimony of the deponent given at the hearing. In cases submitted on the record, the Board may, in its discretion, receive depositions to supplement the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Expenses.
