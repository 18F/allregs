                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RRTs and Area Committees shall address, as part of their planning activities, the desirability of using appropriate dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents listed on the NCP Product Schedule, and the desirability of using appropriate burning agents. RCPs and ACPs shall, as appropriate, include applicable preauthorization plans and address the specific contexts in which such products should and should not be used. In meeting the provisions of this paragraph, preauthorization plans may address factors such as the potential sources and types of oil that might be spilled, the existence and location of environmentally sensitive resources that might be impacted by spilled oil,

available product and storage locations, available equipment and adequately trained operators, and the available means to monitor product application and effectiveness. The RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees shall review and either approve, disapprove, or approve with modification the preauthorization plans developed by Area Committees, as appropriate. Approved preauthorization plans shall be included in the appropriate RCPs and ACPs. If the RRT representatives from EPA and the states with jurisdiction over the waters of the area to which a preauthorization plan applies and the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees approve in advance the use of certain products under specified circumstances as described in the preauthorization plan, the OSC may authorize the use of the products without obtaining the specific concurrences described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For spill situations that are not addressed by the preauthorization plans developed pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, the OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of dispersants, surface washing agents, surface collecting agents, bioremediation agents, or miscellaneous oil spill control agents on the oil discharge, provided that the products are listed on the NCP Product Schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The OSC, with the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the concurrence of the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, and in consultation with the DOC and DOI natural resource trustees, when practicable, may authorize the use of burning agents on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The OSC may authorize the use of any dispersant, surface washing agent, surface collecting agent, other chemical agent, burning agent, bioremediation agent, or miscellaneous oil spill control agent, including products not listed on the NCP Product Schedule, without obtaining the concurrence of the EPA representative to the RRT and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the states with jurisdiction over the navigable waters threatened by the release or discharge, when, in the judgment of the OSC, the use of the product is necessary to prevent or substantially reduce a hazard to human life. Whenever the OSC authorizes the use of a product pursuant to this paragraph, the OSC is to inform the EPA RRT representative and, as appropriate, the RRT representatives from the affected states and, when practicable, the DOC/DOI natural resources trustees of the use of a product, including products not on the Schedule, as soon as possible. Once the threat to human life has subsided, the continued use of a product shall be in accordance with paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sinking agents shall not be authorized for application to oil discharges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When developing preauthorization plans, RRTs may require the performance of supplementary toxicity and effectiveness testing of products, in addition to the test methods specified in Sec. 300.915 and described in appendix C to part 300, due to existing site-specific or area-specific concerns.</p>
