                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Royalties due on oil production from leases subject to the requirements of this part, including condensate separated from gas without processing, shall be at the royalty rate established by the terms of the lease. Royalty shall be paid in value unless the Office of Natural Resources Revenue (ONRR) requires payment in-kind. When paid in value, the royalty due shall be the value, for royalty purposes, determined pursuant to part 1206 of this title multiplied by the royalty rate in the lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when

such off-lease use is permitted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this part applies is subject to royalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All oil (except oil unavoidably lost or used on, or for the benefit of, the lease, including that oil used off-lease for the benefit of the lease when

such off-lease use is permitted by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation, and Enforcement (BOEMRE) or BLM, as appropriate) produced from a Federal or Indian lease to which this part applies is subject to royalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When oil is used on, or for the benefit of, the lease at a production facility handling production from more than one lease with the approval of the BSEE or BLM, as appropriate, or at a production facility handling unitized or communitized production, only that proportionate share of each lease's production (actual or allocated) necessary to operate the production facility may be used royalty-free.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the terms of any lease are inconsistent with this section, the lease terms shall govern to the extent of that inconsistency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If BLM determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an onshore lease, or that oil was drained from an onshore lease for which compensatory royalty is due, or if BSEE determines that oil was avoidably lost or wasted from an offshore lease, then the value of that oil shall be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a lessee receives insurance compensation for unavoidably lost oil, royalties are due on the amount of that compensation. This paragraph shall not apply to compensation through self-insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, the value, for royalty purposes, of production attributable to unitized or communitized leases will be determined in accordance with 30 CFR part 1206. In applying the requirements of 30 CFR part 1206, the circumstances involved in the actual disposition of the portion of the production to which the lessee was entitled but did not take shall be considered as controlling in arriving at the value, for royalty purposes, of that portion as though the person actually selling or disposing of the production were the lessee of the Federal or Indian lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In those instances where the lessee of any lease committed to a federally approved unitization or communitization agreement does not actually take the proportionate share of the agreement production attributable to its lease under the terms of the agreement, the full share of production attributable to the lease under the terms of the agreement nonetheless is subject to the royalty payment and reporting requirements of this title.

the agreement, including royalty interests, must agree to use the proposed method for valuing production from the agreement for royalty purposes.
