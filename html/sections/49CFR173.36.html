                                Sec. 173.36  Hazardous materials in Large Packagings.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person may offer or accept a hazardous material for  transportation in a Large Packaging except as authorized by this  subchapter. Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, no Large  Packaging may be filled with a Packing Group I or II material. Each  Large Packaging used for the transportation of hazardous materials must  conform to the requirements of its specification and regulations for the  transportation of the particular commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Packaging design--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inner packaging closures. A Large  Packaging containing liquid hazardous materials must be packed so that  closures on inner packagings are upright.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flexible Large Packagings. Flexible Large Packagings (e.g., 51H)  are only authorized for use with flexible inner packagings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Friction. The nature and thickness of the outer packaging must  be such that friction during transportation is not likely to generate an  amount of heat sufficient to dangerously alter the chemical stability of  the contents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Securing and cushioning. Inner packagings of Large Packagings  must be packed, secured and cushioned to prevent their breakage or  leakage and to control their shifting within the outer packaging under  conditions normally incident to transportation. Cushioning material must  not be capable of reacting dangerously with the contents of the inner  packagings or having its protective properties significantly weakened in  the event of leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Metallic devices. Nails, staples and other metallic devices must  not protrude into the interior of the outer packaging in such a manner  as to be likely to damage inner packagings or receptacles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial use and reuse of Large Packagings. A Large Packaging may  be reused. If an inner packaging is constructed of paper or flexible  plastic, the inner packaging must be replaced before each reuse. Before  a Large Packaging is filled and offered for transportation, the Large  Packaging must be given an external visual inspection, by the person  filling the Large Packaging, to ensure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Large Packaging is free from corrosion, contamination,  cracks, cuts, or other damage which would render it unable to pass the  prescribed design type test to which it is certified and marked; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Large Packaging is marked in accordance with requirements in  Sec. 178.910 of this subchapter. Additional marking allowed for each  design type may be present. Required markings that are missing, damaged  or difficult to read must be restored or returned to original condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During transportation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No hazardous material may remain on the outside of the Large  Packaging; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each Large Packaging must be securely fastened to or contained  within the transport unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each Large Packaging used for transportation of solids which may  become liquid at temperatures likely to be encountered during  transportation may not be transported in paper or   fiber inner packagings. The inner packagings must be capable of  containing the substance in the liquid state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Liquid hazardous materials may only be offered for  transportation in inner packagings appropriately resistant to an  increase of internal pressure likely to develop during transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A Large Packaging used to transport hazardous materials may not  exceed 3 cubic meters (106 cubic feet) capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Mixed contents. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An outer Large Packaging may contain more  than one hazardous material only when--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The inner and outer packagings used for each hazardous material  conform to the relevant packaging sections of this part applicable to  that hazardous material, and not result in a violation of Sec. 173.21;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The package as prepared for shipment meets the performance  tests prescribed in part 178 of this subchapter for the hazardous  materials contained in the package;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Corrosive materials (except ORM-D) in bottles are further  packed in securely closed inner receptacles before packing in outer  packagings; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For transportation by aircraft, the total net quantity does not  exceed the lowest permitted maximum net quantity per package as shown in  Column 9a or 9b, as appropriate, of the Sec. 172.101 table. The  permitted maximum net quantity must be calculated in kilograms if a  package contains both a liquid and a solid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A packaging containing inner packagings of Division 6.2  materials may not contain other hazardous materials, except dry ice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a Large Packaging is used for the transportation of liquids  with a flash point of 60.5 C (141 F) (closed cup) or lower, or powders  with the potential for dust explosion, measures must be taken during  product loading and unloading to prevent a dangerous electrostatic  discharge.
