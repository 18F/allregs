During Integrated Natural Resource Management  Plan reviews, the Armed Forces will also report to the Service migratory  bird conservation measures implemented and the effectiveness of the  conservation measures in avoiding, minimizing, or mitigating take of  migratory birds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Suspension or Withdrawal of take authorization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  Secretary determines, after seeking the views of the Secretary of  Defense and consulting with the Secretary of State, that incidental take  of migratory birds during a specific military readiness activity likely  would not be compatible with one or more of the migratory bird treaties,  the Secretary will suspend authorization of the take associated with  that activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary may propose to withdraw, and may withdraw in  accordance with the procedures provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this  section the authorization for any take incidental to a specific military  readiness activity if the Secretary determines that a proposed military  readiness activity is likely to result in a significant adverse effect  on the population of a migratory bird species and one or more of the  following circumstances exists:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Armed Forces have not implemented conservation measures  that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Are directly related to protecting the migratory bird species  affected by the proposed military readiness activity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Would significantly reduce take of the migratory bird species  affected by the military readiness activity;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Are economically feasible; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Do not limit the effectiveness of the military readiness  activity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Armed Forces fail to conduct mutually agreed upon  monitoring to determine the effects of a military readiness activity on  migratory bird species and/or the efficacy of the conservation measures  implemented by the Armed Forces; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Armed Forces have not provided reasonably available  information that the Secretary has determined is necessary to evaluate  whether withdrawal of take authorization for the specific military  readiness activity is appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the Secretary proposes to withdraw authorization with  respect to a specific military readiness activity, the Secretary will  first provide written notice to the Secretary of Defense. Any such  notice will include the basis for the Secretary's determination that  withdrawal is warranted in accordance with the criteria contained in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and will identify any conservation  measures or other measures that would, if implemented by the Armed  Forces, permit the Secretary to cancel the proposed withdrawal of  authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Within 15 days of receipt of the notice specified in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, the Secretary of Defense may notify the  Secretary in writing of the Armed Forces' objections, if any, to the  proposed withdrawal, specifying the reasons therefore. The Secretary  will give due consideration to any objections raised by the Armed  Forces. If the Secretary continues to believe that   withdrawal is appropriate, he or she will provide written notice to the  Secretary of Defense of the rationale for withdrawal and response to any  objections to the withdrawal. If objections to the withdrawal remain,  the withdrawal will not become effective until the Secretary of Defense  has had the opportunity to meet with the Secretary within 30 days of the  original notice from the Secretary proposing withdrawal. A final  determination regarding whether authorization will be withdrawn will  occur within 45 days of the original notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any authorized take incidental to a military readiness activity  subject to a proposed withdrawal of authorization will continue to be  authorized by this regulation until the Secretary makes a final  determination on the withdrawal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Secretary may, at his or her discretion, cancel a suspension  or withdrawal of authorization at any time. A suspension may be  cancelled in the event new information is provided that the proposed  activity would be compatible with the migratory bird treaties. A  proposed withdrawal may be cancelled if the Armed Forces modify the  proposed activity to alleviate significant adverse effects on the  population of a migratory bird species or the circumstances in  paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section no longer exist.  Cancellation of suspension or withdrawal of authorization becomes  effective upon delivery of written notice from the Secretary to the  Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The responsibilities of the Secretary under paragraph (b) of  this section may be fulfilled by his/her delegatee who must be an  official nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.
