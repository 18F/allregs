                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All boilers, except watertube boilers, with a maximum allowable  working pressure in excess of 206 kPa gauge (30 psig), if fired with  solid fuel not in suspension, or if not equipped for unattended waterbed  operation, must be fitted with fusible plugs. Fusible plugs must comply  with only the requirements of A19 and A20 of section I of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR  52.01-1) and be stamped on the casing with the name of the manufacturer,  and on the water end of the fusible metal ``ASME Std.'' Fusible plugs  are not permitted where the maximum steam temperature to which they are  exposed exceeds 218 [deg]C (425 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Vertical boilers shall be fitted with one fusible plug located  in a tube not more than 2 inches below the lowest gage cock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Externally fired cylindrical boilers with flues shall have one  plug fitted to the shell immediately below the fire line not less than 4  feet from the front end.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Firebox, Scotch, and other types of shell boilers not  specifically provided for, having a combustion chamber common to all  furnaces, shall have one plug fitted at or near the center of the crown  sheet of the combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Double-ended boilers, having individual combustion chambers for  each end, in which combustion chambers are common to all the furnaces in  one end of the boiler, shall have one plug fitted at or near the center  of the crown sheet of each combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Boilers constructed with a separate combustion chamber for each  individual furnace shall be fitted with a fusible plug in the center of  the crown sheet of each combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Boilers of types not provided for in this section shall be  fitted with at least one fusible plug of such dimensions and located in  a part of the boiler as will best meet the purposes for which it is  intended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fusible plugs shall be so fitted that the smaller end of the  filling is in direct contact with the radiant heat of the fire, and  shall be at least 1 inch higher on the water side than the plate or flue  in which they are fitted, and in no case more than 1 inch below the  lowest permissible water level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The lowest permissible water level shall be determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Vertical firetube boilers, one-half of the length of the tubes  above the lower tube sheets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vertical submerged tube boilers 1 inch above the upper tube  sheet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Internally fired firetube boilers with combustion chambers  integral with the boiler, 2 inches above the highest part of the  combustion chamber.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Horizontal-return tubular and dry back Scotch boilers, 2 inches  above the top row of tubes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fusible plugs shall be cleaned and will be examined by the  marine inspector at each inspection for certification, periodic  inspection, and oftener if necessary. If in the marine inspector's  opinion the condition of any plug is satisfactory, it may be continued  in use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When fusible plugs are renewed at other than the inspection for  certification and no marine inspector is in attendance, the Chief  Engineer shall submit a written report to the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection, who issued the certificate of inspection informing him of  the renewal. This letter report shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and official number of vessel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Date of renewal of fusible plugs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number and location of fusible plugs renewed in each boiler.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Manufacturer and heat number of each plug.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Reason for renewal.
