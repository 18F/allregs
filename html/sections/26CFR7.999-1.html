The loss of tax benefits may  be determined by multiplying the otherwise allowable tax benefits by the  ``international boycott factor.'' Section 999(c)(1) provides that the  international boycott factor is to be determined under regulations  prescribed by the Secretary. The method of computing the international  boycott factor is set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. A special  rule for computing the international boycott factor of a person that is  a member of two or more controlled groups is set forth in paragraph (d).  Transitional rules for making adjustments to the international boycott  factor for years affected by the effective dates are set forth in  paragraph (e). The definitions of the terms used in this section are set  forth in paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (A) or (B) that requires participation in or  cooperation with that particular international boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Participation in or cooperation with an international boycott.  For the definition of the term ``participation in or cooperation with an  international boycott'', see section 999(b)(3) and Parts H through M of  the Treasury Department's International Boycott Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operations in or related to a boycotting country. For the  definitions of the terms ``operations'', ``operations in a boycotting  country'', ``operations related to a boycotting country'', and  ``operations with the government, a company, or a national of a  boycotting country'', see Part B of the Treasury Department's  International Boycott Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Clearly demonstrating clearly separate and identifiable  operations. For the rules for ``clearly demonstrating clearly separate  and identifiable operations'', see Part D of the Treasury Department's  International Boycott Guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Purchase made from a country. The terms ``purchase made from a  boycotting country'' and ``purchases made from any country other than  the United States'' mean, in respect of any particular country, the  gross amount paid in connection with the purchase of, the use of, or the  right to use:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tangible personal property (including money) from a stock of  goods located in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Intangible property (other than securities) in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Securities by a dealer to a beneficial owner that is a  resident of that country (but only if the dealer knows or has reason to  know the country of residence of the beneficial owner),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Real property located in that country, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Services performed in, and the end product of services performed  in, that country (other than payroll paid to a person that is an officer  or employee of the payor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Sales made to a country. The terms ``sales made to a boycotting  country'' and ``sales made to any country other than the United States''  mean, in respect of any particular country, the gross receipts from the  sale, exchange, other disposition, or use of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tangible personal property (including money) for direct use,  consumption, or disposition in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Services performed in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The end product of services (wherever performed) for direct  use, consumption, or disposition in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Intangible property (other than securities) in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Securities by a dealer to a beneficial owner that is a resident  of that country (but only if the dealer knows or has reason to know the  country of residence of the beneficial owner), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Real property located in that country.  To determine the country of direct use, consumption, or disposition of  tangible personal property and the end product of services, see  paragraph (b)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Sales made from a country. The terms ``sales made from a  boycotting country'' and ``sales made from any country other than the  United States'' mean, in respect of a particular country, the gross  receipts from the sale, exchange, other disposition, or use of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tangible personal property (including money) from a stock of  goods located in that country,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Intangible property (other than securities) in that country, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Services performed in, and the end product of services  performed in, that country.  However, gross receipts from any such sale, exchange, other disposition,  or use by a person that are included in the numerator of that person's  international boycott factor by reason of paragraph (b)(6) of this  section shall not again be included in the numerator by reason of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Payroll paid or accrued for services performed in a country. The  terms ``payroll paid or accrued for services performed in a boycotting  country'' and ``payroll paid or accrued for services performed in any  country other than the United States'' mean, in respect of a particular  country, the total amount paid or accrued as compensation to officers  and employees, including wages, salaries, commissions, and bonuses, for  services performed in that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Services performed partly within and partly without a country-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(9)(ii) of this  section, for purposes of allocating to a particular country:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The gross amount paid in connection with the purchase or use of,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The gross receipts from the sale, exchange, other disposition or  use of, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The payroll paid or accrued for services performed, or the end  product of services performed, partly within and partly without that  country, the amount paid, received, or accrued to be allocated to that  country, unless the facts and circumstances of a particular case warrant  a different amount, will be that amount that bears the same relation to  the total amount paid, received, or accrued as the number of days of  performance of the services within that country bears to the total  number of days of performance of services for which the total amount is  paid, received, or accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transportation, telegraph, and cable services. Transportation,  telegraph, and cable services performed partly within one country and  partly within another country are allocated between the two countries as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In the case of a purchase of such services performed from  Country A to Country B, fifty percent of the gross amount paid is deemed  to be a purchase made from Country A and the remaining fifty percent is  deemed to be a purchase made from Country B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of a sale of such services performed from Country A  to Country B, fifty percent of the gross receipts is deemed to be a sale  made from Country R and the remaining fifty percent is deemed to be a  sale made to Country B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Country of use, consumption, or disposition. As a general rule,  the country of use, consumption, or disposition of tangible personal  property (including money) and the end product of services (wherever  performed) is deemed to be the country of destination of the tangible  personal property or the end product of the services. (Thus, if legal  services are performed in one country and an opinion is given for use by  a client in a second country, the end product of the legal services is  used, consumed, or disposed of in the second country.) The occurrence in  a country of a temporary interruption in the shipment of the tangible  personal property or the delivery of the end product of services shall  not constitute such country the country of destination. However, if at  the time of the transaction the person providing the tangible personal  property or the end product of services knew, or should have known from  the facts and circumstances surrounding the transaction, that the  tangible personal property or the end product of services probably would  not be used, consumed,   or disposed of in the country of destination, that person must determine  the country of ultimate use, consumption or disposition of the tangible  personal property or the end product of services. Notwithstanding the  preceding provisions of this subparagraph, a person that sells,  exchanges, otherwise disposes of, or makes available for use, tangible  personal property to any person all of whose business except for an  insubstantial part consists of selling from inventory to retail  customers at retail outlets all within one country may assume at the  time of such sale to such person that the tangible personal property  will be used, consumed, or disposed of within such country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Controlled group taxable year. The term ``controlled group  taxable year'' means the taxable year of the controlled group's common  parent corporation. In the event that no common parent corporation  exists, the members of the group shall elect the taxable year of one of  the members of the controlled group to serve as the controlled group  taxable year. The taxable year election is a binding election to be  changed only with the approval of the Secretary of his delegate. The  election is to be made in accordance with the procedures set forth in  the instructions to Form 5713, the International Boycott Report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Computation of international boycott factor--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  method of computing the international boycott factor of a person that is  not a member of a controlled group is set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section. The method of computing the international boycott factor  of a person that is a member of a controlled group is set forth in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section. For purposes of paragraphs (c) (2) and  (3), purchases and sales made by, and payroll paid or accrued by, a  partnership are deemed to be made or paid or accrued by a partner in  that proportion that the partner's distributive share bears to the  purchases and sales made by, and the payroll paid or accrued by, the  partnership. Also for purposes of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3), purchases  and sales made by, and payroll paid or accrued by, a trust referred to  in section 671 are deemed to be made both by the trust (for purposes of  determining the trust's international boycott factor), and by a person  treated under section 671 as the owner of the trust (but only in that  proportion that the portion of the trust that such person is considered  as owning under sections 671 through 679 bears to the purchases and  sales made by, and the payroll paid and accrued by, the trust).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> International boycott factor of a person that is not a member of  a controlled group. The international boycott factor to be applied by a  person that is not a member of a controlled group (within the meaning of  section 993(a)(3)) is a fraction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Purchases made from all boycotting countries associated in  carrying out a particular international boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sales made to or from all boycotting countries associated in  carrying out a particular international boycott, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payroll paid or accrued for services performed in all boycotting  countries associated in carrying out a particular international boycott  by that person during that person's taxable year, minus the amount of  such purchases, sales, and payroll that is clearly demonstrated to be  attributable to clearly separate and identifiable operations in  connection with which there was no participation in or cooperation with  that international boycott.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The denominator of the fraction is the sum of the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Purchases made from any country other than the United States,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sales made to or from any country other than the United States,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payroll paid or accrued for services performed in any country  other than the United States by that person during that person's taxable  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3))</em> shall be computed in the manner described in  paragraph (c)(2) of this section, except that there shall be taken into  account the purchases and sales made by, and the payroll paid or accrued  by,   each member of the controlled group during each member's own taxable  year that ends with or within the controlled group taxable year that  ends with or within that person's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Computation of the international boycott factor of a person that  is a member of two or more controlled groups. The international boycott  factor to be applied under sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)(1)(F)  by a person that is a member of two or more controlled groups shall be  determined in the manner described in paragraph (c)(3), except that the  purchases, sales, and payroll included in the number and denominator  shall include the purchases, sales, and payroll of that person and of  all other members of the two or more controlled groups of which that  person is a member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Transitional rules--(1) Pre-November 3, 1976 boycotting  operations. The international boycott factor to be applied under  sections 908(a), 952(a)(3), and 995(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(F)</em> by a person that is not a  member of a controlled group, for that person's taxable year that  includes November 3, 1976, or a person that is a member of a controlled  group, for the controlled group taxable year that includes November 3,  1976, shall be computed in the manner described in paragraphs (c)(2) and  (c)(3), respectively, of this section. However, that the following  adjustments shall be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section purchases, sales, and  payroll clearly demonstrated to be attributable to clearly separate and  identifiable operations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That were completed on or before November 3, 1976, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In respect of which it is demonstrated that the agreements  constituting participation in or cooperation with the international  boycott were renounced, the renunciations were communicated on or before  November 3, 1976, to the governments or persons with which the  agreements were made and the agreements have not been reaffirmed after  November 3, 1976, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The international boycott factor resulting after the numerator  has been modified in accordance with paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section  shall be further modified by multiplying it by a fraction. The numerator  of that fraction shall be the number of days in that person's taxable  year (or, if applicable, in that person's controlled group taxable year)  remaining after November 3, 1976, and the denominator shall be 366.  The principles of this subparagraph are illustrated in the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation A, a calendar year taxpayer, is not a member of  a controlled group. During the 1976 calendar year, Corporation DA had  three operations in a boycotting country under three separate contracts,  each of which contained agreements constituting participation in or  cooperation with an international boycott. Each contract was entered  into on or after September 2, 1976. Operation (1) was completed on  November 1, 1976. The sales made to a boycotting country in connection  with Operation (1) amounted to $10. Operation (2) was not completed  during the taxable year, but on November 1, 1976, Corporation A  communicated a renunciation of the boycott agreement covering that  operation to the government of the boycotting country. The sales made to  a boycotting country in connection with Operation (2) amounted to $40.  Operation (3) was not completed during the taxable year, nor was any  renunciation of the boycott agreement made. The sales made to a  boycotting country in connection with Operation (3) amounted to $25.  Corporation A had no purchases made from, sales made from, or payroll  paid or accrued for services performed in, a boycotting country.  Corporation A had $500 of purchases made from, sales made from, sales  made to, and payroll paid or accrued for services performed in,  countries other than the United States. Company A's boycott factor for  1976, computed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section (before the  application of this subparagraph) would be: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16OC91.003</p><p class="depth0">However, the $10 is eliminated from the numerator by reason of  paragraph (e)(1)(i)(A) of this section, and the $40 is eliminated from  the numerator by reason of paragraph (e)(1)(i)(B) of this section. Thus,  before the application of paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section,  Corporation A's international boycott factor is $25/$500. After the  application of paragraph (e)(1)(ii), Corporation A's international  boycott factor is: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16OC91.004</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and (c)(3),  respectively, of this section. However, the following adjustments shall  be made:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section purchases, sales, and  payroll clearly demonstrated to be attributable to clearly separate and  identifiable operations that were carried out in accordance with the  terms of binding contracts entered into before September 2, 1976, and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> That were completed on or before December 31, 1977, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In respect of which it is demonstrated that the agreements  constituting participation in or cooperation with the international  boycott were renounced, the renunciations were communicated on or before  December 31, 1977, to the governments or persons with which the  agreements were made, and the agreements were not reaffirmed after  December 31, 1977, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of clearly separate and identifiable operations  that are carried out in accordance with the terms of binding contracts  entered into before September 2, 1976, but that do not meet the  requirements of paragraph (e)(2)(i) of this section, the numerators  described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i) and (c)(3)(i) of this section shall be  adjusted by multiplying the purchases, sales, and payroll clearly  demonstrated to be attributable to those operations by a fraction, the  numerator of which is the number of days in such person's taxable year  (or, if applicable, in such person's controlled group taxable year)  remaining after December 31, 1977, and the denominator of which is 365.  The principles of this subparagraph are illustrated in the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corporation A is not a member of a controlled group and  reports on the basis of a July 1-June 30 fiscal year. During the 1977- 1978 fiscal year, Corporation A had 2 operations carried out pursuant to  the terms of separate contracts, each of which had a clause that  constituted participation in or cooperation with an international  boycott. Neither operation was completed during the fiscal year, nor  were either of the boycotting clauses renounced. Operation (1) was  carried out in accordance with the terms of a contract entered into on  November 15, 1976. Operation (2) was carried out in accordance with the  terms of a binding contract entered into before September 2, 1976.  Corporation A had sales made to a boycotting country in connection with  Operation (1) in the amount of $50, and in connection with Operation (2)  in the amount of $100. Corporation A had sales made to countries other  than the United States in the amount of $500. Corporation A had no  purchases made from, sales made from, or payroll paid or accrued for  services performed in, any country other than the United States. In the  absence of this subparagraph, Corporation A's international boycott  factor would be [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16OC91.005   However, by reason of the application of this subparagraph, Corporation  A's international boycott factor is reduced to [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC16OC91.006</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.  However, the numerator and the denominator in that paragraph shall  include only the purchases, sales, and payroll of those members of the  controlled group whose taxable years ending after November 3, 1976 have  ended as the end of the taxable year of such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section applies to participation in or  cooperation with an international boycott after November 3, 1976. In the  case of operations which constitute participation in or cooperation with  an international boycott and which are carried out in accordance with  the terms of a binding contract entered into before September   2, 1976, this section applies to such participation or cooperation after  December 31, 1977.
