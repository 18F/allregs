                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prior to a final report of excess, or transfer to another  Federal agency or a State, of any Government-owned military real  property with an estimated value, including the value of existing  improvements, in excess of $100,000, the proposed disposal must be  reported to the Committees. Also, proposals to outlease military real  property for other than agricultural or grazing purposes must be  reported if the estimated annual rental consideration is more than  $100,000. A formal appraisal for estimating value need not be made.  Reports to the Committees pertaining to Army military real property are  made by the Chief of Engineers, and copies of reports are furnished the  two senators of the State, and the congressman of the district where the  property is located. Reports pertaining to Air Force property are made  by that department. DEs, upon request, will assist Air Force commands in  assembling the required data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For Army property, data will be furnished in the format shown in  Figure 11-2 (ENG Form 2187-R, Real Estate Disposal Report) in ER 405-1- 12, and three copies forwarded to HQDA (DAEN-REM) WASH DC 20314. The  information should be submitted within three weeks after dispatch of the  screening message, or within three weeks after receipt of the disposal  directive when screening is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Clearance for transfer to another military department is  obtained by the acquiring department. However, HQDA (DAEN-REZ-L) obtains  clearance for transfer of Army property to a nondefense Federal agency  where authorized by law.</p>
