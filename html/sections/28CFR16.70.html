                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following system of records is exempt from 5 U.S.C. 552a(c)  (3) and (4); (d); (e) (1), (2) and (3), (e)(4) (G) and (H), (e)(5); and  (g):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  (k)(2), and (k)(5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exemptions from the particular subsections are justified for the  following reasons:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record  subject the accounting of disclosures from records concerning him/her  would reveal investigative interest on the part of the Department of  Justice as well as the recipient agency. This would permit record  subjects to impede the investigation, e.g., destroy evidence, intimidate  potential witnesses, or flee the area to avoid inquiries or apprehension  by law enforcement personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from the  access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to subsections (j) and (k)  of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d) because the records contained in this system  relate to official Federal investigations. Individual access to these  records might compromise ongoing investigations, reveal confidential  informants or constitute unwarranted invasions of the personal privacy  of third parties who are involved in a certain investigation.   Amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law  enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden  by requiring criminal investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsections (e) (1) and (5) because in the course of law  enforcement investigations, information may occasionally be obtained or  introduced the accuracy of which is unclear or which is not strictly  relevant or necessary to a specific investigation. In the interests of  effective law enforcement, it is appropriate to retain all information  that may aid in establishing patterns of criminal activity. Moreover, it  would impede the specific investigative process if it were necessary to  assure the relevance, accuracy, timeliness and completeness of all  information obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because in a law enforcement  investigation the requirement that information be collected to the  greatest extent possible from the subject individual would present a  serious impediment to law enforcement in that the subject of the  investigation would be informed of the existence of the investigation  and would therefore be able to avoid detection, apprehension, or legal  obligations of duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because to comply with the requirements  of this subsection during the course of an investigation could impede  the information gathering process, thus hampering the investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsections (e)(4) (G) and (H) because this system is  exempt from the access provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to  subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From subsection (g) because this system is exempt from the  access and amendment provisions of subsection (d) pursuant to  subsections (j) and (k) of the Privacy Act.
