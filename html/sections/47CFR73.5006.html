                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As set forth in 47 CFR 1.2108, petitions to deny may be filed  against the long-form applications filed by winning bidders in broadcast  service auctions and against the long-form applications filed by  applicants whose short-form applications were not mutually exclusive  with any other applicant, or whose short-form applications were mutually  exclusive only with one or more short-form applications for a  noncommercial educational broadcast station, as described in 47 U.S.C.  397(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within ten (10) days following the issuance of a public notice  announcing that a long-form application for an   AM, FM or television construction permit has been accepted for filing,  petitions to deny that application may be filed. Within fifteen (15)  days following the issuance of a public notice announcing that a long- form application for a low-power television, television translator or FM  translator construction permit has been accepted for filing, petitions  to deny that application may be filed. Any such petitions must contain  allegations of fact supported by affidavit of a person or persons with  personal knowledge thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant may file an opposition to any petition to deny, and  the petitioner a reply to such opposition. Allegations of fact or  denials thereof must be supported by affidavit of a person or persons  with personal knowledge thereof. In the AM, FM and television broadcast  services, the time for filing such oppositions shall be five (5) days  from the filing date for petitions to deny, and the time for filing  replies shall be five (5) days from the filing date for oppositions. In  the low-power television, television translator and FM translator  broadcast services, the time for filing such oppositions shall be  fifteen (15) days from the filing date for petitions to deny, and the  time for filing replies shall be ten (10) days from the filing date for  oppositions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Broadcast construction permits will be granted by the Commission  only if the Commission denies or dismisses all petitions to deny, if any  are filed, and is otherwise satisfied that an applicant is qualified,  and after full and timely payment of winning bids and any applicable  late fees. See 47 CFR 73.5003. Construction of broadcast stations shall  not commence until the grant of such permit or license to the winning  bidder and only after full and timely payment of winning bids and any  applicable late fees.
