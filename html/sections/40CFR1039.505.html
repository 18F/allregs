                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to test engines under steady-state  conditions. In some cases, we allow you to choose the appropriate  steady-state duty cycle for an engine; you may also choose between  discrete-mode and ramped-modal testing. In all cases, you must use the  duty cycle you select in your application for certification for all  testing you perform for that engine family. If we test your engines to  confirm that they meet emission standards, we will use the duty cycle  you select for your own testing. If you submit certification test data  using more than one duty cycle, any of the selected duty cycles may be  used for any subsequent testing. We may also perform other testing as  allowed by the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may perform steady-state testing with either discrete-mode  or ramped-modal cycles as described in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use the 5-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal  cycle described in paragraph (a) of Appendix II of this part for  constant-speed engines. Note that these cycles do not apply to all  engines used in constant-speed applications, as described in Sec.   1039.801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the 6-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal  cycle described in paragraph (b) of Appendix II of this part for  variable-speed engines below 19 kW. You may instead use the 8-mode duty  cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in appendix IV  of this part if some engines from your engine family will be used in  applications that do not involve governing to maintain engine operation  around rated speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal  cycle described in paragraph (c) of Appendix II of this part for  variable-speed engines at or above 19 kW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> to replace full-load operation with the maximum load for  which the engine is designed to operate for extended periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To allow non-motoring dynamometers on cycles with idle, you   may omit additional points from the duty-cycle regression as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For variable-speed engines with low-speed governors, you may  omit speed, torque, and power points from the duty-cycle regression  statistics if the following are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The engine operator demand is at its minimum.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The dynamometer demand is at its minimum.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> It is an idle point fnref = 0% (idle) and  Tref = 0% (idle).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tref < T <=5% [middot] Tmaxmapped.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For variable-speed engines without low-speed governors, you may  omit torque and power points from the duty-cycle regression statistics  if the following are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The dynamometer demand is at its minimum.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is an idle point fnref = 0% (idle) and  Tref = 0% (idle).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> fnref - (2% [middot] fntest) <  fn < fnref + (2% [middot] fntest).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Tref < T <=5% [middot] Tmaxmapped.
