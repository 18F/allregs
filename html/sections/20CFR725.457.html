The administrative law judge and the parties may question  witnesses with respect to any matters relevant and material to any  contested issue. Any party who intends to present the testimony of an  expert witness at a hearing, including any physician, regardless of  whether   the physician has previously prepared a medical report, shall so notify  all other parties to the claim at least 10 days before the hearing. The  failure to give notice of the appearance of an expert witness in  accordance with this paragraph, unless notice is waived by all parties,  shall preclude the presentation of testimony by such expert witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No person shall be required to appear as a witness in any  proceeding before an administrative law judge at a place more than 100  miles from his or her place of residence, unless the lawful mileage and  witness fee for 1 day's attendance is paid in advance of the hearing  date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a witness offering testimony relevant to the  liability of the responsible operator, in the absence of extraordinary  circumstances, the witness must have been identified as a potential  hearing witness while the claim was pending before the district  director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a physician offering testimony relevant to the  physical condition of the miner, such physician must have prepared a  medical report. Alternatively, in the absence of a showing of good cause  under Sec. 725.456(b)(1) of this part, a physician may offer testimony  relevant to the physical condition of the miner only to the extent that  the party offering the physician's testimony has submitted fewer medical  reports than permitted by Sec. 725.414.
