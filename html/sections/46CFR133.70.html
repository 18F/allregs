At least one lifebuoy must be located near the stern of the

OSV. The lifebuoys with attached self-igniting lights must be equally distributed on both sides of the OSV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Color and markings. Lifebuoys must be colored and marked as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each lifebuoy must be orange.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each lifebuoy must be marked in block capital letters with the name of the OSV and the name of the port required to be marked on the stern of the OSV under subpart 67.123 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Attachments and fittings.

The self-igniting light must not be attached to the lifebuoys required by this section to be fitted with lifelines. However, if the OSV carries less than four lifebuoys, a buoyant lifeline can be fitted to one of the lifebuoys with a self-igniting light.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lifejackets.

Each lifejacket must have a lifejacket light approved under approval series 161.112 or 161.012 securely attached to the front shoulder area of the lifejacket.

Immersion suits and anti-exposure suits must be stowed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Immersion suits and anti-exposure suits must be stowed so they are readily accessible, and the stowage positions must be marked with the words ``IMMERSION SUITS'' or ``ANTI-EXPOSURE SUITS'' as appropriate, or with the appropriate symbol from IMO Resolution A.760(18).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If watch stations, work stations, or work sites are remote from cabins, staterooms, or berthing areas and the immersion suits are stowed in those locations, there must be, in addition to the immersion suits required under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, enough immersion suits stowed at the watch stations, work stations, or work sites to equal the number of persons normally on watch in, or assigned to, those locations at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Markings. Each immersion suit or anti-exposure suit must be marked in such a way as to identify the person or OSV to which it belongs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lights for immersion suits or anti-exposure suits. Each immersion suit or anti-exposure suit must have a lifejacket light approved under approval series 161.112 or 161.012 securely attached to the front shoulder area of the immersion suit or anti-exposure suit. However, lifejacket lights bearing Coast Guard approval number 161.012/2/1 are not permitted on OSVs certificated to operate on waters where water temperature may drop below 10 [deg]C (50 [deg]F).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Lifejacket, immersion suit, and anti-exposure suit containers. Each lifejacket, immersion suit, and anti-exposure suit container must be marked in block capital letters and numbers with the quantity, identity, and size of the equipment stowed inside the container.
