Authority to release emission data to the public is deficient in that  section 23-25-6 requires that only records concerning investigations be  available to the public.   Further, section 23-25-5(g) and section 23-25-13 may limit the State's  authority to release emission data. Authority to require sources to  install and maintain monitoring equipment is not provided and is  therefore inadequate. Authority to require sources to periodically  report is not provided and is therefore inadequate.
