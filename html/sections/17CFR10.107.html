The application shall show to the satisfaction of the Commission that the additional evidence is material, and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence at the hearing. The Commission may hear the additional evidence or may refer the proceeding to the Administrative Law Judge for the taking of the additional evidence.</p>
