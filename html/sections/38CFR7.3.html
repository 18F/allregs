Group insurance will not be included unless an individual and separate contract of insurance is completely released to the insured and thereafter comes within the provisions of the Act as a policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The phrase Face amount of insurance as used in the regulations in this part will mean the amount of insurance payable as a death benefit; Provided, That any indebtedness, or any accruals (such as paid-up additions, dividend accumulations, etc.) that may be added to or taken from the amount payable as the death benefits will not be used in calculating the face amount of a policy.
