The determination of the recipient's violation may be made only after a recipient has had an opportunity for a hearing on the record before an administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other means authorized by law including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Referral to the Department of Justice for proceedings to enforce any rights of the United States or obligations of the recipient created by the Act or these regulations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use of any requirement of or referral to any Federal, State, or local government agency that will have the effect of correcting a violation of the Act or these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> HHS will limit any termination under Sec. 91.46(a)(1) to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity HHS finds in violation of these regulations. HHS will not base any part of a termination on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not receive Federal financial assistance from HHS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> HHS will take no action under paragraph (a) until:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Secretary has advised the recipient of its failure to comply with the Act and these regulations and has determined that voluntary compliance cannot be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thirty days have elapsed after the Secretary has sent a written report of the circumstances and grounds of the action to the committees of the Congress having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. The Secretary will file a report whenever any action is taken under paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HHS also may defer granting new Federal financial assistance from HHS to a recipient when a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1) is initiated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New Federal financial assistance from HHS includes all assistance for which HHS requires an application or approval, including renewal or continuation of existing activities, or authorization of new activities, during the deferral period. New Federal financial assistance from HHS does not include increases in funding as a result of changed computation of formula awards or assistance approved prior to the beginning of a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HHS will not begin a deferral until the recipient has received a notice of an opportunity for a hearing under Sec. 91.46(a)(1). HHS will not continue a deferral for more than 60 days unless a hearing has begun within that time or the time for beginning the hearing has been extended by mutual consent of the recipient and the Secretary. HHS will not continue a deferral for more than 30 days after the close of the hearing, unless the hearing results in a finding against the recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HHS will limit any deferral to the particular recipient and particular program or activity or part of such program or activity HHS finds in violation of these regulations. HHS will not base any part of a deferral on a finding with respect to any program or activity of the recipient which does not, and would not in connection with the new funds, receive Federal financial assistance from HHS.
