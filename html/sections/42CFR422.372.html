Subject to this section and to paragraphs (a) and (e) of Sec. 422.374, CMS may waive the State licensure requirement if the organization has applied (except as provided in paragraph (b)(4) of this section) for the most closely appropriate State license or authority to conduct business as an MA plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for waiver of State licensure.

The State failed to complete action on the licensing application within 90 days of the date the State received a substantially complete application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Denial of application based on discriminatory treatment.
