                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the General Accounting Office are charged with the responsibility for implementing the Federal Claims Collection Act and have promulgated the Federal Claims Collection Act Joint Standards (FCCAJS) (4 CFR parts 101-105) to inform Government Agencies on how to settle debts and claims which the Agency does not have independent statutory authority to settle. With the exception of loans and claims with outstanding balances of $20,000 or less, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, settlements must be submitted to and approved by the United States Attorney or the DOJ. Debt Settlement of Economic Opportunity Cooperative loans, Claims Against Third Party Converters, Nonprogram loans, Industrial

Development Grants, Rural Development Loan Fund loans, Intermediary Relending Program loans, Nonprofit National Corporations Loans and Grants, Indian Tribal Land Acquisition Loans (to the extent settlement cannot be effected pursuant to Sec. 1956.137), and 601 Energy Impact Assistance Grants are programs that must be settled under the FCCAJS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Debt settlement of the subject loans and claims falls in the following categories:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Settlement of loans and claims may be approved by the Administrator when the outstanding balance of the indebtedness involved in the settlement in $20,000 or less, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs. These loans and claims will be submitted to the National Office on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1956-1, ``Application for Settlement of Indebtedness,'' for debt settlement. Subsequent to approval, Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1956-1 will be distributed in accordance with the Forms Manual Insert (FMI).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loans and claims with an outstanding balance of $200,000 or less inclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, but with an outstanding balance greater than $20,000, exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, after approval by the State Director will be referred to your Regional Office of the General Counsel (OGC) for referral to the United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be found. The form to be used is the Claims Collection Litigation Report (CCLR). This form should be available through the U.S. Attorney. A memorandum from the State Director should be attached to the CCLR recommending acceptance of the debt settlement. If the State Director after reviewing the CCLR does not recommend acceptance, the State Director has the authority to reject the debt settlement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loans and claims with an outstanding balance over $200,000, inclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, will be referred to the Administrator and will include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The case file(s).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A completed CCLR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Copies of the notes, security agreements, and mortgages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A current appraisal of any security owned by the debtor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A narrative which will include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Recommendation for the acceptance of the debt settlement.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The type of loan involved, a short history of the loan, and why the debtor failed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Steps taken to collect the loan(s).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> An analysis of the debtor's future repayment ability. This should discuss if the debtor has any other assets or has concealed or improperly transferred assets, if known. If the debtor is an individual, this should include consideration of the debtor's present and potential income and inheritance prospects.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Why acceptance of the debt settlement offer is in the best interest of the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Administrator concurs with the recommendation for the debt settlement, it will be referred by the FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 National Office to OGC for referral to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil Division, U.S. Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a debtor has a Community Programs or Business and Industry loans(s) and defined in this subpart, these loan(s) will be debt settled under the authority of the Consolidated Farm and Rural Development Act. In such cases, the subject loans and claims should be listed under part II(B) on Form FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 1956-1, as other debts owed FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. Normally, all the security for the subject loans and claims should be disposed of prior to the submission for debt settlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is not necessary to obtain approval of the United States Attorney or the DOJ (as the case may be) in cases where FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 decides not to settle a loan or claim.
