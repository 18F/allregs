It is by use of these access codes that orders are accepted  by the CSC and these codes determine the ship-to points for all orders  filled by the CSC with the exception of orders picked up at the CSC by  the customer. GSA will not change the ship-to location associated with  the customer access code except upon receipt of a written request to do  so, signed by a duly authorized official of the customer activity.</p>
