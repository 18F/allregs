                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. In conducting an audit under 19 U.S.C.  1509(b), the CBP auditors, except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f)  of this section, will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide notice, telephonically and in writing, to the person to  be audited of CBP's intention to conduct an audit and a reasonable  estimate of the time to be required for the audit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inform the person who is to be the subject of the audit, in  writing and before commencement of the audit, of that person's right to  an entrance conference, at which time the objectives and records  requirements of the audit, and any sampling plan to be employed or  offsetting that may apply, will be explained and the estimated  termination date of the audit will be set. Where a decision on a  sampling plan and methodology is not made at the time of the entrance  conference, CBP will discuss these matters with the person being audited  as soon as possible after the discovery of facts and circumstances that  warrant the possible need to employ sampling;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide a further estimate of any additional time for the audit  if, during the course of the audit, it becomes apparent that additional  time will be required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Schedule a closing conference upon completion of the audit on- site work to explain the preliminary results of the audit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Complete a formal written audit report within 90 calendar days  following the closing conference referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of this  section, unless the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of  International Trade, CBP Headquarters, provides written notice to the  person audited of the reason for any delay and the anticipated  completion date; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> After application of any disclosure exemptions contained in 5  U.S.C. 552, send a copy of the formal written audit report to the person  audited within 30 calendar days following completion of the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Petition procedures for failure to conduct closing conference.  Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (f) of this section, if the  estimated or actual termination date of the audit passes without a CBP  auditor providing a closing conference to explain the results of the  audit, the person audited may petition in writing for a closing  conference to the Executive Director, Regulatory Audit, Office of  International Trade, Customs and Border Protection, Washington, DC  20229. Upon receipt of the request, the director will provide for the  closing conference to be held within 15 calendar days after the date of  receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, a response to a prepenalty notice issued by CBP under 19  U.S.C. 1592(b)(1) or 19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, a petition submitted in  response to a penalty notice issued by CBP under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b)(2) or  19 U.S.C. 1593a(b)(2) (19 CFR part 171) and 19 U.S.C. 1618, a  supplemental petition submitted under 19 CFR 171.61 and 171.62, or any  action commenced in a court of proper jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Projection. For purposes of this section, ``projection'' of  sampling results over the universe of transactions is the process by  which the results obtained from the sample entries actually examined are  applied to the universe of entries set within the time period and scope  of the sampling plan to yield a reliable assessment of that which is  sought to be ascertained or measured in the audit, including, but not  limited to, lost duties or revenue, or overpayments or over- declarations, as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When CBP uses statistical sampling. CBP auditors have the sole  discretion to use statistical sampling techniques when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Review of 100 percent of the transactions is impossible or  impractical;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sampling plan is prepared in accordance with generally  recognized sampling procedures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sampling procedure is executed in accordance with that  plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Statistical sampling by audited persons under CBP supervision.  CBP may authorize a person being audited to conduct, under CBP  supervision, self-testing of its own transactions within the time period  and scope of the audit as originally set or later modified by CBP at its  discretion. Audited persons permitted in advance by CBP to conduct self- testing of certain transactions under CBP supervision within the time  period and scope of a CBP audit may use statistical sampling methods,  provided that the criteria contained in paragraph (c)(3) of this section  are satisfied. CBP will determine the time period and scope of the CBP- approved and supervised self-testing and will explain any sampling plan  to be employed in accordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The  execution and results of the self-testing and the sampling plan are  subject to CBP approval, and the audited person is subject to the waiver  of paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Statistical sampling by a private party submitting a prior  disclosure. A private party conducting an independent review of certain  transactions and a   calculation of lost duties, taxes, and fees or lost revenue for purposes  of prior disclosure, in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74(j), may use  statistical sampling, provided that the private party submits an  explanation of the sampling plan and methodology employed and that the  criteria in paragraph (c)(3) of this section are satisfied. Where the  private party submits a prior disclosure employing statistical sampling,  the time period, scope, and any sampling plan employed by the private  party, as well as the execution and results of the self-review, are  subject to CBP review and approval. Where CBP and the private party  discuss and accept the sampling plan and methodology, or an adjustment  to it, the waiver of paragraph (c)(1) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Offset of overpayments and over-declarations in 19 U.S.C. 1592  penalty cases--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In conducting any audit authorized under 19  U.S.C. 1509 and this section for the purpose of calculating the loss of  duties, taxes, and fees or monetary penalty under any provision of 19  U.S.C. 1592, CBP auditors identifying overpayments of duties or fees or  over-declarations of quantities or values that are within the time  period and scope of the audit, as established solely by CBP, will treat  the overpayments or over-declarations on finally liquidated entries as  an offset to any underpayments or under-declarations also identified on  finally liquidated entries, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identified overpayments or over-declarations were not made  by the person being audited for the purpose of violating any provision  of law, including laws other than customs laws,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identified underpayments or under-declarations were not  made knowingly and intentionally, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All other requirements of this paragraph (d) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When audited person conducts self-testing under CBP supervision.  Offsetting will apply to self-testing conducted by an audited person  under CBP supervision (i.e., during a CBP audit), provided that all  requirements of this paragraph (d) are met, CBP approves the self- testing in advance and, upon review of the self-testing, CBP approves  its execution and results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a private party submits a prior disclosure. Offsetting will  apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure, provided that the  prior disclosure is in accordance with 19 CFR 162.74 and CBP approves  the private party's self-review, including its execution and results.  CBP's Office of International Trade, Regulatory Audit will review and  evaluate all such prior disclosures and approve offsetting where it is  satisfied that the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1509(b)(6) and this  paragraph (d) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Time period and scope determined by CBP; projection when  sampling employed. In conducting an audit under paragraph (d)(1) of this  section or authorizing an audited person's self-testing as described in  paragraph (d)(2) of this section, CBP will have the sole authority to  determine the time period and scope of the audit. In conducting a review  of a private party's prior disclosure as described in paragraph (d)(3)  of this section, the time period and scope employed will be subject to  CBP approval. In each of these circumstances, where statistical sampling  is involved, CBP auditors will examine only the selected sample  transactions. The results of the sample examination, with respect to  properly identified overpayments and over-declarations and properly  identified underpayments and under-declarations, will be projected over  the universe of transactions to determine the total overpayments and  over-declarations that are eligible for offsetting and to determine the  total loss of duties, taxes, and fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Same acts, statements, omissions, or entries not required.  Offsetting may be permitted where the overpayments or over-declarations  were not made by the same acts, statements, or omissions that caused the  underpayments or under-declarations, and is not limited to the same  entries that evidence the underpayments or under-declarations, provided  that they are within the time period and scope of the audit as  established by CBP and as described in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Limitations. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to  specific overpayments or over-declarations made for the purpose of  violating any provision of law, including laws other than   customs laws. Offsetting will not be allowed with respect to  overpayments or over-declarations resulting from a failure to timely  claim or establish a duty allowance or preference. Offsetting will be  disallowed entirely where CBP determines that any underpayments or  under-declarations identified for offsetting purposes were made  knowingly and intentionally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Audit report. Where overpayments or over-declarations have been  identified in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this section, the  audit report will state whether they have been made within the time  period and scope of the audit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Disallowance determinations referred to Fines, Penalties, and  Forfeitures office. Any determination that offsets will be disallowed  where overpayments/over-declarations were made for the purpose of  violating any law, or where underpayments or under-declarations were  made knowingly and intentionally, will be made by the appropriate Fines,  Penalties, and Forfeitures (FP&F;) office to which the issue was  referred. CBP will notify the audited person of a determination whether  to allow offsetting in whole or in part. The FP&F; office will issue a  notice of penalty under 19 U.S.C. 1592(b) and/or notice of liability for  lost duties, taxes, and fees under 19 U.S.C. 1592(d) where it determines  that such action is warranted. If the FP&F; office issues a notice of  penalty, the audited person may file a petition under 19 U.S.C.  1592(b)(2), 19 U.S.C. 1618, and 19 CFR part 171 to challenge the action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Refunds limited. An overpayment of duties and fees will only be  credited toward a refund if the circumstances of the overpayment meet  the requirements of 19 U.S.C. 1520 or the requirements of 19 U.S.C.  1514(a) pertaining to clerical error, mistake of fact, or other  inadvertence in any entry, liquidation, or reliquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sampling not evidence of reasonable care. The fact that entries  were previously within the time period and scope of an audit conducted  by CBP in which sampling was employed, in any circumstances described in  this section, is not evidence of reasonable care by a violator in any  subsequent action involving such entries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Exception to procedures. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this  section may not apply when a private party submits a prior disclosure  under paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Paragraphs (a)(5), (a)(6), (b),  (d)(8), and (d)(9) of this section do not apply once CBP and/or ICE  commences an investigation with respect to the issue(s) involved.  [CBP Dec. 11-20, 76 FR 65961, Oct. 25, 2011]</p>
