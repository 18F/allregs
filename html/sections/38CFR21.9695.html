Sec. 1.957 and  1.962 of this chapter, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The overpayment results from an administrative error or an  error in judgment. See Sec. 21.9635(r).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An overpayment of educational assistance paid to the institution  of higher learning on behalf of an eligible individual constitutes a  liability of the individual unless the individual never attended the  term, quarter, or semester certified by the institution of higher  learning. If the individual never attended the term, quarter, or  semester certified by the institution of higher learning, the  institution must return to VA all educational assistance received under  the provisions of 38 U.S.C. chapter 33 on behalf of the individual for  such term, quarter, or semester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the overpayment of educational assistance paid to  the eligible individual, or paid to the institution of higher learning  on behalf of the eligible individual, constitutes a liability of the  institution of higher learning if VA determines that the overpayment is  the result of willful or negligent--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> False certification by the institution of higher learning; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to certify excessive absences from a course,  discontinuance of a course, or interruption of a course by the eligible  individual.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3034(a), 3323(a), 3685)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In determining whether an overpayment resulting from the  actions listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section should  be recovered from an institution of higher learning, VA will apply the  provisions of Sec. 21.4009 (except paragraph (a)(1)) to overpayments of  educational assistance under 38 U.S.C. chapter 33.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> VA will determine the amount of an overpayment as follows--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in  the certified period of enrollment for which he or she received payment,  and who does not substantiate mitigating circumstances for not  completing such course or courses, VA will establish an overpayment  equal to the amount of educational assistance paid for the course or  courses not completed during that certified period of enrollment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an individual who does not complete one or more courses in  the certified period of enrollment, but who substantiates mitigating  circumstances for not completing such course or courses, VA will prorate  the amount of educational assistance to which he or she is entitled.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> VA will determine the prorated amount of the established charges  by dividing the amount the individual was paid for the course or courses  not completed by the number of days in the certified enrollment period,  and multiplying the result by the number of days from the beginning date  of the enrollment period through the last date of attendance. The result  of this calculation will equal the amount the individual is due. The  difference between the amount of educational assistance paid and the  amount of educational assistance the individual is due for the course or  courses not completed will be established as an overpayment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> VA will determine the prorated amount of the monthly housing  allowance by determining the amount the individual was entitled to while  enrolled and subtracting that amount from the total amount paid. The  difference between the amount of the monthly housing allowance paid and  the amount of the monthly housing allowance the individual is due will  be established as an overpayment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Individuals who have substantiated mitigating circumstances will  not be charged an overpayment for the lump sum payment for books,  supplies, equipment, and other educational costs (``book stipend'').
