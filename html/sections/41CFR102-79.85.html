                            <p class="depth0">Executive agencies will make antenna sites available on a fair,  reasonable, and nondiscriminatory basis. Collocation of antennas should  be encouraged where there are multiple antenna siting requests for the  same location. In cases where this is not feasible and space  availability precludes accommodating all antenna siting applicants,  competitive procedures may be used. This should be done in accordance  with applicable Federal, State and local laws and regulations, and  consistent with national security concerns. In making antenna sites  available, agencies must avoid electromagnetic intermodulations and  interferences. To the maximum extent practicable, when placing antennas  for the provision of telecommunication services to the Federal  Government, agencies should use redundant and physically separate entry  points into the building and physically diverse local network facilities  in accordance with guidance issued by the Office of Management and  Budget.</p>
