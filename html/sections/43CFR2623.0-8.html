                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Lands included in grant. (1) Section 2 of the Act of January 25,  1927 (44 Stat. 1027; 43 U.S.C. 871) reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 2. That nothing herein contained is intended or shall be held  or construed to increase, diminish, or affect the rights of States under  grants other than for the support of common or public schools by  numbered school sections in place, and this Act shall not apply to  indemnity of lieu selections or exchanges or the right hereafter to  select indemnity for numbered school sections in place lost to the State  under the provisions of this or other Acts, and all existing laws  governing such grants and indemnity or lieu selections and exchanges are  hereby continued in full force and effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The only grants affected in any way by the provisions of the Act  of January 25, 1927, are those of numbered sections of land in place  made to the States for the support of common or public schools. The  adjudication of claims to land asserted under other grants, for  indemnity or lieu lands and exchanges of lands, will proceed as  theretofore, being governed by the provisions of existing laws  applicable thereto. The States will be afforded full opportunity,  however, if the facts and conditions are such as to authorize such  action, either to assign new base   in support of or to withdraw pending unapproved indemnity school land  selections in support of which mineral school-section lands have been  tendered as base.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lands excluded from grant. (1) Subsection (c) of section 1 of  the Act of January 25, 1927, provides:</p><p class="depth0">That any lands included within the limits of existing reservations  of or by the United States, or specifically reserved for waterpower  purposes, or included in any pending suit or proceedings in the courts  of the United States, or subject to or included in any valid  application, claim, or right initiated or held under any of the existing  laws of the United States, unless or until such application, claim, or  right is relinquished or canceled, and all lands in the Territory of  Alaska are excluded from the provisions of this act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> School-section lands included within the limits of existing  reservations of or by the United States, specifically reserved for  waterpower purposes, or included in any suit or proceedings in the  courts of the United States, prior to January 25, 1927, and all lands in  Alaska are excluded from the provisions of the Act. (Sec. 2623.4)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The words existing reservation as used in subsection (c) are  construed generally and subject to specific determination in particular  cases if the need therefor shall arise, as including Indian and military  reservations, naval and petroleum reserves, national parks, national  forests, stock driveways, reservations established under the Act of June  25, 1910 (36 Stat. 847; 43 U.S.C. 141-143), as amended by the Act of  August 24, 1912 (37 Stat. 497; 43 U.S.C. 142), and all forms of  Executive withdrawal recognized and construed by the Department of the  Interior as reservations, existent prior to January 25, 1927.</p>
