                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each necked-down tank shall be uniformly heat treated. Heat  treatment shall consist of annealing or normalizing and tempering for  Class I, Class II and Class III steel or oil quenching and tempering for  Class III steel. Tempering temperatures shall not be less than 1000 F.  Heat treatment of alternate steels shall be approved. All scale shall be  removed from outside of tank to an extent sufficient to allow proper  inspection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To check uniformity of heat treatment, Brinnel hardness tests  shall be made at 18 inch intervals on the entire longitudinal axis. The  hardness shall not vary more than 35 points in the length of the tank.  No hardness tests need be taken within 12 inches from point of head to  shell tangency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A magnetic particle inspection shall be performed after heat  treatment on all tanks subjected to a quench and temper treatment to  detect the presence of quenching cracks. Cracks shall be removed to  sound metal by grinding and the surface exposed shall be blended  smoothly into the surrounding area. A wall thickness check shall then be  made of the affected area by ultrasonic equipment or other suitable  means acceptable to the inspector and if the remaining wall thickness is  less than the minimum recorded thickness as determined by Sec. 179.500- 4(b) it shall be used for making the calculation prescribed in paragraph  (b) of this section.</p>
