                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligible applicants. Eligible applicants are Guam, the Virgin  Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and  the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Threshold requirements. HUD shall review each grantee's progress  on outstanding grants made under this section based on the grantee's  performance report, the timeliness of close-outs and compliance with  fund management requirements and pertinent regulations, taking into  consideration the size of the grant and the degree and complexity of the  program. If HUD determines upon such review that the applicant does not  have the capacity effectively to administer a new grant, or a portion of  a new grant, in addition to grants currently under administration, the  applicant shall not be invited to submit an application for the current  year's funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Previous audit findings and outstanding monetary obligations.  HUD shall not accept for review an application from an applicant that  has either an outstanding audit finding for any HUD program, or an  outstanding monetary obligation to HUD that is in arrears, or for which  a repayment schedule has not been established and agreed to. The Field  Office manager may waive this restriction if he or she finds that the  applicant has made a good faith effort to clear the audit. In no  instance, however, shall a waiver be provided when funds are due HUD,  unless a satisfactory arrangement for repayment of the debt has been  made and payments are current.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria for funding. The Secretary shall establish, for each  fiscal year, an amount for which eligible applicants may apply. Grant  amounts will be based on population of the applicant and its performance  in previous years. In determining performance, HUD will consider program  achievements and the applicant's effectiveness in using program funds.  Effectiveness in using program funds shall be measured by reviewing  audit, monitoring and performance reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application and performance reporting. Application and  performance reporting requirements are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants must submit applications within 90 days of the  notification of the grant amount from HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicants shall prepare and publish or post a proposed  application in accordance with the citizen participation requirements of  paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicants shall submit to HUD a final application containing  its community development objectives and activities. This application  shall be submitted to the appropriate HUD office, together with the  required certifications, in a form prescribed by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Grant recipients must submit to HUD an annual performance report  on progress achieved on previously funded grants. Grant recipients must  submit the report at a time and in a format determined by HUD. The  report should be   made available to citizens in accordance with the requirements of  paragraph (h)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Costs incurred by the applicant. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other  provision of this part, HUD will not reimburse or recognize any costs  incurred by an applicant before submission of the application to HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normally, HUD will not reimburse or recognize costs incurred  before HUD approval of the application for funding. However, under  unusual circumstances, the Field office manager may consider and  conditionally approve written requests to recognize and reimburse costs  that will be incurred after submission of the application but before it  is approved where failure to do so would impose undue or unreasonable  hardship on the applicant. Conditional approvals will be made only  before the costs are incurred and where the conditions for release of  funds have been met in accordance with 24 CFR 58.22, and with the  understanding that HUD has no obligation whatsoever to approve the  application or to reimburse the applicant should the application be  disapproved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Criteria for conditional approval. HUD may approve a grant  subject to specified conditions. In any such case, the obligation and  utilization of funds may be restricted. The reasons for the conditional  approval and the actions necessary to remove the conditions shall be  specified. Failure of the applicant to satisfy the conditions may result  in a termination of the grant. A conditional approval may be granted  under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When local environmental reviews under 24 CFR part 58 have not  yet been completed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To ensure that actual provision of other resources required to  complete the proposed activities will be available within a reasonable  period of time;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To ensure that a project can be completed within its estimated  costs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where the grantee is required to satisfy an outstanding debt due  to HUD under a payment plan executed between the grantee and the  Department;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Pending resolution of problems related to specific projects or  the capability of the grantee to obtain resources needed to carry out,  operate or maintain the project; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pending approval of site and neighborhood standards for proposed  housing projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Citizen participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant shall provide for  appropriate citizen participation in the application and amendment  process. The applicant must, at least, do each of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Furnish citizens with information concerning the amount of funds  available for community development and housing activities and the range  of activities that may be undertaken, including the estimated amount  proposed to be used for activities that will benefit persons of low and  moderate income, and the plans of the grantee for minimizing  displacement of persons as a result of activities assisted with such  funds and to assist persons actually displaced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Hold one or more public hearings (scheduled at convenient times  and places) to obtain the views of citizens on community development and  housing needs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Develop and publish or post the community development  statement in such a manner as to afford affected citizens an opportunity  to examine its contents and to submit comments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Afford citizens an opportunity to review and comment on the  applicant's performance under any community development block grant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before submitting the application to HUD, the applicant shall  certify that it has:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Met the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Considered any comments and views expressed by citizens; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If appropriate, modified the application accordingly and made  the modified application available to citizens.  [50 FR 37526, Sept. 16, 1985, as amended at 60 FR 56914, Nov. 9, 1995;  61 FR 32269, June 21, 1996]</p><p class="depth4">Effective Date Note: At 61 FR 32269, June 21, 1996, Sec.   570.405(e)(4) was revised. This section contains information collection  and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until  approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
