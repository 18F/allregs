                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluation. Evaluation of each package design under normal  conditions of transport must include a determination of the effect on  that design of the conditions and tests specified in this section.  Separate specimens may be used for the free drop test, the compression  test, and the penetration test, if each specimen is subjected to the  water spray test before being subjected to any of the other tests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial conditions. With respect to the initial conditions for  the tests in this section, the demonstration of compliance with the  requirements of this part must be based on the ambient temperature  preceding and following the tests remaining constant at that value  between -29 [deg]C (-20 [deg]F) and +38 [deg]C (+100 [deg]F) which is  most unfavorable for the feature under consideration. The initial  internal pressure within the containment system must be considered to be  the maximum normal operating pressure, unless a lower internal pressure  consistent with the ambient temperature considered to precede and follow  the tests is more unfavorable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conditions and tests--(1) Heat. An ambient temperature of 38  [deg]C (100 [deg]F) in still air, and insolation according to the  following table:</p><p class="depth0">Insolation Data ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total insolation for a 12-</p><p class="depth0">Form and location of surface           hour period (g cal/cm\2\ ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Flat surfaces transported horizontally:</p><p class="depth0">Base..................................  None</p><p class="depth0">Other surfaces........................  800 Flat surfaces not transported horizontally  200 Curved surfaces...........................  400 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cold. An ambient temperature of -40 [deg]C (-40 [deg]F) in still  air and shade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduced external pressure. An external pressure of 25 kPa (3.5  lbf/in\2\) absolute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Increased external pressure. An external pressure of 140 kPa (20  lbf/in\2\) absolute.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Vibration. Vibration normally incident to transport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Water spray. A water spray that simulates exposure to rainfall  of approximately 5 cm/h (2 in/h) for at least 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Free drop. Between 1.5 and 2.5 hours after the conclusion of the  water spray test, a free drop through the distance specified below onto  a flat, essentially unyielding, horizontal surface, striking the surface  in a position for which maximum damage is expected.</p><p class="depth0">Criteria for Free Drop Test (Weight/Distance) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Package weight                          Free drop -------------------------------------------------------     distance</p><p class="depth0">-----------------</p><p class="depth0">Kilograms                    (Pounds)        Meters   (Feet) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Less than 5,000..................  (Less than 11,000).      1.2      (4) 5,000 to 10,000..................  (11,000 to 22,000).      0.9      (3) 10,000 to 15,000.................  (22,000 to 33,100).      0.6      (2) More than 15,000.................  (More than 33,100).      0.3      (1) ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Corner drop. A free drop onto each corner of the package in  succession, or in the case of a cylindrical package onto each quarter of  each rim, from a height of 0.3 m (1 ft) onto a flat, essentially  unyielding, horizontal surface. This test applies only to fiberboard,  wood, or fissile material rectangular packages not exceeding 50 kg (110  lbs) and fiberboard, wood, or fissile material cylindrical packages not  exceeding 100 kg (220 lbs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Compression. For packages weighing up to 5000 kg (11,000 lbs),  the package must be subjected, for a period of 24 hours, to a  compressive load applied uniformly to the top and bottom of the package  in the position in which the package would normally be transported. The  compressive load must be the greater of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The equivalent of 5 times the weight of the package; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The equivalent of 13 kPa (2 lbf/in\2\) multiplied by the  vertically projected area of the package.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Penetration. Impact of the hemispherical end of a vertical  steel cylinder of 3.2 cm (1.25 in) diameter and 6 kg (13 lbs) mass,  dropped from a height of 1 m (40 in) onto the exposed surface of the  package that is expected to be most vulnerable to puncture. The long  axis of the cylinder must be perpendicular to the package surface.</p>
