                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Unsecured extensions of credit to a single counterparty. A Bank  shall not extend unsecured credit to any single counterparty (other than  a GSE) in an amount that would exceed the limits of this paragraph. A  Bank shall not extend unsecured credit to a GSE in an amount that would  exceed the limits set forth in paragraph (c) of this section. If a  third-party provides an irrevocable, unconditional guarantee of  repayment of a credit (or any part thereof), the third-party guarantor  shall be considered the counterparty for purposes of calculating and  applying the unsecured credit limits of this section with respect the to  guaranteed portion of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Term limits. All unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank to a  single counterparty that arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance sheet  and derivative transactions (but excluding   the amount of sales of federal funds with a maturity of one day or less  and sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract) shall not  exceed the product of the maximum capital exposure limit applicable to  such counterparty, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of  this section and Table 4 of this part, multiplied by the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Bank's total capital; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The counterparty's Tier 1 capital, or if Tier 1 capital is not  available, total capital (as defined by the counterparty's principal  regulator) or some similar comparable measure identified by the Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overall limits including sales of overnight federal funds. All  unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank to a single counterparty that  arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance sheet and derivative  transactions, including the amounts of sales of federal funds with a  maturity of one day or less and sales of federal funds subject to a  continuing contract, shall not exceed twice the limit calculated  pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this chapter or are otherwise  excluded from the prohibition against investments in whole mortgages or  whole loan or interests in such mortgages or loans by  Sec. 956.3(a)(4)(iii) of this chapter shall be calculated based on the  Bank's total capital and the credit rating assigned to the particular  obligation as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this  section. If a Bank owns series or classes of obligations issued by a  particular state, local or tribal government unit or agency or has  extended other forms of unsecured credit to such entity falling into  different rating categories, the total amount of unsecured credit  extended by the Bank to that government unit or agency shall not exceed  the term limit associated with the highest-rated obligation issued by  the entity and actually purchased by the Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(iii)</em>  of this section, the applicable maximum capital exposure limits are  assigned to each counterparty based upon the long-term credit rating of  the counterparty, as determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of  this section, and are provided in the following Table 4 of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Table 4--Maximum Limits on Unsecured Extensions of Credit to a Single</p><p class="depth0">Counterparty by Counterparty Long-Term Credit Rating Category ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum</p><p class="depth0">capital</p><p class="depth0">Long-term credit rating of counterparty category      exposure limit</p><p class="depth0">(in percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Highest Investment Grade................................              15 Second Highest Investment Grade.........................              14 Third Highest Investment Grade..........................               9 Fourth Highest Investment Grade.........................               3 Below Investment Grade or Other.........................               1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a counterparty does not have a long-term credit rating but  has received a short-term credit rating from an NRSRO, the maximum  capital exposure limit applicable to that counterparty shall be based  upon the short-term credit rating, as determined in accordance with  paragraph (a)(5) of this section, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The highest short-term investment grade credit rating shall  correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of  this part for the third highest long-term investment grade rating;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The second highest short-term investment grade rating shall  correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of  this part for the fourth highest long-term investment grade rating; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The third highest short-term investment grade rating shall  correspond to the maximum capital exposure limit provided in Table 4 of  this part for the fourth highest long-term investment grade rating.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a specific debt obligation issued by a counterparty  receives a credit rating from an NRSRO that is lower than the  counterparty's long-term credit rating, the total amount of   the lower-rated obligation held by the Bank may not exceed a sub-limit  calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except  that the Bank shall use the credit rating associated with the specific  obligation to determine the applicable maximum capital exposure limit.  For purposes of this paragraph, the credit rating of the debt obligation  shall be determined in accordance with paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Bank determination of applicable credit ratings. The following  criteria shall be applied to determine a counterparty's credit rating:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The counterparty's most recent credit rating from a given NRSRO  shall be considered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If only one NRSRO has rated the counterparty, that NRSRO's  rating shall be used. If a counterparty has received credit ratings from  more than one NRSRO, the lowest credit rating from among those NRSROs  shall be used;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Where a credit rating has a modifier, the credit rating is  deemed to be the credit rating without the modifier;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a counterparty is placed on a credit watch for a potential  downgrade by an NRSRO, the credit rating from that NRSRO at the next  lower grade shall be used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If a counterparty is not rated by an NRSRO, the Bank shall  determine the applicable credit rating by using credit rating standards  available from an NRSRO or other similar standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unsecured extensions of credit to affiliated counterparties--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  In general. The total amount of unsecured extensions of credit by a Bank  to a group of affiliated counterparties that arise from the Bank's on-  and off-balance sheet and derivative transactions, including sales of  federal funds with a maturity of one day or less and sales of federal  funds subject to a continuing contract, shall not exceed thirty percent  of the Bank's total capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relation to individual limits. The aggregate limits calculated  under this paragraph shall apply in addition to the limits on extensions  of unsecured credit to a single counterparty imposed by paragraph (a) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special limits for GSEs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Unsecured extensions of  credit by a Bank to a GSE that arise from the Bank's on- and off-balance  sheet and derivative transactions, including from the purchase of any  subordinated debt subject to the sub-limit set forth in paragraph (c)(2)  of this section, from any sales of federal funds with a maturity of one  day or less and from sales of federal funds subject to a continuing  contract, shall not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Bank's total capital; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The GSE's total capital (as defined by the GSE's principal  regulator) or some similar comparable measure identified by the Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sub-limit for subordinated debt. The maximum amount of  subordinated debt issued by a GSE and held by a Bank shall not exceed  the term limit calculated under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, except  that a Bank shall use the credit rating of the GSE's subordinated debt  to determine the applicable maximum capital exposure limit. The credit  rating of the subordinated debt shall be determined in accordance with  paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limits applying to a GSE after a downgrade. If any NRSRO assigns  a credit rating to any senior debt obligation issued (or to be issued)  by a GSE that is below the highest investment grade or downgrades, or  places on a credit watch for a potential downgrade of the credit rating  on any senior unsecured obligation issued by a GSE to below the highest  investment grade, the special limits on unsecured extensions of credit  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section shall cease to apply, and  instead, the Bank shall calculate the maximum amount of its unsecured  extensions of credit to that GSE in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1)  and (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Extensions of unsecured credit to other Banks. The limits of  this section do not apply to unsecured credit extended by one Bank to  another Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Extensions of unsecured credit after downgrade or placement on  credit watch. If an NRSRO downgrades the credit rating applicable to any  counterparty or places any counterparty on a credit watch for a  potential downgrade, a Bank need not unwind or liquidate any existing  transaction or position with   that counterparty that complied with the limits of this section at the  time it was entered. In such a case, however, a Bank may extend any  additional unsecured credit to such a counterparty only in compliance  with the limitations that are calculated using the lower maximum  exposure limits. For the purposes of this section, the renewal of an  existing unsecured extension of credit, including any decision not to  terminate any sales of federal funds subject to a continuing contract,  shall be considered an additional extension of unsecured credit that can  be undertaken only in accordance with the lower limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Total unsecured extensions of  credit. Each Bank shall report monthly to the Finance Board the amount  of the Bank's total unsecured extensions of credit arising from on- and  off-balance sheet and derivative transactions to any single counterparty  or group of affiliated counterparties that exceeds 5 percent of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Bank's total capital; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The counterparty's, or affiliated counterparties' combined,  Tier 1 capital, or if Tier 1 capital is not available, total capital (as  defined by each counterparty's principal regulator) or some similar  comparable measure identified by the Bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Total secured and unsecured extensions of credit. Each Bank  shall report monthly to the Finance Board the amount of the Bank's total  secured and unsecured extensions of credit arising from on- and off- balance sheet and derivative transactions to any single counterparty or  group of affiliated counterparties that exceeds 5 percent of the Bank's  total assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Extensions of credit in excess of limits. A Bank shall report  promptly to the Finance Board any extensions of unsecured credit that  exceeds any limit set forth in paragraphs (a), (b) or (c) of this  section. In making this report, a Bank shall provide the name of the  counterparty or group of affiliated counterparties to which the excess  unsecured credit has been extended, the dollar amount of the applicable  limit which has been exceeded, the dollar amount by which the Bank's  extension of unsecured credit exceeds such limit, the dates for which  the Bank was not in compliance with the limit, and, if applicable, a  brief explanation of any extenuating circumstances which caused the  limit to be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Measurement of unsecured extensions of credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  For purposes of this section, unsecured extensions of credit will be  measured as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For on-balance sheet transactions, an amount equal to the sum of  the book value of the item plus net payments due the Bank;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For off-balance sheet transactions, an amount equal to the  credit equivalent amount of such item, calculated in accordance with  Sec. 932.4(f) of this part; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For derivative transactions, an amount equal to the sum of the  current and potential future credit exposures for the derivative  contract, where those values are calculated in accordance with  Sec. Sec. 932.4(g) or 932.4(h) of this part, as applicable, less the  amount of any collateral that is held in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 932.4(e)(2)(ii)(B) of this part against the credit  exposure from the derivative contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this chapter) purchased by a Bank shall be considered an  unsecured extension of credit for the purposes of this section, except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any amount owed the Bank against which the Bank holds collateral  in accordance with Sec. 932.4(e)(2)(ii)(B) of this part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any amount which the Finance Board has determined on a case-by- case basis shall not be considered an unsecured extension of credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Obligations of the United States. Obligations of, or guaranteed  by, the United States are not subject to the requirements of this  section.  [66728, Dec. 27, 2002]</p>
