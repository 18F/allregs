                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The hydrostatic-test pressure must be at least one and three- tenths (1.30) times the maximum allowable working pressure stamped on  the pressure vessel, multiplied by the ratio of the stress value ``S''  at the test temperature to the stress value ``S'' at the design  temperature for the materials of which the pressure vessel is  constructed. The values for ``S'' shall be taken from tables UCS 23, UNF  23, UHA 23, or UHT 23 of section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure  Vessel Code (incorporated by reference, see 46 CFR 54.01-1). The value  of ``S'' at test temperature shall be that taken for the material of the  tabulated value of temperature closest to the test temperature. The  value of ``S'' at design temperature shall be as interpolated from the  appropriate table. No ratio less than one shall be used. The stress  resulting from the hydrostatic test shall not exceed 90 percent of the  yield stress of the material at the test temperature. External loadings  which will exist in supporting structure during the hydrostatic test  should be considered. The design shall consider the combined stress  during hydrostatic testing due to pressure and the support reactions.  This stress shall not exceed 90 percent of the yield stress of the  material at the test temperature. In addition the adequacy of the  supporting structure during hydrostatic testing should be considered in  the design.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The hydrostatic test pressure shall be applied for a sufficient  period of time to permit a thorough examination of all joints and  connections. The test shall not be conducted until the vessel and liquid  are at approximately the same temperature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Defects detected during the hydrostatic test or subsequent  examination shall be completely removed and then inspected. Provided the  marine inspector gives his approval, they may then be repaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vessels requiring stress relieving shall be stress relieved  after any welding repairs have been made. (See UW-40 of section VIII of  the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> After repairs have been made the vessel shall again be tested in  the regular way, and if it passes the test, the marine inspector may  accept it. If it does not pass the test, the marine inspector can order  supplementary repairs, or, if in his judgment the vessel is not suitable  for service, he may permanently reject it.
