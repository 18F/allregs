                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> WS and RCD loans. WS and RCD loans may be used for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Water development, storage, treatment and conveyance to farms for irrigation and other farm use, including farmstead, livestock, orchard, and crop spraying.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drainage systems and facilities in farm areas to sustain agricultural production or protect farmers and rural residents from water damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agricultural water management practices for annual streamflow stabilization, recharging ground water reservoirs, and conserving water supplies by management and control of vegetation along waterways and in drainage basins.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Soil conservation and water control facilities such as dikes, terraces, detention reservoirs, stream channels, ditches, and other special land treatment and stabilization measures needed to protect farms and rural residents from water damage, provided such facilities cannot be installed or improved

under, or will not conflict with, other public programs such as those administered by the Corps of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special treatment measures or equipment primarily, though not exclusively, for flood prevention such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilities and equipment for fire prevention and control.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tree planting and establishment of other vegetative cover for stabilizing critical runoff and sediment-producing areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Structural and vegetative measures to stabilize stream channels and gullies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Basic farm conservation practices to control runoff, erosion, and sedimentation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Installing, repairing, and improving water storage facilities, including outlets for immediate and future domestic, municipal and industrial water supply and water quality management, and conveying water to treatment facilities or distribution systems. When payment of loans for such facilities are primarily dependent upon revenues from use of water stored the loan approval official must determine the adequacy of facility for use of the water before a loan is closed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Public water based recreation and fish and wildlife developer loans will only be made to public bodies for the local share of cost for such developments for which NRCS is providing technical or financial assistance from WS or RCD funds. Loans will not be made for developments larger or more elaborate than that which is included in the WS or RCD plan. Loans may include funds for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Construction of necessary water resource improvements such as storage capacity in multipurpose and single purpose reservoirs, water level control structures in reservoirs and streams, and stream channel improvements necessary for the development of the facilities. This may include practices for improvement of fish and wildlife habitat and environment and related areas and facilities for proper protection and management of the development.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Essential developments, improvements, equipment and facilities for access, public health and safety, and efficient operation management and maintenance; such as energy utilities, water supply and waste disposal systems, maintenance buildings, fences, cattle guards, roads and trails, parking, picnicking, camping, beaches, playgrounds, and related shelters and equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special areas and structures such as forest and other vegetative cover, marshes, pits, shelters and fish ladders to provide protected natural spawning, breeding, nesting, and feeding for fish and wildlife.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Soil and water management for agriculture-related pollutant control. Measures to reduce agriculture-related pollutants that adversely affect the community and the general public. Measures may include, but are not limited to, holding ponds, debris basins, diversions, terraces, and community distribution systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Acquiring fee simple title to lands or perpetual easements, or rights-of-way for sites for works of improvement or project measures and related costs for removal, relocation, or replacement of existing improvements including relocation payments for displaced persons, business enterprises and facilities, and other related purposes. Funds for land acquisition will be limited to costs necessary for WS works of improvement or RCD measures. Final construction plans will indicate minimum essential lands and rights-of-way to be acquired. In some cases, sponsoring local organizations may need to acquire lands in excess of actual needs when it is expedient for planned development. If the Rural Development State Director determines that the acquisition of excess land is necessary or expedient for the orderly development of a WS works of improvement, or RCD measure, he may authorize the action subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The applicant must agree to sell excess land as soon as practicable and apply the proceeds, together with any income from excess land, on the debt to RUS.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The applicant must furnish legal evidence of authority to acquire additional land and dispose of it as agreed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Evidence must be provided to justify acquisition of additional land.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Easements for land or water resource protection structures must be perpetual and must not include clauses

that terminate the easement with the dissolution or abandonment of the applicant organization. Loan funds will not be used for an easement that deviates in any way from that provided in the standard NRCS form unless modifications of it are approved by both NRCS and RUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Acquisition of water supply or water right by purchase or by appropriation under local, State, and Federal laws. The loan may include funds for the purchase of land on which the water supply or water right is presently being used when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The water supply or water right cannot be purchased without the land; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The value of the land is not the major portion of the cost; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any excess land thus acquired will be sold as soon as possible and the proceeds applied on the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Purchase of equipment and machinery necessary for development and operation of planned WS works of improvement or RCD measures or projects including:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Special-purpose equipment. Purchase or rent special-purpose equipment to install or maintain any community facility in categories in paragraph (a)(11) of this section or to establish on farms soil and water conservation measures such as terraces, ponds, land leveling for irrigation or drainage, subsoiling, seeding, tree planting, and removal of brush, scattered trees, and stumps, provided:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such equipment is not otherwise available when needed.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> There is sufficient need and local demand to justify ownership or rental.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Rates to be charged include, among other things, an allowance for depreciation, obsolescence, and replacement based upon the recommendations of the equipment manufacturer or the experience of contractors engaged in providing services for similar types of work.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Forestry equipment and services.
