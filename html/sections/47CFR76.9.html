                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any materials filed in the course of a proceeding under this provision may be designated as proprietary by that party if the party believes in good faith that the materials fall within an exemption to disclosure contained in the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. 552(b). Any party asserting confidentiality for such materials shall so indicate by clearly marking each page, or portion thereof, for which a proprietary designation is claimed. If a proprietary designation is challenged, the party claiming confidentiality will have the burden of demonstrating, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the material designated as proprietary falls under the standards for nondisclosure enunciated in FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submissions containing information claimed to be proprietary under this section shall be submitted to the Commission in confidence pursuant to the requirements of Sec.  0.459 of this chapter and clearly marked ``Not for Public Inspection.'' An edited version removing all proprietary data shall be filed with the Commission for inclusion in the public file within five (5) days from the date the unedited reply is submitted, and shall be served on the opposing parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, materials marked as proprietary may be disclosed solely to the following persons, only for use in the proceeding, and only to the extent necessary to assist in the prosecution or defense of the case:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Counsel of record representing the parties in the proceeding and any support personnel employed by such attorneys;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Officers or employees of the parties in the proceeding who are named by another party as being directly involved in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iii)</em> Consultants or expert witnesses retained by the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(iv)</em> The Commission and its staff; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(v)</em> Court reporters and stenographers in accordance with the terms and conditions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Commission will entertain, subject to a proper showing, a party's request to further restrict access to proprietary information as specified by the party. The other parties will have an opportunity to respond to such requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The persons designated in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section shall not disclose information designated as proprietary to any person who is not authorized under this section to receive such information, and shall not use the information in any activity or function other than the prosecution or defense of the case before the Commission. Each individual who is provided access to the information by the opposing party shall sign a notarized statement affirmatively stating, or shall certify under penalty of perjury, that the individual has personally reviewed the Commission's rules and understands the limitations they impose on the signing party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No copies of materials marked proprietary may be made except copies to be used by persons designated in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. Each party shall maintain a log recording the number of copies made of all proprietary material and the persons to whom the copies have been provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Upon termination of the complaint proceeding, including all appeals and petitions, all originals and reproductions of any proprietary materials, along with the log recording persons who received copies of such materials, shall be provided to the producing party. In addition, upon final termination of the proceeding, any notes or other work product derived in whole or in part from the proprietary materials of an opposing or third party shall be destroyed.
