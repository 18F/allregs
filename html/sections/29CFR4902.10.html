                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Exemption. Under the authority granted by 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), PBGC hereby exempts the system of records entitled ``PBGC-12, Personnel Security Investigation Records--PBGC'' from the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 552a (c)(3), (d), (e)(1), (e)(4)(G), (H), and (I), and (f), to the extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to PBGC under an express promise of confidentiality or, before September 27, 1975, under an implied promise of confidentiality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasons for Exemption. The reasons for asserting this exemption are to insure the gaining of information essential to determining suitability and fitness for PBGC employment or for work for PBGC as a contractor or as an employee of a contractor, access to information, and security clearances, to insure that full and candid disclosures are obtained in making such determinations, to prevent subjects of such determinations from thwarting the completion of such determinations, and to avoid revealing the identities of persons who furnish information to PBGC in confidence.
