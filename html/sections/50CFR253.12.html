An application fee of 0.5 percent of the dollar  amount of an application is due when the application is formally  accepted. Upon submission, 50 percent of the application fee, known as  the ``filing fee,'' is non-refundable; the remainder, known as the  ``commitment fee,'' may be refunded if the Program declines an  application or an applicant withdraws its application before the Program  issues an AIP letter, as described in Sec. 253.13(e). The Program will  not issue an AIP letter if any of the application fee remains unpaid. No  portion of the application fee shall be refunded once the Program issues  an AIP letter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> False statement. A false statement on an application is grounds  for denial or termination of funds, grounds for possible punishment by a  fine or imprisonment as provided in 18 U.S.C. 1001 and an event of a  security default.</p>
