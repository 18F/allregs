                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise exempted under the  provisions of Sec. 86.1801-12(j) or (k), CO2 fleet average  exhaust emission standards of this subpart apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 2012 and later model year passenger automobiles and light  trucks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Heavy-duty vehicles subject to standards under 40 CFR 1037.104.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Vehicles imported by ICIs as defined in 40 CFR 85.1502.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The terms ``passenger automobile'' and ``light truck'' as used  in this section have the meanings as defined in Sec. 86.1818-12.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Useful life requirements. Full useful life requirements for  CO2 standards are defined in Sec. 86.1818-12. There is not an  intermediate useful life standard for CO2 emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Altitude. Altitude requirements for CO2 standards are  provided in Sec. 86.1810-09(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Small volume manufacturer certification procedures.  Certification procedures for small volume manufacturers are provided in  Sec. 86.1838. Small businesses meeting certain criteria may be exempted  from the greenhouse gas emission standards in Sec. 86.1818 according to  the provisions of Sec. 86.1801-12(j) or (k).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>. The fleet average CO2  standards applicable in a given model year are calculated separately for  passenger automobiles and light trucks for each manufacturer and each  model year according to the provisions in Sec. 86.1818-12. Each  manufacturer must comply with the applicable CO2 fleet  average standard on a production-weighted average basis, for each  separate averaging set, at the end of each model year, using the  procedure described in paragraph (j) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In-use CO2 standards. In-use CO2 exhaust emission  standards applicable to each model type are provided in Sec. 86.1818- 12(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Durability procedures and method of determining deterioration  factors (DFs). Deterioration factors for CO2 exhaust emission  standards are provided in Sec. 86.1823-08(m).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Vehicle test procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test procedures for  demonstrating compliance with CO2 exhaust emission standards  are contained in subpart B of this part and subpart B of part 600 of  this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing of all passenger automobiles and light trucks to  determine compliance with CO2 exhaust emission standards set  forth in this section must be on a loaded vehicle weight (LVW) basis, as  defined in Sec. 86.1803-01.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Testing for the purpose of providing certification data is  required only at low altitude conditions. If hardware and software  emission control strategies used during low altitude condition testing  are not used similarly across all altitudes for in-use operation, the  manufacturer must include a statement in the application for  certification, in accordance with Sec. 86.1844-01(d)(11) and  Sec. 86.1810-09(f), stating what the different strategies are and why  they are used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Calculating the fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers must compute separate production-weighted fleet  average carbon-related exhaust emissions at the end of the model year  for passenger automobiles and light trucks, using actual production,  where production means vehicles produced and delivered for sale, and  certifying model types to standards as defined in Sec. 86.1818-12. The  model type carbon-related exhaust emission results determined according  to 40 CFR part 600 subpart F (in units of grams per mile rounded to the  nearest whole number) become the certification standard for each model  type.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers must separately calculate production-weighted  fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions levels for the following  averaging sets according to the provisions of part 600 subpart F of this  chapter:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Passenger automobiles subject to the fleet average  CO2 standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(c)(2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Light trucks subject to the fleet average CO2  standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(c)(3);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Passenger automobiles subject to the Temporary Leadtime  Allowance Alternative Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(e), if  applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Light trucks subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance  Alternative Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(e), if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Certification compliance and enforcement requirements for CO2  exhaust emission standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance and   enforcement requirements are provided in this section and Sec. 86.1848- 10(c)(9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certificate issued for each test group requires all model  types within that test group to meet the in-use emission standards to  which each model type is certified as outlined in Sec. 86.1818-12(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each manufacturer must comply with the applicable CO2  fleet average standard on a production-weighted average basis, at the  end of each model year, using the procedure described in paragraph (i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each manufacturer must comply on an annual basis with the fleet  average standards as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacturers must report in their annual reports to the Agency  that they met the relevant corporate average standard by showing that  their production-weighted average CO2 emission levels of  passenger automobiles, light trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles, as  applicable, are at or below the applicable fleet average standards; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the production-weighted average is above the applicable  fleet average standard, manufacturers must obtain and apply sufficient  CO2 credits as authorized under paragraph (k)(8) of this  section. A manufacturer must show that they have offset any exceedence  of the corporate average standard via the use of credits. Manufacturers  must also include their credit balances or deficits in their annual  report to the Agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a manufacturer fails to meet the corporate average  CO2 standard for four consecutive years, the vehicles causing  the corporate average exceedence will be considered not covered by the  certificate of conformity (see paragraph (k)(8) of this section). A  manufacturer will be subject to penalties on an individual-vehicle basis  for sale of vehicles not covered by a certificate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> EPA will review each manufacturer's production to designate the  vehicles that caused the exceedence of the corporate average standard.  EPA will designate as nonconforming those vehicles in test groups with  the highest certification emission values first, continuing until  reaching a number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of  noncomplying vehicles as determined in paragraph (k)(8) of this section.  In a group where only a portion of vehicles would be deemed  nonconforming, EPA will determine the actual nonconforming vehicles by  counting backwards from the last vehicle produced in that test group.  Manufacturers will be liable for penalties for each vehicle sold that is  not covered by a certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Requirements for the CO2 averaging, banking and trading (ABT)  program. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer whose CO2 fleet average emissions  exceed the applicable standard must complete the calculation in  paragraph (k)(4) of this section to determine the size of its  CO2 deficit. A manufacturer whose CO2 fleet  average emissions are less than the applicable standard must complete  the calculation in paragraph (k)(4) of this section to generate  CO2 credits. In either case, the number of credits or debits  must be rounded to the nearest whole number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are no property rights associated with CO2  credits generated under this subpart. Credits are a limited  authorization to emit the designated amount of emissions. Nothing in  this part or any other provision of law should be construed to limit  EPA's authority to terminate or limit this authorization through a  rulemaking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each manufacturer must comply with the reporting and  recordkeeping requirements of paragraph (l) of this section for  CO2 credits, including early credits. The averaging, banking  and trading program is enforceable through the certificate of conformity  that allows the manufacturer to introduce any regulated vehicles into  commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credits are earned on the last day of the model year.  Manufacturers must calculate, for a given model year and separately for  passenger automobiles, light trucks, and heavy-duty vehicles (as  specified in 40 CFR 1037.104), the number of credits or debits it has  generated according to the following equation rounded to the nearest  megagram:  CO2 Credits or Debits (Mg) = [(CO2 Standard-- Manufacturer's Production-Weighted Fleet Average CO2  Emissions) x (Total Number of Vehicles Produced) x (Vehicle Lifetime  Miles)] / 1,000,000     Where:  CO2 Standard = the applicable standard for the model year as</p><p class="depth3">determined by Sec. 86.1818-12; Manufacturer's Production-Weighted Fleet Average CO2</p><p class="depth3">Emissions = average calculated according to paragraph (i) of</p><p class="depth3">this section; Total Number of Vehicles Produced = The number of vehicles domestically</p><p class="depth3">produced plus those imported as defined in Sec. 600.511-80 of</p><p class="depth3">this chapter; and Vehicle Lifetime Miles is 195,264 for passenger automobiles and 225,865</p><p class="depth3">for light trucks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total credits or debits generated in a model year, maintained  and reported separately for passenger automobiles and light trucks,  shall be the sum of the credits or debits calculated in paragraph (k)(4)  of this section and any of the following credits, if applicable, minus  any N2O and/or CH4 CO2-equivalent  debits calculated according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1818-12(f)(4):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Air conditioning leakage credits earned according to the  provisions of Sec. 86.1867-12(b);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air conditioning efficiency credits earned according to the  provisions of Sec. 86.1868-12(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Off-cycle technology credits earned according to the  provisions of Sec. 86.1869-12(d).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Full size pickup truck credits earned according to the  provisions of Sec. 86.1870-12(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> N2O and/or CH4 CO2-equivalent  debits accumulated according to the provisions of Sec. 86.1818-12(f)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The expiration date of unused CO2 credits is based on  the model year in which the credits are earned, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unused CO2 credits from the 2009 model year shall  retain their full value through the 2014 model year. Credits from the  2009 model year that remain at the end of the 2014 model year shall  expire.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unused CO2 credits from the 2010 through 2015 model  years shall retain their full value through the 2021 model year. Credits  remaining from these model years at the end of the 2021 model year shall  expire.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unused CO2 credits from the 2016 and later model  years shall retain their full value through the five subsequent model  years after the model year in which they were generated. Credits  remaining at the end of the fifth model year after the model year in  which they were generated shall expire.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Credits may be used as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Credits generated and calculated according to the method in  paragraphs (k)(4) and (5) of this section may not be used to offset  deficits other than those deficits accrued with respect to the standard  in Sec. 86.1818. Credits may be banked and used in a future model year  in which a manufacturer's average CO2 level exceeds the  applicable standard. Credits may be transferred between the passenger  automobile and light truck fleets of a given manufacturer. Credits may  also be traded to another manufacturer according to the provisions in  paragraph (k)(8) of this section. Before trading or carrying over  credits to the next model year, a manufacturer must apply available  credits to offset any deficit, where the deadline to offset that credit  deficit has not yet passed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The use of credits shall not change Selective Enforcement  Auditing or in-use testing failures from a failure to a non-failure. The  enforcement of the averaging standard occurs through the vehicle's  certificate of conformity. A manufacturer's certificate of conformity is  conditioned upon compliance with the averaging provisions. The  certificate will be void ab initio if a manufacturer fails to meet the  corporate average standard and does not obtain appropriate credits to  cover its shortfalls in that model year or subsequent model years (see  deficit carry-forward provisions in paragraph (k)(8) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Special provisions for manufacturers using the Temporary  Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Credits generated by  vehicles subject to the fleet average CO2 standards specified  in Sec. 86.1818-12(c) may only be used to offset a deficit generated by  vehicles subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative  Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(e).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Credits generated by a passenger automobile or light truck  averaging set subject to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative  Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(e)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section  may be used to offset a deficit generated by an averaging set subject   to the Temporary Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards through the  2015 model year, except that manufacturers qualifying under the  provisions of Sec. 86.1818-12(e)(3) may use such credits to offset a  deficit generated by an averaging set subject to the Temporary Leadtime  Allowance Alternative Standards through the 2016 model year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Credits generated by an averaging set subject to the Temporary  Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818- 12(e)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section may not be used to offset a deficit  generated by an averaging set subject to the fleet average  CO2 standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(c)(2) or (3) or  otherwise transferred to an averaging set subject to the fleet average  CO2 standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(c)(2) or (3).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Credits generated by vehicles subject to the Temporary Leadtime  Allowance Alternative Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(e)(4)(i) or  (ii) may be banked for use in a future model year (to offset a deficit  generated by an averaging set subject to the Temporary Leadtime  Allowance Alternative Standards). All such credits shall expire at the  end of the 2015 model year, except that manufacturers qualifying under  the provisions of Sec. 86.1818-12(e)(3) may use such credits to offset a  deficit generated by an averaging set subject to the Temporary Leadtime  Allowance Alternative Standards through the 2016 model year.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A manufacturer with any vehicles subject to the Temporary  Leadtime Allowance Alternative Standards specified in Sec. 86.1818- 12(e)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section in a model year in which that  manufacturer also generates credits with vehicles subject to the fleet  average CO2 standards specified in Sec. 86.1818-12(c) may not  trade or bank credits earned against the fleet average standards in  Sec. 86.1818-12(c) for use in a future model year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Credits generated in the 2017 through 2020 model years under  the provisions of Sec. 86.1818(e)(3)(ii) may not be traded or otherwise  provided to another manufacturer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Credits generated under any alternative fleet average standards  approved under Sec. 86.1818(g) may not be traded or otherwise provided  to another manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The following provisions apply if debits are accrued:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a manufacturer calculates that it has negative credits (also  called ``debits'' or a ``credit deficit'') for a given model year, it  may carry that deficit forward into the next three model years. Such a  carry-forward may only occur after the manufacturer exhausts any supply  of banked credits. At the end of the third model year, the deficit must  be covered with an appropriate number of credits that the manufacturer  generates or purchases. Any remaining deficit is subject to a voiding of  the certificate ab initio, as described in this paragraph (k)(8).  Manufacturers are not permitted to have a credit deficit for four  consecutive years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If debits are not offset within the specified time period, the  number of vehicles not meeting the fleet average CO2  standards (and therefore not covered by the certificate) must be  calculated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine the gram per mile quantity of debits for the  noncompliant vehicle category by multiplying the total megagram deficit  by 1,000,000 and then dividing by the vehicle lifetime miles for the  vehicle category (passenger automobile or light truck) specified in  paragraph (k)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Divide the result by the fleet average standard applicable to  the model year in which the debits were first incurred and round to the  nearest whole number to determine the number of vehicles not meeting the  fleet average CO2 standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> EPA will determine the vehicles not covered by a certificate  because the condition on the certificate was not satisfied by  designating vehicles in those test groups with the highest carbon- related exhaust emission values first and continuing until reaching a  number of vehicles equal to the calculated number of non-complying  vehicles as determined in this paragraph (k)(8). If this calculation  determines that only a portion of vehicles in a test group contribute to  the debit situation, then EPA will designate actual vehicles in that  test group as not covered   by the certificate, starting with the last vehicle produced and counting  backwards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a manufacturer ceases production of passenger  automobiles, light trucks, or heavy-duty vehicles subject to the  standards of 40 CFR 1037.104, the manufacturer continues to be  responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required  time period. Any failure to offset the debits will be considered a  violation of paragraph (k)(8)(i) of this section and may subject the  manufacturer to an enforcement action for sale of vehicles not covered  by a certificate, pursuant to paragraphs (k)(8)(ii) and (iii) of this  section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If a manufacturer is purchased by, merges with, or otherwise  combines with another manufacturer, the controlling entity is  responsible for offsetting any debits outstanding within the required  time period.
