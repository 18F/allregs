These temperatures shall be  maintained throughout the cleaning cycle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An approved cleaning compound shall be used in the wash water.  (The use of metered equipment for dispensing the compound into solution  is recommended.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wash water shall be changed approximately every 4 hours or more  often if needed to maintain sanitary conditions and at the end of each  shift. Remedial measures shall be taken to prevent excess foaming during  the egg washing operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Replacement water shall be added continuously to the wash water  of washers to maintain a continuous overflow. Rinse water and chlorine  sanitizing rinse may be used as part of the replacement water. Iodine  sanitizing rinse may not be used as part of the replacement water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Waste water from the egg washing operation shall be piped  directly to drains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The washing operation shall be continuous and shall be completed  as rapidly as possible. Eggs shall not be allowed to stand or soak in  water. Immersion-type washers shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Prewetting shell eggs prior to washing may be accomplished by  spraying a continuous flow of water over the eggs in a manner which  permits the water to drain away, or by other methods which may be  approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Shell eggs shall not be washed in the breaking room or any room  where edible products are processed.
