The pad inserts from adult buoyant vests shall provide not less than 16 pounds buoyancy; the pad inserts from child medium vests shall provide not less than 11 pounds

buoyancy; and the pad inserts from child small vests shall provide not less than 7\1/4\ pounds buoyancy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Body strap test. The complete body strap assembly, including hardware, shall be tested for strength by attaching the dee ring to a suitable support such that the assembly hangs vertically its full length. A weight as specified in Sec. 160.047-3(f) shall be attached to the other end on the snap hook for 10 minutes. The specified weight shall not break or excessively distort the body strap assembly.
