The property at the time of transfer must conform to the minimum standards established by the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (84 Stat. 1590), as amended (29 U.S.C. 651).

In case of damage or destruction of the property by flood, fire, rain, windstorm, vandalism, snow or tornado, the insurance money collected shall be expended only for repair or replacement of property. Otherwise, insurance proceeds shall be paid to the Bureau.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the public school authority is self-insured and can present evidence of that fact to the Area Director or Commissioner, insurance for lost or damaged property will not be required. However, the public school authority will be responsible for replacement of such lost or damaged property at no cost to the Government or for paying the Government enough to replace the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The permittee shall maintain the property in a reasonable state of repair
