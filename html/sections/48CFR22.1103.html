                            <p class="depth0">All professional employees shall be compensated fairly and properly.  Accordingly, the contracting officer shall insert the provision at  52.222-46, Evaluation of Compensation for Professional Employees, in  solicitations for negotiated contracts when the contract amount is  expected to exceed $700,000 and services are to be provided which will  require meaningful numbers of professional employees. This provision  requires that offerors submit for evaluation a total compensation plan  setting forth proposed salaries and fringe benefits for professional  employees working on the contract. Supporting information will include  data, such as recognized national and regional compensation surveys and  studies of professional, public and private organizations, used in  establishing the total compensation structure. Plans indicating  unrealistically low professional employee compensation may be assessed  adversely as one of the factors considered in making an award.
