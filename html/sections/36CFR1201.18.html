                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Interest. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NARA will assess interest on all delinquent debts  unless prohibited by statute, regulation, or contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interest begins to accrue on all debts from the date that the  debt becomes delinquent. NARA will not recover interest if you pay the  debt within 30 days of the date on which interest begins to accrue. NARA  will assess interest at the rate established annually by the Secretary  of the Treasury under 31 U.S.C. 3717, unless a different rate is either  necessary to protect the interests of NARA or established by a contract,  repayment agreement, or statute. NARA will notify you of the basis for  its finding when a different rate is necessary to protect the interests  of NARA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Archivist may extend the 30-day period for payment without  interest where he or she determines that such action is in the best  interest of   NARA. A decision to extend or not to extend the payment period is final  and is not subject to further review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Penalty. NARA will assess a penalty charge of 6 percent a year  on any portion of a debt that is delinquent for more than 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Administrative costs. NARA will assess charges to cover  administrative costs incurred as a result of your failure to pay a debt  before it becomes delinquent. Administrative costs include the  additional costs incurred in processing and handling the debt because it  became delinquent, such as costs incurred in obtaining a credit report  or in using a private collection contractor, or service fees charged by  a Federal agency for collection activities undertaken on behalf of NARA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocation of payments. A partial or installment payment by a  debtor will be applied first to outstanding penalty assessments, second  to administrative costs, third to accrued interest, and fourth to the  outstanding debt principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional authority. NARA may assess interest, penalty charges,  and administrative costs on debts that are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717  to the extent authorized under common law or other applicable statutory  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Archivist may (without regard to the amount of  the debt) waive collection of all or part of accrued interest, penalty  charges, or administrative costs, if he or she determines that  collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience  or not in the best interest of NARA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A decision to waive interest, penalty charges, or administrative  costs may be made at any time before a debt is paid. However, and unless  otherwise stated in these regulations, where these charges have been  collected before the waiver decision, they will not be refunded. The  Archivist's decision to waive or not waive collection of these charges  is final and is not subject to further review.</p>
