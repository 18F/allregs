                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The implementation of the Privacy Act of 1974 within  DSS is as prescribed by DoD Directive 5400.11. This section provides  special rules and information that extend or amplify DoD policies with  respect to matters of particular concern to the Defense Security  Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Privacy Act rules application. Any request which cites neither  Act, concerning personal record information in a system or records, by  the individual to whom such information pertains, for access, amendment,  correction, accounting of disclosures, etc., will be governed by the  Privacy Act of 1974, DoD Directive 5400.11 and these rules exclusively.  Requests for like information which cite only the Freedom of Information  Act will be governed by the Freedom of Information Act, DoD Regulation  5400.7R \2\. Any denial or exemption of all or part of a record from  notification, access, disclosure, amendment or other provision, will  also be processed under these rules, unless court order or other  competent authority directs otherwise. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ See footnote 1 to 321.1. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> First amendment rights. No DSS official or element may maintain  any information pertaining to the exercise by an individual of his  rights under the First Amendment without the permission of that  individual unless such collection is specifically authorized by statute  or necessary to and within the scope of an authorized law enforcement  activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Standards of accuracy and validation of records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All  individuals or elements within DSS which create or maintain records  pertaining to individuals will insure that they are reasonably accurate,  relevant, timely and complete to serve the purpose for which they are  maintained and to assure fairness to the individual to whom they  pertain. Information that is not pertinent to a stated purpose of a  system of records will not be maintained within those records. Officials  compiling investigatory records will make every reasonable effort to  assure that only reports that are impartial, clear, accurate, complete,  fair and relevant with respect to the authorized purpose of such records  are included, and that reports not meeting these standards or serving  such purposes are not included in such records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to dissemination to an individual or agency outside DoD of  any record about an individual (except for a Freedom of Information Act  action or access by a subject individual under these rules) the  disclosing DSS official will by review, make a reasonable effort to  assure that such record is accurate, complete, timely, fair and relevant  to the purpose for which they are maintained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Defense Clearance and Investigations Index (DCII). It is the  policy of DSS, as custodian, that each DoD component or element that has  direct access to or contributes records to the DCII (V5-02), is  individually responsible for compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and  DoD Directive 5400.11 with respect to requests for notification,  requests for access by subject individuals, granting of such access,  request for amendment and corrections by subjects, making amendments or  corrections, other disclosures, accounting for disclosures and the  exercise of exemptions, insofar as they pertain to any record placed in  the DCII by that component or element. Any component or element of the  DoD that makes a disclosure of any record whatsoever to an individual or  agency outside the DoD, from the DCII, is individually responsible to  maintain an accounting of that disclosure as prescribed by the Privacy  Act of 1974 and DoD Directive 5400.11 and to notify the element placing  the   record in the DCII of the disclosure. Use of and compliance with the  procedures of the DCII Disclosure Accounting System will meet these  requirements. Any component or element of DoD with access to the DCII  that, in response to a request concerning an individual, discovers a  record pertaining to that individual placed in the DCII by another  component or element, may refer the requester to the DoD component that  placed the record into the DCII without making an accounting of such  referral, although it involves the divulging of the existence of that  record. Generally, consultation with, and referral to, the component or  element placing a record in the DCII should be effected by any component  receiving a request pertaining to that record to insure appropriate  exercise of amendment or exemption procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Investigative operations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DSS agents must be thoroughly  familiar with and understand these rules and the authorities, purposes  and routine uses of DSS investigative records, and be prepared to  explain them and the effect of refusing information to all sources of  investigative information, including subjects, during interview, in  response to questions that go beyond the required printed and oral  notices. Agents shall be guided by DSS Handbook for Personnel Security  Investigations in this respect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All sources may be advised that the subject of an investigative  record may be given access to it, but that the identities of sources may  be withheld under certain conditions. Such advisement will be made as  prescribed in DSS Handbook for Personnel Security Investigations, and  the interviewing agent may not urge a source to request a grant of  confidentiality. Such pledges of confidence will be given sparingly and  then only when required to obtain information relevant and necessary to  the stated purpose of the investigative information being collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-system information on individuals. The following information  is not considered part of personal records systems reportable under the  Privacy Act of 1974 and may be maintained by DSS members for ready  identification, contact, and property control purposes only. If at any  time the information described in this paragraph is to be used for other  than these purposes, that information must become part of a reported,  authorized record system. No other information concerning individuals  except that described in the records systems notice and this paragraph  may be maintained within DSS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification information at doorways, building directories,  desks, lockers, name tags, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification in telephone directories, locator cards and  rosters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Geographical or agency contact cards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Property receipts and control logs for building passes,  credentials, vehicles, weapons, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Temporary personal working notes kept solely by and at the  initiative of individual members of DSS to facilitate their duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notification of prior recipients. Whenever a decision is made to  amend a record, or a statement contesting a DSS decision not to amend a  record is received from the subject individual, prior recipients of the  record identified in disclosure accountings will be notified to the  extent possible. In some cases, prior recipients cannot be located due  to reorganization or deactivations. In these cases, the personnel  security element of the receiving Defense Component will be sent the  notification or statement for appropriate action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Ownership of DSS Investigative Records. Personnel security  investigative reports shall not be retained by DoD recipient  organizations. Such reports are considered to be the property of the  investigating organization and are on loan to the recipient organization  for the purpose for which requested. All copies of such reports shall be  destroyed within 120 days after the completion of the final personnel  security determination and the completion of all personnel action  necessary to implement the determination. Reports that are required for  longer periods may be retained only with the specific written approval  of the investigative organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Consultation and referral. DSS system of records may contain  records originated by other components or   agencies which may have claimed exemptions for them under the Privacy  Act of 1974. When any action that may be exempted is initiated  concerning such a record, consultation with the originating agency or  component will be effected. Where appropriate such records will be  referred to the originating component or agency for approval or  disapproval of the action.</p>
