                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Waiver of assessment for certain initial periods. No eligible  entity shall pay any assessment associated with the transaction account  guarantee program for the period from October 14, 2008, through November  12, 2008. An eligible entity that opts out of the program on or before  December 5, 2008 will not pay any assessment under the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initiation of assessments. Beginning on November 13, 2008 each  eligible entity that does not opt out of the transaction account  guarantee program on or before December 5, 2008 will be required to pay  the FDIC assessments on all deposit amounts in noninterest-bearing  transaction accounts calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of assessment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs  (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section any eligible entity that does not opt  out of the transaction account guarantee program shall pay quarterly an  annualized 10 basis point assessment on any deposit amounts exceeding  the existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000, as reported on its  quarterly Consolidated Reports of Condition and Income, Thrift Financial   Report, or Report of Assets and Liabilities of U.S. Branches and  Agencies of Foreign Banks (each, a ``Call Report'') in any noninterest- bearing transaction accounts (as defined in Sec. 370.2(h)), including  any such amounts swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction account  into an noninterest-bearing savings deposit account as provided in  Sec. 370.4(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> shall pay quarterly a fee based upon its Risk Category  rating. The amount of the fee for each such entity is equal to the  annualized, TAG assessment rate for the entity multiplied by the amount  of the deposits held in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as  defined in Sec. 370.2(h) and including any amounts swept from a  noninterest- bearing transaction account into an noninterest-bearing  savings deposit account as provided in Sec. 370.4(c)) that exceed the  existing deposit insurance limit of $250,000, as reported on the  entity's most recent quarterly Call Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Beginning on July 1, 2010, each participating entity that does  not opt out of the transaction account guarantee program shall pay  quarterly a fee based upon its Risk Category rating. The amount of the  fee for each such entity is equal to the annualized, TAG assessment rate  for the entity multiplied by the aggregate amount of the deposits held  in noninterest-bearing transaction accounts (as defined in Sec. 370.2(h)  and including any amounts swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction  account into an noninterest-bearing savings deposit account as provided  in Sec. 370.4(c)) that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  $250,000, calculated based upon the average daily balances in such  accounts as reported on the entity's most recent quarterly Call Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The annualized TAG assessment rates are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 15 basis points, for the portion of each quarter in which the  entity is assigned to Risk Category I;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 20 basis points, for the portion of each quarter in which the  entity is assigned to Risk Category II; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 25 basis points, for the portion of each quarter in which the  entity is assigned to either Risk Category III or Risk Category IV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount to be reported for each noninterest-bearing  transaction account as the average daily balance is the total dollar  amount held in such account that exceeds $250,000 for each calendar day  during the quarter divided by the number of calendar days in the  quarter. For those days that an office of the reporting institution is  closed (e.g., Saturdays, Sundays, or holidays), the amounts outstanding  from the previous business day should be used. The total number of  accounts to be reported should be calculated on the same basis.  Documentation supporting the amounts used in the calculation of the  average daily balance amounts must be retained and be readily available  upon request by the FDIC or the institution's primary Federal regulator.  In addition, all institutions that do not opt of the transaction account  guarantee program must establish procedures to gather the necessary  daily data beginning July 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An entity's Risk Category is determined in accordance with the  FDIC's risk-based premium system described in 12 CFR part 327. The  assessments provided in this paragraph (c) shall be in addition to an  institution's risk-based assessment imposed under Part 327.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Collection of assessment. Assessments for the transaction  account guarantee program shall be collected along with a participating  entity's quarterly deposit insurance payment as provided in Sec. 327.3,  and subject to penalties for failure to timely pay assessments as  referenced in Sec. 308.132(c)(3)(v).  [73 FR 72266, Nov. 26, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 45099, Sept. 1, 2009;  75 FR 20265, Apr. 19, 2010]</p>
