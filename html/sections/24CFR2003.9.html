                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3), because release of an accounting of  disclosures to an individual who is the subject of an investigation  could reveal the nature and scope of the investigation and could result  in the altering or destruction of evidence, improper influencing of  witnesses, and other evasive actions that could impede or compromise the  investigation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (d)(1), because release of investigative records  to an individual who is the subject of an investigation could interfere  with pending or prospective law enforcement proceedings, constitute an  unwarranted invasion of the personal privacy of third parties, reveal  the identity of   confidential sources, or reveal sensitive investigative techniques and  procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d)(2), because amendment or correction of  investigative records could interfere with pending or prospective law  enforcement proceedings, or could impose an impossible administrative  and investigative burden by requiring the OIG to continuously retrograde  its investigations attempting to resolve questions of accuracy,  relevance, timeliness and completeness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (e)(1), because it is often impossible to  determine relevance or necessity of information in the early stages of  an investigation. The value of such information is a question of  judgment and timing; what appears relevant and necessary when collected  may ultimately be evaluated and viewed as irrelevant and unnecessary to  an investigation. In addition, the OIG may obtain information concerning  the violation of laws other than those within the scope of its  jurisdiction. In the interest of effective law enforcement, the OIG  should retain this information because it may aid in establishing  patterns of unlawful activity and provide leads for other law  enforcement agencies. Further, in obtaining evidence during an  investigation, information may be provided to the OIG which relates to  matters incidental to the main purpose of the investigation but which  may be pertinent to the investigative jurisdiction of another agency.  Such information cannot readily be identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The systems of records entitled ``Investigative Files of the  Office of Inspector General,'' ``Hotline Complaint Files of the Office  of Inspector General,'' ``Name Indices System of the Office of Inspector  General,'' and ``Autoinvestigation of the Office of Inspector General''  consist in part of investigatory material compiled by the OIG for the  purpose of determining suitability, eligibility, or qualifications for  Federal civilian employment or Federal contracts, the release of which  would reveal the identity of a source who furnished information to the  Government under an express promise that the identity of the source  would be held in confidence. Therefore, to the extent that information  in these systems fall within the coverage of exemption (k)(5) of the  Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5), these systems of records are exempt  from the requirements of subsection (d)(1), because release would reveal  the identity of a source who furnished information to the Government  under an express promise of confidentiality. Revealing the identity of a  confidential source could impede future cooperation by sources, and  could result in harassment or harm to such sources.
