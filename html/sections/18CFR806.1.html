The special standards established pursuant to Section 3.4(2) shall be applicable to all water withdrawals and consumptive uses in accordance with the terms of those standards, irrespective of whether such withdrawals and uses are also subject to project review under Section 3.10. This part, and every other part of 18 CFR Chapter VIII, shall also be incorporated into and made a part of the comprehensive plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When projects subject to Commission review and approval are sponsored by governmental authorities, the Commission shall submit recommendations and findings to the sponsoring agency, which shall be included in any report submitted by such agency to its respective legislative body or to any committee thereof in connection with any request for authorization or appropriation therefor. The Commission review will ascertain the project's compatibility with the objectives, goals, guidelines and criteria set forth in the comprehensive plan. If determined compatible, the said project will also be incorporated into the comprehensive plan, if so required by the compact. For the purposes of avoiding conflicts of jurisdiction and of giving full effect to the Commission as a regional agency of the member jurisdictions, no expenditure or commitment shall be made by any governmental authority for or on account of the construction, acquisition or operation of any project or facility unless it first has been included by the Commission in the comprehensive plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If any portion of this part, or any other part of 18 CFR Chapter VIII, shall, for any reason, be declared invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as otherwise stated in this part, this part shall be effective on January 1, 2007.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When any period of time is referred to in this part, such period in all cases shall be so computed as to exclude the first and include the last day of such period. Whenever the last day of any such period shall fall on Saturday or Sunday, or on any day made a legal holiday by the law of the United States, such day shall be omitted from the computation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any Commission forms or documents referenced in this part may be obtained from the Commission at 1721 North Front Street, Harrisburg, PA 17102-2391, or from the Commission's Web site at http://www.srbc.net.</p>
