                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as expressly provided otherwise in the applicable form:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The schedule specified below in this section as Schedules I  shall be as of the date of the most recent audited balance sheet for  each person or group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The schedules specified below in this section as Schedule IV and  V shall be filed for each period for which an audited income statement  is required to be filed for each person or group.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Schedules II, III and V shall be filed as of the date and for  periods specified in the schedule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When information is required in schedules for both the  registrant and the registrant and its subsidiaries consolidated it may  be presented in the form of a single schedule: Provided, That items  pertaining to the registrant are shown separately and that such single  schedule affords a properly summarized presentation of the facts. If the  information required by any schedule (including the notes thereto) may  be shown in the related financial statement or in a note thereto without  making such statement unclear or confusing, that procedure may be  followed and the schedule omitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The schedules shall be examined by the independent accountant.</p><p class="depth2">Schedule I--Summary of investments--other than investments in  related parties. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-15 shall be  filed in support of caption 1 of the most recent audited balance sheet.</p><p class="depth2">Schedule II--Condensed financial information of registrant. The  schedule prescribed by   Sec. 210.12-04 shall be filed when the restricted net assets (Sec.  210.4.08(e)(3)) of consolidated subsidiaries exceed 25 percent of  consolidated net assets as of the end of the most recently completed  fiscal year. For purposes of the above test, restricted net assets of  consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the registrant's  proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after  intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent fiscal  year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the  form of loans, advances or cash dividends without the consent of a third  party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.). Where  restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced  differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash  dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used.  Redeemable preferred stocks (Sec. 210.7-03.20) and noncontrolling  interests shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this  test.</p><p class="depth2">Schedule III--Supplementary insurance information. The schedule  prescribed by Sec. 210.12-16 shall be filed giving segment detail in  support of various balance sheet and income statement captions. The  required balance sheet information shall be presented as of the date of  each audited balance sheet filed, and the income statement information  shall be presented for each period for which an audited income statement  is required to be filed, for each person or group.</p><p class="depth2">Schedule IV--Reinsurance. The schedule prescribed by Sec. 210.12-17  shall be filed for reinsurance ceded and assumed.</p><p class="depth2">Schedule V--Valuation and qualifying accounts. The schedule  prescribed by Sec. 210.12-09 shall be filed in support of valuation and  qualifying accounts included in the balance sheet (see Sec. 210.4-02).</p><p class="depth2">Schedule VI--Supplemental Information Concerning Property-Casualty  Insurance Operations. The information required by Sec. 210.12-18 shall  be presented as of the same dates and for the same periods for which the  information is reflected in the audited consolidated financial  statements required by Sec. Sec. 210.3-01 and 3-02. The schedule may be  omitted if reserves for unpaid property-casualty claims and claim  adjustment expenses of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries,  its unconsolidated subsidiaries and its 50%-or-less-owned equity basis  investees did not in the aggregate, exceed one-half of common  stockholders' equity of the registrant and its consolidated subsidiaries  as of the beginning of the fiscal year. For purposes of this test, only  the proportionate share of the registrant and its other subsidiaries in  the reserves for unpaid claims and claim adjustment expenses of 50%-or- less-owned equity investees taken in the aggregate after intercompany  eliminations shall be taken into account.
