It must be the intention of the company to engage actively in the  execution of surety bonds in favor of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No bond is acceptable if it has been executed (signed and/or  otherwise validated) by a company or its agent in a State where it has  not obtained that State's license to do surety business. Although a  company must be licensed in the State or other area in which it executes  a bond, it need not be licensed in the State or other area in which the  principal resides or where the contract is to be performed. The term  other area includes the Canal Zone, District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto  Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  [40 FR 6499, Feb. 12, 1975]</p>
