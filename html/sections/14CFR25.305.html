At any load up to limit loads, the  deformation may not interfere with safe operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The structure must be able to support ultimate loads without  failure for at least 3 seconds. However, when proof of strength is shown  by dynamic tests simulating actual load conditions, the 3-second limit  does not apply. Static tests conducted to ultimate load must include the  ultimate deflections and ultimate deformation induced by the loading.

This must  be shown by analysis, flight tests, or other tests found necessary by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Unless shown to be extremely improbable, the airplane must be  designed to withstand any forced structural vibration resulting from any  failure, malfunction or adverse condition in the flight control system.
