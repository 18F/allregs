                            <p class="depth0">This section specifies the deposit control test requirements and performance standards which must be met in order to certify detergent additives for use in unleaded gasoline, pursuant to Sec. 80.161(b)(1)(ii)(A)(3). These standards must be met in the context of the specific test procedures identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. The testing must be conducted and the performance standards met when the subject detergent additive is mixed in a test fuel meeting all relevant requirements of Sec. 80.164, including the deposit-forming tendency demonstration specified in Sec. 80.164(b)(3), if applicable. Complete test documentation must be submitted by the certifying party within 30 days of receipt of a written request from EPA for such records. The certification test procedures and standards associated with the alternative national generic certification option in Sec. 80.163(a)(1)(iii) are contained in Sec. 80.176.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fuel injector deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce no more than 5% flow restriction in any one injector when tested in accordance with ASTM D5598. At the option of the certifier, fuel injector flow may be measured at intervals during the 10,000 mile test cycle described in ASTM D5598, in addition to the flow measurements required at the completion of the test cycle, but not more than every 1,000 miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Intake valve deposit control testing. The required test fuel must produce the accumulation of less than 100 mg of intake valve deposits on average when tested in accordance with ASTM D5500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Materials incorporated by reference.
