If the Secretary finds the recommendation of the Board shows adequate cause, the Secretary may remove such member from office. Further, without recommendation of the Board, a member may be removed by the Secretary upon showing of adequate cause, including the failure by a member to submit reports or remit assessments required under this part, if the Secretary determines that such member's continued service would be detrimental to the achievement of the purposes of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Should any member position become vacant, successors for the unexpired terms of such member shall be appointed in the manner specified in Sec. 1214.41.
