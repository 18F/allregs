                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Each mechanical fitting failure, as required by Sec. 192.1009, must  be submitted on a Mechanical Fitting Failure Report Form PHMSA F-7100.1- 2. An operator must submit a mechanical fitting failure report for each  mechanical fitting failure that occurs within a calendar year not later  than March 15 of the following year (for example, all mechanical failure  reports for calendar year 2011 must be submitted no later than March 15,  2012). Alternatively, an operator may elect to submit its reports  throughout the year. In addition,   an operator must also report this information to the State pipeline  safety authority if a State has obtained regulatory authority over the  operator's pipeline.
