For purposes of subpart C of this part, the corresponding deduction approach is the methodology used for the deductions from regulatory capital related to reciprocal cross holdings (as described in paragraph (c)(3) of this section), non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section), and non-common stock significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (as described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section). Under the corresponding deduction approach, a Board-regulated institution must make deductions from the component of capital for which the underlying instrument would qualify if it were issued by the Board-regulated institution itself, as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(i)-(iii) of this section. If the Board-regulated institution does not have a sufficient amount of a specific component of capital to effect the required deduction, the shortfall must be deducted according to paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If an investment is in the form of an instrument issued by a financial institution that is not a regulated financial institution, the Board-regulated institution must treat the instrument as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A common equity tier 1 capital instrument if it is common stock or represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the financial institution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An additional tier 1 capital instrument if it is subordinated to all creditors of the financial institution and is senior in liquidation only to common shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an investment is in the form of an instrument issued by a regulated financial institution and the instrument does not meet the criteria for common equity tier 1, additional tier 1 or tier 2 capital instruments under Sec. 217.20, the Board-regulated institution must treat the instrument as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A common equity tier 1 capital instrument if it is common stock included in GAAP equity or represents the most subordinated claim in liquidation of the financial institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An additional tier 1 capital instrument if it is included in GAAP equity, subordinated to all creditors of the financial institution, and senior in a receivership, insolvency, liquidation, or similar proceeding only to common shareholders; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A tier 2 capital instrument if it is not included in GAAP equity but considered regulatory capital by the primary supervisor of the financial institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an investment is in the form of a non-qualifying capital instrument (as defined in Sec. 217.300(c)), the Board-regulated institution must treat the instrument as:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An additional tier 1 capital instrument if such instrument was included in the issuer's tier 1 capital prior to May 19, 2010; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A tier 2 capital instrument if such instrument was included in the issuer's tier 2 capital (but not includable in tier 1 capital) prior to May 19, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reciprocal cross holdings in the capital of financial institutions. A Board-regulated institution must deduct investments in the capital of other financial institutions it holds reciprocally, where such reciprocal cross holdings result from a formal or informal arrangement to swap, exchange, or otherwise intend to hold each other's capital instruments, by applying the corresponding deduction approach.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions. (i) A Board-regulated institution must deduct its non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions (as defined in Sec. 217.2) that, in the aggregate, exceed 10 percent of the sum of the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital elements minus all deductions from and adjustments to common equity tier 1 capital elements required under paragraphs (a) through (c)(3) of this section (the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments) by applying the corresponding deduction approach.\24\ The deductions described in this section are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, a Board-regulated institution that underwrites a failed underwriting, with the prior written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, is not required to deduct a non-significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution pursuant to this paragraph (c) to the extent the investment is related to the failed underwriting.\25\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\24\ With the prior written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, a Board-regulated institution is not required to deduct a non-significant investment in the capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution pursuant to this paragraph if the financial institution is in distress and if such investment is made for the purpose of providing financial support to the financial institution, as determined by the Board.</p><p class="depth0">\25\ Any non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that do not exceed the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments under this section must be assigned the appropriate risk weight under subparts D, E, or F of this part, as applicable.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount to be deducted under this section from a specific capital component is equal to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Board-regulated institution's non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions exceeding the 10 percent threshold for non-significant investments, multiplied by</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The ratio of the Board-regulated institution's non-significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of such capital component to the Board-regulated institution's total non-significant investments in unconsolidated financial institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock. A Board-regulated institution must deduct its significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions that are not in the form of common stock by applying the corresponding deduction approach.\26\ The deductions described in this section are net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section. In addition, with the prior

written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, a Board-regulated institution that underwrites a failed underwriting is not required to deduct a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution pursuant to this paragraph (c) if such investment is related to such failed underwriting.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\26\ With prior written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, a Board-regulated institution is not required to deduct a significant investment in the capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution in distress which is not in the form of common stock pursuant to this section if such investment is made for the purpose of providing financial support to the financial institution as determined by the Board.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Items subject to the 10 and 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction thresholds.

The Board-regulated institution must risk weight these assets at 100 percent. For a state member bank that is a member of a consolidated group for tax purposes, the amount of DTAs that could be realized through net operating loss carrybacks may not exceed the amount that the state member bank could reasonably expect to have refunded by its parent holding company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> MSAs net of associated DTLs, in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock, net of associated DTLs in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.\27\ Significant investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions in the form of common stock subject to the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold may be reduced by any goodwill embedded in the valuation of such investments deducted by the Board-regulated institution pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section. In addition, with the prior written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, a Board-regulated institution that underwrites a failed underwriting is not required to deduct a significant investment in the capital of an unconsolidated financial institution in the form of common stock pursuant to this paragraph (d) if such investment is related to such failed underwriting.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\27\ With the prior written approval of the Board, for the period of time stipulated by the Board, a Board-regulated institution is not required to deduct a significant investment in the capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution in distress in the form of common stock pursuant to this section if such investment is made for the purpose of providing financial support to the financial institution as determined by the Board.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Board-regulated institution must deduct from common equity tier 1 capital elements the items listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section that are not deducted as a result of the application of the 10 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold, and that, in aggregate, exceed 17.65 percent of the sum of the Board-regulated institution's common equity tier 1 capital elements, minus adjustments to and deductions from common equity tier 1 capital required under paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, minus the items listed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section (the 15 percent common equity tier 1 capital deduction threshold).

A Board-regulated institution that elects to exclude DTAs relating to adjustments under paragraph (b) of this section also must exclude DTLs and must do so consistently in all future calculations.

In order to adjust the gross long position to recognize a short position in the same instrument, the following criteria must be met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maturity of the short position must match the maturity of the long position, or the short position has a residual maturity of at least one year (maturity requirement); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a position that is a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet) as reported on the Board-regulated institution's Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable, if the Board-regulated institution has a contractual right or obligation to sell the long position at a specific point in time and the counterparty to the contract has an obligation to purchase the long position if the Board-regulated institution exercises its right to sell, this point in time may be treated as the maturity of the long position such that the maturity of the long position and short position are deemed to match for purposes of the maturity requirement, even if the maturity of the short position is less than one year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For an investment in the Board-regulated institution's own capital instrument under paragraph (c)(1) of this section or an investment in a capital of an unconsolidated financial institution under paragraphs (c)(4), (c)(5), and (d)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A Board-regulated institution may only net a short position against a long position in the Board-regulated institution's own capital instrument under paragraph (c)(1) of this section if the short position involves no counterparty credit risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A gross long position in a Board-regulated institution's own capital instrument or in a capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution

resulting from a position in an index may be netted against a short position in the same index. Long and short positions in the same index without maturity dates are considered to have matching maturities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A short position in an index that is hedging a long cash or synthetic position in a Board-regulated institution's own capital instrument or in a capital instrument of an unconsolidated financial institution can be decomposed to provide recognition of the hedge. More specifically, the portion of the index that is composed of the same underlying instrument that is being hedged may be used to offset the long position if both the long position being hedged and the short position in the index are reported as a trading asset or trading liability (whether on- or off-balance sheet) on the Board-regulated institution's Call Report, for a state member bank, or FR Y-9C, for a bank holding company or savings and loan holding company, as applicable, and the hedge is deemed effective by the Board-regulated institution's internal control processes, which have not been found to be inadequate by the Board.
