                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following systems of records are eligible for exemption  under 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2) because they are maintained by a component of  the agency or subcomponent which performs as its principal function the  enforcement of criminal laws, and they contain investigatory material  compiled for criminal law enforcement purposes. Accordingly, these  systems of records are exempt from the following subsections of 552a of  title 5 U.S. Code: (c)(3) and (4), (d), (e)(1), (2), and (3), (e)(4)(G),  (H), and (I), (e)(5) and (8), (f) and (g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DOL/ESA-45 (Investigative Files of the Office of Labor- Management Standards), a system of records maintained by the Office of  Labor-Management Standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DOL/OIG-1 (General Investigative Files, and Subject Title Index,  USDOL/OIG), a system of records maintained   by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DOL/OIG-2 (Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Records), a  system of records maintained by the OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DOL/OIG-3 (Case Development Records), a system of records  maintained by the OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> DOL/OIG-5 (Investigative Case Tracking Systems/Audit Information  Reporting Systems, USDOL/OIG), a system of records maintained by the  OIG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> DOL/MSHA-20 (Civil/Criminal Investigations), a system of records  maintained by the Mine Safety and Health Administration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> DOL/EBSA-2 (Office of Enforcement Index Cards and Investigation  Files), a system of records maintained by the Employee Benefits Security  Administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This exemption applies to the extent that information in these  systems of records is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C.  552a(j)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (12) of this section, from the following  subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subsection (c)(3). The release of the disclosure accounting  would present a serious impediment to law enforcement by permitting the  subject of an investigation of an actual or potential criminal violation  to determine whether he is the subject of investigation, or to obtain  valuable information concerning the nature of that investigation and the  information obtained, or to identify witnesses and informants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsection (c)(4). Since an exemption is being claimed for  subsection (d) f the Act (Access to Records), this subsection is  inapplicable to the extent that these systems of records are exempted  from subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (d). Access to records contained in these systems  would inform the subject of an actual or potential criminal  investigation of the existence of that investigation, of the nature and  scope of the investigation, of the information and evidence obtained as  to his or her activities, and of the identity of witnesses or  informants. Such access would, accordingly, provide information that  could enable the subject to avoid detection, apprehension, and  prosecution. This result, therefore, would constitute a serious  impediment to effective law enforcement not only because it would  prevent the successful completion of the investigation but also because  it could endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, lead  to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence,  or the fabrication of testimony. Amendment of the records would  interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and imposes  an impossible administrative burden by requiring criminal investigations  to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Subsection (e)(1). In the course of criminal and related law  enforcement investigations, cases, and matters, the agency will  occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential  violations of law that may not be technically within its statutory or  other authority, or it may compile information in the course of an  investigation which may not be relevant to a specific prosecution. In  the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain  some or all of such information since it can aid in establishing  patterns of criminal activity and can provide valuable leads for Federal  and other law enforcement agencies. Moreover, it is difficult to know  during the course of an investigation what is relevant and necessary. In  this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant at first, but  later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Subsection (e)(2). To collect information to the greatest extent  practicable from the subject individual of a criminal investigation or  prosecution would present a serious impediment to law enforcement  because the subject of the investigation or prosecution would be placed  on notice as to the existence of the investigation and would therefore  be able to avoid detection or apprehension, improperly influence  witnesses, destroy evidence, or fabricate testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subsection (e)(3). To provide individuals supplying information  with a form which includes the information   required by subsection (e)(3) would constitute a serious impediment to  law enforcement, i.e., it could compromise the existence of a  confidential investigation or reveal the identity of witnesses or  confidential informants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Subsections (e)(4)(G) and (H). These subsections are  inapplicable to the extent that these systems are exempt from the access  provisions of subsection (d) and the rules provisions of subsection (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Subsection (e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records  in these systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad  generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I)  of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should  be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of  the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary  to protect the confidentiality of the sources of criminal and related  law enforcement information. Such exemption is further necessary to  protect the privacy and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Subsection (e)(5). In the collection of information for criminal  enforcement purposes it is impossible to determine in advance what  information is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. With the  passage of time, seemingly irrelevant or untimely information may  acquire new significance as further investigation brings new details to  light. Furthermore, the accuracy of such information can often only be  determined in a court of law. The restrictions of subsection (e)(5)  would inhibit the ability of government attorneys in exercising their  judgment in reporting on information and investigations and impede the  development of criminal information and related data necessary for  effective law enforcement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Subsection (e)(8). The individual notice requirements of  subsection (e)(8) could present a serious impediment to law enforcement  as this could interfere with the ability to issue warrants or subpoenas  and could reveal investigative techniques, procedures, or evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Subsection (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant  to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the  individual dealing with an actual or potential criminal, civil, or  regulatory investigation or prosecution must be exempted because such  notice to an individual would be detrimental to the successful conduct  and/or completion of an investigation or case, pending or future. In  addition, mere notice of the fact of an investigation could inform the  subject or others that their activities are under investigation or may  become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to  avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence,  or to fabricate testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for  subsection (d) of the Act (Access to Records) the rules required  pursuant to subsections (f)(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these  systems of records to the extent that these systems of records are  exempted from subsection (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Subsection (g). Since an exemption is being claimed for  subsections (d) (Access to Records) and (f) (Agency Rules) this section  is inapplicable, and is exempted for the reasons set forth for those  subsections, to the extent that these systems of records are exempted  from subsections (d) and (f).
