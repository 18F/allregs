The return must be filed in every such case regardless of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nature of the counsel or advice given, whether for or against the formation, organization, or reorganization of the foreign corporation, or the nature of the aid or assistance rendered, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The action taken upon the advice or counsel, that is, whether the foreign corporation is actually formed, organized or reorganized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special provisions--(1) Employers.

In the case of aid, assistance, counsel, or advice in, or with respect to, the formation, organization, or reorganization of a foreign corporation given by a person in whole or in part through the medium of employees (including, in the case of a corporation, the officers thereof), the return made by the employer must set forth in detail the information required by this section including that which, as an incident to

such employment, is within the possession or knowledge or under the control of such employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees. The obligation of an employee (including, in the case of a corporation, the officers thereof) to file a return with respect to any aid, assistance, counsel, or advice in or with respect to the formation, organization, or reorganization of a foreign corporation, given as an incident to his employment, will be satisfied if a return as prescribed by this section is duly filed by the employer. Clerks, stenographers, and other employees rendering aid or assistance solely of a clerical or mechanical character in or with respect to the formation, organization, or reorganization of a foreign corporation are not required to file returns by reason of such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Partners. In the case of aid, assistance, counsel, or advice in, or with respect to, the formation, organization, or reorganization of a foreign corporation given by one or more members of a partnership in the course of its business, the obligation of each such individual member to file a return will be satisfied if a return as prescribed by this section is duly filed by the partnership executed by all the members of the firm who gave any such aid, assistance, counsel, or advice. If, however, the partnership has been dissolved at the time the return is due, individual returns must be filed by each member of the former partnership who gave any such aid, assistance, counsel, or advice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Return jointly made. If two or more persons aid, assist, counsel, or advise in, or with respect to, the formation, organization, or reorganization of a particular foreign corporation, any two or more of such persons may, in lieu of filing several returns, jointly execute and file one return.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Separate return for each corporation. If a person aids, assists, counsels, or advises in, or with respect to, the formation, organization, or reorganization of more than one foreign corporation, a separate return must be filed with respect to each foreign corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information required to be shown on return.
