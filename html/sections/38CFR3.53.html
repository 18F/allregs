                                Sec.  3.53  Continuous cohabitation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The requirement that there must be continuous  cohabitation from the date of marriage to the date of death of the  veteran will be considered as having been met when the evidence shows  that any separation was due to the misconduct of, or procured by, the  veteran without the fault of the surviving spouse. Temporary separations  which ordinarily occur, including those caused for the time being  through fault of either party, will not break the continuity of the  cohabitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Findings of fact. The statement of the surviving spouse as to  the reason for the separation will be accepted in the absence of  contradictory information. If the evidence establishes that the  separation was by mutual consent and that the parties lived apart for  purposes of convenience, health, business, or any other reason which did  not show an intent on the part of the surviving spouse to desert the  veteran, the continuity of the cohabitation will not be considered as  having been broken. State laws will not control in determining questions  of desertion; however, due weight will be given to findings of fact in  court decisions made during the life of the veteran on issues  subsequently involved in the application of this section.  [41 FR 18300, May 3, 1976, as amended at 59 FR 32659, June 24, 1994]</p>
