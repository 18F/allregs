                                Sec. 19.405  Consignor for in-bond shipments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A proprietor who ships spirits, denatured spirits, or wines by transfer in bond is the ``consignor'' of the shipment for purposes of this part. The following rules apply to these transfers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A consignor who is a proprietor of a distilled spirits plant must prepare a transfer record in accordance with Sec. 19.620 to cover the transfer in bond of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Spirits or denatured spirits to another distilled spirits plant pursuant to an approved application on form TTB F 5100.16, Application for Transfer of Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits in Bond;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Wine to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant or a bonded wine cellar; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Spirits or denatured spirits to an alcohol fuel plant pursuant to an approved application on TTB F 5100.16, Application for Transfer of Spirits and/or Denatured Spirits in Bond; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A consignor who is a proprietor of an alcohol fuel plant must prepare a transfer record in accordance with Sec. 19.620 to cover the transfer in bond of spirits to the bonded premises of a distilled spirits plant pursuant to an approved application on TTB F 5100.16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of the transfer record. On completion of lading or transfer by pipeline, the consignor must retain one copy of the transfer record and one copy of any accompanying document and must forward the original transfer record and any accompanying document to the consignee. If the shipment is made by truck, the original transfer record and accompanying documents must accompany the shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Multiple shipments. As a general rule, a consignor must prepare a transfer record for each conveyance. However, a consignor may prepare a single transfer record that covers all packages of spirits shipped by truck on the same day to the same plant. In such a case, the consignor must prepare a shipment and delivery order for each shipment showing the number of packages, their serial numbers or other package identification, the name of the producer, warehouseman, or processor, and the serial numbers of any seals or other security devices applied to the truck. The shipping and delivery order must be properly authenticated by the

consignor and must constitute a complete record of the spirits transferred in each truck each day. The consignor must retain a copy of each shipping and delivery order. After lading the last truck for the day, the consignor must retain one copy of the single transfer record and one copy of any accompanying document and forward the original single transfer record and accompanying document to the consignee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Packages. When a consignor transfers spirits in packages, the consignor must weigh each package except in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When transferring the spirits in a secured conveyance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the consignor has securely sealed the individual packages; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the appropriate TTB officer waives this requirement upon a finding that there will be no jeopardy to the revenue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Temporary serial numbers. When packages are weighed at the time of shipment, the consignor must assign temporary serial numbers to the packages and show for each package its gross shipment weight on a package gauge record prepared in accordance with Sec. 19.619. A copy of the package gauge record must accompany each original or copy of the transfer record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Bulk conveyances and pipelines. When a consignor transfers spirits, denatured spirits, or wines in bulk conveyances or by pipelines, the consignor must gauge the spirits, denatured spirits, or wines and record the quantity determined on the transfer record required under Sec. 19.620 or Sec. 24.309 of this chapter. The consignor must secure bulk conveyances of spirits or denatured spirits pursuant to Sec. 19.441 of this part.
