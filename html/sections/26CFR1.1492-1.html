facts and circumstances of each particular case. In any such case where a transferor desires to establish that the transfer is not in pursuance of such a plan, a statement of the facts relating to the plan under which the transfer is to be made or was made, together with a copy of the plan if in writing, shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, Washington, DC 20225, for a ruling. This statement shall contain, or be verified by, a written declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. A letter notifying the transferor of the Commissioner's determination will be mailed to the transferor.
