                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Where in order, VA will apportion subsistence allowance in accordance with Sec. 3.451 of this title, subject to the limitations of Sec. 3.458 of this title. If the veteran is in receipt of benefits at the Chapter 30 rate, VA will not apportion these benefits.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5307(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. The effective date of apportionment will be as prescribed in Sec. 3.400(e) of this title.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5307(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Child adopted out of family. Where evidence establishes that a veteran is the natural parent of a child or children legally adopted outside of the veteran's family, VA will apportion in favor of the child or children only that additional amount of subsistence allowance payable on account of the existence of the child or children. The veteran is not entitled in his or her own right to the additional amount of subsistence allowance payable for the child because of the existence of the child unless the veteran is contributing to the child's support.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5307(c))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Veteran convicted of a felony. The subsistence allowance of a veteran in a rehabilitation program after October 17, 1980, may not be apportioned if the veteran is incarcerated because of conviction for a felony.
