                                Sec. 732.5  Steps regarding Electronic Export Information (EEI)
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Step 27: Electronic Export Information (EEI) filing  requirements. Exporters or agents authorized to file EEI to the  Automated Export System (AES), should review Sec. 758.1 of the EAR to  determine when the EAR requires EEI to be filed and what EEI data  elements the EAR requires to be included. More detailed information  about EEI filing procedures and requirements may be found in the Bureau  of Census Foreign Trade Regulations (FTR) at 15 CFR Part 30. Reexporters  and firms exporting from abroad may skip Steps 27 through 29 and proceed  directly to Sec. 732.6 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> License code/license exception code (license code). You must  report the correct license code that corresponds with your license  authority (license or license exception) or designation (No License  Required (NLR)) for your export on the EEI filing, as appropriate. See  Sec. 758.1(g) of the EAR and 15 CFR 30.6(a)(23) and Part III of  Appendix B to 15 CFR Part 30 of the FTR. Generally, conflicts of data  elements with license   exception criteria, e.g., ECCN or destination, will result in a fatal  error in the AES system. By reporting a license code for a license  exception on an EEI filing you are certifying that your transaction  meets the criteria of that license exception. By reporting a license  code of NLR you are certifying that no license is required for your  export.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> License number. If you are exporting under the authority of a  license, you must report the license number on the EEI filing. See 15  CFR 30.6(b)(5) of the FTR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Item description. You must report an item description identical  to the item description on the license when a license is required, or  report an item description sufficient in detail to permit review by the  U.S. Government and verification of the Schedule B Number or the  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) for license  exception exports or exports for which No License is Required (NLR). See  Sec. 758.1(g) of the EAR; and 15 CFR 30.6(a)(13) of the FTR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Entering the ECCN. You must report the correct Export Control  Classification Number (ECCN) or ``EAR99'' for items that are not  classified under an ECCN on the EEI filing for all licensed and license  exception exports, and ``No License Required'' (NLR) exports of items  having a reason for control other than or in addition to anti-terrorism  (AT). The only exception to this requirement would be the return of  unwanted foreign origin items, meeting the provisions of License  Exception TMP, under Sec. 740.9(b)(3) of the EAR. See Sec. 758.1(g) of  the EAR and 15 CFR 30.6(b)(6) of the FTR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Step 28: Destination Control Statement. The Destination Control  Statement (DCS) must be entered on the invoice and on the bill of  lading, air waybill, or other export control document that accompanies  the shipment from its point of origin in the United States to the  ultimate consignee or end-user abroad. The person responsible for  preparation of those documents is responsible for entry of the DCS. The  DCS is required for all exports from the United States of items on the  Commerce Control List and is not required for items classified as EAR99,  unless the export may be made under License Exception BAG or GFT (see  part 740 of the EAR). Reexporters should review Sec. 752.15 of the EAR  for DCS requirements when using a Special Comprehensive License;  otherwise, DCS requirements do not apply to reexports. See Sec. 758.6  of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Step 29: Recordkeeping. Records of transactions subject to the  EAR must be maintained for five years in accordance with the  recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.  [65 FR 42568, July 10, 2000, as amended at 79 FR 4615, Jan. 29, 2014]</p>
