________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">a. The intent of the language in Sec. 60.7(b) is to have a specific FFS, identified by the sponsor, used at least once in an FAA-approved flight training program for the airplane simulated during the 12-month period described. The identification of the specific FFS may change from one 12-month period to the next 12-month period as long as the sponsor sponsors and uses at least one FFS at least once during the prescribed period. No minimum number of hours or minimum FFS periods are required.</p><p class="depth0">b. The following examples describe acceptable operational practices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Example One.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A sponsor is sponsoring a single, specific FFS for its own use, in its own facility or elsewhere--this single FFS forms the basis for the sponsorship.

Once the initial or upgrade evaluation is complete, the first continuing qualification evaluation will be conducted within 6 months. The 12-month continuing qualification evaluation cycle begins on that date and continues for each subsequent 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> There is no minimum number of hours of FFS use required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The identification of the specific FFS may change from one 12-month period to the next 12-month period as long as the sponsor sponsors and uses at least one FFS at least once during the prescribed period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example Two.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A sponsor sponsors an additional number of FFSs, in its facility or elsewhere.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. Flight test data used to validate FFS performance and handling qualities must have been gathered in accordance with a flight test program containing the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A flight test plan consisting of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The maneuvers and procedures required for aircraft certification and simulation programming and validation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For each maneuver or procedure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The procedures and control input the flight test pilot and/or engineer used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The atmospheric and environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The initial flight conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The airplane configuration, including weight and center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The data to be gathered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All other information necessary to recreate the flight test conditions in the FFS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appropriately qualified flight test personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An understanding of the accuracy of the data to be gathered using appropriate alternative data sources, procedures, and instrumentation that is traceable to a recognized standard as described in Attachment 2, Table A2E of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Appropriate and sufficient data acquisition equipment or system(s), including appropriate data reduction and analysis methods and techniques, as would be acceptable to the FAA's Aircraft Certification Service.</p><p class="depth0">b. The data, regardless of source, must be presented as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In a format that supports the FFS validation process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In a manner that is clearly readable and annotated correctly and completely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With resolution sufficient to determine compliance with the tolerances set forth in Attachment 2, Table A2A of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With any necessary instructions or other details provided, such as yaw damper or throttle position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Without alteration, adjustments, or bias. Data may be corrected to address known data calibration errors provided that an explanation of the methods used to correct the errors appears in the QTG. The corrected data may be re-scaled, digitized, or otherwise manipulated to fit the desired presentation.</p><p class="depth0">c. After completion of any additional flight test, a flight test report must be submitted in support of the validation data. The report must contain sufficient data and rationale to support qualification of the FFS at the level requested.</p><p class="depth0">d. As required by Sec. 60.13(f), the sponsor must notify the NSPM when it becomes aware that an addition to, an amendment to, or a revision of data that may relate to FFS performance or handling characteristics is available. The data referred to in this paragraph is data used to validate the performance, handling qualities, or other characteristics of the aircraft, including data related to any relevant changes occurring after the type certificate was issued. The sponsor must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 10 calendar days, notify the NSPM of the existence of this data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 45 calendar days, notify the NSPM of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The schedule to incorporate this data into the FFS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The reason for not incorporating this data into the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">e. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot tests'' results in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snapshot.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">f. The FFS sponsor is encouraged to maintain a liaison with the manufacturer of the aircraft being simulated (or with the holder of the aircraft type certificate for the aircraft being simulated if the manufacturer is no longer in business), and, if appropriate, with the person having supplied the aircraft data package for the FFS in order to facilitate the notification required by Sec. 60.13(f).</p><p class="depth0">g. It is the intent of the NSPM that for new aircraft entering service, at a point well in advance of preparation of the Qualification Test Guide (QTG), the sponsor should submit to the NSPM for approval, a descriptive document (see Table A2C, Sample Validation Data Roadmap for Airplanes) containing the plan for acquiring the validation data, including data sources. This document should clearly identify sources of data for all required tests, a description of the validity of these data for a specific engine type and thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting the performance or flying qualities of the aircraft. Additionally, this document should provide other information, such as the rationale or explanation for cases where data or data parameters are missing, instances where engineering simulation data are used or where flight test methods require further explanations. It should also provide a brief narrative describing the cause and effect of any deviation from data requirements. The aircraft manufacturer may provide this document.</p><p class="depth0">h. There is no requirement for any flight test data supplier to submit a flight test plan or program prior to gathering flight test data. However, the NSPM notes that inexperienced data gatherers often provide data that is irrelevant, improperly marked, or lacking adequate justification for selection. Other problems include inadequate information regarding initial conditions or test maneuvers. The NSPM has been forced to refuse these data submissions as validation data for an FFS evaluation. It is for this reason that the NSPM recommends that any data supplier not previously experienced in this area review the data necessary for programming and for validating the performance of the FFS, and discuss the flight test plan anticipated for acquiring such data with the NSPM well in advance of commencing the flight tests.</p><p class="depth0">i. The NSPM will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether to approve supplemental

validation data derived from flight data recording systems, such as a Quick Access Recorder or Flight Data Recorder.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

In the event that the NSPM determines that special equipment or specifically qualified persons will be required to conduct an evaluation, the NSPM will make every attempt to notify the sponsor at least one (1) week, but in no case less than 72 hours, in advance of the evaluation. Examples of special equipment include spot photometers, flight control measurement devices, and sound analyzers. Examples of specially qualified personnel include individuals specifically qualified to install or use any special equipment when its use is required.</p><p class="depth0">b.

A convertible FFS is addressed as a separate FFS for each model and series airplane to which it will be converted and for the FAA qualification level sought. If a sponsor seeks qualification for two or more models of an airplane type using a convertible FFS, the sponsor must submit a QTG for each airplane model, or a QTG for the first airplane model and a supplement to that QTG for each additional airplane model. The NSPM will conduct evaluations for each airplane model.</p><p class="depth0">g. Form and manner of presentation of objective test results in the QTG:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor's FFS test results must be recorded in a manner acceptable to the NSPM, that allows easy comparison of the FFS test results to the validation data (e.g., use of a multi-channel recorder, line printer, cross plotting, overlays, transparencies).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FFS results must be labeled using terminology common to airplane parameters as opposed to computer software identifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Validation data documents included in a QTG may be photographically reduced only if such reduction will not alter the graphic scaling or cause difficulties in scale interpretation or resolution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scaling on graphical presentations must provide the resolution necessary to evaluate the parameters shown in Attachment 2, Table A2A of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Tests involving time histories, data sheets (or transparencies thereof) and FFS test results must be clearly marked with appropriate reference points to ensure an accurate comparison between the FFS and the airplane with respect to time. Time histories recorded via a line printer are to be clearly identified for cross plotting on the airplane data. Over-plots must not obscure the reference data.</p><p class="depth0">h. The sponsor may elect to complete the QTG objective and subjective tests at the manufacturer's facility or at the sponsor's training facility. If the tests are conducted at the manufacturer's facility, the sponsor must repeat at least one-third of the tests at the sponsor's training facility in order to substantiate FFS performance. The QTG must be clearly annotated to indicate when and where each test was accomplished. Tests conducted at the manufacturer's facility and at the sponsor's training facility must be conducted after the FFS is assembled with systems and sub-systems functional and operating in an interactive manner. The test results must be submitted to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">i. The sponsor must maintain a copy of the MQTG at the FFS location.</p><p class="depth0">j. All FFSs for which the initial qualification is conducted after May 30, 2014, must have an electronic MQTG (eMQTG) including all objective data obtained from airplane testing, or another approved source (reformatted or digitized), together with correlating objective test results obtained from the performance of the FFS (reformatted or digitized) as prescribed in this appendix. The eMQTG must also contain the general FFS performance or demonstration results (reformatted or digitized) prescribed in this appendix, and a description of the equipment necessary to perform the initial qualification evaluation and the continuing qualification evaluations. The eMQTG must include the original validation data used to validate FFS performance and handling qualities in either the original digitized format from the data supplier or an electronic scan of the

original time-history plots that were provided by the data supplier. A copy of the eMQTG must be provided to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">k. All other FFSs not covered in subparagraph ``j'' must have an electronic copy of the MQTG by May 30, 2014. An electronic copy of the MQTG must be provided to the NSPM. This may be provided by an electronic scan presented in a Portable Document File (PDF), or similar format acceptable to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">l. During the initial (or upgrade) qualification evaluation conducted by the NSPM, the sponsor must also provide a person who is a user of the device (e.g., a qualified pilot or instructor pilot with flight time experience in that aircraft) and knowledgeable about the operation of the aircraft and the operation of the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">m. Only those FFSs that are sponsored by a certificate holder as defined in Appendix F of this part will be evaluated by the NSPM. However, other FFS evaluations may be conducted on a case-by-case basis as the Administrator deems appropriate, but only in accordance with applicable agreements.</p><p class="depth0">n. The NSPM will conduct an evaluation for each configuration, and each FFS must be evaluated as completely as possible. To ensure a thorough and uniform evaluation, each FFS is subjected to the general simulator requirements in Attachment 1 of this appendix, the objective tests listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix, and the subjective tests listed in Attachment 3 of this appendix. The evaluations described herein will include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Airplane responses, including longitudinal and lateral-directional control responses (see Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance in authorized portions of the simulated airplane's operating envelope, to include tasks evaluated by the NSPM in the areas of surface operations, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing as well as abnormal and emergency operations (see Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flight deck configuration (see Attachment 1 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pilot, flight engineer, and instructor station functions checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Airplane systems and sub-systems (as appropriate) as compared to the airplane simulated (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> FFS systems and sub-systems, including force cueing (motion), visual, and aural (sound) systems, as appropriate (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain additional requirements, depending upon the qualification level sought, including equipment or circumstances that may become hazardous to the occupants. The sponsor may be subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.</p><p class="depth0">o. The NSPM administers the objective and subjective tests, which includes an examination of functions. The tests include a qualitative assessment of the FFS by an NSP pilot. The NSP evaluation team leader may assign other qualified personnel to assist in accomplishing the functions examination and/or the objective and subjective tests performed during an evaluation when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Objective tests provide a basis for measuring and evaluating FFS performance and determining compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subjective tests provide a basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluating the capability of the FFS to perform over a typical utilization period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining that the FFS satisfactorily simulates each required task;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Verifying correct operation of the FFS controls, instruments, and systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">p. The tolerances for the test parameters listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix reflect the range of tolerances acceptable to the NSPM for FFS validation and are not to be confused with design tolerances specified for FFS manufacture. In making decisions regarding tests and test results, the NSPM relies on the use of operational and engineering judgment in the application of data (including consideration of the way in which the flight test was flown and the way the data was gathered and applied), data presentations, and the applicable tolerances for each test.</p><p class="depth0">q. In addition to the scheduled continuing qualification evaluation, each FFS is subject to evaluations conducted by the NSPM at any time without prior notification to the sponsor. Such evaluations would be accomplished in a normal manner (i.e., requiring exclusive use of the FFS for the conduct of objective and subjective tests and an examination of functions) if the FFS is not being used for flight crewmember training, testing, or checking. However, if the FFS were being used, the evaluation would be conducted in a non-exclusive manner. This non-exclusive evaluation will be conducted by the FFS evaluator accompanying the check airman, instructor, Aircrew Program Designee (APD), or FAA inspector aboard the FFS along with the student(s) and observing the operation of the FFS during the training, testing, or checking activities.</p><p class="depth0">r. Problems with objective test results are handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a problem with an objective test result is detected by the NSP evaluation team during an evaluation, the test may be repeated or the QTG may be amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If it is determined that the results of an objective test do not support the level requested but do support a lower level, the NSPM may qualify the FFS at that lower level. For example, if a Level D evaluation is requested and the FFS fails to meet sound test tolerances, it could be qualified at Level C.</p><p class="depth0">s. After an FFS is successfully evaluated, the NSPM issues a Statement of Qualification (SOQ) to the sponsor. The NSPM recommends the FFS to the TPAA, who will approve the FFS for use in a flight training program. The SOQ will be issued at the satisfactory conclusion of the initial or continuing qualification evaluation and will list the tasks for which the FFS is qualified, referencing the tasks described in Table A1B in Attachment 1 of this appendix. However, it is the sponsor's responsibility to obtain TPAA approval prior to using the FFS in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">t. Under normal circumstances, the NSPM establishes a date for the initial or upgrade evaluation within ten (10) working days after determining that a complete QTG is acceptable. Unusual circumstances may warrant establishing an evaluation date before this determination is made. A sponsor may schedule an evaluation date as early as 6 months in advance. However, there may be a delay of 45 days or more in rescheduling and completing the evaluation if the sponsor is unable to meet the scheduled date. See Attachment 4 of this appendix, Figure A4A, Sample Request for Initial, Upgrade, or Reinstatement Evaluation.</p><p class="depth0">u. The numbering system used for objective test results in the QTG should closely follow the numbering system set out in Attachment 2 of this appendix, FFS Objective Tests, Table A2A.</p><p class="depth0">v. Contact the NSPM or visit the NSPM Web site for additional information regarding the preferred qualifications of pilots used to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.15(d).</p><p class="depth0">w. Examples of the exclusions for which the FFS might not have been subjectively tested by the sponsor or the NSPM and for which qualification might not be sought or granted, as described in Sec. 60.15(g)(6), include windshear training and circling approaches.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

In instances where a sponsor plans to remove an FFS from active status for a period of less than two years, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The NSPM must be notified in writing and the notification must include an estimate of the period that the FFS will be inactive;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuing Qualification evaluations will not be scheduled during the inactive period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The NSPM will remove the FFS from the list of qualified FSTDs on a mutually established date not later than the date on which the first missed continuing qualification evaluation would have been scheduled;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Before the FFS is restored to qualified status, it must be evaluated by the NSPM. The evaluation content and the time required to accomplish the evaluation is based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and sponsor-conducted quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The sponsor must notify the NSPM of any changes to the original scheduled time out of service;</p><p class="depth0">b. Simulators qualified prior to May 30, 2008, are not required to meet the general simulation requirements, the objective test requirements or the subjective test requirements of attachments 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix as long as the simulator continues to meet the test requirements contained in the MQTG developed under the original qualification basis.</p><p class="depth0">c. After May 30, 2009, each visual scene or airport model beyond the minimum required for the FFS qualification level that is installed in and available for use in a qualified FFS must meet the requirements described in attachment 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">d. Simulators qualified prior to May 30, 2008, may be updated. If an evaluation is deemed appropriate or necessary by the NSPM after such an update, the evaluation will not require an evaluation to standards beyond those against which the simulator was originally qualified.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">e. Other certificate holders or persons desiring to use an FFS may contract with FFS sponsors to use FFSs previously qualified at a particular level for an airplane type and approved for use within an FAA-approved flight training program. Such FFSs are not required to undergo an additional qualification process, except as described in Sec. 60.16.</p><p class="depth0">f. Each FFS user must obtain approval from the appropriate TPAA to use any FFS in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">g. The intent of the requirement listed in Sec. 60.17(b), for each FFS to have a SOQ within 6 years, is to have the availability of that statement (including the configuration list and the limitations to authorizations) to provide a complete picture of the FFS inventory regulated by the FAA. The issuance of the statement will not require any additional evaluation or require any adjustment to the evaluation basis for the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">h. Downgrading of an FFS is a permanent change in qualification level and will necessitate the issuance of a revised SOQ to reflect the revised qualification level, as appropriate. If a temporary restriction is placed on an FFS because of a missing, malfunctioning, or inoperative component or on-going repairs, the restriction is not a permanent change in qualification level. Instead, the restriction is temporary and is removed when the reason for the restriction has been resolved.</p><p class="depth0">i. The NSPM will determine the evaluation criteria for an FFS that has been removed from active status. The criteria will be based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity. For example, if the FFS were out of service for a 1 year period, it would be necessary to complete the entire QTG, since all of the quarterly evaluations would have been missed. The NSPM will also consider how the FFS was stored, whether parts were removed from the FFS and whether the FFS was disassembled.</p><p class="depth0">j. The FFS will normally be requalified using the FAA-approved MQTG and the criteria that was in effect prior to its removal from qualification. However, inactive periods of 2 years or more will require requalification under the standards in effect and current at the time of requalification.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

If the NSP evaluator plans to accomplish specific tests during a normal continuing qualification evaluation that requires the use of special equipment or technicians, the sponsor will be notified as far in advance of the evaluation as practical; but not less than 72 hours. Examples of such tests include latencies, control dynamics, sounds and vibrations, motion, and/or some visual system tests.</p><p class="depth0">h. The continuing qualification evaluations, described in Sec. 60.19(b), will normally require 4 hours of FFS time. However, flexibility is necessary to address abnormal situations or situations involving aircraft with additional levels of complexity (e.g., computer controlled aircraft). The sponsor should anticipate that some tests may require additional time. The continuing qualification evaluations will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review of the results of the quarterly inspections conducted by the sponsor since

the last scheduled continuing qualification evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A selection of approximately 8 to 15 objective tests from the MQTG that provide an adequate opportunity to evaluate the performance of the FFS.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">a. For the purposes of this attachment, the flight conditions specified in the Flight Conditions Column of Table A2A of this appendix, are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ground--on ground, independent of airplane configuration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Take-off--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First segment climb--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position (normally not above 50 ft AGL);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Second segment climb--gear up with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position (normally between 50 ft and 400 ft AGL);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Clean--flaps/slats retracted and gear up;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cruise--clean configuration at cruise altitude and airspeed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Approach--gear up or down with flaps/slats at any normal approach position as recommended by the airplane manufacturer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Landing--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified landing position.</p><p class="depth0">b. The format for numbering the objective tests in Appendix A, Attachment 2, Table A2A, and the objective tests in Appendix B, Attachment 2, Table B2A, is identical. However, each test required for FFSs is not necessarily required for FTDs. Also, each test required for FTDs is not necessarily required for FFSs. Therefore, when a test number (or series of numbers) is not required, the term ``Reserved'' is used in the table at that location. Following this numbering format provides a degree of commonality between the two tables and substantially reduces the potential for confusion when referring to objective test numbers for either FFSs or FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">c. The reader is encouraged to review the Airplane Flight Simulator Evaluation Handbook, Volumes I and II, published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, London, UK, and AC 25-7, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes, and AC 23-8, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Part 23 Airplanes, for references and examples regarding flight testing requirements and techniques.</p><p class="depth0">d. If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector should be clearly noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for the test.</p><p class="depth0">End Information
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The ground and flight tests required for qualification are listed in Table A2A, FFS Objective Tests. Computer generated simulator test results must be provided for each test except where an alternative test is specifically authorized by the NSPM. If a flight condition or operating condition is required for the test but does not apply to the airplane being simulated or to the qualification level sought, it may be disregarded (e.g., an engine out missed approach for a single-engine airplane or a maneuver using reverse thrust for an airplane without reverse thrust capability). Each test result is compared against the validation data described in Sec. 60.13 and in this appendix. Although use of a driver program designed to automatically accomplish the tests is encouraged for all simulators and required for Level C and Level D simulators, it must be possible to conduct each test manually while recording all appropriate parameters. The results must be produced on an appropriate recording device acceptable to the NSPM and must include simulator number, date, time, conditions, tolerances, and appropriate dependent variables portrayed in comparison to the validation data. Time histories are required unless otherwise indicated in Table A2A. All results must be labeled using the tolerances and units given.</p><p class="depth0">b. Table A2A in this attachment sets out the test results required, including the parameters, tolerances, and flight conditions for simulator validation. Tolerances are provided for the listed tests because mathematical modeling and acquisition and development of reference data are often inexact. All tolerances listed in the following tables are applied to simulator performance. When two tolerance values are given for a parameter, the less restrictive may be used unless otherwise indicated. In those cases where a tolerance is expressed only as a percentage, the tolerance percentage applies to the maximum value of that parameter within its normal operating range as measured from the neutral or zero position unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">c. Certain tests included in this attachment must be supported with an SOC. In Table A2A, requirements for SOCs are indicated in the ``Test Details'' column.</p><p class="depth0">d. When operational or engineering judgment is used in making assessments for flight test data applications for simulator validity, such judgment must not be limited to a single parameter. For example, data that exhibit rapid variations of the measured parameters may require interpolations or a ``best fit'' data selection. All relevant parameters related to a given maneuver or flight condition must be provided to allow overall interpretation. When it is difficult or impossible to match simulator to airplane data throughout a time history, differences must be justified by providing a comparison of other related variables for the condition being assessed.</p><p class="depth0">e. It is not acceptable to program the FFS so that the mathematical modeling is correct only at the validation test points. Unless otherwise noted, simulator tests must represent airplane performance and handling qualities at operating weights and centers of gravity (CG) typical of normal operation. If a test is supported by airplane data at one extreme weight or CG, another test supported by airplane data at mid-conditions or as close as possible to the other extreme must be included. Certain tests that are relevant only at one extreme CG or weight condition need not be repeated at the other extreme. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices.</p><p class="depth0">f. When comparing the parameters listed to those of the airplane, sufficient data must also be provided to verify the correct flight condition and airplane configuration

changes. For example, to show that control force is within the parameters for a static stability test, data to show the correct airspeed, power, thrust or torque, airplane configuration, altitude, and other appropriate datum identification parameters must also be given. If comparing short period dynamics, normal acceleration may be used to establish a match to the airplane, but airspeed, altitude, control input, airplane configuration, and other appropriate data must also be given. If comparing landing gear change dynamics, pitch, airspeed, and altitude may be used to establish a match to the airplane, but landing gear position must also be provided. All airspeed values must be properly annotated (e.g., indicated versus calibrated). In addition, the same variables must be used for comparison (e.g., compare inches to inches rather than inches to centimeters).</p><p class="depth0">g. The QTG provided by the sponsor must clearly describe how the simulator will be set up and operated for each test. Each simulator subsystem may be tested independently, but overall integrated testing of the simulator must be accomplished to assure that the total simulator system meets the prescribed standards. A manual test procedure with explicit and detailed steps for completing each test must also be provided.</p><p class="depth0">h. For previously qualified simulators, the tests and tolerances of this attachment may be used in subsequent continuing qualification evaluations for any given test if the sponsor has submitted a proposed MQTG revision to the NSPM and has received NSPM approval.</p><p class="depth0">i. Simulators are evaluated and qualified with an engine model simulating the airplane data supplier's flight test engine. For qualification of alternative engine models (either variations of the flight test engines or other manufacturer's engines) additional tests with the alternative engine models may be required. This attachment contains guidelines for alternative engines.</p><p class="depth0">j. For testing Computer Controlled Aircraft (CCA) simulators, or other highly augmented airplane simulators, flight test data is required for the Normal (N) and/or Non-normal (NN) control states, as indicated in this attachment. Where test results are independent of control state, Normal or Non-normal control data may be used. All tests in Table A2A require test results in the Normal control state unless specifically noted otherwise in the Test Details section following the CCA designation. The NSPM will determine what tests are appropriate for airplane simulation data. When making this determination, the NSPM may require other levels of control state degradation for specific airplane tests. Where Non-normal control states are required, test data must be provided for one or more Non-normal control states, and must include the least augmented state. Where applicable, flight test data must record Normal and Non-normal states for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pilot controller deflections or electronically generated inputs, including location of input; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flight control surface positions unless test results are not affected by, or are independent of, surface positions.</p><p class="depth0">k. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices. FFSs for highly augmented airplanes will be validated both in the unaugmented configuration (or failure state with the maximum permitted degradation in handling qualities) and the augmented configuration. Where various levels of handling qualities result from failure states, validation of the effect of the failure is necessary. Requirements for testing will be mutually agreed to between the sponsor and the NSPM on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">l. Some tests will not be required for airplanes using airplane hardware in the simulator flight deck (e.g., ``side stick controller''). These exceptions are noted in Section 2 ``Handling Qualities'' in Table A2A of this attachment. However, in these cases, the sponsor must provide a statement that the airplane hardware meets the appropriate manufacturer's specifications and the sponsor must have supporting information to that fact available for NSPM review.</p><p class="depth0">m. For objective test purposes, see Appendix F of this part for the definitions of ``Near maximum,'' ``Light,'' and ``Medium'' gross weight.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">n. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot tests'' results in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition should exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">o.

If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector should be clearly noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for test near the ground.</p><p class="depth0">b. The reader is encouraged to review the Airplane Flight Simulator Evaluation Handbook, Volumes I and II, published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, London, UK, and AC 25-7, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes, and AC 23-8, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Part 23 Airplanes, for references and examples regarding flight testing requirements and techniques.</p><p class="depth0">4. Control Dynamics</p><p class="depth0">a. General. The characteristics of an airplane flight control system have a major effect on handling qualities. A significant consideration in pilot acceptability of an airplane is the ``feel'' provided through the flight controls. Considerable effort is expended on airplane feel system design so that pilots will be comfortable and will consider the airplane desirable to fly. In order for an FFS to be representative, it should ``feel'' like the airplane being simulated. Compliance with this requirement is determined by comparing a recording of the control feel dynamics of the FFS to actual airplane measurements in the takeoff, cruise and landing configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recordings such as free response to an impulse or step function are classically used to estimate the dynamic properties of electromechanical systems. In any case, it is only possible to estimate the dynamic properties as a result of being able to estimate true inputs and responses. Therefore, it is imperative that the best possible data be collected since close matching of the FFS control loading system to the airplane system is essential. The required dynamic control tests are described in Table A2A of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For initial and upgrade evaluations, the QPS requires that control dynamics characteristics be measured and recorded directly from the flight controls (Handling Qualities--Table A2A). This procedure is usually accomplished by measuring the free response of the controls using a step or impulse input to excite the system. The procedure should be accomplished in the takeoff, cruise and landing flight conditions and configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For airplanes with irreversible control systems, measurements may be obtained on the ground if proper pitot-static inputs are provided to represent airspeeds typical of those encountered in flight. Likewise, it may be shown that for some airplanes, takeoff, cruise, and landing configurations have like effects. Thus, one may suffice for another. In either case, engineering validation or airplane manufacturer rationale should be submitted as justification for ground tests or for eliminating a configuration. For FFSs requiring static and dynamic tests at the controls, special test fixtures will not be required during initial and upgrade evaluations if the QTG shows both test fixture results and the results of an alternate approach (e.g., computer plots that were produced concurrently and show satisfactory agreement). Repeat of the alternate method during the initial evaluation satisfies this test requirement.</p><p class="depth0">b. Control Dynamics Evaluation. The dynamic properties of control systems are often stated in terms of frequency, damping and a number of other classical measurements. In order to establish a consistent means of validating test results for FFS control loading, criteria are needed that will clearly define the measurement interpretation and the applied tolerances. Criteria are needed for underdamped, critically damped and overdamped systems. In the case of an underdamped system with very light damping, the system may be quantified in terms of frequency and damping. In critically damped or overdamped systems, the frequency and damping are not readily measured from a response time history. Therefore, the following suggested measurements may be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For Level C and D simulators. Tests to verify that control feel dynamics represent the airplane should show that the dynamic damping cycles (free response of the controls) match those of the airplane within specified tolerances. The NSPM recognizes that several different testing methods may be used to verify the control feel dynamic response. The NSPM will consider the merits of testing methods based on reliability and consistency. One acceptable method of evaluating the response and the tolerance to be applied is described below for the underdamped and critically damped cases. A sponsor using this method to comply with the QPS requirements should perform the tests as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Underdamped response. Two measurements are required for the period, the time to first zero crossing (in case a rate limit is present) and the subsequent frequency of oscillation. It is necessary to measure cycles on an individual basis in case there are non-uniform periods in the response. Each period will be independently compared to the respective period of the airplane control system and, consequently, will enjoy the full tolerance specified for that period. The damping tolerance will be applied to overshoots on an individual basis. Care should be taken when applying the tolerance to small

overshoots since the significance of such overshoots becomes questionable. Only those overshoots larger than 5 per cent of the total initial displacement should be considered. The residual band, labeled T(Ad) on Figure A2A is [5 percent of the initial displacement amplitude Ad from the steady state value of the oscillation. Only oscillations outside the residual band are considered significant. When comparing FFS data to airplane data, the process should begin by overlaying or aligning the FFS and airplane steady state values and then comparing amplitudes of oscillation peaks, the time of the first zero crossing and individual periods of oscillation. The FFS should show the same number of significant overshoots to within one when compared against the airplane data. The procedure for evaluating the response is illustrated in Figure A2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Critically damped and overdamped response. Due to the nature of critically damped and overdamped responses (no overshoots), the time to reach 90 percent of the steady state (neutral point) value should be the same as the airplane within [10 percent. Figure A2B illustrates the procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special considerations. Control systems that exhibit characteristics other than classical overdamped or underdamped responses should meet specified tolerances. In addition, special consideration should be given to ensure that significant trends are maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tolerances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following table summarizes the tolerances, T, for underdamped systems, and ``n'' is the sequential period of a full cycle of oscillation.

Alternative method for control dynamics evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An alternative means for validating control dynamics for aircraft with hydraulically powered flight controls and artificial feel systems is by the measurement of control force and rate of movement.

The FAA is open to alternative means such as the one described above. The alternatives should be justified and appropriate to the application. For example, the method described here may not apply to all manufacturers' systems and certainly not to aircraft with reversible control systems. Each case is considered on its own merit on an ad hoc basis. If the FAA finds that alternative methods do not result in satisfactory performance, more conventionally accepted methods will have to be used.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09MY08.001</p><p class="depth0">5. Ground Effect</p><p class="depth0">a. For an FFS to be used for take-off and landing (not applicable to Level A simulators in that the landing maneuver may not be credited in a Level A simulator) it should reproduce the aerodynamic changes that occur in ground effect. The parameters chosen for FFS validation should indicate these changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A dedicated test should be provided that will validate the aerodynamic ground effect characteristics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The organization performing the flight tests may select appropriate test methods and procedures to validate ground effect. However, the flight tests should be performed with enough duration near the ground to sufficiently validate the ground-effect model.</p><p class="depth0">b. The NSPM will consider the merits of testing methods based on reliability and consistency. Acceptable methods of validating ground effect are described below. If other methods are proposed, rationale should be provided to conclude that the tests performed validate the ground-effect model. A sponsor using the methods described below to comply with the QPS requirements should perform the tests as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Level fly-bys. The level fly-bys should be conducted at a minimum of three altitudes within the ground effect, including one at no more than 10% of the wingspan above the ground, one each at approximately 30% and 50% of the wingspan where height refers to main gear tire above the ground. In addition, one level-flight trim condition should be conducted out of ground effect (e.g., at 150% of wingspan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Shallow approach landing. The shallow approach landing should be performed at a glide slope of approximately one degree with negligible pilot activity until flare.</p><p class="depth0">c. The lateral-directional characteristics are also altered by ground effect. For example, because of changes in lift, roll damping is affected. The change in roll damping will affect other dynamic modes usually evaluated for FFS validation. In fact, Dutch roll dynamics, spiral stability, and roll-rate for a given lateral control input are altered by ground effect. Steady heading sideslips will also be affected. These effects should be accounted for in the FFS modeling. Several tests such as crosswind landing, one engine

inoperative landing, and engine failure on take-off serve to validate lateral-directional ground effect since portions of these tests are accomplished as the aircraft is descending through heights above the runway at which ground effect is an important factor.</p><p class="depth0">6. Motion System</p><p class="depth0">a. General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pilots use continuous information signals to regulate the state of the airplane. In concert with the instruments and outside-world visual information, whole-body motion feedback is essential in assisting the pilot to control the airplane dynamics, particularly in the presence of external disturbances. The motion system should meet basic objective performance criteria, and should be subjectively tuned at the pilot's seat position to represent the linear and angular accelerations of the airplane during a prescribed minimum set of maneuvers and conditions. The response of the motion cueing system should also be repeatable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Motion System tests in Section 3 of Table A2A are intended to qualify the FFS motion cueing system from a mechanical performance standpoint. Additionally, the list of motion effects provides a representative sample of dynamic conditions that should be present in the flight simulator. An additional list of representative, training-critical maneuvers, selected from Section 1 (Performance tests), and Section 2 (Handling Qualities tests), in Table A2A, that should be recorded during initial qualification (but without tolerance) to indicate the flight simulator motion cueing performance signature have been identified (reference Section 3.e). These tests are intended to help improve the overall standard of FFS motion cueing.</p><p class="depth0">b. Motion System Checks. The intent of test 3a, Frequency Response, test 3b, Leg Balance, and test 3c, Turn-Around Check, as described in the Table of Objective Tests, is to demonstrate the performance of the motion system hardware, and to check the integrity of the motion set-up with regard to calibration and wear. These tests are independent of the motion cueing software and should be considered robotic tests.</p><p class="depth0">c. Motion System Repeatability. The intent of this test is to ensure that the motion system software and motion system hardware have not degraded or changed over time. This diagnostic test should be completed during continuing qualification checks in lieu of the robotic tests. This will allow an improved ability to determine changes in the software or determine degradation in the hardware. The following information delineates the methodology that should be used for this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Input: The inputs should be such that rotational accelerations, rotational rates, and linear accelerations are inserted before the transfer from airplane center of gravity to pilot reference point with a minimum amplitude of 5 deg/sec/sec, 10 deg/sec and 0.3 g, respectively, to provide adequate analysis of the output.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recommended output:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Actual platform linear accelerations; the output will comprise accelerations due to both the linear and rotational motion acceleration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motion actuators position.</p><p class="depth0">d. Motion Cueing Performance Signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Background. The intent of this test is to provide quantitative time history records of motion system response to a selected set of automated QTG maneuvers during initial qualification. This is not intended to be a comparison of the motion platform accelerations against the flight test recorded accelerations (i.e., not to be compared against airplane cueing). If there is a modification to the initially qualified motion software or motion hardware (e.g., motion washout filter, simulator payload change greater than 10%) then a new baseline may need to be established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test Selection. The conditions identified in Section 3.e. in Table A2A are those maneuvers where motion cueing is the most discernible. They are general tests applicable to all types of airplanes and should be completed for motion cueing performance signature at any time acceptable to the NSPM prior to or during the initial qualification evaluation, and the results included in the MQTG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priority. Motion system should be designed with the intent of placing greater importance on those maneuvers that directly influence pilot perception and control of the airplane motions. For the maneuvers identified in section 3.e. in Table A2A, the flight simulator motion cueing system should have a high tilt co-ordination gain, high rotational gain, and high correlation with respect to the airplane simulation model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Data Recording. The minimum list of parameters provided should allow for the determination of the flight simulator's motion cueing performance signature for the initial qualification evaluation. The following parameters are recommended as being acceptable to perform such a function:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Flight model acceleration and rotational rate commands at the pilot reference point;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motion actuators position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Actual platform position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Actual platform acceleration at pilot reference point.</p><p class="depth0">e. Motion Vibrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Presentation of results. The characteristic motion vibrations may be used to verify that the flight simulator can reproduce the frequency content of the airplane when flown in specific conditions. The test results should be presented as a Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot with frequencies on

the horizontal axis and amplitude on the vertical axis. The airplane data and flight simulator data should be presented in the same format with the same scaling. The algorithms used for generating the flight simulator data should be the same as those used for the airplane data. If they are not the same then the algorithms used for the flight simulator data should be proven to be sufficiently comparable. As a minimum, the results along the dominant axes should be presented and a rationale for not presenting the other axes should be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interpretation of results. The overall trend of the PSD plot should be considered while focusing on the dominant frequencies. Less emphasis should be placed on the differences at the high frequency and low amplitude portions of the PSD plot. During the analysis, certain structural components of the flight simulator have resonant frequencies that are filtered and may not appear in the PSD plot. If filtering is required, the notch filter bandwidth should be limited to 1 Hz to ensure that the buffet feel is not adversely affected. In addition, a rationale should be provided to explain that the characteristic motion vibration is not being adversely affected by the filtering. The amplitude should match airplane data as described below. However, if the PSD plot was altered for subjective reasons, a rationale should be provided to justify the change. If the plot is on a logarithmic scale, it may be difficult to interpret the amplitude of the buffet in terms of acceleration. For example, a 1x10-3 g-rms2/Hz would describe a heavy buffet and may be seen in the deep stall regime. Alternatively, a 1x10-6 g-rms2/Hz buffet is almost not perceivable; but may represent a flap buffet at low speed. The previous two examples differ in magnitude by 1000. On a PSD plot this represents three decades (one decade is a change in order of magnitude of 10; and two decades is a change in order of magnitude of 100).</p><p class="depth0">Note: In the example, ``g-rms2 is the mathematical expression for ``g's root mean squared.''</p><p class="depth0">7. Sound System</p><p class="depth0">a. General. The total sound environment in the airplane is very complex, and changes with atmospheric conditions, airplane configuration, airspeed, altitude, and power settings. Flight deck sounds are an important component of the flight deck operational environment and provide valuable information to the flight crew. These aural cues can either assist the crew (as an indication of an abnormal situation), or hinder the crew (as a distraction or nuisance). For effective training, the flight simulator should provide flight deck sounds that are perceptible to the pilot during normal and abnormal operations, and comparable to those of the airplane. The flight simulator operator should carefully evaluate background noises in the location where the device will be installed. To demonstrate compliance with the sound requirements, the objective or validation tests in this attachment were selected to provide a representative sample of normal static conditions typically experienced by a pilot.</p><p class="depth0">b. Alternate propulsion. For FFS with multiple propulsion configurations, any condition listed in Table A2A of this attachment should be presented for evaluation as part of the QTG if identified by the airplane manufacturer or other data supplier as significantly different due to a change in propulsion system (engine or propeller).</p><p class="depth0">c. Data and Data Collection System.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information provided to the flight simulator manufacturer should be presented in the format suggested by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) ``Flight Simulator Design and Performance Data Requirements,'' as amended. This information should contain calibration and frequency response data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system used to perform the tests listed in Table A2A should comply with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The specifications for octave, half octave, and third octave band filter sets may be found in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S1.11-1986;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measurement microphones should be type WS2 or better, as described in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 1094-4-1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Headsets. If headsets are used during normal operation of the airplane they should also be used during the flight simulator evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Playback equipment. Playback equipment and recordings of the QTG conditions should be provided during initial evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Background noise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Background noise is the noise in the flight simulator that is not associated with the airplane, but is caused by the flight simulator's cooling and hydraulic systems and extraneous noise from other locations in the building. Background noise can seriously impact the correct simulation of airplane sounds and should be kept below the airplane sounds. In some cases, the sound level of the simulation can be increased to compensate for the background noise. However, this approach is limited by the specified tolerances and by the subjective acceptability of the sound environment to the evaluation pilot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The acceptability of the background noise levels is dependent upon the normal sound levels in the airplane being represented. Background noise levels that fall below the lines defined by the following points, may be acceptable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 70 dB @ 50 Hz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 55 dB @ 1000 Hz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 30 dB @ 16 kHz</p><p class="depth0">(Note: These limits are for unweighted \1/3\ octave band sound levels. Meeting these limits for background noise does not ensure an acceptable flight simulator.

Additional Information About Flight Simulator Qualification for New</p><p class="depth0">or Derivative Airplanes</p><p class="depth0">a. Typically, an airplane manufacturer's approved final data for performance, handling qualities, systems or avionics is not available until well after a new or derivative airplane has entered service. However, flight crew training and certification often begins several months prior to the entry of the first airplane into service. Consequently, it may be necessary to use preliminary data provided by the airplane manufacturer for interim qualification of flight simulators.</p><p class="depth0">b. In these cases, the NSPM may accept certain partially validated preliminary airplane and systems data, and early release (``red label'') avionics data in order to permit the necessary program schedule for training, certification, and service introduction.</p><p class="depth0">c. Simulator sponsors seeking qualification based on preliminary data should consult the NSPM to make special arrangements for using preliminary data for flight simulator qualification. The sponsor should also consult the airplane and flight simulator manufacturers to develop a data plan and flight simulator qualification plan.</p><p class="depth0">d. The procedure to be followed to gain NSPM acceptance of preliminary data will vary from case to case and between airplane manufacturers. Each airplane manufacturer's new airplane development and test program is designed to suit the needs of the particular project and may not contain the same events or sequence of events as another manufacturer's program, or even the same manufacturer's program for a different airplane. Therefore, there cannot be a prescribed invariable procedure for acceptance of preliminary data, but instead there should be a statement describing the final sequence of events, data sources, and validation procedures agreed by the simulator sponsor, the airplane manufacturer, the flight simulator manufacturer, and the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A description of airplane manufacturer-provided data needed for flight simulator modeling and validation is to be found in the IATA Document ``Flight Simulator Design and Performance Data Requirements,'' as amended.</p><p class="depth0">e. The preliminary data should be the manufacturer's best representation of the airplane, with assurance that the final data will not significantly deviate from the preliminary estimates. Data derived from these predictive or preliminary techniques should be validated against available sources including, at least, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturer's engineering report. The report should explain the predictive method used and illustrate past success of the method on similar projects. For example, the manufacturer could show the application of the method to an earlier airplane model or predict the characteristics of an earlier model and compare the results to final data for that model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early flight test results. This data is often derived from airplane certification tests, and should be used to maximum advantage for early flight simulator validation. Certain critical tests that would normally be done early in the airplane certification program should be included to validate essential pilot training and certification maneuvers. These include cases where a pilot is expected to cope with an airplane failure mode or an engine failure. Flight test

data that will be available early in the flight test program will depend on the airplane manufacturer's flight test program design and may not be the same in each case. The flight test program of the airplane manufacturer should include provisions for generation of very early flight test results for flight simulator validation.</p><p class="depth0">f. The use of preliminary data is not indefinite. The airplane manufacturer's final data should be available within 12 months after the airplane's first entry into service or as agreed by the NSPM, the simulator sponsor, and the airplane manufacturer. When applying for interim qualification using preliminary data, the simulator sponsor and the NSPM should agree on the update program. This includes specifying that the final data update will be installed in the flight simulator within a period of 12 months following the final data release, unless special conditions exist and a different schedule is acceptable. The flight simulator performance and handling validation would then be based on data derived from flight tests or from other approved sources. Initial airplane systems data should be updated after engineering tests. Final airplane systems data should also be used for flight simulator programming and validation.</p><p class="depth0">g. Flight simulator avionics should stay essentially in step with airplane avionics (hardware and software) updates. The permitted time lapse between airplane and flight simulator updates should be minimal. It may depend on the magnitude of the update and whether the QTG and pilot training and certification are affected. Differences in airplane and flight simulator avionics versions and the resulting effects on flight simulator qualification should be agreed between the simulator sponsor and the NSPM. Consultation with the flight simulator manufacturer is desirable throughout the qualification process.</p><p class="depth0">h. The following describes an example of the design data and sources that might be used in the development of an interim qualification plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan should consist of the development of a QTG based upon a mix of flight test and engineering simulation data. For data collected from specific airplane flight tests or other flights, the required design model or data changes necessary to support an acceptable Proof of Match (POM) should be generated by the airplane manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For proper validation of the two sets of data, the airplane manufacturer should compare their simulation model responses against the flight test data, when driven by the same control inputs and subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as recorded in the flight test. The model responses should result from a simulation where the following systems are run in an integrated fashion and are consistent with the design data released to the flight simulator manufacturer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Propulsion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Aerodynamics;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mass properties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Flight controls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Stability augmentation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Brakes/landing gear.</p><p class="depth0">i.

Background</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tolerances listed in Table A2A of this attachment are designed to measure the quality of the match using flight-test data as a reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Good engineering judgment should be applied to all tolerances in any test.

Validation Data Roadmap</p><p class="depth0">a. Airplane manufacturers or other data suppliers should supply a validation data roadmap (VDR) document as part of the data package. A VDR document contains guidance material from the airplane validation data supplier recommending the best possible sources of data to be used as validation data in the QTG. A VDR is of special value when requesting interim qualification, qualification of simulators for airplanes certificated prior to 1992, and qualification of alternate engine or avionics fits. A sponsor seeking to have a device qualified in accordance with the standards contained in this QPS appendix should submit a VDR to the NSPM as early as possible in the planning stages. The NSPM is the final authority to approve the data to be used as validation material for the QTG. The NSPM and the Joint Aviation Authorities' Synthetic Training Devices Advisory Board have committed to maintain a list of agreed VDRs.</p><p class="depth0">b. The VDR should identify (in matrix format) sources of data for all required tests. It should also provide guidance regarding the validity of these data for a specific engine type, thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting airplane handling qualities and performance. The VDR should include rationale or explanation in cases where data or parameters are missing, engineering simulation data are to be used, flight test methods require explanation, or there is any deviation from data requirements. Additionally, the document should refer to other appropriate sources of validation data (e.g., sound and vibration data documents).</p><p class="depth0">c. The Sample Validation Data Roadmap (VDR) for airplanes, shown in Table A2C, depicts a generic roadmap matrix identifying sources of validation data for an abbreviated list of tests. This document is merely a sample and does not provide actual data. A complete matrix should address all test conditions and provide actual data and data sources.</p><p class="depth0">d. Two examples of rationale pages are presented in Appendix F of the IATA ``Flight Simulator Design and Performance Data Requirements.'' These illustrate the type of airplane and avionics configuration information and descriptive engineering rationale used to describe data anomalies or provide an acceptable basis for using alternative data for QTG validation requirements.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

The QTG should also include an explanation of the nature of the change and its effect on the airplane response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For an avionics change to a contributory system that significantly affects some tests in the QTG or where new functionality is added, the QTG should be based on validation data from the previously validated avionics configuration and supplemental avionics-specific flight test data sufficient to validate the alternate avionics revision. Additional flight test validation data may not be needed if the avionics changes were certified without the need for testing with a comprehensive flight instrumentation package. The airplane manufacturer should coordinate flight simulator data requirements, in advance with the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A matrix or ``roadmap'' should be provided with the QTG indicating the appropriate validation data source for each test. The roadmap should include identification of the revision state of those contributory avionics systems that could affect specific test responses if changed.</p><p class="depth0">15. Transport Delay Testing</p><p class="depth0">a. This paragraph explains how to determine the introduced transport delay through the flight simulator system so that it does not exceed a specific time delay. The transport delay should be measured from control inputs through the interface, through each of the host computer modules and back through the interface to motion, flight instrument, and visual systems. The transport delay should not exceed the maximum allowable interval.</p><p class="depth0">b. Four specific examples of transport delay are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Simulation of classic non-computer controlled aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Simulation of computer controlled aircraft using real airplane black boxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Simulation of computer controlled aircraft using software emulation of airplane boxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Simulation using software avionics or re-hosted instruments.</p><p class="depth0">c. Figure A2C illustrates the total transport delay for a non-computer-controlled airplane or the classic transport delay test. Since there are no airplane-induced delays for this case, the total transport delay is equivalent to the introduced delay.</p><p class="depth0">d. Figure A2D illustrates the transport delay testing method using the real airplane controller system.</p><p class="depth0">e. To obtain the induced transport delay for the motion, instrument and visual signal, the delay induced by the airplane controller should be subtracted from the total transport delay. This difference represents the introduced delay and should not exceed the standards prescribed in Table A1A.</p><p class="depth0">f. Introduced transport delay is measured from the flight deck control input to the reaction of the instruments and motion and visual systems (See Figure A2C).</p><p class="depth0">g. The control input may also be introduced after the airplane controller system and the introduced transport delay measured directly from the control input to the reaction of the instruments, and simulator motion and visual systems (See Figure A2D).</p><p class="depth0">h. Figure A2E illustrates the transport delay testing method used on a flight simulator that uses a software emulated airplane controller system.</p><p class="depth0">i. It is not possible to measure the introduced transport delay using the simulated airplane controller system architecture for the pitch, roll and yaw axes. Therefore, the signal should be measured directly from the pilot controller. The flight simulator manufacturer should measure the total transport delay and subtract the inherent delay of the actual airplane components because the real airplane controller system has an inherent delay provided by the airplane manufacturer. The flight simulator manufacturer should ensure that the introduced delay does not exceed the standards prescribed in Table A1A.</p><p class="depth0">j. Special measurements for instrument signals for flight simulators using a real airplane instrument display system instead of a simulated or re-hosted display. For flight instrument systems, the total transport delay should be measured and the inherent delay of the actual airplane components subtracted to ensure that the introduced delay does not exceed the standards prescribed in Table A1A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Figure A2FA illustrates the transport delay procedure without airplane display simulation. The introduced delay consists of the delay between the control movement and the instrument change on the data bus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Figure A2FB illustrates the modified testing method required to measure introduced delay due to software avionics or re-hosted instruments. The total simulated instrument transport delay is measured and the airplane delay should be subtracted from this total. This difference represents the introduced delay and should not exceed the standards prescribed in Table A1A. The inherent delay of the airplane between the data bus and the displays is indicated in figure A2FA. The display manufacturer should provide this delay time.</p><p class="depth0">k. Recorded signals. The signals recorded to conduct the transport delay calculations should be explained on a schematic block diagram. The flight simulator manufacturer should also provide an explanation of why each signal was selected and how they relate to the above descriptions.</p><p class="depth0">l. Interpretation of results. Flight simulator results vary over time from test to test due to ``sampling uncertainty.'' All flight simulators run at a specific rate where all

modules are executed sequentially in the host computer. The flight controls input can occur at any time in the iteration, but these data will not be processed before the start of the new iteration. For example, a flight simulator running at 60 Hz may have a difference of as much as 16.67 msec between test results. This does not mean that the test has failed. Instead, the difference is attributed to variations in input processing. In some conditions, the host simulator and the visual system do not run at the same iteration rate, so the output of the host computer to the visual system will not always be synchronized.</p><p class="depth0">m. The transport delay test should account for both daylight and night modes of operation of the visual system. In both cases, the tolerances prescribed in Table A1A must be met and the motion response should occur before the end of the first video scan containing new information.

Test results are carefully reviewed to determine if the test is within the specified tolerances. This can be a time consuming process, particularly when reference data exhibits rapid variations or an apparent anomaly requiring engineering judgment in the application of the tolerances. In these cases, the solution is to compare the results to the MQTG. The continuing qualification results are compared to the results in the MQTG for acceptance. The flight simulator operator and the NSPM should look for any change in the flight simulator performance since initial qualification.</p><p class="depth0">b.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">b. It has become standard practice for experienced simulator manufacturers to use modeling techniques to establish data bases for new simulator configurations while awaiting the availability of actual flight test data. The data generated from the aerodynamic modeling techniques is then compared to the flight test data when it becomes available. The results of such comparisons have become increasingly consistent, indicating that these techniques, applied with the appropriate experience, are dependable and accurate for the development of aerodynamic models for use in Level A and Level B simulators.</p><p class="depth0">c. Based on this history of successful comparisons, the NSPM has concluded that those who are experienced in the development of aerodynamic models may use modeling techniques to alter the method for acquiring flight test data for Level A or Level B simulators.</p><p class="depth0">d. The information in Table A2E (Alternative Data Sources, Procedures, and Instrumentation) is presented to describe an acceptable alternative to data sources for simulator modeling and validation and an acceptable alternative to the procedures and instrumentation traditionally used to gather such modeling and validation data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative data sources that may be used for part or all of a data requirement are the Airplane Maintenance Manual, the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Airplane Design Data, the Type Inspection Report (TIR), Certification Data or acceptable supplemental flight test data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sponsor should coordinate with the NSPM prior to using alternative data sources in a flight test or data gathering effort.</p><p class="depth0">e. The NSPM position regarding the use of these alternative data sources, procedures, and instrumentation is based on the following presumptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data gathered through the alternative means does not require angle of attack (AOA) measurements or control surface position measurements for any flight test. However, AOA can be sufficiently derived if the flight test program ensures the collection of acceptable level, unaccelerated, trimmed flight data. All of the simulator time history tests that begin in level, unaccelerated, and trimmed flight, including the three basic trim tests and ``fly-by'' trims, can be a successful validation of angle of attack by comparison with flight test pitch angle. (Note: Due to the criticality of angle of attack in the development of the ground effects model, particularly critical for normal landings and landings involving cross-control input applicable to Level B simulators, stable ``fly-by'' trim data will be the acceptable norm for normal and cross-control input landing objective data for these applications.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The use of a rigorously defined and fully mature simulation controls system model that includes accurate gearing and cable stretch characteristics (where applicable), determined from actual aircraft measurements.

If fictional airports are used, the sponsor must ensure that navigational aids and all appropriate maps, charts, and other navigational reference material for the fictional airports (and surrounding areas as necessary) are compatible, complete, and accurate with respect to the visual presentation of the airport model of this fictional airport. An SOC must be submitted that addresses navigation aid installation and performance and other criteria (including obstruction clearance protection) for all instrument approaches to the fictional airports that are available in the simulator. The SOC must reference and account for information in the terminal instrument procedures manual and the construction and availability of the required maps, charts, and other navigational material. This material must be clearly marked ``for training purposes only.''</p><p class="depth0">c. When the simulator is being used by an instructor or evaluator for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter, only airport models classified as Class I, Class II, or Class III may be used by the instructor or evaluator. Detailed descriptions/definitions of these classifications are found in Appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">d. When a person sponsors an FFS maintained by a person other than a U.S. certificate holder, the sponsor is accountable for that FFS originally meeting, and continuing to meet, the criteria under which it was originally qualified and the appropriate Part 60 criteria, including the airport models that may be used by instructors or evaluators for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">e. Neither Class II nor Class III airport visual models are required to appear on the SOQ, and the method used for keeping instructors and evaluators apprised of the airport models that meet Class II or Class III requirements on any given simulator is at the option of the sponsor, but the method used must be available for review by the TPAA.</p><p class="depth0">f. When an airport model represents a real world airport and a permanent change is made to that real world airport (e.g., a new runway, an extended taxiway, a new lighting system, a runway closure) without a written extension grant from the NSPM (described in paragraph 1.g. of this section), an update to that airport model must be made in accordance with the following time limits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a new airport runway, a runway extension, a new airport taxiway, a taxiway extension, or a runway/taxiway closure--within 90 days of the opening for use of the new airport runway, runway extension, new airport taxiway, or taxiway extension; or within 90 days of the closure of the runway or taxiway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a new or modified approach light system--within 45 days of the activation of the new or modified approach light system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For other facility or structural changes on the airport (e.g., new terminal, relocation of Air Traffic Control Tower)--within 180 days of the opening of the new or changed facility or structure.</p><p class="depth0">g. If a sponsor desires an extension to the time limit for an update to a visual scene or airport model or has an objection to what must be updated in the specific airport model requirement, the sponsor must provide a written extension request to the NSPM stating the reason for the update delay and a proposed completion date, or explain why the update is not necessary (i.e., why the identified airport change will not have an impact on flight training, testing, or checking). A copy of this request or objection must also be sent to the POI/TCPM. The NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM. If there is an objection, after consultation with the appropriate POI/TCPM regarding the training, testing, or checking impact, the NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">2. Discussion</p><p class="depth0">a. The subjective tests provide a basis for evaluating the capability of the simulator to perform over a typical utilization period; determining that the simulator accurately simulates each required maneuver, procedure, or task; and verifying correct operation of the simulator controls, instruments, and systems. The items listed in the following Tables are for simulator evaluation purposes only. They may not be used to limit or exceed the authorizations for use of a given level of simulator, as described on the SOQ, or as approved by the TPAA.</p><p class="depth0">b. The tests in Table A3A, Operations Tasks, in this attachment, address pilot functions, including maneuvers and procedures (called flight tasks), and are divided by

flight phases. The performance of these tasks by the NSPM includes an operational examination of the visual system and special effects. There are flight tasks included to address some features of advanced technology airplanes and innovative training programs. For example, ``high angle-of-attack maneuvering'' is included to provide a required alternative to ``approach to stalls'' for airplanes employing flight envelope protection functions.</p><p class="depth0">c. The tests in Table A3A, Operations Tasks, and Table A3G, Instructor Operating Station of this attachment, address the overall function and control of the simulator including the various simulated environmental conditions; simulated airplane system operations (normal, abnormal, and emergency); visual system displays; and special effects necessary to meet flight crew training, evaluation, or flight experience requirements.</p><p class="depth0">d. All simulated airplane systems functions will be assessed for normal and, where appropriate, alternate operations. Normal, abnormal, and emergency operations associated with a flight phase will be assessed during the evaluation of flight tasks or events within that flight phase. Simulated airplane systems are listed separately under ``Any Flight Phase'' to ensure appropriate attention to systems checks. Operational navigation systems (including inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, or other long-range systems) and the associated electronic display systems will be evaluated if installed. The NSP pilot will include in his report to the TPAA, the effect of the system operation and any system limitation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Simulators demonstrating a satisfactory circling approach will be qualified for the circling approach maneuver and may be approved for such use by the TPAA in the sponsor's FAA-approved flight training program. To be considered satisfactory, the circling approach will be flown at maximum gross weight for landing, with minimum visibility for the airplane approach category, and must allow proper alignment with a landing runway at least 90 different from the instrument approach course while allowing the pilot to keep an identifiable portion of the airport in sight throughout the maneuver (reference--14 CFR 91.175(e)).</p><p class="depth0">f. At the request of the TPAA, the NSPM may assess a device to determine if it is capable of simulating certain training activities in a sponsor's training program, such as a portion of a Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) scenario. Unless directly related to a requirement for the qualification level, the results of such an evaluation would not affect the qualification level of the simulator. However, if the NSPM determines that the simulator does not accurately simulate that training activity, the simulator would not be approved for that training activity.</p><p class="depth0">g. The FAA intends to allow the use of Class III airport models when the sponsor provides the TPAA (or other regulatory authority) an appropriate analysis of the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) necessary for competent performance of the tasks in which this particular media element is used. The analysis should describe the ability of the FFS/visual media to provide an adequate environment in which the required SKAs are satisfactorily performed and learned. The analysis should also include the specific media element, such as the airport model. Additional sources of information on the conduct of task and capability analysis may be found on the FAA's Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) Web site at: http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/aqp/.</p><p class="depth0">h. The TPAA may accept Class III airport models without individual observation provided the sponsor provides the TPAA with an acceptable description of the process for determining the acceptability of a specific airport model, outlines the conditions under which such an airport model may be used, and adequately describes what restrictions will be applied to each resulting airport or landing area model. Examples of situations that may warrant Class--III model designation by the TPAA include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Training, testing, or checking on very low visibility operations, including SMGCS operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instrument operations training (including instrument takeoff, departure, arrival, approach, and missed approach training, testing, or checking) using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A specific model that has been geographically ``moved'' to a different location and aligned with an instrument procedure for another airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A model that does not match changes made at the real-world airport (or landing area for helicopters) being modeled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A model generated with an ``off-board'' or an ``on-board'' model development tool (by providing proper latitude/longitude reference; correct runway or landing area orientation, length, width, marking, and lighting information; and appropriate adjacent taxiway location) to generate a facsimile of a real world airport or landing area.</p><p class="depth0">i. Previously qualified simulators with certain early generation Computer Generated Image (CGI) visual systems, are limited by the capability of the Image Generator or the display system used. These systems are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Early CGI visual systems that are excepted from the requirement of including runway numbers as a part of the specific runway marking requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Link NVS and DNVS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Novoview 2500 and 6000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> FlightSafety VITAL series up to, and including, VITAL III, but not beyond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Redifusion SP1, SP1T, and SP2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early CGI visual systems are excepted from the requirement of including runway numbers unless the runways are used for LOFT training sessions. These LOFT airport models require runway numbers but only for the specific runway end (one direction) used in the LOFT session. The systems required to display runway numbers only for LOFT scenes are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> FlightSafety VITAL IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Redifusion SP3 and SP3T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Link-Miles Image II.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following list of previously qualified CGI and display systems are incapable of generating blue lights. These systems are not required to have accurate taxi-way edge lighting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Redifusion SP1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> FlightSafety Vital IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Link-Miles Image II and Image IIT</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> XKD displays (even though the XKD image generator is capable of generating blue colored lights, the display cannot accommodate that color).</p><p class="depth0">End Information

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">a. The following is an example test schedule for an Initial/Upgrade evaluation that covers the majority of the requirements set out in the Functions and Subjective test requirements. It is not intended that the schedule be followed line by line, rather, the example should be used as a guide for preparing a schedule that is tailored to the airplane, sponsor, and training task.</p><p class="depth0">b. Functions and subjective tests should be planned. This information has been organized as a reference document with the considerations, methods, and evaluation notes for each individual aspect of the simulator task presented as an individual item. In this way the evaluator can design his or her own test plan, using the appropriate sections to provide guidance on method and evaluation criteria. Two aspects should be present in any test plan structure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An evaluation of the simulator to determine that it replicates the aircraft and performs reliably for an uninterrupted period equivalent to the length of a typical training session.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The simulator should be capable of operating reliably after the use of training device functions such as repositions or malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">c. A detailed understanding of the training task will naturally lead to a list of objectives that the simulator should meet. This list will form the basis of the test plan. Additionally, once the test plan has been formulated, the initial conditions and the evaluation criteria should be established. The evaluator should consider all factors that may have an influence on the characteristics observed during particular training tasks in order to make the test plan successful.</p><p class="depth0">2.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability</p><p class="depth0">This attachment applies to all simulators, regardless of qualification level, that are used to satisfy the training requirements of an FAA-approved low-altitude windshear flight training program, or any FAA-approved training program that addresses windshear encounters.</p><p class="depth0">2. Statement of Compliance and Capability (SOC)</p><p class="depth0">a. The sponsor must submit an SOC confirming that the aerodynamic model is based on flight test data supplied by the airplane manufacturer or other approved data provider. The SOC must also confirm that any change to environmental wind parameters, including variances in those parameters for windshear conditions, once inserted for computation, result in the correct simulated performance. This statement must also include examples of environmental wind parameters currently evaluated in the simulator (such as crosswind takeoffs, crosswind approaches, and crosswind landings).</p><p class="depth0">b. For simulators without windshear warning, caution, or guidance hardware in the original equipment, the SOC must also state that the simulation of the added hardware and/or software, including associated flight deck displays and annunciations, replicates the system(s) installed in the airplane. The statement must be accompanied by a block diagram depicting the input and output signal flow, and comparing the signal flow to the equipment installed in the airplane.</p><p class="depth0">3. Models</p><p class="depth0">The windshear models installed in the simulator software used for the qualification evaluation must do the following:</p><p class="depth0">a. Provide cues necessary for recognizing windshear onset and potential performance degradation requiring a pilot to initiate recovery procedures. The cues must include all of the following, as appropriate for the portion of the flight envelope:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rapid airspeed change of at least [15 knots (kts).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stagnation of airspeed during the takeoff roll.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rapid vertical speed change of at least [500 feet per minute (fpm).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rapid pitch change of at least [5.</p><p class="depth0">b. Be adjustable in intensity (or other parameter to achieve an intensity effect) to at

least two (2) levels so that upon encountering the windshear the pilot may identify its presence and apply the recommended procedures for escape from such a windshear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the intensity is lesser, the performance capability of the simulated airplane in the windshear permits the pilot to maintain a satisfactory flightpath; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the intensity is greater, the performance capability of the simulated airplane in the windshear does not permit the pilot to maintain a satisfactory flightpath (crash). Note: The means used to accomplish the ``nonsurvivable'' scenario of paragraph 3.b.(2) of this attachment, that involve operational elements of the simulated airplane, must reflect the dispatch limitations of the airplane.</p><p class="depth0">c. Be available for use in the FAA-approved windshear flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">4. Demonstrations</p><p class="depth0">a. The sponsor must identify one survivable takeoff windshear training model and one survivable approach windshear training model. The wind components of the survivable models must be presented in graphical format so that all components of the windshear are shown, including initiation point, variance in magnitude, and time or distance correlations. The simulator must be operated at the same gross weight, airplane configuration, and initial airspeed during the takeoff demonstration (through calm air and through the first selected survivable windshear), and at the same gross weight, airplane configuration, and initial airspeed during the approach demonstration (through calm air and through the second selected survivable windshear).</p><p class="depth0">b. In each of these four situations, at an ``initiation point'' (i.e., where windshear onset is or should be recognized), the recommended procedures for windshear recovery are applied and the results are recorded as specified in paragraph 5 of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0">c. These recordings are made without inserting programmed random turbulence. Turbulence that results from the windshear model is to be expected, and no attempt may be made to neutralize turbulence from this source.</p><p class="depth0">d. The definition of the models and the results of the demonstrations of all four?(4) cases described in paragraph 4.a of this attachment, must be made a part of the MQTG.</p><p class="depth0">5. Recording Parameters</p><p class="depth0">a. In each of the four MQTG cases, an electronic recording (time history) must be made of the following parameters:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indicated or calibrated airspeed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indicated vertical speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pitch attitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indicated or radio altitude.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Angle of attack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Elevator position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Engine data (thrust, N1, or throttle position).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Wind magnitudes (simple windshear model assumed).</p><p class="depth0">b. These recordings must be initiated at least 10 seconds prior to the initiation point, and continued until recovery is complete or ground contact is made.</p><p class="depth0">6. Equipment Installation and Operation</p><p class="depth0">All windshear warning, caution, or guidance hardware installed in the simulator must operate as it operates in the airplane. For example, if a rapidly changing wind speed and/or direction would have caused a windshear warning in the airplane, the simulator must respond equivalently without instructor/evaluator intervention.</p><p class="depth0">7. Qualification Test Guide</p><p class="depth0">a. All QTG material must be forwarded to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">b. A simulator windshear evaluation will be scheduled in accordance with normal procedures. Continuing qualification evaluation schedules will be used to the maximum extent possible.</p><p class="depth0">c. During the on-site evaluation, the evaluator will ask the operator to run the performance tests and record the results. The results of these on-site tests will be compared to those results previously approved and placed in the QTG or MQTG, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">d. QTGs for new (or MQTGs for upgraded) simulators must contain or reference the information described in paragraphs 2, 3, 4, and 5 of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">8. Subjective Evaluation</p><p class="depth0">The NSPM will fly the simulator in at least two of the available windshear scenarios to subjectively evaluate simulator performance as it encounters the programmed windshear conditions.</p><p class="depth0">a. One scenario will include parameters that enable the pilot to maintain a satisfactory flightpath.</p><p class="depth0">b. One scenario will include parameters that will not enable the pilot to maintain a satisfactory flightpath (crash).</p><p class="depth0">c. Other scenarios may be examined at the NSPM's discretion.</p><p class="depth0">9. Qualification Basis</p><p class="depth0">The addition of windshear programming to a simulator in order to comply with the qualification for required windshear training

does not change the original qualification basis of the simulator.</p><p class="depth0">10. Demonstration Repeatability</p><p class="depth0">For the purposes of demonstration repeatability, it is recommended that the simulator be flown by means of the simulator's autodrive function (for those simulators that have autodrive capability) during the demonstrations.</p><p class="depth0">End Information
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Attachment 6 to Appendix A to Part 60--FSTD Directives Applicable to</p><p class="depth0">Airplane Flight Simulators</p><p class="depth0">Flight Simulation Training Device (FSTD) Directive</p><p class="depth0">FSTD Directive 1. Applicable to all Full Flight Simulators (FFS), regardless of the original qualification basis and qualification date (original or upgrade), having Class II or Class III airport models available.</p><p class="depth0">Agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT.</p><p class="depth0">Action: This is a retroactive requirement to have all Class II or Class III airport models meet current requirements.________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Summary: Notwithstanding the authorization listed in paragraph 13b in Appendices A and C of this part, this FSTD Directive requires each certificate holder to ensure that by May 30, 2009, except for the airport model(s) used to qualify the simulator at the designated level, each airport model used by the certificate holder's instructors or evaluators for training, checking, or testing under this chapter in an FFS, meets the definition of a Class II or Class III airport model as defined in 14CFR part 60. The completion of this requirement will not require a report, and the method used for keeping instructors and evaluators apprised of the airport models that meet Class II or Class III requirements on any given simulator is at the option of the certificate holder whose employees are using the FFS, but the method used must be available for review by the TPAA for that certificate holder.</p><p class="depth0">Dates: FSTD Directive 1 becomes effective on May 30, 2008.</p><p class="depth0">For Further Information Contact: Ed Cook, Senior Advisor to the Division Manager, Air Transportation Division, AFS-200, 800 Independence Ave, SW., Washington, DC 20591; telephone: (404) 832-4701; fax: (404) 761-8906.</p><p class="depth0">Specific Requirements:</p><p class="depth0">1. Part 60 requires that each FSTD be:</p><p class="depth0">a. Sponsored by a person holding or applying for an FAA operating certificate under Part 119, Part 141, or Part 142, or holding or applying for an FAA-approved training program under Part 63, Appendix C, for flight engineers, and</p><p class="depth0">b. Evaluated and issued an SOQ for a specific FSTD level.</p><p class="depth0">2. FFSs also require the installation of a visual system that is capable of providing an out-of-the-flight-deck view of airport models. However, historically these airport models were not routinely evaluated or required to meet any standardized criteria. This has led to qualified simulators containing airport models being used to meet FAA-approved training, testing, or checking requirements with potentially incorrect or inappropriate visual references.</p><p class="depth0">3. To prevent this from occurring in the future, by May 30, 2009, except for the airport model(s) used to qualify the simulator at the designated level, each certificate holder must assure that each airport model used for training, testing, or checking under this chapter in a qualified FFS meets the definition of a Class II or Class III airport model as defined in Appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">4. These references describe the requirements for visual scene management and the minimum distances from which runway or landing area features must be visible for all levels of simulator. The airport model must provide, for each ``in-use runway'' or ``in-use landing area,'' runway or landing area surface and markings, runway or landing area lighting, taxiway surface and markings, and taxiway lighting. Additional requirements include correlation of the v airport models with other aspects of the airport environment, correlation of the aircraft and associated equipment, scene quality assessment features, and the control of these models the instructor must be able to exercise.</p><p class="depth0">5. For circling approaches, all requirements of this section apply to the runway used for the initial approach and to the runway of intended landing.</p><p class="depth0">6. The details in these models must be developed using airport pictures, construction drawings and maps, or other similar data, or developed in accordance with published regulatory material. However, this FSTD DIRECTIVE 1 does not require that airport models contain details that are beyond the initially designed capability of the visual system, as currently qualified. The recognized limitations to visual systems are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Visual systems not required to have runway numbers as a part of the specific runway marking requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Link NVS and DNVS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Novoview 2500 and 6000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FlightSafety VITAL series up to, and including, VITAL III, but not beyond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Redifusion SP1, SP1T, and SP2.</p><p class="depth0">b. Visual systems required to display runway numbers only for LOFT scenes are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> FlightSafety VITAL IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Redifusion SP3 and SP3T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Link-Miles Image II.</p><p class="depth0">c. Visual systems not required to have accurate taxiway edge lighting are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Redifusion SP1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FlightSafety Vital IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Link-Miles Image II and Image IIT</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> XKD displays (even though the XKD image generator is capable of generating blue colored lights, the display cannot accommodate that color).</p><p class="depth0">7. A copy of this Directive must be filed in the MQTG in the designated FSTD Directive Section, and its inclusion must be annotated on the Index of Effective FSTD Directives chart. See Attachment 4, Appendices A through D for a sample MQTG Index of Effective FSTD Directives chart.

The FTD sponsor is encouraged to maintain a liaison with the manufacturer of the aircraft being simulated (or with the holder of the aircraft type certificate for the aircraft being simulated if the manufacturer is no longer in business), and if appropriate, with the person having supplied the aircraft data package for the FTD in order to facilitate the notification described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">g. It is the intent of the NSPM that for new aircraft entering service, at a point well in advance of preparation of the QTG, the sponsor should submit to the NSPM for approval, a descriptive document (see Appendix A, Table A2C, Sample Validation Data Roadmap for Airplanes) containing the plan for acquiring the validation data, including data sources. This document should clearly identify sources of data for all required tests, a description of the validity of these data for a specific engine type and thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting the performance or flying qualities of the aircraft. Additionally, this document should provide other information such as the rationale or explanation for cases where data or data parameters are missing, instances where engineering simulation data are used, or where flight test methods require further explanations. It should also provide a brief narrative describing the cause and effect of any deviation from data requirements. The aircraft manufacturer may provide this document.</p><p class="depth0">h. There is no requirement for any flight test data supplier to submit a flight test

plan or program prior to gathering flight test data. However, the NSPM notes that inexperienced data gatherers often provide data that is irrelevant, improperly marked, or lacking adequate justification for selection. Other problems include inadequate information regarding initial conditions or test maneuvers. The NSPM has been forced to refuse these data submissions as validation data for an FTD evaluation. It is for this reason that the NSPM recommends that any data supplier not previously experienced in this area review the data necessary for programming and for validating the performance of the FTD and discuss the flight test plan anticipated for acquiring such data with the NSPM well in advance of commencing the flight tests.</p><p class="depth0">i.

The sponsor may elect to complete the QTG objective and subjective tests at the manufacturer's facility or at the sponsor's training facility. If the tests are conducted at the manufacturer's facility, the sponsor must repeat at least one-third of the tests at the sponsor's training facility in order to substantiate FTD performance. The QTG must be clearly annotated to indicate when and where each test was accomplished. Tests conducted at the manufacturer's facility and at the sponsor's training facility must be conducted after the FTD is assembled with systems and sub-systems functional and operating in an interactive manner. The test results must be submitted to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">i. The sponsor must maintain a copy of the MQTG at the FTD location.</p><p class="depth0">j.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">m. Only those FTDs that are sponsored by a certificate holder as defined in Appendix F will be evaluated by the NSPM. However, other FTD evaluations may be conducted on a case-by-case basis as the Administrator deems appropriate, but only in accordance with applicable agreements.</p><p class="depth0">n. The NSPM will conduct an evaluation for each configuration, and each FTD must be evaluated as completely as possible. To ensure a thorough and uniform evaluation, each FTD is subjected to the general FTD requirements in Attachment 1 of this appendix, the objective tests listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix, and the subjective tests listed in Attachment 3 of this appendix. The evaluations described herein will include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Airplane responses, including longitudinal and lateral-directional control responses (see Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance in authorized portions of the simulated airplane's operating envelope, to include tasks evaluated by the NSPM in the areas of surface operations, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach and landing, as well as abnormal and emergency operations (see Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flight deck configuration (see Attachment 1 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pilot, flight engineer, and instructor station functions checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Airplane systems and sub-systems (as appropriate) as compared to the airplane simulated (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> FTD systems and sub-systems, including force cueing (motion), visual, and aural (sound) systems, as appropriate (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain additional requirements, depending upon the qualification level sought, including equipment or circumstances that may become hazardous to the occupants. The sponsor may be subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.</p><p class="depth0">o. The NSPM administers the objective and subjective tests, which includes an examination of functions. The tests include a qualitative assessment of the FTD by an NSP pilot. The NSP evaluation team leader may assign other qualified personnel to assist in accomplishing the functions examination and/or the objective and subjective tests performed during an evaluation when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Objective tests provide a basis for measuring and evaluating FTD performance and determining compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subjective tests provide a basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluating the capability of the FTD to perform over a typical utilization period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining that the FTD satisfactorily simulates each required task;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Verifying correct operation of the FTD controls, instruments, and systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">p. The tolerances for the test parameters listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix reflect the range of tolerances acceptable to the NSPM for FTD validation and are not to be confused with design tolerances specified for FTD manufacture. In making decisions regarding tests and test results, the NSPM relies on the use of operational and engineering judgment in the application of data (including consideration of the way in which the flight test was flown and way the data was gathered and applied), data presentations, and the applicable tolerances for each test.</p><p class="depth0">q. In addition to the scheduled continuing qualification evaluation, each FTD is subject to evaluations conducted by the NSPM at any time without prior notification to the

sponsor. Such evaluations would be accomplished in a normal manner (i.e., requiring exclusive use of the FTD for the conduct of objective and subjective tests and an examination of functions) if the FTD is not being used for flight crewmember training, testing, or checking. However, if the FTD were being used, the evaluation would be conducted in a non-exclusive manner. This non-exclusive evaluation will be conducted by the FTD evaluator accompanying the check airman, instructor, Aircrew Program Designee (APD), or FAA inspector aboard the FTD along with the student(s) and observing the operation of the FTD during the training, testing, or checking activities.</p><p class="depth0">r. Problems with objective test results are handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a problem with an objective test result is detected by the NSP evaluation team during an evaluation, the test may be repeated or the QTG may be amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If it is determined that the results of an objective test do not support the qualification level requested but do support a lower level, the NSPM may qualify the FTD at a lower level. For example, if a Level 6 evaluation is requested, but the FTD fails to meet the spiral stability test tolerances, it could be qualified at Level 5.</p><p class="depth0">s. After an FTD is successfully evaluated, the NSPM issues an SOQ to the sponsor, the NSPM recommends the FTD to the TPAA, who will approve the FTD for use in a flight training program. The SOQ will be issued at the satisfactory conclusion of the initial or continuing qualification evaluation and will list the tasks for which the FTD is qualified, referencing the tasks described in Table B1B in Attachment 1 of this appendix. However, it is the sponsor's responsibility to obtain TPAA approval prior to using the FTD in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">t. Under normal circumstances, the NSPM establishes a date for the initial or upgrade evaluation within ten (10) working days after determining that a complete QTG is acceptable. Unusual circumstances may warrant establishing an evaluation date before this determination is made. A sponsor may schedule an evaluation date as early as 6 months in advance. However, there may be a delay of 45 days or more in rescheduling and completing the evaluation if the sponsor is unable to meet the scheduled date. See Attachment 4, Figure B4A, Sample Request for Initial, Upgrade, or Reinstatement Evaluation, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">u. The numbering system used for objective test results in the QTG should closely follow the numbering system set out in Attachment 2, FTD Objective Tests, Table B2A, of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">v.

The evaluation content and the time required to accomplish the evaluation is based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and sponsor-conducted quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The sponsor must notify the NSPM of any changes to the original scheduled time out of service;</p><p class="depth0">b. FTDs qualified prior to May 30, 2008, and replacement FTD systems, are not required to meet the general FTD requirements, the objective test requirements, and the subjective test requirements of Attachments 1, 2, and 3 of this appendix as long as the FTD continues to meet the test requirements contained in the MQTG developed under the original qualification basis.</p><p class="depth0">c. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">d. FTDs qualified prior to May 30, 2008, may be updated.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">e. Other certificate holders or persons desiring to use an FTD may contract with FTD sponsors to use FTDs previously qualified at a particular level for an airplane type and approved for use within an FAA-approved flight training program. Such FTDs are not required to undergo an additional qualification process, except as described in Sec. 60.16.</p><p class="depth0">f. Each FTD user must obtain approval from the appropriate TPAA to use any FTD in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">g. The intent of the requirement listed in Sec. 60.17(b), for each FTD to have an SOQ within 6 years, is to have the availability of that statement (including the configuration list and the limitations to authorizations) to provide a complete picture of the FTD inventory regulated by the FAA. The issuance of the statement will not require any additional evaluation or require any adjustment to the evaluation basis for the FTD.</p><p class="depth0">h. Downgrading of an FTD is a permanent change in qualification level and will necessitate the issuance of a revised SOQ to reflect the revised qualification level, as appropriate. If a temporary restriction is placed on an FTD because of a missing, malfunctioning, or inoperative component or on-going repairs, the restriction is not a permanent change in qualification level. Instead, the restriction is temporary and is removed when the reason for the restriction has been resolved.</p><p class="depth0">i. The NSPM will determine the evaluation criteria for an FTD that has been removed from active status for a prolonged period. The criteria will be based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity. For example, if the FTD were out of service for a 1 year period, it would be necessary to complete the entire QTG, since all of the quarterly evaluations would have been missed. The NSPM will also consider how the FTD was stored, whether parts were removed from the FTD and whether the FTD was disassembled.</p><p class="depth0">j. The FTD will normally be requalified using the FAA-approved MQTG and the criteria that was in effect prior to its removal from qualification. However, inactive periods of 2 years or more will require re-qualification under the standards in effect and current at the time of requalification.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

If the NSP evaluator plans to accomplish specific tests during a normal continuing qualification evaluation that requires the use of special equipment or technicians, the sponsor will be notified as far in advance of the evaluation as practical; but not less than 72 hours. Examples of such tests include latencies, control sweeps, or motion or visual system tests.</p><p class="depth0">g. The continuing qualification evaluations described in Sec. 60.19(b) will normally require 4 hours of FTD time. However, flexibility is necessary to address abnormal situations or situations involving aircraft with additional levels of complexity (e.g., computer controlled aircraft). The sponsor should anticipate that some tests may require additional time. The continuing qualification evaluations will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review of the results of the quarterly inspections conducted by the sponsor since the last scheduled continuing qualification evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A selection of approximately 8 to 15 objective tests from the MQTG that provide an adequate opportunity to evaluate the performance of the FTD. The tests chosen will

be performed either automatically or manually and should be able to be conducted within approximately one-third (1/3) of the allotted FTD time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A subjective evaluation of the FTD to perform a representative sampling of the tasks set out in attachment 3 of this appendix. This portion of the evaluation should take approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the allotted FTD time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An examination of the functions of the FTD may include the motion system, visual system, sound system as applicable, instructor operating station, and the normal functions and simulated malfunctions of the airplane systems.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Discussion</p><p class="depth0">a. For the purposes of this attachment, the flight conditions specified in the Flight Conditions Column of Table B2A, are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ground--on ground, independent of airplane configuration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Take-off--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> First segment climb--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position (normally not above 50 ft AGL);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Second segment climb--gear up with flaps/slats in any certified takeoff position (normally between 50 ft and 400 ft AGL);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Clean--flaps/slats retracted and gear up;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Cruise--clean configuration at cruise altitude and airspeed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Approach--gear up or down with flaps/slats at any normal approach position as recommended by the airplane manufacturer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Landing--gear down with flaps/slats in any certified landing position.</p><p class="depth0">b. The format for numbering the objective tests in Appendix A, Attachment 2, Table A2A, and the objective tests in Appendix B, Attachment 2, Table B2A, is identical. However, each test required for FFSs is not necessarily required for FTDs. Also, each test required for FTDs is not necessarily required for FFSs. Therefore, when a test number (or series of numbers) is not required, the term ``Reserved'' is used in the table at that location. Following this numbering format provides a degree of commonality between the two tables and substantially reduces the potential for confusion when referring to objective test numbers for either FFSs or FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">c. The reader is encouraged to review the Airplane Flight Simulator Evaluation Handbook, Volumes I and II, published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, London, UK, and FAA AC 25-7, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes, and AC 23-8, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Part 23 Airplanes, for references and examples regarding flight testing requirements and techniques.</p><p class="depth0">d. If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector should be clearly noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for the test.</p><p class="depth0">e. A Level 4 FTD does not require objective tests and therefore, Level 4 is not addressed in the following table.</p><p class="depth0">End Information
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The ground and flight tests required for qualification are listed in Table B2A Objective Tests. Computer generated FTD test results must be provided for each test except where an alternate test is specifically authorized by the NSPM. If a flight condition or operating condition is required for the test but does not apply to the airplane being simulated or to the qualification level sought, it may be disregarded (e.g., an engine out missed approach for a single-engine airplane; a maneuver using reverse thrust for an airplane without reverse thrust capability). Each test result is compared against the validation data described in Sec. 60.13, and in Appendix B. The results must be produced on an appropriate recording device acceptable to the NSPM and must include FTD number, date, time, conditions, tolerances, and appropriate dependent variables portrayed in comparison to the validation data. Time histories are required unless otherwise indicated in Table B2A. All results must be labeled using the tolerances and units given.</p><p class="depth0">b. Table B2A in this attachment sets out the test results required, including the parameters, tolerances, and flight conditions for FTD validation. Tolerances are provided for the listed tests because mathematical modeling and acquisition and development of reference data are often inexact. All tolerances listed in the following tables are applied to FTD performance. When two tolerance values are given for a parameter, the less restrictive may be used unless otherwise indicated. In those cases where a tolerance is expressed only as a percentage, the tolerance percentage applies to the maximum value of that parameter within its normal operating range as measured from the neutral or zero position unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">c. Certain tests included in this attachment must be supported with a SOC. In Table B2A, requirements for SOCs are indicated in the ``Test Details'' column.</p><p class="depth0">d. When operational or engineering judgment is used in making assessments for flight test data applications for FTD validity, such judgment may not be limited to a single parameter. For example, data that exhibit rapid variations of the measured parameters may require interpolations or a ``best fit'' data section. All relevant parameters related to a given maneuver or flight condition must be provided to allow overall interpretation. When it is difficult or impossible to match FTD to airplane data throughout a time history, differences must be justified by providing a comparison of other related variables for the condition being assessed.</p><p class="depth0">e. It is not acceptable to program the FTD so that the mathematical modeling is correct only at the validation test points. Unless noted otherwise, tests must represent airplane performance and handling qualities at operating weights and centers of gravity (CG) typical of normal operation. If a test is supported by aircraft data at one extreme weight or CG, another test supported by aircraft data at mid-conditions or as close as possible to the other extreme is necessary. Certain tests that are relevant only at one extreme CG or weight condition need not be repeated at the other extreme. The results of the tests for Level 6 are expected to be indicative of the device's performance and handling qualities throughout all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The airplane weight and CG envelope;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operational envelope; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Varying atmospheric ambient and environmental conditions--including the extremes authorized for the respective airplane or set of airplanes.</p><p class="depth0">f. When comparing the parameters listed to those of the airplane, sufficient data must also be provided to verify the correct flight condition and airplane configuration changes. For example, to show that control force is within the parameters for a static stability test, data to show the correct airspeed, power, thrust or torque, airplane configuration, altitude, and other appropriate datum identification parameters must also be given. If comparing short period dynamics, normal acceleration may be used to establish a match to the airplane, but airspeed, altitude, control input, airplane configuration, and other appropriate data must also be given. If comparing landing gear change dynamics, pitch, airspeed, and altitude may be used to establish a match to the airplane, but landing gear position must also be provided. All airspeed values must be properly annotated (e.g., indicated versus calibrated). In addition, the same variables must be used for comparison (e.g., compare inches to inches rather than inches to centimeters).</p><p class="depth0">g. The QTG provided by the sponsor must clearly describe how the FTD will be set up and operated for each test. Each FTD subsystem may be tested independently, but overall integrated testing of the FTD must be accomplished to assure that the total FTD system meets the prescribed standards. A manual test procedure with explicit and detailed steps for completing each test must also be provided.</p><p class="depth0">h. For previously qualified FTDs, the tests and tolerances of this attachment may be used in subsequent continuing qualification evaluations for any given test if the sponsor has submitted a proposed MQTG revision to the NSPM and has received NSPM approval.</p><p class="depth0">i. FTDs are evaluated and qualified with an engine model simulating the airplane data supplier's flight test engine. For qualification of alternative engine models (either variations of the flight test engines or other manufacturer's engines) additional tests

with the alternative engine models may be required. This attachment contains guidelines for alternative engines.</p><p class="depth0">j. Testing Computer Controlled Aircraft (CCA) simulators, or other highly augmented airplane simulators, flight test data is required for the Normal (N) and/or Non-normal (NN) control states, as indicated in this attachment. Where test results are independent of control state, Normal or Non-normal control data may be used. All tests in Table B2A require test results in the Normal control state unless specifically noted otherwise in the Test Details section following the CCA designation. The NSPM will determine what tests are appropriate for airplane simulation data. When making this determination, the NSPM may require other levels of control state degradation for specific airplane tests. Where Non-normal control states are required, test data must be provided for one or more Non-normal control states, and must include the least augmented state. Where applicable, flight test data must record Normal and Non-normal states for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pilot controller deflections or electronically generated inputs, including location of input; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Flight control surface positions unless test results are not affected by, or are independent of, surface positions.</p><p class="depth0">k. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices. FTDs for highly augmented airplanes will be validated both in the unaugmented configuration (or failure state with the maximum permitted degradation in handling qualities) and the augmented configuration. Where various levels of handling qualities result from failure states, validation of the effect of the failure is necessary. Requirements for testing will be mutually agreed to between the sponsor and the NSPM on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">l. Some tests will not be required for airplanes using airplane hardware in the FTD flight deck (e.g., ``side stick controller''). These exceptions are noted in Section 2 ``Handling Qualities'' in Table B2A of this attachment. However, in these cases, the sponsor must provide a statement that the airplane hardware meets the appropriate manufacturer's specifications and the sponsor must have supporting information to that fact available for NSPM review.</p><p class="depth0">m.

In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot test results'' in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">o.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. This paragraph (including the following tables) is relevant only to FTD Level 5. It is provided because this level is required to simulate the performance and handling characteristics of a set of airplanes with similar characteristics, such as normal airspeed/altitude operating envelope and the same number and type of propulsion systems (engines).</p><p class="depth0">b. Tables B2B through B2E reflect FTD performance standards that are acceptable to the FAA. A sponsor must demonstrate that a device performs within these parameters, as applicable. If a device does not meet the established performance parameters for some or for all of the applicable tests listed in Tables B2B through B2E, the sponsor may use NSP accepted flight test data for comparison purposes for those tests.</p><p class="depth0">c. Sponsors using the data from Tables B2B through B2E must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Submit a complete QTG, including results from all of the objective tests appropriate for the level of qualification sought as set out in Table B2A. The QTG must highlight those results that demonstrate the performance of the FTD is within the allowable performance ranges indicated in Tables B2B through B2E, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The QTG test results must include all relevant information concerning the conditions under which the test was conducted; e.g., gross weight, center of gravity, airspeed, power setting, altitude (climbing, descending, or level), temperature, configuration, and any other parameter that impacts the conduct of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The test results become the validation data against which the initial and all subsequent continuing qualification evaluations are compared. These subsequent evaluations will use the tolerances listed in Table B2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Subjective testing of the device must be performed to determine that the device performs and handles like an airplane within the appropriate set of airplanes.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">b. It has become standard practice for experienced FTD manufacturers to use such techniques as a means of establishing data bases for new FTD configurations while awaiting the availability of actual flight test data; and then comparing this new data with the newly available flight test data. The results of such comparisons have, as reported by some recognized and experienced simulation experts, become increasingly consistent and indicate that these techniques, applied with appropriate experience, are becoming dependably accurate for the development of aerodynamic models for use in Level 6 FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">c. In reviewing this history, the NSPM has concluded that, with proper care, those who are experienced in the development of aerodynamic models for FTD application can successfully use these modeling techniques to acceptably alter the method by which flight test data may be acquired and, when applied to Level 6 FTDs, does not compromise the quality of that simulation.</p><p class="depth0">d. The information in the table that follows (Table of Alternative Data Sources, Procedures, and Information: Level 6 FTD Only) is presented to describe an acceptable alternative to data sources for Level 6 FTD modeling and validation, and an acceptable alternative to the procedures and instrumentation found in the flight test methods traditionally accepted for gathering modeling and validation data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Alternative data sources that may be used for part or all of a data requirement are the Airplane Maintenance Manual, the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM), Airplane Design Data, the Type Inspection Report (TIR), Certification Data or acceptable supplemental flight test data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The NSPM recommends that use of the alternative instrumentation noted in Table B2F be coordinated with the NSPM prior to employment in a flight test or data gathering effort.</p><p class="depth0">e. The NSPM position regarding the use of these alternative data sources, procedures, and instrumentation is based on three primary preconditions and presumptions regarding the objective data and FTD aerodynamic program modeling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Data gathered through the alternative means does not require angle of attack (AOA) measurements or control surface position measurements for any flight test. AOA can be sufficiently derived if the flight test program insures the collection of acceptable level, unaccelerated, trimmed flight data. Angle of attack may be validated by conducting the three basic ``fly-by'' trim tests. The FTD time history tests should begin in level, unaccelerated, and trimmed flight, and the results should be compared with the flight test pitch angle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A simulation controls system model should be rigorously defined and fully mature. It should also include accurate gearing and cable stretch characteristics (where applicable) that are determined from actual aircraft measurements. Such a model does not require control surface position measurements in the flight test objective data for Level 6 FTD applications.</p><p class="depth0">f. Table B2F is not applicable to Computer Controlled Aircraft FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">g. Utilization of these alternate data sources, procedures, and instrumentation does not relieve the sponsor from compliance with the balance of the information contained in this document relative to Level 6 FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">h.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Discussion</p><p class="depth0">a. The subjective tests provide a basis for evaluating the capability of the FTD to perform over a typical utilization period. The items listed in the Table of Functions and Subjective Tests are used to determine whether the FTD competently simulates each required maneuver, procedure, or task; and verifying correct operation of the FTD controls, instruments, and systems. The tasks do not limit or exceed the authorizations for use of a given level of FTD as described on the SOQ or as approved by the TPAA. All items in the following paragraphs are subject to examination.</p><p class="depth0">b. All simulated airplane systems functions will be assessed for normal and, where appropriate, alternate operations. Simulated airplane systems are listed separately under ``Any Flight Phase'' to ensure appropriate attention to systems checks. Operational navigation systems (including inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, or other long-range systems) and the associated electronic display systems will be evaluated if installed. The NSP pilot will include in his report to the TPAA, the effect of the system operation and any system limitation.</p><p class="depth0">c. At the request of the TPAA, the NSP Pilot may assess the FTD for a special aspect of a sponsor's training program during the functions and subjective portion of an evaluation. Such an assessment may include a portion of a specific operation (e.g., a Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) scenario) or special emphasis items in the sponsor's training program. Unless directly related to a requirement for the qualification level, the results of such an evaluation would not affect the qualification of the FTD.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

The intent of the language in Sec. 60.7(b) is to have a specific FFS, identified by the sponsor, used at least once in an FAA-approved flight training program for the helicopter simulated during the 12-month period described. The identification of the specific FFS may change from one 12-month period to the next 12-month period as long as that sponsor sponsors and uses at least one FFS at least once during the prescribed period. There is no minimum number of hours or minimum FFS periods required.</p><p class="depth0">b.

After completion of any additional flight test, a flight test report must be submitted in support of the validation data. The report must contain sufficient data and rationale to support qualification of the FFS at the level requested.</p><p class="depth0">d. As required by Sec. 60.13(f), the sponsor must notify the NSPM when it becomes aware that an addition to, an amendment to, or a revision of data that may relate to FFS performance or handling characteristics is

available. The data referred to in this paragraph is data used to validate the performance, handling qualities, or other characteristics of the aircraft, including data related to any relevant changes occurring after the type certificate was issued. The sponsor must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 10 calendar days, notify the NSPM of the existence of this data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 45 calendar days, notify the NSPM of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The schedule to incorporate this data into the FFS; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The reason for not incorporating this data into the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">e. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot test results'' in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">f. The FFS sponsor is encouraged to maintain a liaison with the manufacturer of the aircraft being simulated (or with the holder of the aircraft type certificate for the aircraft being simulated if the manufacturer is no longer in business), and, if appropriate, with the person who supplied the aircraft data package for the FFS in order to facilitate the notification required by Sec. 60.13(f).</p><p class="depth0">g. It is the intent of the NSPM that for new aircraft entering service, at a point well in advance of preparation of the QTG, the sponsor should submit to the NSPM for approval, a descriptive document (see Table C2D, Sample Validation Data Roadmap for Helicopters) containing the plan for acquiring the validation data, including data sources. This document should clearly identify sources of data for all required tests, a description of the validity of these data for a specific engine type and thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting the performance or flying qualities of the aircraft. Additionally, this document should provide other information, such as the rationale or explanation for cases where data or data parameters are missing, instances where engineering simulation data are used or where flight test methods require further explanations. It should also provide a brief narrative describing the cause and effect of any deviation from data requirements. The aircraft manufacturer may provide this document.</p><p class="depth0">h. There is no requirement for any flight test data supplier to submit a flight test plan or program prior to gathering flight test data. However, the NSPM notes that inexperienced data gatherers often provide data that is irrelevant, improperly marked, or lacking adequate justification for selection. Other problems include inadequate information regarding initial conditions or test maneuvers. The NSPM has been forced to refuse these data submissions as validation data for an FFS evaluation. It is for this reason that the NSPM recommends that any data supplier not previously experienced in this area review the data necessary for programming and for validating the performance of the FFS, and discuss the flight test plan anticipated for acquiring such data with the NSPM well in advance of commencing the flight tests.</p><p class="depth0">i.

The sponsor may elect to complete the QTG objective and subjective tests at the manufacturer's facility or at the sponsor's training facility. If the tests are conducted at the manufacturer's facility, the sponsor must repeat at least one-third of the tests at the sponsor's training facility in order to substantiate FFS performance. The QTG must be clearly annotated to indicate when and where each test was accomplished. Tests conducted at the manufacturer's facility and at the sponsor's training facility must be conducted after the FFS is assembled with systems and sub-systems functional and operating in an interactive manner. The test results must be submitted to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">i. The sponsor must maintain a copy of the MQTG at the FFS location.</p><p class="depth0">j. All FFSs for which the initial qualification is conducted after May 30, 2014, must have an electronic MQTG (eMQTG) including all objective data obtained from helicopter testing, or another approved source (reformatted or digitized), together with correlating objective test results obtained from the performance of the FFS (reformatted or digitized) as prescribed in this appendix. The eMQTG must also contain the general FFS performance or demonstration results (reformatted or digitized) prescribed in this appendix, and a description of the equipment necessary to perform the initial qualification evaluation and the continuing qualification evaluations. The eMQTG must include the original validation data used to validate FFS performance and handling qualities in either the original digitized format from the data supplier or an electronic scan of the original time-history plots that were provided by the data supplier. A copy of the eMQTG must be provided to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">k. All other FFSs not covered in subparagraph ``j'' must have an electronic copy of the MQTG by May 30, 2014. An electronic copy of the MQTG must be provided to the NSPM.

During the initial (or upgrade) qualification evaluation conducted by the NSPM, the sponsor must also provide a person who is a user of the device (e.g., a qualified pilot or instructor pilot with flight time experience in that aircraft) and knowledgeable about the operation of the aircraft and the operation of the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">m. Only those FFSs that are sponsored by a certificate holder as defined in Appendix F of this part will be evaluated by the NSPM. However, other FFS evaluations may be conducted on a case-by-case basis as the Administrator deems appropriate, but only in accordance with applicable agreements.</p><p class="depth0">n. The NSPM will conduct an evaluation for each configuration, and each FFS must be evaluated as completely as possible. To ensure a thorough and uniform evaluation, each FFS is subjected to the general simulator requirements in Attachment 1 of this appendix, the objective tests listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix, and the subjective tests listed in Attachment 3 of this appendix. The evaluations described herein will include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Helicopter responses, including longitudinal and lateral-directional control responses (see Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance in authorized portions of the simulated helicopter's operating envelope, to include tasks evaluated by the NSPM in the areas of surface operations, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach, and landing as well as abnormal and emergency

operations (see Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flight deck configuration (see Attachment 1 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pilot, flight engineer, and instructor station functions checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Helicopter systems and sub-systems (as appropriate) as compared to the helicopter simulated (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> FFS systems and sub-systems, including force cueing (motion), visual, and aural (sound) systems, as appropriate (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain additional requirements, depending upon the qualification level sought, including equipment or circumstances that may become hazardous to the occupants. The sponsor may be subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.</p><p class="depth0">o. The NSPM administers the objective and subjective tests, which includes an examination of functions. The tests include a qualitative assessment of the FFS by an NSP pilot. The NSP evaluation team leader may assign other qualified personnel to assist in accomplishing the functions examination and/or the objective and subjective tests performed during an evaluation when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Objective tests provide a basis for measuring and evaluating FFS performance and determining compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subjective tests provide a basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluating the capability of the FFS to perform over a typical utilization period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining that the FFS satisfactorily simulates each required task;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Verifying correct operation of the FFS controls, instruments, and systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">p. The tolerances for the test parameters listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix reflect the range of tolerances acceptable to the NSPM for FFS validation and are not to be confused with design tolerances specified for FFS manufacture. In making decisions regarding tests and test results, the NSPM relies on the use of operational and engineering judgment in the application of data (including consideration of the way in which the flight test was flown and way the data was gathered and applied), data presentations, and the applicable tolerances for each test.</p><p class="depth0">q. In addition to the scheduled continuing qualification evaluation, each FFS is subject to evaluations conducted by the NSPM at any time without prior notification to the sponsor. Such evaluations would be accomplished in a normal manner (i.e., requiring exclusive use of the FFS for the conduct of objective and subjective tests and an examination of functions) if the FFS is not being used for flight crewmember training, testing, or checking. However, if the FFS were being used, the evaluation would be conducted in a non-exclusive manner. This non-exclusive evaluation will be conducted by the FFS evaluator accompanying the check airman, instructor, Aircrew Program Designee (APD), or FAA inspector aboard the FFS along with the student(s) and observing the operation of the FFS during the training, testing, or checking activities.</p><p class="depth0">r. Problems with objective test results are handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a problem with an objective test result is detected by the NSP evaluation team during an evaluation, the test may be repeated or the QTG may be amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If it is determined that the results of an objective test do not support the level requested but do support a lower level, the NSPM may qualify the FFS at that lower level. For example, if a Level D evaluation is requested and the FFS fails to meet sound test tolerances, it could be qualified at Level C.</p><p class="depth0">s. After an FFS is successfully evaluated, the NSPM issues a certificate of qualification (COQ) to the sponsor. The NSPM recommends the FFS to the TPAA, who will approve the FFS for use in a flight training program. The COQ will be issued at the satisfactory conclusion of the initial or continuing qualification evaluation and will list the tasks for which the FFS is qualified, referencing the tasks described in Table C1B in Attachment 1 of this appendix. However, it is the sponsor's responsibility to obtain TPAA approval prior to using the FFS in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">t. Under normal circumstances, the NSPM establishes a date for the initial or upgrade evaluation within ten (10) working days after determining that a complete QTG is acceptable. Unusual circumstances may warrant establishing an evaluation date before this determination is made. A sponsor may schedule an evaluation date as early as 6 months in advance. However, there may be a delay of 45 days or more in rescheduling and completing the evaluation if the sponsor is unable to meet the scheduled date. See Attachment 4, of this appendix, Figure C4A, Sample Request for Initial, Upgrade, or Reinstatement Evaluation.</p><p class="depth0">u.

Such FFSs are not required to undergo an additional qualification process, except as described in Sec. 60.16.</p><p class="depth0">f. Each FFS user must obtain approval from the appropriate TPAA to use any FFS in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">g. The intent of the requirement listed in Sec. 60.17(b), for each FFS to have an SOQ within 6 years, is to have the availability of that statement (including the configuration list and the limitations to authorizations) to provide a complete picture of the FFS inventory regulated by the FAA. The issuance of the statement will not require any additional evaluation or require any adjustment to the evaluation basis for the FFS.</p><p class="depth0">h. Downgrading of an FFS is a permanent change in qualification level and will necessitate the issuance of a revised SOQ to reflect the revised qualification level, as appropriate. If a temporary restriction is placed on an FFS because of a missing, malfunctioning, or inoperative component or on-going repairs, the restriction is not a permanent change in qualification level. Instead, the restriction is temporary and is removed when the reason for the restriction has been resolved.</p><p class="depth0">i. The NSPM will determine the evaluation criteria for an FFS that has been removed from active status. The criteria will be based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity. For example, if the FFS were out of service for a 1 year period, it would be necessary to complete the entire QTG, since all of the quarterly evaluations would have been missed. The NSPM will also consider how the FFS was stored, whether parts were removed from the FFS and whether the FFS was disassembled.</p><p class="depth0">j. The FFS will normally be requalified using the FAA-approved MQTG and the criteria that was in effect prior to its removal from qualification. However, inactive periods of 2 years or more will require requalification under the standards in effect and current at the time of requalification.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

If the NSP evaluator plans to accomplish specific tests during a normal continuing qualification evaluation that requires the use of special equipment or technicians, the sponsor will be notified as far in advance of the evaluation as practical; but not less than 72 hours. Examples of such tests include latencies, control dynamics, sounds and vibrations, motion, and/or some visual system tests.</p><p class="depth0">h. The continuing qualification evaluations, described in Sec. 60.19(b), will normally require 4 hours of FFS time. However, flexibility is necessary to address abnormal situations or situations involving aircraft with additional levels of complexity (e.g., computer controlled aircraft). The sponsor should anticipate that some tests may require additional time. The continuing qualification evaluations will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review of the results of the quarterly inspections conducted by the sponsor since the last scheduled continuing qualification evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A selection of approximately 8 to 15 objective tests from the MQTG that provide an adequate opportunity to evaluate the performance of the FFS.

Introduction</p><p class="depth0">a. If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector (magnitude and direction) should be clearly noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for the test.</p><p class="depth0">b. The NSPM will not evaluate any simulator unless the required SOC indicates that the motion system is designed and manufactured to safely operate within the simulator's maximum excursion, acceleration, and velocity capabilities (see Motion System in the following table).</p><p class="depth0">c.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The ground and flight tests required for qualification are listed in Table of C2A, FFS Objective Tests. Computer-generated simulator test results must be provided for each test except where an alternative test is specifically authorized by the NSPM. If a flight condition or operating condition is required for the test but does not apply to the helicopter being simulated or to the qualification level sought, it may be disregarded (e.g., an engine out missed approach for a single-engine helicopter, or a hover test for a Level B simulator). Each test result is compared against the validation data described in Sec. 60.13 and in this appendix. Although use of a driver program designed to automatically accomplish the tests is encouraged for all simulators and required for Level C and Level D simulators, each test must be able to be accomplished manually while recording all appropriate parameters. The results must be produced on an appropriate recording device acceptable to the NSPM and must include simulator number, date, time, conditions, tolerances, and appropriate dependent variables portrayed in comparison to the validation data. Time histories are required unless otherwise indicated in Table C2A. All results must be labeled using the tolerances and units given.</p><p class="depth0">b. Table C2A sets out the test results required, including the parameters, tolerances, and flight conditions for simulator validation. Tolerances are provided for the listed tests because mathematical modeling and acquisition/development of reference data are often inexact. All tolerances listed in the following tables are applied to simulator performance. When two tolerance values are given for a parameter, the less restrictive value may be used unless otherwise indicated. In those cases where a tolerance is expressed only as a percentage, the tolerance percentage applies to the maximum value of that parameter within its normal operating range as measured from the neutral or zero position unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">c. Certain tests included in this attachment must be supported with an SOC. In Table C2A, requirements for SOCs are indicated in the ``Test Details'' column.</p><p class="depth0">d. When operational or engineering judgment is used in making assessments for flight test data applications for simulator validity, such judgment may not be limited to a single parameter. For example, data that exhibit rapid variations of the measured parameters may require interpolations or a ``best fit'' data selection. All relevant parameters related to a given maneuver or flight condition must be provided to allow overall interpretation. When it is difficult or impossible to match simulator to helicopter data throughout a time history, differences must be justified by providing a comparison of other related variables for the condition being assessed.</p><p class="depth0">e. The FFS may not be programmed so that the mathematical modeling is correct only at the validation test points. Unless noted otherwise, simulator tests must represent helicopter performance and handling qualities at operating weights and centers of gravity (CG) typical of normal operation. If a test is supported by helicopter data at one extreme weight or CG, another test supported by helicopter data at mid-conditions or as close as possible to the other extreme must be included. Certain tests that are relevant only at one extreme CG or weight condition need not be repeated at the other extreme. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices.</p><p class="depth0">f. When comparing the parameters listed to those of the helicopter, sufficient data must also be provided to verify the correct flight condition and helicopter configuration changes. For example, to show that control force is within [0.5 pound (0.22 daN) in a static stability test, data to show the correct airspeed, power, thrust or torque, helicopter configuration, altitude, and other appropriate datum identification parameters must also be given. If comparing short period dynamics, normal acceleration may be used to establish a match to the helicopter, but airspeed, altitude, control input, helicopter configuration, and other appropriate data must also be given. All airspeed values must be properly annotated (e.g., indicated versus calibrated). In addition, the same variables must be used for comparison (e.g., compare inches to inches rather than inches to centimeters).</p><p class="depth0">g. The QTG provided by the sponsor must clearly describe how the simulator will be set up and operated for each test. Each simulator subsystem may be tested independently, but overall integrated testing of the simulator must be accomplished to assure that the total simulator system meets the prescribed standards. A manual test procedure with explicit and detailed steps for completing each test must also be provided.</p><p class="depth0">h. For previously qualified simulators, the tests and tolerances of this attachment may be used in subsequent continuing qualification evaluations for any given test if the sponsor has submitted a proposed MQTG revision to the NSPM and has received NSPM approval.</p><p class="depth0">i. Motion System Tests:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The minimum excursions, accelerations, and velocities for pitch, roll, and yaw must be measurable about a single, common reference point and must be achieved by driving one degree of freedom at a time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The minimum excursions, accelerations, and velocities for heave, sway, and surge may be measured about different, identifiable reference points and must be achieved by driving one degree of freedom at a time.</p><p class="depth0">j. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices. FFSs for highly augmented helicopters will be validated both in the unaugmented configuration (or failure state with the maximum permitted degradation in handling qualities) and the augmented configuration. Where various levels of handling qualities result from failure states, validation of the effect of the failure is necessary. For those performance and static handling qualities tests where the primary concern is control position in the unaugmented configuration, unaugmented data are not required if the design of the system precludes any affect on control position. In those instances where the unaugmented helicopter response is divergent and non-repeatable, it may not be feasible to meet the specified tolerances. Alternative requirements for testing will be mutually agreed upon by the sponsor and the NSPM on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">k. Some tests will not be required for helicopters using helicopter hardware in the simulator flight deck (e.g., ``helicopter modular controller''). These exceptions are noted in Table C2A of this attachment. However, in these cases, the sponsor must provide a statement that the helicopter hardware meets the appropriate manufacturer's specifications and the sponsor must have supporting information to that fact available for NSPM review.</p><p class="depth0">l. In cases where light-class helicopters are being simulated, prior coordination with the NSPM on acceptable weight ranges is required. The terms ``light'', ``medium'', and ``near maximum'', as defined in Appendix F of this part, may not be appropriate for the simulation of light-class helicopters.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">m. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot test results'' in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot''. The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">n.

If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector should be clearly noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for test near the ground.</p><p class="depth0">b. The reader is encouraged to review the Airplane Flight Simulator Evaluation Handbook, Volumes I and II, published by the Royal Aeronautical Society, London, UK, and FAA AC 25-7, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Transport Category Airplanes, and AC 23-8, as amended, Flight Test Guide for Certification of Part 23 Airplanes, for references and examples regarding flight testing requirements and techniques.</p><p class="depth0">4. Control Dynamics</p><p class="depth0">a. General. The characteristics of a helicopter flight control system have a major effect on the handling qualities. A significant consideration in pilot acceptability of a helicopter is the ``feel'' provided through the flight controls. Considerable effort is expended on helicopter feel system design so that pilots will be comfortable and will consider the helicopter desirable to fly. In order for an FFS to be representative, it should ``feel'' like the helicopter being simulated. Compliance with this requirement is determined by comparing a recording of the control feel dynamics of the FFS to actual helicopter measurements in the hover and cruise configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recordings such as free response to an impulse or step function are classically used to estimate the dynamic properties of electromechanical systems. In any case, it is only possible to estimate the dynamic properties as a result of only being able to estimate true inputs and responses. Therefore, it is imperative that the best possible data be collected since close matching of the FFS control loading system to the helicopter system is essential. The required dynamic control tests are described in Table C2A of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For initial and upgrade evaluations, the QPS requires that control dynamics characteristics be measured and recorded directly from the flight controls (Handling Qualities--Table C2A). This procedure is usually accomplished by measuring the free response of the controls using a step or impulse input to excite the system. The procedure should be accomplished in the hover and cruise flight conditions and configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For helicopters with irreversible control systems, measurements may be obtained on the ground if proper pitot-static inputs are provided to represent airspeeds typical of those encountered in flight. Likewise, it may be shown that for some helicopters, hover, climb, cruise, and autorotation have like effects. Thus, one may suffice for another. If either or both considerations apply, engineering validation or helicopter manufacturer rationale should be submitted as justification for ground tests or for eliminating a configuration. For FFSs requiring static and dynamic tests at the controls, special test fixtures will not be required during initial and upgrade evaluations if the QTG shows both test fixture results and the results of an alternate approach (e.g., computer plots that were produced concurrently and show satisfactory agreement). Repeat of the alternate method during the initial evaluation satisfies this test requirement.</p><p class="depth0">b. Control Dynamics Evaluations. The dynamic properties of control systems are often stated in terms of frequency, damping, and a number of other classical measurements. In order to establish a consistent means of validating test results for FFS control loading, criteria are needed that will clearly define the measurement interpretation and the applied tolerances. Criteria are needed for underdamped, critically damped and overdamped systems. In the case of an underdamped system with very light damping, the system may be quantified in terms of frequency and damping. In critically damped or overdamped systems, the frequency and damping are not readily measured from a response time history. Therefore, the following suggested measurements may be used:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For Levels C and D simulators. Tests to verify that control feel dynamics represent the helicopter should show that the dynamic damping cycles (free response of the controls) match those of the helicopter within specified tolerances. The NSPM recognizes that several different testing methods may be used to verify the control feel dynamic response. The NSPM will consider the merits of testing methods based on reliability and consistency. One acceptable method of evaluating the response and the tolerance to be applied is described below for the underdamped and critically damped cases. A sponsor using this method to comply with the QPS requirements should perform the tests as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Underdamped Response. Two measurements are required for the period, the time to first zero crossing (in case a rate limit is present) and the subsequent frequency of oscillation. It is necessary to measure cycles on an individual basis in case there are non-uniform periods in the response. Each period will be independently compared to the respective period of the helicopter control system and, consequently, will enjoy the full tolerance specified for that period. The damping tolerance will be applied to overshoots on an individual basis. Care should be

taken when applying the tolerance to small overshoots since the significance of such overshoots becomes questionable. Only those overshoots larger than 5 percent of the total initial displacement should be considered significant. The residual band, labeled T(Ad) on Figure C2A is [5 percent of the initial displacement amplitude Ad from the steady state value of the oscillation. Only oscillations outside the residual band are considered significant. When comparing FFS data to helicopter data, the process should begin by overlaying or aligning the FFS and helicopter steady state values and then comparing amplitudes of oscillation peaks, the time of the first zero crossing, and individual periods of oscillation. The FFS should show the same number of significant overshoots to within one when compared against the helicopter data. The procedure for evaluating the response is illustrated in Figure C2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Critically damped and Overdamped Response. Due to the nature of critically damped and overdamped responses (no overshoots), the time to reach 90 percent of the steady state (neutral point) value should be the same as the helicopter within [10 percent. The simulator response must be critically damped also. Figure C2B illustrates the procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special considerations. Control systems that exhibit characteristics other than classical overdamped or underdamped responses should meet specified tolerances. In addition, special consideration should be given to ensure that significant trends are maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tolerances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following summarizes the tolerances, ``T'' for underdamped systems, and ``n'' is the sequential period of a full cycle of oscillation.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">6. Motion System.</p><p class="depth0">a. General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pilots use continuous information signals to regulate the state of the helicopter. In concert with the instruments and outside-world visual information, whole-body motion feedback is essential in assisting the pilot to

control the helicopter dynamics, particularly in the presence of external disturbances. The motion system should meet basic objective performance criteria, and be subjectively tuned at the pilot's seat position to represent the linear and angular accelerations of the helicopter during a prescribed minimum set of maneuvers and conditions. The response of the motion cueing system should be repeatable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Motion System tests in Section 3 of Table C2A are intended to qualify the FFS motion cueing system from a mechanical performance standpoint. Additionally, the list of motion effects provides a representative sample of dynamic conditions that should be present in the flight simulator. An additional list of representative, training-critical maneuvers, selected from Section 1, (Performance tests) and Section 2, (Handling Qualities tests) in Table C2A, that should be recorded during initial qualification (but without tolerance) to indicate the flight simulator motion cueing performance signature have been identified (reference Section 3.e). These tests are intended to help improve the overall standard of FFS motion cueing.</p><p class="depth0">b. Motion System Checks. The intent of test 3a, Frequency Response, test 3b, Leg Balance, and test 3c, Turn-Around Check, as described in the Table of Objective Tests, is to demonstrate the performance of the motion system hardware, and to check the integrity of the motion set-up with regard to calibration and wear. These tests are independent of the motion cueing software and should be considered robotic tests.</p><p class="depth0">c. Motion System Repeatability. The intent of this test is to ensure that the motion system software and motion system hardware have not degraded or changed over time. This diagnostic test should be completed during continuing qualification checks in lieu of the robotic tests. This will allow an improved ability to determine changes in the software or determine degradation in the hardware. The following information delineates the methodology that should be used for this test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Input: The inputs should be such that rotational accelerations, rotational rates, and linear accelerations are inserted before the transfer from helicopter center of gravity to pilot reference point with a minimum amplitude of 5 deg/sec/sec, 10 deg/sec and 0.3 g, respectively, to provide adequate analysis of the output.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recommended output:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Actual platform linear accelerations; the output will comprise accelerations due to both the linear and rotational motion acceleration;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motion actuators position.</p><p class="depth0">d. Motion Cueing Performance Signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Background. The intent of this test is to provide quantitative time history records of motion system response to a selected set of automated QTG maneuvers during initial qualification. It is not intended to be a comparison of the motion platform accelerations against the flight test recorded accelerations (i.e., not to be compared against helicopter cueing). If there is a modification to the initially qualified motion software or motion hardware (e.g., motion washout filter, simulator payload change greater than 10%) then a new baseline may need to be established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test Selection. The conditions identified in Section 3.e. in Table C2A are those maneuvers where motion cueing is the most discernible. They are general tests applicable to all types of helicopters and should be completed for motion cueing performance signature at any time acceptable to the NSPM prior to or during the initial qualification evaluation, and the results included in the MQTG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Priority. Motion system should be designed with the intent of placing greater importance on those maneuvers that directly influence pilot perception and control of the helicopter motions. For the maneuvers identified in section 3.e. in Table C2A, the flight simulator motion cueing system should have a high tilt co-ordination gain, high rotational gain, and high correlation with respect to the helicopter simulation model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Data Recording. The minimum list of parameters provided should allow for the determination of the flight simulator's motion cueing performance signature for the initial qualification evaluation. The following parameters are recommended as being acceptable to perform such a function:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Flight model acceleration and rotational rate commands at the pilot reference point;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Motion actuators position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Actual platform position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Actual platform acceleration at pilot reference point.</p><p class="depth0">e. Motion Vibrations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Presentation of results. The characteristic motion vibrations may be used to verify that the flight simulator can reproduce the frequency content of the helicopter when flown in specific conditions. The test results should be presented as a Power Spectral Density (PSD) plot with frequencies on the horizontal axis and amplitude on the vertical axis. The helicopter data and flight simulator data should be presented in the same format with the same scaling. The algorithms used for generating the flight simulator data should be the same as those used for the helicopter data. If they are not the same then the algorithms used for the flight simulator data should be proven to be sufficiently comparable. As a minimum the results along the dominant axes should be presented and a rationale for not presenting the other axes should be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interpretation of results. The overall trend of the PSD plot should be considered

while focusing on the dominant frequencies. Less emphasis should be placed on the differences at the high frequency and low amplitude portions of the PSD plot. During the analysis, certain structural components of the flight simulator have resonant frequencies that are filtered and may not appear in the PSD plot. If filtering is required, the notch filter bandwidth should be limited to 1 Hz to ensure that the buffet feel is not adversely affected. In addition, a rationale should be provided to explain that the characteristic motion vibration is not being adversely affected by the filtering. The amplitude should match helicopter data as described below. However, if the PSD plot was altered for subjective reasons, a rationale should be provided to justify the change. If the plot is on a logarithmic scale it may be difficult to interpret the amplitude of the buffet in terms of acceleration. For example, a 1x10-3 g-rms\2\/Hz would describe a heavy buffet and may be seen in the deep stall regime. Alternatively, a 1x10-6 g-rms\2\/Hz buffet is almost imperceptable, but may represent a flap buffet at low speed. The previous two examples differ in magnitude by 1000. On a PSD plot this represents three decades (one decade is a change in order of magnitude of 10, and two decades is a change in order of magnitude of 100).</p><p class="depth0">Note: In the example, ``g-rms\2\'' is the mathematical expression for ``g's root mean squared.''</p><p class="depth0">f.

The information provided covers the six axes of motion (pitch, roll, yaw, vertical, lateral, and longitudinal) and addresses displacement, velocity, and acceleration. Also included is information about the parameters for initial rotational and linear acceleration. The parameters listed in this table apply only to Level C and Level D simulators, and are presented here as recommended targets for motion system capability.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR09MY08.035</p><p class="depth0">7. Sound System</p><p class="depth0">a. General. The total sound environment in the helicopter is very complex, and changes with atmospheric conditions, helicopter configuration, airspeed, altitude, and power settings. Flight deck sounds are an important component of the flight deck operational environment and provide valuable information

to the flight crew. These aural cues can either assist the crew (as an indication of an abnormal situation), or hinder the crew (as a distraction or nuisance). For effective training, the flight simulator should provide flight deck sounds that are perceptible to the pilot during normal and abnormal operations, and that are comparable to those of the helicopter. The flight simulator operator should carefully evaluate background noises in the location where the device will be installed. To demonstrate compliance with the sound requirements, the objective or validation tests in this attachment were selected to provide a representative sample of normal static conditions typically experienced by a pilot.</p><p class="depth0">b. Alternate propulsion. For FFS with multiple propulsion configurations, any condition listed in Table C2A in this attachment should be presented for evaluation as part of the QTG if identified by the helicopter manufacturer or other data supplier as significantly different due to a change in propulsion system (engine or propeller).</p><p class="depth0">c. Data and Data Collection System.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information provided to the flight simulator manufacturer should comply be presented in the format suggested by the ``International Air Transport Association (IATA) Flight Simulator Design and Performance Data Requirements,'' as amended. This information should contain calibration and frequency response data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The system used to perform the tests listed in Table C2A should comply with the following standards:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The specifications for octave, half octave, and third octave band filter sets may be found in American National Standards Institute (ANSI) S1.11-1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Measurement microphones should be type WS2 or better, as described in International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) 1094-4-1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Headsets.

Playback equipment and recordings of the QTG conditions should be provided during initial evaluations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Background noise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Background noise is the noise in the flight simulator that is not associated with the helicopter, but is caused by the flight simulator's cooling and hydraulic systems and extraneous noise from other locations in the building. Background noise can seriously impact the correct simulation of helicopter sounds, and should be kept below the helicopter sounds. In some cases, the sound level of the simulation can be increased to compensate for the background noise. However, this approach is limited by the specified tolerances and by the subjective acceptability of the sound environment to the evaluation pilot.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The acceptability of the background noise levels is dependent upon the normal sound levels in the helicopter being represented. Background noise levels that fall below the lines defined by the following points, may be acceptable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 70 dB @ 50 Hz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 55 dB @ 1000 Hz;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 30 dB @ 16 kHz.</p><p class="depth0">(Note: These limits are for unweighted \1/3\ octave band sound levels. Meeting these limits for background noise does not ensure an acceptable flight simulator.

Additional Information About Flight Simulator Qualification for New</p><p class="depth0">or Derivative Helicopters</p><p class="depth0">a. Typically, a helicopter manufacturer's approved final data for performance, handling qualities, systems or avionics is not available until well after a new or derivative helicopter has entered service. However, flight crew training and certification often begins several months prior to the entry of the first helicopter into service. Consequently, it may be necessary to use preliminary data provided by the helicopter manufacturer for interim qualification of flight simulators.</p><p class="depth0">b. In these cases, the NSPM may accept certain partially validated preliminary helicopter and systems data, and early release (``red label'') avionics data in order to permit the necessary program schedule for training, certification, and service introduction.</p><p class="depth0">c. Simulator sponsors seeking qualification based on preliminary data should consult the NSPM to make special arrangements for using preliminary data for flight simulator qualification. The sponsor should also consult the helicopter and flight simulator manufacturers to develop a data plan and flight simulator qualification plan.</p><p class="depth0">d. The procedure to be followed to gain NSPM acceptance of preliminary data will vary from case to case and between helicopter manufacturers. Each helicopter manufacturer's new helicopter development and test program is designed to suit the needs of the particular project and may not contain the same events or sequence of events as another manufacturer's program or even the same manufacturer's program for a different helicopter. Therefore, there cannot be a prescribed invariable procedure for acceptance of preliminary data; instead there should be a statement describing the final sequence of events, data sources, and validation procedures agreed by the simulator sponsor, the helicopter manufacturer, the flight simulator manufacturer, and the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A description of helicopter manufacturer-provided data needed for flight simulator modeling and validation is to be found in the ``Royal Aeronautical Society Data Package Requirements for Design and Performance Evaluation of Rotary Wing Synthetic Training Devices.''</p><p class="depth0">e. The preliminary data should be the manufacturer's best representation of the helicopter, with assurance that the final data will not deviate significantly from the preliminary estimates. Data derived from these predictive or preliminary techniques should be validated by available sources including, at least, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturer's engineering report. The report should explain the predictive method used and illustrate past success of the method on similar projects. For example, the manufacturer could show the application of the method to an earlier helicopter model or predict the characteristics of an earlier model and compare the results to final data for that model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early flight test results. This data is often derived from helicopter certification tests and should be used to maximum advantage for early flight simulator validation. Certain critical tests that would normally be done early in the helicopter certification program should be included to validate essential pilot training and certification maneuvers. These tests include cases where a pilot is expected to cope with a helicopter failure mode or an engine failure. The early data available will depend on the helicopter manufacturer's flight test program design and may not be the same in each case. The flight test program of the helicopter manufacturer should include provisions for generation of very early flight tests results for flight simulator validation.</p><p class="depth0">f. The use of preliminary data is not indefinite. The helicopter manufacturer's final data should be available within 12 months after the helicopter first entry into service or as agreed by the NSPM, the simulator sponsor, and the helicopter manufacturer. When applying for interim qualification using preliminary data, the simulator sponsor and the NSPM should agree on the update program. This includes specifying that the final data update will be installed in the flight simulator within a period of 12 months following the final data release, unless special conditions exist and a different schedule is acceptable. The flight simulator performance and handling validation would then be based on data derived from flight tests. Initial helicopter systems data should be updated after engineering tests. Final helicopter systems data should also be used for flight simulator programming and validation.</p><p class="depth0">g. Flight simulator avionics should stay essentially in step with helicopter avionics (hardware and software) updates. The permitted time lapse between helicopter and flight simulator updates should be minimal. It may depend on the magnitude of the update and whether the QTG and pilot training and certification are affected. Differences in helicopter and flight simulator avionics versions and the resulting effects on flight simulator qualification should be agreed between the simulator sponsor and the NSPM. Consultation with the flight simulator manufacturer is desirable throughout the qualification process.</p><p class="depth0">h. The following describes an example of the design data and sources that might be used in the development of an interim qualification plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan should consist of the development of a QTG based upon a mix of flight test and engineering simulation data. For

data collected from specific helicopter flight tests or other flights the required design model or data changes necessary to support an acceptable Proof of Match (POM) should be generated by the helicopter manufacturer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For proper validation of the two sets of data, the helicopter manufacturer should compare their simulation model responses against the flight test data, when driven by the same control inputs and subjected to the same atmospheric conditions as recorded in the flight test. The model responses should result from a simulation where the following systems are run in an integrated fashion and are consistent with the design data released to the flight simulator manufacturer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Propulsion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Aerodynamics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mass properties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Flight controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Stability augmentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Brakes/landing gear.</p><p class="depth0">i.

If engineering simulator data or other non-flight-test data are used as an allowable form of reference validation data for the objective tests listed in Table C2A of this attachment, the data provider must supply a well-documented mathematical model and testing procedure that enables a replication of the engineering simulation results within 20% of the corresponding flight test tolerances.</p><p class="depth0">b. Background</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The tolerances listed in Table C2A of this attachment are designed to measure the quality of the match using flight-test data as a reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Good engineering judgment should be applied to all tolerances in any test.

Validation Data Roadmap</p><p class="depth0">a. Helicopter manufacturers or other data suppliers should supply a validation data roadmap (VDR) document as part of the data package. A VDR document contains guidance material from the helicopter validation data supplier recommending the best possible sources of data to be used as validation data in the QTG. A VDR is of special value when requesting interim qualification, qualification of simulators for helicopters certificated prior to 1992, and qualification of alternate engine or avionics fits. A sponsor seeking to have a device qualified in accordance with the standards contained in this QPS appendix should submit a VDR to the NSPM as early as possible in the planning stages. The NSPM is the final authority to approve the data to be used as validation material for the QTG. The NSPM and the Joint Aviation Authorities' Synthetic Training Devices Advisory Board have committed to maintain a list of agreed VDRs.</p><p class="depth0">b. The VDR should identify (in matrix format) sources of data for all required tests. It should also provide guidance regarding the validity of these data for a specific engine type, thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting helicopter handling qualities and performance. The VDR should include rationale or explanation in cases where data or parameters are missing, engineering simulation data are to be used, flight test methods require explanation, or where there is any deviation from

data requirements. Additionally, the document should refer to other appropriate sources of validation data (e.g., sound and vibration data documents).</p><p class="depth0">c. The Sample Validation Data Roadmap (VDR) for helicopters, shown in Table C2D, depicts a generic roadmap matrix identifying sources of validation data for an abbreviated list of tests. This sample document uses fixed wing parameters instead of helicopter values. It is merely a sample and does not provide actual data. A complete matrix should address all test conditions for helicopter application and provide actual data and data sources.</p><p class="depth0">d. Two examples of rationale pages are presented in Appendix F of IATA Flight Simulator Design and Performance Data Requirements document. These illustrate the type of helicopter and avionics configuration information and descriptive engineering rationale used to describe data anomalies or provide an acceptable basis for using alternative data for QTG validation requirements.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

Acceptance Guidelines for Alternative Avionics (Flight-Related</p><p class="depth0">Computers and Controllers)</p><p class="depth0">a. Background</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a new helicopter type, the majority of flight validation data are collected on the first helicopter configuration with a ``baseline'' flight-related avionics ship-set; (see subparagraph b.(2) of this section). These data are then used to validate all flight simulators representing that helicopter type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional validation data may be needed for flight simulators representing a helicopter with avionics of a different hardware design than the baseline, or a different software revision than that of previously validated configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When a flight simulator with additional or alternate avionics configurations is to be qualified, the QTG should contain tests against validation data for selected cases where avionics differences are expected to be significant.</p><p class="depth0">b. Approval Guidelines For Validating Alternate Avionics</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following guidelines apply to flight simulators representing helicopters with a revised avionics configuration, or more than one avionics configuration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The baseline validation data should be based on flight test data, except where other data are specifically allowed (e.g., engineering flight simulator data).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The helicopter avionics can be segmented into two groups, systems or components whose functional behavior contributes to the aircraft response presented in the QTG results, and systems that do not. The following avionics are examples of contributory systems for which hardware design changes or software revisions may lead to significant differences in the aircraft response relative to the baseline avionics configuration: Flight control computers and controllers for engines, autopilot, braking system, and nosewheel steering system, if applicable. Related avionics such as augmentation systems should also be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The acceptability of validation data used in the QTG for an alternative avionics fit should be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For changes to an avionics system or component that do not affect QTG validation test response, the QTG test can be based on validation data from the previously validated avionics configuration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For an avionics change to a contributory system, where a specific test is not affected by the change (e.g., the avionics change is a Built In Test Equipment (BITE) update or a modification in a different flight phase), the QTG test can be based on validation data from the previously-validated avionics configuration. The QTG should include authoritative justification (e.g., from the helicopter manufacturer or system supplier) that this avionics change does not affect the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For an avionics change to a contributory system, the QTG may be based on validation data from the previously-validated avionics configuration if no new functionality is added and the impact of the avionics change on the helicopter response is based on acceptable aeronautical principles with proven success history and valid outcomes. This should be supplemented with avionics-specific validation data from the helicopter manufacturer's engineering simulation, generated with the revised avionics configuration. The QTG should include an explanation of the nature of the change and its effect on the helicopter response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> For an avionics change to a contributory system that significantly affects some tests in the QTG, or where new functionality is added, the QTG should be based on validation data from the previously validated avionics configuration and supplemental avionics-specific flight test data sufficient to validate the alternate avionics revision. Additional flight test validation data may not be needed if the avionics changes were certified without the need for testing with a comprehensive flight instrumentation package. The helicopter manufacturer should coordinate flight simulator data requirements in advance with the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A matrix or ``roadmap'' should be provided with the QTG indicating the appropriate validation data source for each test. The roadmap should include identification of the revision state of those contributory avionics systems that could affect specific test responses.</p><p class="depth0">15. Transport Delay Testing</p><p class="depth0">a. This paragraph describes how to determine the introduced transport delay through the flight simulator system so that it does not exceed a specific time delay. The transport delay should be measured from control inputs through the interface, through each of the host computer modules and back through the interface to motion, flight instrument, and visual systems. The transport delay should not exceed the maximum allowable interval.</p><p class="depth0">b. Four specific examples of transport delay are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Simulation of classic non-computer controlled aircraft;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Simulation of Computer Controlled Aircraft using real helicopter black boxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Simulation of Computer Controlled Aircraft using software emulation of helicopter boxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Simulation using software avionics or rehosted instruments.</p><p class="depth0">c. Figure C2C illustrates the total transport delay for a non-computer-controlled helicopter or the classic transport delay test. Since there are no helicopter-induced delays for this case, the total transport delay is equivalent to the introduced delay.</p><p class="depth0">d. Figure C2D illustrates the transport delay testing method using the real helicopter controller system.</p><p class="depth0">e. To obtain the induced transport delay for the motion, instrument and visual signal, the delay induced by the helicopter controller should be subtracted from the total transport delay. This difference represents the introduced delay and should not exceed the standards prescribed in Table C1A.</p><p class="depth0">f. Introduced transport delay is measured from the flight deck control input to the reaction of the instruments and motion and visual systems (See Figure C2C).</p><p class="depth0">g. The control input may also be introduced after the helicopter controller system input and the introduced transport delay may be measured directly from the control input to the reaction of the instruments, and simulator motion and visual systems (See Figure C2D).</p><p class="depth0">h. Figure C2E illustrates the transport delay testing method used on a flight simulator that uses a software emulated helicopter controller system.</p><p class="depth0">i. It is not possible to measure the introduced transport delay using the simulated helicopter controller system architecture for the pitch, roll and yaw axes. Therefore, the signal should be measured directly from the pilot controller. The flight simulator manufacturer should measure the total transport delay and subtract the inherent delay of the actual helicopter components because the real helicopter controller system has an inherent delay provided by the helicopter manufacturer. The flight simulator manufacturer should ensure that the introduced delay does not exceed the standards prescribed in Table C1A.</p><p class="depth0">j. Special measurements for instrument signals for flight simulators using a real helicopter instrument display system instead of a simulated or re-hosted display. For flight instrument systems, the total transport delay should be measured and the inherent delay of the actual helicopter components subtracted to ensure that the introduced delay does not exceed the standards prescribed in Table C1A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Figure C2FA illustrates the transport delay procedure without helicopter display simulation. The introduced delay consists of the delay between the control movement and the instrument change on the data bus.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Figure C2FB illustrates the modified testing method required to measure introduced delay due to software avionics or re-hosted instruments. The total simulated instrument transport delay is measured and the helicopter delay should be subtracted from this total. This difference represents the introduced delay and should not exceed the standards prescribed in Table C1A. The inherent delay of the helicopter between the data bus and the displays is indicated in figure C2FA. The display manufacturer should provide this delay time.</p><p class="depth0">k. Recorded signals. The signals recorded to conduct the transport delay calculations should be explained on a schematic block diagram. The flight simulator manufacturer should also provide an explanation of why each signal was selected and how they relate to the above descriptions.</p><p class="depth0">l. Interpretation of results. Flight simulator results vary over time from test to test due to ``sampling uncertainty.'' All flight simulators run at a specific rate where all modules are executed sequentially in the host computer. The flight controls input can occur at any time in the iteration, but these data will not be processed before the start of the new iteration. For example, a flight simulator running at 60 Hz may have a difference of as much as 16.67 msec between results. This does not mean that the test has failed. Instead, the difference is attributed to variation in input processing. In some conditions, the host simulator and the visual system do not run at the same iteration rate, so the output of the host computer to the visual system will not always be synchronized.</p><p class="depth0">m. The transport delay test should account for both daylight and night modes of operation of the visual system. In both cases, the tolerances prescribed in Table C1A should be met and the motion response should occur before the end of the first video scan containing new information.

It has become standard practice for experienced simulator manufacturers to use such techniques as a means of establishing data bases for new simulator configurations while awaiting the availability of actual flight test data. The data generated from the aerodynamic modeling techniques is then compared to the flight test data when it becomes available. The results of such comparisons have become increasingly consistent, indicating that these techniques, applied with appropriate experience, are dependable and accurate for the development of aerodynamic models for use in Level B simulators.</p><p class="depth0">c. Based on this history of successful comparisons, the NSPM has concluded that those who are experienced in the development of aerodynamic models for simulator application can successfully use these modeling techniques to alter the method for acquiring flight test data for Level B simulators.</p><p class="depth0">d.

The NSPM position on the use of these alternative data sources, procedures, and instrumentation is based on the use of a rigorously defined and fully mature simulation controls system model that includes accurate gearing and cable stretch characteristics (where applicable), determined from actual aircraft measurements. The model does not require control surface position measurements in the flight test objective data in these limited applications.</p><p class="depth0">f. Data may be acquired by using an inertial measurement system and a synchronized video of the calibrated helicopter instruments, including the inclinometer; the force/position measurements of flight deck controls; and a clear visual directional reference for a known magnetic bearing (e.g., a runway centerline).

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">18. Visual Display Systems.</p><p class="depth0">a. Basic principles of a FFS collimated display:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The essential feature of a collimated display is that light rays coming from a given point in a picture are parallel. There are two main implications of the parallel rays:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The viewer's eyes focus at infinity and have zero convergence, providing a cue that the object is distant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The angle to any given point in the picture does not change when viewed from a different position so the object behaves geometrically as though it were located at a significant distance from the viewer. These cues are self-consistent, and are appropriate for any object that has been modeled as being at a significant distance from the viewer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In an ideal situation the rays are perfectly parallel, but most implementations provide only an approximation to the ideal. Typically, an FFS display provides an image located not closer than about 20-33 ft (6-10 m) from the viewer, with the distance varying over the field-of-view. A schematic representation of a collimated display is provided in Figure C2A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Collimated displays are well suited to many simulation applications as the area of interest is relatively distant from the observer so the angles to objects should remain independent of viewing position. Consider the view of the runway seen by the flight crew lined up on an approach. In the real world, the runway is distant and the light rays from the runway to the eyes are parallel. The runway appears to be straight ahead to both crew members. This situation is well simulated by a collimated display and is presented in Figure C2B. Note that the distance to the runway has been shortened for clarity. If drawn to scale, the runway would be farther away and the rays from the two seats would be closer to being parallel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> While the horizontal field-of-view of a collimated display can be extended to approximately 210-220, the vertical field-of-view has been limited to about 40-45. These limitations result from tradeoffs in optical quality and interference between the display components and flight deck structures, but were sufficient to meet FFS regulatory approval for Helicopter FFSs. However, recent designs have been introduced with vertical fields of view of up to 60 for helicopter applications.</p><p class="depth0">b. Basic principles of a FFS dome (or non-collimated) display:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The situation in a dome display is shown in Figure C2C. As the angles can be correct for only one eye point at a time, the visual system in the figure has been aligned for the right seat eye point position. The runway appears to be straight ahead of the aircraft for this viewer. For the left seat viewer, however, the runway appears to be somewhat to the right of the aircraft. As the aircraft is still moving towards the runway, the perceived velocity vector will be directed towards the runway and this will be interpreted as the aircraft having some yaw offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The situation is substantially different for near field objects encountered in helicopter operations close to the ground. In those cases, objects that should be interpreted as being close to the viewer will be misinterpreted as being distant in a collimated display. The errors can actually be reduced in a dome display.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The field-of-view possible with a dome display can be larger than that of a collimated display. Depending on the configuration, a field-of-view of 240 by 90 is possible and can be exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">c. Additional display considerations</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> While the situations described above are for discrete viewing positions, the same arguments can be extended to moving eye points produced by the viewer's head movement. In the real world, the parallax effects resulting from head movement provide distance cues. The effect is particularly strong for relative movement of flight deck structure in the near field and modeled objects in the distance. Collimated displays will provide accurate parallax cues for distant objects, but increasingly inaccurate cues for

near field objects. The situation is reversed for dome displays.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stereopsis cues resulting from the different images presented to each eye for objects relatively close to the viewer also provide depth cues. Again, the collimated and dome displays provide more or less accurate cues depending on the modeled distance of the objects being viewed.</p><p class="depth0">d. Training implications</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In view of the basic principles described above, it is clear that neither display approach provides a completely accurate image for all possible object distances. The sponsor should consider the training role of the FFS when configuring the display system to make the optimum choice. Factors that should be considered include relative importance of training tasks at low altitudes, the role of the two crew members in the flying tasks, and the field-of-view required for specific training tasks.

If fictional airports are used, the sponsor must ensure that navigational aids and all appropriate maps, charts, and other navigational reference material for the fictional

airports (and surrounding areas as necessary) are compatible, complete, and accurate with respect to the visual presentation and airport model of this fictional airport. An SOC must be submitted that addresses navigation aid installation and performance and other criteria (including obstruction clearance protection) for all instrument approaches to the fictional airports that are available in the simulator. The SOC must reference and account for information in the terminal instrument procedures manual and the construction and availability of the required maps, charts, and other navigational material. This material must be clearly marked ``for training purposes only.''</p><p class="depth0">c. When the simulator is being used by an instructor or evaluator for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter, only airport models classified as Class I, Class II, or Class III may be used by the instructor or evaluator. Detailed descriptions/definitions of these classifications are found in Appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">d. When a person sponsors an FFS maintained by a person other than a U.S. certificate holder, the sponsor is accountable for that FFS originally meeting, and continuing to meet, the criteria under which it was originally qualified and the appropriate Part 60 criteria, including the visual scenes and airport models that may be used by instructors or evaluators for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">e. Neither Class II nor Class III airport visual models are required to appear on the SOQ, and the method used for keeping instructors and evaluators apprised of the airport models that meet Class II or Class III requirements on any given simulator is at the option of the sponsor, but the method used must be available for review by the TPAA.</p><p class="depth0">f. When an airport model represents a real world airport and a permanent change is made to that real world airport (e.g., a new runway, an extended taxiway, a new lighting system, a runway closure) without a written extension grant from the NSPM (described in paragraph 1.g., of this section), an update to that airport model must be made in accordance with the following time limits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a new airport runway, a runway extension, a new airport taxiway, a taxiway extension, or a runway/taxiway closure--within 90 days of the opening for use of the new airport runway, runway extension, new airport taxiway, or taxiway extension; or within 90 days of the closure of the runway or taxiway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a new or modified approach light system--within 45 days of the activation of the new or modified approach light system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For other facility or structural changes on the airport (e.g., new terminal, relocation of Air Traffic Control Tower)--within 180 days of the opening of the new or changed facility or structure.</p><p class="depth0">g. If a sponsor desires an extension to the time limit for an update to a visual scene or airport model or has an objection to what must be updated in the specific airport model requirement, the sponsor must provide a written extension request to the NSPM stating the reason for the update delay and a proposed completion date or provide an explanation for the objection, explaining why the identified airport change will not have an impact on flight training, testing, or checking. A copy of this request or objection must also be sent to the POI/TCPM. The NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM; however, if there is an objection, after consultation with the appropriate POI/TCPM regarding the training, testing, or checking impact, the NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements

The tests in Table C3A, Operations Tasks, and Table C3G, Instructor Operating Station, in this attachment address the overall function and control of the simulator including the various simulated environmental conditions; simulated helicopter system operation (normal, abnormal, and emergency); visual system displays; and special effects necessary to meet flight crew training, evaluation, or flight experience requirements.</p><p class="depth0">d. All simulated helicopter systems functions will be assessed for normal and, where appropriate, alternate operations. Normal, abnormal, and emergency operations associated with a flight phase will be assessed during the evaluation of flight tasks or events within that flight phase. Simulated helicopter systems are listed separately under ``Any Flight Phase'' to ensure appropriate attention to systems checks. Operational navigation systems (including inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, or other long-range systems) and the associated electronic display systems will be evaluated if installed. The NSP pilot will include in his report to the TPAA, the effect of the system operation and any system limitation.</p><p class="depth0">e. Simulators demonstrating a satisfactory circling approach will be qualified for the circling approach maneuver and may be approved for such use by the TPAA in the sponsor's FAA-approved flight training program. To be considered satisfactory, the circling approach will be flown at maximum gross weight for landing, with minimum visibility for the helicopter approach category, and must allow proper alignment with a landing runway at least 90 different from the instrument approach course while allowing the pilot to keep an identifiable portion of the airport in sight throughout the maneuver (reference--14 CFR 91.175(e)).</p><p class="depth0">f. At the request of the TPAA, the NSP Pilot may assess the simulator for a special aspect of a sponsor's training program during the functions and subjective portion of an evaluation. Such an assessment may include a portion of a Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) scenario or special emphasis items in the sponsor's training program. Unless directly related to a requirement for the qualification level, the results of such an evaluation would not affect the qualification of the simulator.</p><p class="depth0">g. This appendix addresses helicopter simulators at Levels B, C, and D because there are no Level A Helicopter simulators.</p><p class="depth0">h. The FAA intends to allow the use of Class III airport models on a limited basis when the sponsor provides the TPAA (or other regulatory authority) an appropriate analysis of the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) necessary for competent performance of the tasks in which this particular media element is used. The analysis should describe the ability of the FFS/visual media to provide an adequate environment in which the required SKAs are satisfactorily performed and learned. The analysis should also include the specific media element, such as the visual scene or airport model. Additional sources of information on the conduct of task and capability analysis may be found on the FAA's Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) Web site at: http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/aqp/.</p><p class="depth0">h. The TPAA may accept Class III airport models without individual observation provided the sponsor provides the TPAA with an acceptable description of the process for determining the acceptability of a specific airport model, outlines the conditions under which such an airport model may be used, and adequately describes what restrictions will be applied to each resulting airport or landing area model. Examples of situations that may warrant Class III model designation by the TPAA include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Training, testing, or checking on very low visibility operations, including SMGCS operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instrument operations training (including instrument takeoff, departure, arrival, approach, and missed approach training, testing, or checking) using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A specific model that has been geographically ``moved'' to a different location and aligned with an instrument procedure for another airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A model that does not match changes made at the real-world airport (or landing area for helicopters) being modeled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A model generated with an ``off-board'' or an ``on-board'' model development tool (by providing proper latitude/longitude reference; correct runway or landing area orientation, length, width, marking, and lighting information; and appropriate adjacent taxiway location) to generate a facsimile of a real world airport or landing area.</p><p class="depth0">i. Previously qualified simulators with certain early generation Computer Generated Image (CGI) visual systems, are limited by the capability of the Image Generator or the display system used. These systems are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Early CGI visual systems that are exempt from the necessity of including runway numbers as a part of the specific runway marking requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Link NVS and DNVS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Novoview 2500 and 6000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> FlightSafety VITAL series up to, and including, VITAL III, but not beyond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Redifusion SP1, SP1T, and SP2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Early CGI visual systems are excepted from the necessity of including runway numbers unless the runway is used for LOFT training sessions. These LOFT airport models require runway numbers, but only for the specific runway end (one direction) used in the LOFT session. The systems required to display runway numbers only for LOFT scenes are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> FlightSafety VITAL IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Redifusion SP3 and SP3T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Link-Miles Image II.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following list of previously qualified CGI and display systems are incapable of generating blue lights. These systems are not required to have accurate taxi-way edge lighting are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Redifusion SP1 and SP1T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> FlightSafety Vital IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Link-Miles Image II and Image IIT</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> XKD displays (even though the XKD image generator is capable of generating blue colored lights, the display cannot accommodate that color).</p><p class="depth0">End Information

Applicable to all FFSs, regardless of the original qualification basis and qualification date (original or upgrade), having Class II or Class III airport models available.</p><p class="depth0">Agency: Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), DOT</p><p class="depth0">Action: This is a retroactive requirement to have all Class II or Class III airport models meet current requirements.________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Summary: Notwithstanding the authorization listed in paragraph 13b in Appendices A and C of this part, this FSTD Directive requires each certificate holder to ensure that by May 30, 2009, except for the airport model(s) used to qualify the simulator at the designated level, each airport model used by the certificate holder's instructors or evaluators for training, checking, or testing under this chapter in an FFS, meets the definition of a Class II or Class III airport model as defined in 14CFR part 60. The completion of this requirement will not require a report, and the method used for keeping instructors and evaluators apprised of the airport models that meet Class II or Class III requirements on any given simulator is at the option of the certificate holder whose employees are using the FFS, but the method used must be available for review by the TPAA for that certificate holder.</p><p class="depth0">Dates: FSTD Directive 1 becomes effective on May 30, 2008.</p><p class="depth0">For Further Information Contact: Ed Cook, Senior Advisor to the Division Manager, Air Transportation Division, AFS-200, 800 Independence Ave, SW, Washington, DC, 20591: telephone: (404) 832-4701; fax: (404) 761-8906.</p><p class="depth0">Specific Requirements:</p><p class="depth0">1. Part 60 requires that each FSTD be:</p><p class="depth0">a. Sponsored by a person holding or applying for an FAA operating certificate under Part 119, Part 141, or Part 142, or holding or applying for an FAA-approved training program under Part 63, Appendix C, for flight engineers, and</p><p class="depth0">b. Evaluated and issued an SOQ for a specific FSTD level.</p><p class="depth0">2. FFSs also require the installation of a visual system that is capable of providing an out-of-the-flight-deck view of airport models. However, historically these airport models were not routinely evaluated or required to meet any standardized criteria. This has led to qualified simulators containing airport models being used to meet FAA-approved training, testing, or checking requirements with potentially incorrect or inappropriate visual references.</p><p class="depth0">3. To prevent this from occurring in the future, by May 30, 2009, except for the airport model(s) used to qualify the simulator at the designated level, each certificate holder must assure that each airport model used for training, testing, or checking under this chapter in a qualified FFS meets the definition of a Class II or Class III airport model as defined in Appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">4. These references describe the requirements for visual scene management and the minimum distances from which runway or landing area features must be visible for all levels of simulator. The visual scene or airport model must provide, for each ``in-use runway'' or ``in-use landing area,'' runway or landing area surface and markings, runway or landing area lighting, taxiway surface and markings, and taxiway lighting. Additional requirements include correlation of the visual scenes or airport models with other aspects of the airport environment, correlation of the aircraft and associated equipment, scene quality assessment features, and the extent to which the instructor is able to exercise control of these scenes or models.</p><p class="depth0">5. For circling approaches, all requirements of this section apply to the runway used for the initial approach and to the runway of intended landing.</p><p class="depth0">6. The details in these scenes or models must be developed using airport pictures, construction drawings and maps, or other similar data, or be developed in accordance with published regulatory material. However, FSTD Directive 1 does not require that airport models contain details that are beyond the initially designed capability of the visual system, as currently qualified. The recognized limitations to visual systems are as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Visual systems not required to have runway numbers as a part of the specific runway marking requirements are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Link NVS and DNVS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Novoview 2500 and 6000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FlightSafety VITAL series up to, and including, VITAL III, but not beyond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Redifusion SP1, SP1T, and SP2.</p><p class="depth0">b. Visual systems required to display runway numbers only for LOFT scenes are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> FlightSafety VITAL IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Redifusion SP3 and SP3T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Link-Miles Image II.</p><p class="depth0">c. Visual systems not required to have accurate taxiway edge lighting are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Redifusion SP1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FlightSafety Vital IV.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Link-Miles Image II and Image IIT</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> XKD displays (even though the XKD image generator is capable of generating blue colored lights, the display cannot accommodate that color).</p><p class="depth0">7. A copy of this Directive must be filed in the MQTG in the designated FSTD Directive Section, and its inclusion must be annotated on the Index of Effective FSTD Directives chart. See Attachment 4, Appendices A through D of this part for a sample MQTG Index of Effective FSTD Directives chart.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">a. The intent of the language in Sec. 60.7(b) is to have a specific FTD, identified by the sponsor, used at least once in an FAA-approved flight training program for the helicopter simulated during the 12-month period described. The identification of the specific FTD may change from one 12-month period to the next 12-month period as long as that sponsor sponsors and uses at least one FTD at least once during the prescribed period. There is no minimum number of hours or minimum FTD periods required.</p><p class="depth0">b. The following examples describe acceptable operational practices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Example One.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A sponsor is sponsoring a single, specific FTD for its own use, in its own facility or elsewhere--this single FTD forms the basis for the sponsorship. The sponsor uses that FTD at least once in each 12-month period in that sponsor's FAA-approved flight training program for the helicopter simulated. This 12-month period is established according to the following schedule:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the FTD was qualified prior to May 30, 2008, the 12-month period begins on the date of the first continuing qualification evaluation conducted in accordance with Sec. 60.19 after May 30, 2008, and continues for each subsequent 12-month period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A device qualified on or after May 30, 2008, will be required to undergo an initial or upgrade evaluation in accordance with Sec. 60.15. Once the initial or upgrade evaluation is complete, the first continuing qualification evaluation will be conducted within 6 months. The 12 month continuing qualification evaluation cycle begins on that date and continues for each subsequent 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> There is no minimum number of hours of FTD use required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The identification of the specific FTD may change from one 12-month period to the next 12-month period as long as that sponsor sponsors and uses at least one FTD at least once during the prescribed period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example Two.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A sponsor sponsors an additional number of FTDs, in its facility or elsewhere.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. Flight test data used to validate FTD performance and handling qualities must have been gathered in accordance with a flight test program containing the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A flight test plan consisting of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The maneuvers and procedures required for aircraft certification and simulation programming and validation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For each maneuver or procedure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The procedures and control input the flight test pilot and/or engineer used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The atmospheric and environmental conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The initial flight conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The helicopter configuration, including weight and center of gravity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The data to be gathered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> All other information necessary to recreate the flight test conditions in the FTD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appropriately qualified flight test personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate and sufficient data acquisition equipment or system(s), including appropriate data reduction and analysis methods and techniques, acceptable to the FAA's Aircraft Certification Service.</p><p class="depth0">b. The data, regardless of source, must be presented:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In a format that supports the FTD validation process;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In a manner that is clearly readable and annotated correctly and completely;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With resolution sufficient to determine compliance with the tolerances set forth in Attachment 2, Table D2A Appendix D;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With any necessary guidance information provided; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Without alteration, adjustments, or bias. Data may be corrected to address known data calibration errors provided that an explanation of the methods used to correct the errors appears in the QTG. The corrected data may be re-scaled, digitized, or otherwise manipulated to fit the desired presentation</p><p class="depth0">c. After completion of any additional flight test, a flight test report must be submitted in support of the validation data. The report must contain sufficient data and rationale to support qualification of the FTD at the level requested.</p><p class="depth0">d. As required by Sec. 60.13(f), the sponsor must notify the NSPM when it becomes aware that an addition to or a revision of the flight related data or helicopter systems related data is available if this data is used to program and operate a qualified FTD. The data referred to in this sub-section is data used to validate the performance, handling qualities, or other characteristics of the aircraft, including data related to any relevant changes occurring after the type certification is issued. The sponsor must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 10 calendar days, notify the NSPM of the existence of this data; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Within 45 calendar days, notify the NSPM of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The schedule to incorporate this data into the FTD; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The reason for not incorporating this data into the FTD.</p><p class="depth0">e. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot tests'' results in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">f. The FTD sponsor is encouraged to maintain a liaison with the manufacturer of the aircraft being simulated (or with the holder of the aircraft type certificate for the aircraft being simulated if the manufacturer is no longer in business), and if appropriate, with the person having supplied the aircraft data package for the FTD in order to facilitate the notification described in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">g. It is the intent of the NSPM that for new aircraft entering service, at a point well in advance of preparation of the QTG, the sponsor should submit to the NSPM for approval, a descriptive document (see Appendix C of this part, Table C2D, Sample Validation Data Roadmap for Helicopters) containing the plan for acquiring the validation data, including data sources. This document should clearly identify sources of data for all required tests, a description of the validity of these data for a specific engine type and thrust rating configuration, and the revision levels of all avionics affecting the performance or flying qualities of the aircraft. Additionally, this document should provide other information such as the rationale or explanation for cases where data or data parameters are missing, instances where engineering simulation data are used, or where flight test methods require further explanations. It should also provide a brief narrative describing the cause and effect of any deviation from data requirements. The aircraft manufacturer may provide this document.</p><p class="depth0">h. There is no requirement for any flight test data supplier to submit a flight test plan or program prior to gathering flight test data. However, the NSPM notes that inexperienced data gatherers often provide data that is irrelevant, improperly marked, or lacking adequate justification for selection. Other problems include inadequate information regarding initial conditions or test maneuvers. The NSPM has been forced to refuse these data submissions as validation data for an FTD evaluation. For this reason the NSPM recommends that any data supplier not previously experienced in this area review the data necessary for programming and for validating the performance of the FTD and discuss the flight test plan anticipated for acquiring such data with the NSPM well in advance of commencing the flight tests.</p><p class="depth0">i. The NSPM will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether to approve supplemental validation data derived from flight data recording systems such as a Quick Access Recorder or Flight Data Recorder.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

In the event that the NSPM determines that special equipment or specifically qualified persons will be required to conduct an evaluation, the NSPM will make every attempt to notify the sponsor at least one (1) week, but in no case less than 72 hours, in advance of the evaluation. Examples of special equipment include flight control measurement devices, accelerometers, or oscilloscopes. Examples of specially qualified personnel include individuals specifically qualified to install or use any special equipment when its use is required.</p><p class="depth0">b.

The sponsor may elect to complete the QTG objective and subjective tests at the manufacturer's facility or at the sponsor's training facility. If the tests are conducted at the manufacturer's facility, the sponsor must repeat at least one-third of the tests at the sponsor's training facility in order to substantiate FTD performance. The QTG must be clearly annotated to indicate when and where each test was accomplished. Tests conducted at the manufacturer's facility and at the sponsor's training facility must be conducted after the FTD is assembled with systems and sub-systems functional and operating in an interactive manner. The test results must be submitted to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0">i. The sponsor must maintain a copy of the MQTG at the FTD location.</p><p class="depth0">j. All FTDs for which the initial qualification is conducted after May 30, 2014, must have an electronic MQTG (eMQTG) including all objective data obtained from helicopter testing, or another approved source (reformatted or digitized), together with correlating objective test results obtained from the performance of the FTD (reformatted or digitized) as prescribed in this appendix.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">m. Only those FTDs that are sponsored by a certificate holder as defined in Appendix F of this part will be evaluated by the NSPM. However, other FTD evaluations may be conducted on a case-by-case basis as the Administrator deems appropriate, but only in accordance with applicable agreements.</p><p class="depth0">n. The NSPM will conduct an evaluation for each configuration, and each FTD must be evaluated as completely as possible. To ensure a thorough and uniform evaluation,

each FTD is subjected to the general FTD requirements in Attachment 1 of this appendix, the objective tests listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix, and the subjective tests listed in Attachment 3 of this appendix. The evaluations described herein will include, but not necessarily be limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Helicopter responses, including longitudinal and lateral-directional control responses (see Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance in authorized portions of the simulated helicopter's operating envelope, to include tasks evaluated by the NSPM in the areas of surface operations, takeoff, climb, cruise, descent, approach and landing, as well as abnormal and emergency operations (see Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Control checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Flight deck configuration (see Attachment 1 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pilot, flight engineer, and instructor station functions checks (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 3 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Helicopter systems and sub-systems (as appropriate) as compared to the helicopter simulated (see attachment 1 and attachment 3 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> FTD systems and sub-systems, including force cueing (motion), visual, and aural (sound) systems, as appropriate (see Attachment 1 and Attachment 2 of this appendix).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain additional requirements, depending upon the qualification level sought, including equipment or circumstances that may become hazardous to the occupants. The sponsor may be subject to Occupational Safety and Health Administration requirements.</p><p class="depth0">o. The NSPM administers the objective and subjective tests, which include an examination of functions. The tests include a qualitative assessment of the FTD by an NSP pilot. The NSP evaluation team leader may assign other qualified personnel to assist in accomplishing the functions examination and/or the objective and subjective tests performed during an evaluation when required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Objective tests provide a basis for measuring and evaluating FTD performance and determining compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Subjective tests provide a basis for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Evaluating the capability of the FTD to perform over a typical utilization period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining that the FTD satisfactorily simulates each required task;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Verifying correct operation of the FTD controls, instruments, and systems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Demonstrating compliance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0">p. The tolerances for the test parameters listed in Attachment 2 of this appendix reflect the range of tolerances acceptable to the NSPM for FTD validation and are not to be confused with design tolerances specified for FTD manufacture. In making decisions regarding tests and test results, the NSPM relies on the use of operational and engineering judgment in the application of data (including consideration of the way in which the flight test was flown and way the data was gathered and applied), data presentations, and the applicable tolerances for each test.</p><p class="depth0">q. In addition to the scheduled continuing qualification evaluation, each FTD is subject to evaluations conducted by the NSPM at any time without prior notification to the sponsor. Such evaluations would be accomplished in a normal manner (i.e., requiring exclusive use of the FTD for the conduct of objective and subjective tests and an examination of functions) if the FTD is not being used for flight crewmember training, testing, or checking. However, if the FTD were being used, the evaluation would be conducted in a non-exclusive manner. This non-exclusive evaluation will be conducted by the FTD evaluator accompanying the check airman, instructor, Aircrew Program Designee (APD), or FAA inspector aboard the FTD along with the student(s) and observing the operation of the FTD during the training, testing, or checking activities.</p><p class="depth0">r. Problems with objective test results are handled as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a problem with an objective test result is detected by the NSP evaluation team during an evaluation, the test may be repeated or the QTG may be amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If it is determined that the results of an objective test do not support the qualification level requested but do support a lower level, the NSPM may qualify the FTD at a lower level.</p><p class="depth0">s. After an FTD is successfully evaluated, the NSPM issues an SOQ to the sponsor. The NSPM recommends the FTD to the TPAA, who will approve the FTD for use in a flight training program. The SOQ will be issued at the satisfactory conclusion of the initial or continuing qualification evaluation and will list the tasks for which the FTD is qualified, referencing the tasks described in Table D1B in Attachment 1 of this appendix. However, it is the sponsor's responsibility to obtain TPAA approval prior to using the FTD in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">t. Under normal circumstances, the NSPM establishes a date for the initial or upgrade evaluation within ten (10) working days after determining that a complete QTG is acceptable. Unusual circumstances may warrant establishing an evaluation date before this determination is made. A sponsor may schedule an evaluation date as early as 6 months in advance. However, there may be a delay of 45 days or more in rescheduling and completing the evaluation if the sponsor is unable to meet the scheduled date. See Attachment 4, of this appendix, Figure D4A,

Sample Request for Initial, Upgrade, or Reinstatement Evaluation.</p><p class="depth0">u. The numbering system used for objective test results in the QTG should closely follow the numbering system set out in Attachment 2, FTD Objective Tests, Table D2A of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">v. Contact the NSPM or visit the NSPM Web site for additional information regarding the preferred qualifications of pilots used to meet the requirements of Sec. 60.15(d).</p><p class="depth0">w. Examples of the exclusions for which the FTD might not have been subjectively tested by the sponsor or the NSPM and for which qualification might not be sought or granted, as described in Sec. 60.15(g)(6), include approaches to and departures from slopes and pinnacles.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

In instances where a sponsor plans to remove an FTD from active status for a period of less than two years, the following procedures apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The NSPM must be notified in writing and the notification must include an estimate of the period that the FTD will be inactive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Continuing Qualification evaluations will not be scheduled during the inactive period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The NSPM will remove the FTD from the list of qualified FTDs on a mutually established date not later than the date on which the first missed continuing qualification evaluation would have been scheduled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Before the FTD is restored to qualified status, it must be evaluated by the NSPM. The evaluation content and the time required to accomplish the evaluation is based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and sponsor-conducted quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The sponsor must notify the NSPM of any changes to the original scheduled time out of service.</p><p class="depth0">b. FTDs and replacement FTD systems qualified prior to May 30, 2008, are not required to meet the general FTD requirements, the objective test requirements, and the subjective test requirements of Attachments 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of this appendix as long as the FTD continues to meet the test requirements contained in the MQTG developed under the original qualification basis.</p><p class="depth0">c. After (1 year after date of publication of the final rule in the Federal Register) each visual scene and airport model installed in and available for use in a qualified FTD must meet the requirements described in Attachment 3 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">d. Simulators qualified prior to May 30, 2008, may be updated. If an evaluation is deemed appropriate or necessary by the NSPM after such an update, the evaluation will not require an evaluation to standards beyond those against which the simulator was originally qualified.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">e. Other certificate holders or persons desiring to use an FTD may contract with FTD sponsors to use FTDs previously qualified at a particular level for a helicopter type and approved for use within an FAA-approved flight training program. Such FTDs are not required to undergo an additional qualification process, except as described in Sec. 60.16.</p><p class="depth0">f. Each FTD user must obtain approval from the appropriate TPAA to use any FTD in an FAA-approved flight training program.</p><p class="depth0">g. The intent of the requirement listed in Sec. 60.17(b), for each FTD to have an SOQ within 6 years, is to have the availability of that statement (including the configuration list and the limitations to authorizations) to provide a complete picture of the FTD inventory regulated by the FAA. The issuance of the statement will not require any additional evaluation or require any adjustment to the evaluation basis for the FTD.</p><p class="depth0">h. Downgrading of an FTD is a permanent change in qualification level and will necessitate the issuance of a revised SOQ to reflect the revised qualification level, as appropriate. If a temporary restriction is placed on an FTD because of a missing, malfunctioning, or inoperative component or on-going repairs, the restriction is not a permanent change in qualification level. Instead, the restriction is temporary and is removed when the reason for the restriction has been resolved.</p><p class="depth0">i. It is not the intent of the NSPM to discourage the improvement of existing simulation (e.g., the ``updating'' of a control loading system, or the replacement of the IOS with a more capable unit) by requiring the

``updated'' device to meet the qualification standards current at the time of the update. Depending on the extent of the update, the NSPM may require that the updated device be evaluated and may require that an evaluation include all or a portion of the elements of an initial evaluation. However, the standards against which the device would be evaluated are those that are found in the MQTG for that device.</p><p class="depth0">j. The NSPM will determine the evaluation criteria for an FTD that has been removed from active status for a prolonged period. The criteria will be based on the number of continuing qualification evaluations and quarterly inspections missed during the period of inactivity. For example, if the FTD were out of service for a 1 year period, it would be necessary to complete the entire QTG, since all of the quarterly evaluations would have been missed. The NSPM will also consider how the FTD was stored, whether parts were removed from the FTD and whether the FTD was disassembled.</p><p class="depth0">k. The FTD will normally be requalified using the FAA-approved MQTG and the criteria that was in effect prior to its removal from qualification. However, inactive periods of 2 years or more will require re-qualification under the standards in effect and current at the time of requalification.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

If the NSP evaluator plans to accomplish specific tests during a normal continuing qualification evaluation that requires the use of special equipment or technicians, the sponsor will be notified as far in advance of the evaluation as practical; but not less than 72 hours. Examples of such tests include latencies and control sweeps.</p><p class="depth0">g. The continuing qualification evaluations described in Sec. 60.19(b) will normally require 4 hours of FTD time. However, flexibility is necessary to address abnormal situations or situations involving aircraft with additional levels of complexity (e.g., computer controlled aircraft). The sponsor should anticipate that some tests may require additional time. The continuing qualification evaluations will consist of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Review of the results of the quarterly inspections conducted by the sponsor since the last scheduled continuing qualification evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A selection of approximately 8 to 15 objective tests from the MQTG that provide an adequate opportunity to evaluate the performance of the FTD. The tests chosen will be performed either automatically or manually and should be able to be conducted within approximately one-third (1/3) of the allotted FTD time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A subjective evaluation of the FTD to perform a representative sampling of the tasks set out in attachment 3 of this appendix. This portion of the evaluation should take approximately two-thirds (2/3) of the allotted FTD time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An examination of the functions of the FTD may include the motion system, visual system, sound system as applicable, instructor operating station, and the normal functions and simulated malfunctions of the simulated helicopter systems. This examination is normally accomplished simultaneously with the subjective evaluation requirements.</p><p class="depth0">h. The requirement established in Sec. 60.19(b)(4) regarding the frequency of NSPM-conducted continuing qualification evaluations for each FTD is typically 12 months. However, the establishment and satisfactory implementation of an approved QMS for a sponsor will provide a basis for adjusting the frequency of evaluations to exceed 12-month intervals.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

A Level 4 device is one that may have an open helicopter-specific flight deck area, or an enclosed helicopter-specific flight deck and at least one operating system. Air/ground logic is required (no aerodynamic programming required). All displays may be flat/LCD panel representations or actual representations of displays in the aircraft. All controls, switches, and knobs may be touch sensitive activation (not capable of manual manipulation of the flight controls) or may physically replicate the aircraft in control operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Level 5. A Level 5 device is one that may have an open helicopter-specific flight deck area, or an enclosed helicopter-specific flight deck and a generic aerodynamic program with at least one operating system and control loading representative of the simulated helicopter. The control loading need only represent the helicopter at an approach speed and configuration. All displays may be flat/LCD panel representations or actual representations of displays in the aircraft. Primary and secondary flight controls (e.g., rudder, aileron, elevator, flaps, spoilers/speed brakes, engine controls, landing gear, nosewheel steering, trim, brakes) must be physical controls. All other controls, switches, and knobs may be touch sensitive activation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Level 6. A Level 6 device is one that has an enclosed helicopter-specific flight deck and aerodynamic program with all applicable helicopter systems operating and control loading that is representative of the simulated helicopter throughout its ground and flight envelope and significant sound representation. All displays may be flat/LCD panel representations or actual representations of displays in the aircraft, but all controls, switches, and knobs must physically replicate the aircraft in control operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Level 7. A Level 7 device is one that has an enclosed helicopter-specific flight deck and aerodynamic program with all applicable helicopter systems operating and control loading that is representative of the simulated helicopter throughout its ground and flight envelope and significant sound representation. All displays may be flat/LCD panel representations or actual representations of displays in the aircraft, but all controls, switches, and knobs must physically replicate the aircraft in control operation. It also has a visual system that provides an out-of-the-flight deck view, providing cross-flight deck viewing (for both pilots simultaneously) of a field-of-view of at least 146 horizontally and 36 vertically as well as a vibration cueing system for characteristic helicopter vibrations noted at the pilot station(s).</p><p class="depth0">End Information

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Discussion</p><p class="depth0">a. If relevant winds are present in the objective data, the wind vector (magnitude and direction) should be noted as part of the data presentation, expressed in conventional terminology, and related to the runway being used for the test.</p><p class="depth0">b. The format for numbering the objective tests in Appendix C of this part, Attachment 2, Table C2A, and the objective tests in Appendix D of this part, Attachment 2, Table D2A, is identical. However, each test required for FFSs is not necessarily required for FTDs, and each test required for FTDs is not necessarily required for FFSs. When a test number (or series of numbers) is not required, the term ``Reserved'' is used in the table at that location. Following this numbering format provides a degree of commonality between the two tables and substantially reduces the potential for confusion when referring to objective test numbers for either FFSs or FTDs.</p><p class="depth0">c. A Level 4 FTD does not require objective tests and is not addressed in the following table.</p><p class="depth0">End Information
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">2. Test Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The ground and flight tests required for qualification are listed in Table D2A Objective Evaluation Tests. Computer generated FTD test results must be provided for each test except where an alternate test is specifically authorized by the NSPM. If a flight condition or operating condition is required for the test but does not apply to the helicopter being simulated or to the qualification level sought, it may be disregarded (e.g., engine out climb capability for a single-engine helicopter). Each test result is compared against the validation data described in Sec. 60.13, and in Appendix B of this part. The results must be produced on an appropriate recording device acceptable to the NSPM and must include FTD number, date, time, conditions, tolerances, and appropriate dependent variables portrayed in comparison to the validation data. Time histories are required unless otherwise indicated in Table D2A. All results must be labeled using the tolerances and units given.</p><p class="depth0">b. Table D2A in this attachment sets out the test results required, including the parameters, tolerances, and flight conditions for FTD validation. Tolerances are provided for the listed tests because mathematical modeling and acquisition and development of reference data are often inexact. All tolerances listed in the following tables are applied to FTD performance. When two tolerance values are given for a parameter, the less restrictive may be used unless otherwise indicated. In those cases where a tolerance is expressed only as a percentage, the tolerance percentage applies to the maximum value of that parameter within its normal operating range as measured from the neutral or zero position unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">c. Certain tests included in this attachment must be supported with an SOC. In Table D2A, requirements for SOCs are indicated in the ``Test Details'' column.</p><p class="depth0">d. When operational or engineering judgment is used in making assessments for flight test data applications for FTD validity, such judgment must not be limited to a single parameter. For example, data that exhibit rapid variations of the measured parameters may require interpolations or a ``best fit'' data section. All relevant parameters related to a given maneuver or flight condition must be provided to allow overall interpretation. When it is difficult or impossible to match FTD to helicopter data throughout a time history, differences must be justified by providing a comparison of other related variables for the condition being assessed.</p><p class="depth0">e. The FTD may not be programmed so that the mathematical modeling is correct only at the validation test points. Unless noted otherwise, tests must represent helicopter performance and handling qualities at operating weights and centers of gravity (CG) typical of normal operation. If a test is

supported by aircraft data at one extreme weight or CG, another test supported by aircraft data at mid-conditions or as close as possible to the other extreme is necessary. Certain tests that are relevant only at one extreme CG or weight condition need not be repeated at the other extreme. The results of the tests for Level 6 are expected to be indicative of the device's performance and handling qualities throughout all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The helicopter weight and CG envelope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operational envelope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Varying atmospheric ambient and environmental conditions--including the extremes authorized for the respective helicopter or set of helicopters.</p><p class="depth0">f. When comparing the parameters listed to those of the helicopter, sufficient data must also be provided to verify the correct flight condition and helicopter configuration changes. For example, to show that control force is within the parameters for a static stability test, data to show the correct airspeed, power, thrust or torque, helicopter configuration, altitude, and other appropriate datum identification parameters must also be given. If comparing short period dynamics, normal acceleration may be used to establish a match to the helicopter, but airspeed, altitude, control input, helicopter configuration, and other appropriate data must also be given. If comparing landing gear change dynamics, pitch, airspeed, and altitude may be used to establish a match to the helicopter, but landing gear position must also be provided. All airspeed values must be properly annotated (e.g., indicated versus calibrated). In addition, the same variables must be used for comparison (e.g., compare inches to inches rather than inches to centimeters).</p><p class="depth0">g. The QTG provided by the sponsor must clearly describe how the FTD will be set up and operated for each test. Each FTD subsystem may be tested independently, but overall integrated testing of the FTD must be accomplished to assure that the total FTD system meets the prescribed standards. A manual test procedure with explicit and detailed steps for completing each test must also be provided.</p><p class="depth0">h. For previously qualified FTDs, the tests and tolerances of this attachment may be used in subsequent continuing qualification evaluations for any given test if the sponsor has submitted a proposed MQTG revision to the NSPM and has received NSPM approval.</p><p class="depth0">i. Tests of handling qualities must include validation of augmentation devices. FTDs for highly augmented helicopters will be validated both in the unaugmented configuration (or failure state with the maximum permitted degradation in handling qualities) and the augmented configuration. Where various levels of handling qualities result from failure states, validation of the effect of the failure is necessary. For those performance and static handling qualities tests where the primary concern is control position in the unaugmented configuration, unaugmented data are not required if the design of the system precludes any affect on control position. In those instances where the unaugmented helicopter response is divergent and non-repeatable, it may not be feasible to meet the specified tolerances. Alternative requirements for testing will be mutually agreed upon by the sponsor and the NSPM on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">j. Some tests will not be required for helicopters using helicopter hardware in the FTD flight deck (e.g., ``helicopter modular controller''). These exceptions are noted in Section 2 ``Handling Qualities'' in Table D2A of this attachment. However, in these cases, the sponsor must provide a statement that the helicopter hardware meets the appropriate manufacturer's specifications and the sponsor must have supporting information to that fact available for NSPM review.</p><p class="depth0">k. In cases where light-class helicopters are being simulated, prior coordination with the NSPM on acceptable weight ranges is required. The terms ``light,'' ``medium,'' and ``near maximum,'' may not be appropriate for the simulation of light-class helicopters.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">l. In those cases where the objective test results authorize a ``snapshot test'' or a ``series of snapshot test'' results in lieu of a time-history result, the sponsor or other data provider must ensure that a steady state condition exists at the instant of time captured by the ``snapshot.'' The steady state condition must exist from 4 seconds prior to, through 1 second following, the instant of time captured by the snap shot.</p><p class="depth0">m.

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">3. Control Dynamics</p><p class="depth0">a. The characteristics of a helicopter flight control system have a major effect on the handling qualities. A significant consideration in pilot acceptability of a helicopter is the ``feel'' provided through the flight deck controls. Considerable effort is expended on helicopter feel system design in order to deliver a system with which pilots will be comfortable and consider the helicopter desirable to fly. In order for an FTD to be representative, it too must present the pilot with the proper feel; that of the respective helicopter. Compliance with this requirement is determined by comparing a recording of the control feel dynamics of the FFS to actual helicopter measurements in the hover and cruise configurations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Recordings such as free response to an impulse or step function are classically used to estimate the dynamic properties of electromechanical systems. It is only possible to estimate the dynamic properties as a result of only being able to estimate true inputs and responses. Therefore, it is imperative that the best possible data be collected since close matching of the FTD control loading system to the helicopter systems is essential. Control feel dynamic tests are described in the Table of Objective Tests in this appendix. Where accomplished, the free response is measured after a step or pulse input is used to excite the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For initial and upgrade evaluations, it is required that control dynamic characteristics be measured at and recorded directly from the flight deck controls. This procedure is usually accomplished by measuring the free response of the controls using a step or pulse input to excite the system. The procedure must be accomplished in hover, climb, cruise, and autorotation. For helicopters with irreversible control systems, measurements may be obtained on the ground. The procedure should be accomplished in the hover and cruise flight conditions and configurations. Proper pitot-static inputs (if appropriate) must be provided to represent airspeeds typical of those encountered in flight.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It may be shown that for some helicopters, climb, cruise, and autorotation have like effects. Thus, some tests for one may suffice for some tests for another. If either or both considerations apply, engineering validation or helicopter manufacturer rationale must be submitted as justification for ground tests or for eliminating a configuration. For FTDs requiring static and dynamic tests at the controls, special test fixtures will not be required during initial and upgrade evaluations if the sponsor's QTG shows both test fixture results and the results of an alternative approach, such as computer plots which were produced concurrently and show satisfactory agreement. Repeat of the alternative method during the initial evaluation satisfies this test requirement.</p><p class="depth0">b. Control Dynamics Evaluations. The dynamic properties of control systems are often stated in terms of frequency, damping, and a number of other classical measurements which can be found in texts on control systems. In order to establish a consistent means of validating test results for FTD control loading, criteria are needed that will clearly define the interpretation of the measurements and the tolerances to be applied. Criteria are needed for both the underdamped system and the overdamped system, including the critically damped case. In the case of an underdamped system with very light damping, the system may be quantified in terms of frequency and damping. In critically damped or overdamped systems, the frequency and damping is not readily measured from a response time history. Therefore, some other measurement must be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tests to verify that control feel dynamics represent the helicopter must show that the dynamic damping cycles (free response of the control) match that of the helicopter within specified tolerances. The method of evaluating the response and the tolerance to be applied are described below for the underdamped and critically damped cases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Underdamped Response. Two measurements are required for the period, the time to first zero crossing (in case a rate limit is present) and the subsequent frequency of oscillation. It is necessary to measure cycles on an individual basis in case there are nonuniform periods in the response. Each period will be independently compared to the respective period of the helicopter control system and, consequently, will enjoy the full tolerance specified for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The damping tolerance will be applied to overshoots on an individual basis. Care must be taken when applying the tolerance to small overshoots since the significance of such overshoots becomes questionable. Only those overshoots larger than 5 percent of the total initial displacement will be considered significant. The residual band, labeled T(Ad) on Figure 1 of this attachment is [5 percent of the initial displacement amplitude, Ad, from the steady state value of the oscillation. Oscillations within the residual band are considered insignificant. When comparing simulator data to helicopter data, the process would begin by overlaying or aligning the simulator and helicopter steady state values and then comparing amplitudes of oscillation peaks, the time of the first zero crossing, and individual periods of oscillation. To be satisfactory, the simulator must show the same number of significant overshoots to within one when compared against

the helicopter data. The procedure for evaluating the response is illustrated in Figure 1 of this attachment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Critically Damped and Overdamped Response. Due to the nature of critically damped responses (no overshoots), the time to reach 90 percent of the steady state (neutral point) value must be the same as the helicopter within [10 percent. The simulator response must be critically damped also. Figure 2 of this attachment illustrates the procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special considerations. Control systems that exhibit characteristics other than classical overdamped or underdamped responses should meet specified tolerances. In addition, special consideration should be given to ensure that significant trends are maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tolerances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following summarizes the tolerances, ``T'' for underdamped systems, and ``n'' is the sequential period of a full cycle of oscillation. See Figure D2A of this attachment for an illustration of the referenced measurements.

Except for special use airport models, all airport models required by this part must be representations of real-world, operational airports or representations of fictional airports and must meet the requirements set out in Tables D3B or D3C of this attachment, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">b. If fictional airports are used, the sponsor must ensure that navigational aids and all appropriate maps, charts, and other navigational reference material for the fictional airports (and surrounding areas as necessary) are compatible, complete, and accurate with respect to the visual presentation and the airport model of this fictional airport. An SOC must be submitted that addresses navigation aid installation and performance and other criteria (including obstruction clearance protection) for all instrument approaches to the fictional airports that are available in the simulator. The SOC must reference and account for information in the terminal instrument procedures manual and the construction and availability of the required maps, charts, and other navigational material. This material must be clearly marked ``for training purposes only.''</p><p class="depth0">c. When the simulator is being used by an instructor or evaluator for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter, only airport models classified as Class I, Class II, or Class III may be used by the instructor or evaluator. Detailed descriptions/definitions of these classifications are found in Appendix F of this part.</p><p class="depth0">d. When a person sponsors an FTD maintained by a person other than a U.S. certificate holder, the sponsor is accountable for that FTD originally meeting, and continuing to meet, the criteria under which it was originally qualified and the appropriate Part 60 criteria, including the visual scenes and airport models that may be used by instructors or evaluators for purposes of training, checking, or testing under this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">e. Neither Class II nor Class III airport visual models are required to appear on the SOQ, and the method used for keeping instructors and evaluators apprised of the airport models that meet Class II or Class III requirements on any given simulator is at the option of the sponsor, but the method used must be available for review by the TPAA.</p><p class="depth0">f. When an airport model represents a real world airport and a permanent change is made to that real world airport (e.g., a new runway, an extended taxiway, a new lighting system, a runway closure) without a written extension grant from the NSPM (described in paragraph 1.g., of this section), an update to that airport model must be made in accordance with the following time limits:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a new airport runway, a runway extension, a new airport taxiway, a taxiway extension, or a runway/taxiway closure--within 90 days of the opening for use of the new airport runway, runway extension, new airport taxiway, or taxiway extension; or within 90 days of the closure of the runway or taxiway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a new or modified approach light system--within 45 days of the activation of the new or modified approach light system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For other facility or structural changes on the airport (e.g., new terminal, relocation of Air Traffic Control Tower)--within 180 days of the opening of the new or changed facility or structure.</p><p class="depth0">g. If a sponsor desires an extension to the time limit for an update to a visual scene or airport model or has an objection to what must be updated in the specific airport model requirement, the sponsor must provide a written extension request to the NPSM stating the reason for the update delay and a proposed completion date or provide an explanation for the objection, explaining why the identified airport change will not have an impact on flight training, testing, or checking. A copy of this request or objection must also be sent to the POI/TCPM. The NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM; however, if there is an objection, after consultation with the appropriate POI/TCPM regarding the training, testing, or checking impact, the NSPM will send the official response to the sponsor and a copy to the POI/TCPM.</p><p class="depth0">h. Examples of situations that may warrant Class--III model designation by the TPAA include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Training, testing, or checking on very low visibility operations, including SMGCS operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Instrument operations training (including instrument takeoff, departure, arrival, approach, and missed approach training, testing, or checking) using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A specific model that has been geographically ``moved'' to a different location and aligned with an instrument procedure for another airport.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A model that does not match changes made at the real-world airport (or landing area for helicopters) being modeled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A model generated with an ``off-board'' or an ``on-board'' model development tool (by providing proper latitude/longitude reference; correct runway or landing area orientation, length, width, marking, and lighting information; and appropriate adjacent taxiway location) to generate a facsimile of a real world airport or landing area.</p><p class="depth0">These airport models may be accepted by the TPAA without individual observation provided the sponsor provides the TPAA with an acceptable description of the process for determining the acceptability of a specific airport model, outlines the conditions under which such an airport model may be used, and adequately describes what restrictions will be applied to each resulting airport or landing area model.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements

They must not be used to limit or exceed the authorizations for use of a given level of FTD as found in the Practical Test Standards or as approved by the TPAA. All items in the following paragraphs are subject to an examination of function.</p><p class="depth0">b. The List of Operations Tasks in Table D3A addressing pilot functions and maneuvers is divided by flight phases. All simulated helicopter systems functions will be assessed for normal and, where appropriate, alternate operations. Normal, abnormal, and emergency operations associated with a flight phase will be assessed during the evaluation of maneuvers or events within that flight phase.</p><p class="depth0">c. Systems to be evaluated are listed separately under ``Any Flight Phase'' to ensure appropriate attention to systems checks. Operational navigation systems (including inertial navigation systems, global positioning systems, or other long-range systems) and the associated electronic display systems will be evaluated if installed. The NSP pilot will include in his report to the TPAA, the effect of the system operation and any system limitation.</p><p class="depth0">d. At the request of the TPAA, the NSP Pilot may assess the FTD for a special aspect of a sponsor's training program during the functions and subjective portion of an evaluation. Such an assessment may include a portion of a specific operation (e.g., a Line Oriented Flight Training (LOFT) scenario) or special emphasis items in the sponsor's training program. Unless directly related to a requirement for the qualification level, the results of such an evaluation would not necessarily affect the qualification of the FTD.</p><p class="depth0">e. The FAA intends to allow the use of Class III airport models on a limited basis when the sponsor provides the TPAA (or other regulatory authority) an appropriate

analysis of the skills, knowledge, and abilities (SKAs) necessary for competent performance of the tasks in which this particular media element is used. The analysis should describe the ability of the FTD/visual media to provide an adequate environment in which the required SKAs are satisfactorily performed and learned. The analysis should also include the specific media element, such as the visual scene or airport model. Additional sources of information on the conduct of task and capability analysis may be found on the FAA's Advanced Qualification Program (AQP) Web site at: http://www.faa.gov/education_research/training/aqp.</p><p class="depth0">End Information

________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin QPS Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. Not later than May 30, 2010, each current sponsor of an FSTD must submit to the NSPM a proposed Quality Management System (QMS) program as described in this appendix. The NSPM will notify the sponsor of the acceptability of the program, including any required adjustments. Within 6 months of the notification of acceptability, the sponsor must implement the program, conduct internal audits, make required program adjustments as a result of any internal audit, and schedule the NSPM initial audit.</p><p class="depth0">b. First-time FSTD sponsors must submit to the NSPM the proposed QMS program no later than 120 days before the initial FSTD evaluation. The NSPM will notify the sponsor of the acceptability of the program, including any required adjustments. Within 6 months of the notification of acceptability, the sponsor must implement the program, conduct internal audits, make required program adjustments as a result of any internal audit, and schedule the NSPM initial audit.</p><p class="depth0">c. The Director of Operations for a Part 119 certificate holder, the Chief Instructor for a Part 141 certificate holder, or the equivalent for a Part 142 or Flight Engineer School sponsor must designate a Management Representative (MR) who has the authority to establish and modify the sponsor's policies, practices, and procedures regarding the QMS program for the recurring qualification and the daily use of each FSTD.</p><p class="depth0">d. The minimum content required for an acceptable QMS is found in Table E1. The policies, processes, or procedures described in this table must be maintained in a Quality Manual and will serve as the basis for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The sponsor-conducted initial and recurring periodic assessments;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The NSPM-conducted initial and recurring periodic assessments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The continuing surveillance and analysis by the NSPM of the sponsor's performance and effectiveness in providing a satisfactory FSTD for use on a regular basis.</p><p class="depth0">e. The sponsor must conduct assessments of its QMS program in segments. The segments will be established by the NSPM at the initial assessment, and the interval for the segment assessments will be every 6

months. The intervals for the segment assessments may be extended beyond 6 months as the QMS program matures, but will not be extended beyond 12 months. The entire QMS program must be assessed every 24 months.</p><p class="depth0">f. The periodic assessments conducted by the NSPM will be conducted at intervals not less than once every 24 months, and include a comprehensive review of the QMS program. These reviews will be conducted more frequently if warranted.</p><p class="depth0">End QPS Requirements
________________________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Begin Information</p><p class="depth0">g. An example of a segment assessment--At the initial QMS assessment, the NSPM will divide the QMS program into segments (e.g., 6 separate segments). There must be an assessment of a certain number of segments every 6 months (i.e., segments 1 and 2 at the end of the first 6 month period; segments 3 and 4 at the end of the second 6 month period (or one year); and segments 5 and 6 at the end of the third 6 month period (or 18 months). As the program matures, the interval between assessments may be extended to 12 months (e.g., segments 1, 2, and 3 at the end of the first year; and segments 4, 5, and 6 at the end of the second year). In both cases, the entire QMS program is assessed at least every 24 months.</p><p class="depth0">h. The following materials are presented to assist sponsors in preparing for an NSPM evaluation of the QMS program. The sample documents include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The NSPM desk assessment tool for initial evaluation of the required elements of a QMS program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The NSPM on-site assessment tool for initial and continuing evaluation of the required elements of a QMS program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An Element Assessment Table that describes the circumstances that exist to warrant a finding of ``non-compliance,'' or ``non-conformity''; ``partial compliance,'' or ``partial conformity''; and ``acceptable compliance,'' or ``acceptable conformity.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A sample Continuation Sheet for additional comments that may be added by the sponsor or the NSPM during a QMS evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A sample Sponsor Checklist to assist the sponsor in verifying the elements that comprise the required QMS program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A table showing the essential functions, processes, and procedures that relate to the required QMS components and a cross-reference to each represented task.</p><p class="depth0">i. Additional Information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In addition to specifically designated QMS evaluations, the NSPM will evaluate the sponsor's QMS program as part of regularly scheduled FSTD continuing qualification evaluations and no-notice FSTD evaluations, focusing in part on the effectiveness and viability of the QMS program and its contribution to the overall capability of the FSTD to meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The sponsor or MR may delegate duties associated with maintaining the qualification of the FSTD (e.g., corrective and preventive maintenance, scheduling and conducting tests or inspections, functional preflight checks) but retain the responsibility and authority for the day-to-day qualification of the FSTD. One person may serve as the sponsor or MR for more than one FSTD, but one FSTD may not have more than one sponsor or MR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A QMS program may be applicable to more than one certificate holder (e.g., part 119 and part 142 or two part 119 certificate holders) and an MR may work for more than one certificate holder (e.g., part 119 and part 142 or two part 119 certificate holders) as long as the sponsor's QMS program requirements and the MR requirements are met for each certificate holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Standard Measurements for Flight Simulator Quality: A quality system based on FSTD performance will improve and maintain training quality. See http://www.faa.gov/safety/programs_initiatives/aircraft_aviation/nsp/sqms/ for more information on measuring FSTD performance.</p><p class="depth0">j. The FAA does not mandate a specific QMS program format, but an acceptable QMS program should contain the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A Quality Policy. This is a formal written Quality Policy Statement that is a commitment by the sponsor outlining what the Quality System will achieve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A MR who has overall authority for monitoring the on-going qualification of assigned FSTDs to ensure that all FSTD qualification issues are resolved as required by this part. The MR should ensure that the QMS program is properly implemented and maintained, and should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Brief the sponsor's management on the qualification processes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Serve as the primary contact point for all matters between the sponsor and the NSPM regarding the qualification of the assigned FSTDs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Oversee the day-to-day quality control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The system and processes outlined in the QMS should enable the sponsor to monitor compliance with all applicable regulations and ensure correct maintenance and performance of the FSTD in accordance with part 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A QMS program and a statement acknowledging completion of a periodic review by the MR should include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A maintenance facility that provides suitable FSTD hardware and software tests and maintenance capability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A recording system in the form of a technical log in which defects, deferred defects, and development projects are listed,

assigned and reviewed within a specified time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Routine maintenance of the FSTD and performance of the QTG tests with adequate staffing to cover FSTD operating periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A planned internal assessment schedule and a periodic review should be used to verify that corrective action was complete and effective. The assessor should have adequate knowledge of FSTDs and should be acceptable to the NSPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The MR should receive Quality System training and brief other personnel on the procedures.</p><p class="depth0">End Information
