                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You must use the procedures and test methods in this section to determine capture efficiency as part of the performance test required by Sec. 63.4160.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system; coating solvent flash-off and coating, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system and the removal or evaporation of cleaning materials from the surfaces they are applied to occurs within the capture system. For example, this criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the capture system does not meet both of the criteria in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, then you must use one of the three protocols described in paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this section to measure capture efficiency. The capture efficiency measurements use TVH capture efficiency as a surrogate for organic HAP capture efficiency. For the protocols in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the capture efficiency measurement must consist of three test runs. Each test run must be at least 3 hours duration or the length of a production run, whichever is longer, up to 8 hours. For the purposes of this test, a production run means the time required for a single part to go from the beginning to the end of production which includes surface preparation activities and drying or curing time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure. The liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol compares the mass of liquid TVH in materials used in the coating operation, to the mass of TVH emissions not captured by the emission capture system. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section

to measure emission capture system efficiency using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials are applied, and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and materials subsequently occur, such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use Method 204A or 204F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to determine the mass fraction of TVH liquid input from each coating, thinner, and cleaning material used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run. To make the determination, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use Equation 1 of this section to calculate the total mass of TVH liquid input from all the coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation during each capture efficiency test run.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY02.013
Where:
TVHused = total mass of TVH liquid input from all coatings,</p><p class="depth3">thinners, and cleaning materials used in the coating operation</p><p class="depth3">during the capture efficiency test run, kg.TVHi = mass fraction of TVH in coating, thinner, or cleaning</p><p class="depth3">material, i, that is used in the coating operation during the</p><p class="depth3">capture efficiency test run, kg TVH per kg material.Voli = total volume of coating, thinner, or cleaning</p><p class="depth3">material, i, used in the coating operation during the capture</p><p class="depth3">efficiency test run, liters.Di = density of coating, thinner, or cleaning material, i, kg</p><p class="depth3">material per liter material.n = number of different coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials used</p><p class="depth3">in the coating operation during the capture efficiency test</p><p class="depth3">run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use Method 204D or E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use Method 204D if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use Method 204E if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure, other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system, using Equation 2 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY02.014



Where:
CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the</p><p class="depth3">add-on control device, percent.TVHused = total mass of TVH liquid input used in the coating</p><p class="depth3">operation during the capture efficiency test run, kg.TVHuncaptured = total mass of TVH that is not captured by the</p><p class="depth3">emission capture system and that exits from the temporary</p><p class="depth3">total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture</p><p class="depth3">efficiency test run, kg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gas-to-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure. The gas-to-gas protocol compares the mass of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system to the mass of TVH emissions not captured. Use a temporary total enclosure or a building enclosure and the procedures in paragraphs (d)(1) through (5) of this section to measure emission capture system efficiency using the gas-to-gas protocol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Either use a building enclosure or construct an enclosure around the coating operation where coatings, thinners, and cleaning materials are applied and all areas where emissions from these applied coatings and materials subsequently occur such as flash-off, curing, and drying areas. The areas of the coating operation where capture devices collect emissions generated by the coating operation for routing to an add-on control device, such as the entrance and exit areas of an oven or a spray booth, must also be inside the enclosure. The enclosure must meet the applicable definition of a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use Method 204B or 204C of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions captured by the emission capture system during each capture efficiency test run as measured at the inlet to the add-on control device. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sampling points for the Method 204B or 204C measurement must be upstream from the add-on control device and must represent total emissions routed from the capture system and entering the add-on control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If multiple emission streams from the capture system enter the add-on control device without a single common duct, then the emissions entering the add-on control device must be simultaneously measured in each duct, and the total emissions entering the add-on control device must be determined.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use Method 204D or 204E of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 to measure the total mass, kg, of TVH emissions that are not captured by the emission capture system; they are measured as they exit the temporary total enclosure or building enclosure during each capture efficiency test run. To make the measurement, substitute TVH for each occurrence of the term VOC in the methods.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use Method 204D if the enclosure is a temporary total enclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use Method 204E if the enclosure is a building enclosure. During the capture efficiency measurement, all organic compound emitting operations inside the building enclosure other than the coating operation for which capture efficiency is being determined must be shut down, but all fans and blowers must be operating normally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each capture efficiency test run, determine the percent capture efficiency of the emission capture system, using Equation 3 of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR23JY02.015
Where:
CE = capture efficiency of the emission capture system vented to the</p><p class="depth3">add-on control device, percent.

TVHcaptured = total mass of TVH captured by the emission</p><p class="depth3">capture system as measured at the inlet to the add-on control</p><p class="depth3">device during the emission capture efficiency test run, kg.TVHuncaptured = total mass of TVH that is not captured by the</p><p class="depth3">emission capture system and that exits from the temporary</p><p class="depth3">total enclosure or building enclosure during the capture</p><p class="depth3">efficiency test run, kg.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Determine the capture efficiency of the emission capture system as the average of the capture efficiencies measured in the three test runs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alternative capture efficiency protocol. As an alternative to the procedures specified in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, you may determine capture efficiency using any other capture efficiency protocol and test methods that satisfy the criteria of either the DQO or LCL approach as described in appendix A to subpart KK of this part.</p>
