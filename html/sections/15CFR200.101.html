As new  requirements appear, there are continual shifts of program emphasis to  meet the most urgent needs for the measurement of additional quantities,  extended ranges, or improved accuracies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The basic research and development activities of NIST are  primarily   funded by direct appropriations, and are aimed at meeting broad general  needs. NIST may also undertake investigations or developments to meet  some specialized physical measurement problem of another Government  agency, industrial group, or manufacturing firm, using funds supplied by  the requesting organization.</p>
