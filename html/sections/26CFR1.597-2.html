Except as otherwise provided in the regulations under section 597, all FFA is includible as ordinary income to the recipient at the time the FFA is received or accrued in accordance with the recipient's method of accounting. The amount of FFA received or accrued is the amount of any money, the fair market value of any property (other than an Agency Obligation), and the issue price of any Agency Obligation (determined under Sec. 1.597-3(c)(2)).

An Institution must establish a deferred FFA account commencing in the first taxable year in which it receives FFA that is not currently included in income under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and must maintain that account in accordance with the requirements of this paragraph (c)(4). The Institution must add the amount of any FFA that is not currently included in income under paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section to its deferred FFA account. The Institution must decrease the balance of its deferred FFA account by the amount of deferred FFA included in income under paragraphs (c)(4)(ii), (iv) and (v) of this section. (See also paragraph (d)(5)(i)(B) of this section for other adjustments that decrease the deferred FFA account.) If, under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, FFA is not currently included in income in a taxable year, the Institution thereafter must maintain its deferred FFA account on a FIFO (first in, first out) basis (e.g., for purposes of the first sentence of paragraph (c)(4)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance of account.

In the case of an Institution without Continuing Equity, the amount described in this paragraph (c)(4)(iii) is the amount by which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The excess for the taxable year of the Institution's deductions allowed by chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code (other than net operating and capital loss carryovers) over its gross income (taking into account FFA included in income under paragraph (c)(2) of this section); is greater than</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Institution's remaining equity as of the beginning of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Remaining equity.

account FFA included in income under paragraph (c)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Additional deferred FFA recapture by an Institution with Continuing Equity. To the extent that, as of the end of a taxable year, the cumulative amount of FFA deferred under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that an Institution with Continuing Equity has recaptured under this paragraph (c)(4) is less than the cumulative amount of FFA deferred under paragraph (c)(3) of this section that the Institution would have recaptured if that FFA had been included in income ratably over the six taxable years immediately following the taxable year of deferral, the Institution must include that difference in income for the taxable year. An Institution with Continuing Equity must include in income the balance of its deferred FFA account in the taxable year in which it liquidates, ceases to do business, transfers (other than to a Bridge Bank) substantially all of its assets and liabilities, or is deemed to transfer all of its assets under Sec. 1.597-5(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Optional accelerated recapture of deferred FFA. An Institution that has a deferred FFA account may include in income the balance of its deferred FFA account on its timely filed (including extensions) original income tax return for any taxable year that it is not under Agency Control. The balance of its deferred FFA account is income on the last day of that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions to limitations on use of losses. In computing an Institution's taxable income or alternative minimum taxable income for a taxable year, sections 56(d)(1), 382 and 383 and Secs. 1.1502-15, 1.1502-21, and 1.1502-22 (or Secs. 1.1502-15A, 1.1502-21A, and 1.1502-22A, as appropriate) do not limit the use of the attributes of the Institution to the extent, if any, that the inclusion of FFA (including recaptured FFA) in income results in taxable income or alternative minimum taxable income (determined without regard to this paragraph (c)(5)) for the taxable year. This paragraph (c)(5) does not apply to any limitation under section 382 or 383 or Sec. 1.1502-15, Sec. 1.1502-21 or Sec. 1.1502-22 (or Sec. 1.1502-15A, Sec. 1.1502-21A or Sec. 1.1502-22A, as appropriate) that arose in connection with or prior to a corporation becoming a Consolidated Subsidiary of the Institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Operating rules--(i) Bad debt reserves. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, the adjusted bases of an Institution's assets are reduced by the amount of the Institution's reserves for bad debts under section 585 or 593, other than supplemental reserves under section 593.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bad debt reserves. For purposes of paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of this section, the adjusted bases of an Institution's assets are reduced by the amount of the Institution's reserves for bad debts under section 585 or 593, other than supplemental reserves under section 593.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of Consolidated Subsidiaries. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an Institution is treated as a single entity that includes the income, expenses, assets, liabilities, and attributes of its Consolidated Subsidiaries, with appropriate adjustments to prevent duplication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative minimum tax. To compute the alternative minimum taxable income attributable to FFA of an Institution for any taxable year under section 55, the rules of this section, and related rules, are applied by using alternative minimum tax basis, deductions, and all other items required to be taken into account. All other alternative minimum tax provisions continue to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Earnings and profits. FFA that is not currently included in income under this paragraph (c) is included in earnings and profits for all purposes of the Internal Revenue Code to the extent and at the time it is included in income under this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transfers of money or property to Agency, and property subject to a Loss Guarantee--(1) Transfers of property to Agency. The transfer of property to Agency or a Controlled Entity is a taxable sale or exchange in which the Institution is treated as realizing an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transfers of property to Agency. The transfer of property to Agency or a Controlled Entity is a taxable sale or exchange in which the Institution is treated as realizing an amount equal to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The property's fair market value; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For property subject to a Loss Guarantee, the greater of the property's fair market value or the guaranteed value or price at which the property can be put at the time of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> FFA with respect to property covered by a Loss Guarantee other than on transfer to Agency.

amount realized does not exceed the greater of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The property's fair market value; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The guaranteed value or price at which the property can be put at the time of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(2), references to an amount realized include amounts obtained in whole or partial satisfaction of loans, amounts obtained by virtue of charging off or marking to market covered property, and other amounts similarly related to property, whether or not disposed of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Treatment of FFA received in exchange for property. FFA included in the amount realized for property under this paragraph (d) is not includible in income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section. The amount realized is treated in the same manner as if realized from a person other than Agency or a Controlled Entity. For example, gain attributable to FFA received with respect to a capital asset retains its character as capital gain. Similarly, FFA received with respect to property that has been charged off for income tax purposes is treated as a recovery to the extent of the amount previously charged off. Any FFA provided in excess of the amount realized under this paragraph (d) is includible in income under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Adjustment to FFA--(i) In general. If an Institution pays or transfers money or property to Agency or a Controlled Entity, the amount of money and fair market value of the property is an adjustment to its FFA to the extent the amount paid and transferred exceeds the amount of money and fair market value of property Agency or a Controlled Entity provides in exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If an Institution pays or transfers money or property to Agency or a Controlled Entity, the amount of money and fair market value of the property is an adjustment to its FFA to the extent the amount paid and transferred exceeds the amount of money and fair market value of property Agency or a Controlled Entity provides in exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deposit insurance. This paragraph (d)(4) does not apply to amounts paid to Agency with respect to deposit insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of an interest held by Agency or a Controlled Entity--(A) In general. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an interest described in Sec. 1.597-3(b) is not treated as property when transferred by the issuer to Agency or a Controlled Entity nor when acquired from Agency or a Controlled Entity by the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an interest described in Sec. 1.597-3(b) is not treated as property when transferred by the issuer to Agency or a Controlled Entity nor when acquired from Agency or a Controlled Entity by the issuer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Dispositions to persons other than issuer. On the date Agency or a Controlled Entity transfers an interest described in Sec. 1.597-3(b) to a holder other than the issuer, Agency or a Controlled Entity, the issuer is treated for purposes of this paragraph (d)(4) as having transferred to Agency an amount of money equal to the sum of the amount of money and the fair market value of property that was paid by the new holder as consideration for the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Consolidated groups. For purposes of this paragraph (d), an Institution will be treated as having made any transfer to Agency or a Controlled Entity that was made by any other member of its consolidated group. The consolidated group must make appropriate investment basis adjustments to the extent the member transferring money or other property is not the member that received FFA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Manner of making adjustments to FFA--(i) Reduction of FFA and deferred FFA. An Institution adjusts its FFA under paragraph (d)(4) of this section by reducing in the following order and in an aggregate amount not greater than the adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reduction of FFA and deferred FFA. An Institution adjusts its FFA under paragraph (d)(4) of this section by reducing in the following order and in an aggregate amount not greater than the adjustment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of any FFA that is otherwise includible in income for the taxable year (before application of paragraph (c) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The balance (but not below zero) in the deferred FFA account, if any, maintained under paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deduction of excess amounts. If the amount of the adjustment exceeds the sum of the amounts described in paragraph (d)(5)(i) of this section, the Institution may deduct the excess to the extent the deduction does not exceed the amount of FFA included in income for prior taxable years reduced by the amount of deductions allowable under this paragraph (d)(5)(ii) in prior taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional adjustments. Any adjustment to FFA in excess of the sum of the amounts described in paragraphs (d)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section is treated--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By an Institution other than a New Entity or Acquiring, as a deduction of the amount in excess of FFA received that is required to be transferred to Agency under section 11(g) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1821(g)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> By a New Entity or Acquiring, as an adjustment to the purchase price paid in the Taxable Transfer (see Sec. 1.338-7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Institution M, a calendar year taxpayer without Continuing Equity because it is in Agency receivership, is not a member of a consolidated group and has not been acquired in a Taxable Transfer. On January 1, 1997, M has assets with a total adjusted basis of $100 million and total liabilities of $120 million. M's deductions do not exceed its gross income (determined without regard to FFA) for 1997. Agency provides $30 million of FFA to M in 1997. The amount of this FFA that M must include in income in 1997 is limited by Sec. 1.597-2(c)(2) to $20 million, the amount by which M's liabilities ($120 million) exceed the total adjusted basis of its assets ($100 million) at the beginning of the taxable year. Pursuant to Sec. 1.597-2(c)(4)(i), M must establish a deferred FFA account for the remaining $10 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If Agency instead lends M the $30 million, M's indebtedness to Agency is disregarded and the results are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 1. Section 597(c); Secs. 1.597-1(b) (defining FFA) and 1.597-3(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Institution M, a calendar year taxpayer without Continuing Equity because it is in Agency receivership, is not a member of a consolidated group and has not been acquired in a Taxable Transfer. At the beginning of 1998, M's remaining equity is $0 and M has a deferred FFA account of $10 million. Agency does not provide any FFA to M in 1998. During the year, M transfers property not covered by a Loss Guarantee to Agency and does not receive any consideration. The property has an adjusted basis of $5 million and a fair market value of $1 million at the time of the transfer. M has no other taxable income or loss in 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.597-2(d)(1), M is treated as selling the property for $1 million, its fair market value, thus recognizing a $4 million loss ($5 million-$1 million). In addition, because M did not receive any consideration from Agency, under Sec. 1.597-2(d)(4) M has an adjustment to FFA of $1 million, the amount by which the fair market value of the transferred property ($1 million) exceeds the consideration M received from Agency ($0). Because no FFA is provided to M in 1998, this adjustment reduces the balance of M's deferred FFA account to $9 million ($10 million-$1 million). Section 1.597-2(d)(5)(i)(B). Because M's $4 million loss causes M's deductions to exceed its gross income by $4 million in 1998 and M has no remaining equity, under Sec. 1.597-2(c)(4)(iii)(A) M must include $4 million of deferred FFA in income, and must decrease the remaining $9 million balance of its deferred FFA account by the same amount, leaving a balance of $5 million.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Loss Guarantee. Institution Q, a calendar year taxpayer, sells an asset covered by a Loss Guarantee to an unrelated third party for $4,000. Q's adjusted basis in the asset at the time of sale and the asset's guaranteed value are both $10,000. Pursuant to the Loss Guarantee, Agency pays Q $6,000 ($10,000-$4,000). Q's amount realized from the sale of the asset is $10,000 ($4,000 from the third party and $6,000 from Agency). Section 1.597-2(d)(2). Q realizes no gain or loss on the sale ($10,000-$10,000 = $0), and therefore includes none of the $6,000 of FFA it receives pursuant to the Loss Guarantee in income. Section 1.597-2(d)(3).
