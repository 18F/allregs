                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Handgear permit. A vessel issued a valid open access NE multispecies Handgear permit is subject to the following restrictions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The vessel may possess and land up to 75 lb (90.7 kg) of cod, and up to the landing and possession limit restrictions for other NE multispecies specified in Sec. 648.86, provided the vessel complies with the restrictions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If either the GOM or GB cod trip limit applicable to a vessel fishing under a NE multispecies DAS permit, as specified in Sec. 648.86(b)(1) and (2), respectively, is adjusted by NMFS, the cod trip limit specified in this paragraph (a)(1) shall be adjusted proportionally (rounded up to the nearest 25 lb (11.3 kg)). For example, if the GOM cod trip limit specified at Sec. 648.86(b)(1) doubled, then the cod trip limit for the Handgear B category fishing in the GOM Regulated Mesh Area would also double to 150 lb (68 kg).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions: (i) The vessel may not use or possess on board gear other than handgear while in possession of, fishing for, or landing NE multispecies, and must have at least one standard tote on board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vessel may not fish for, possess, or land regulated species from March 1 through March 20 of each year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel, if fishing with tub-trawl gear, may not fish with more than a maximum of 250 hooks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Declaration. To fish for GB cod south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, as defined at Sec. 648.80(a)(1), a vessel owner or operator must obtain, and retain on board, a letter of authorization from the Regional Administrator declaring an intent to fish south of the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, and may not fish in any other area for a minimum of 7 consecutive days from the effective date of the letter of authorization. Such a vessel may transit the GOM Regulated Mesh Area, provided that their gear is stowed and not available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Charter/party permit. A vessel that has been issued a valid open access NE multispecies charter/party permit is subject to the additional restrictions on gear, recreational minimum fish sizes, possession limits, and prohibitions on sale specified in Sec. 648.89, and any other applicable provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Scallop NE multispecies possession limit permit. With the exception of vessels fishing in the Sea Scallop Access Areas as specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d), a vessel that has been issued a

valid open access scallop NE multispecies possession limit permit may possess and land up to 300 lb (136.1 kg) of regulated NE multispecies when fishing under a scallop DAS allocated under Sec. 648.53, provided the vessel does not fish for, possess, or land haddock from January 1 through June 30, as specified under Sec. 648.86(a)(2)(i), and provided that the amount of regulated NE multispecies on board the vessel does not exceed any of the pertinent trip limits specified under Sec. 648.86, and provided the vessel has at least one standard tote on board. A vessel fishing in the Sea Scallop Access Areas as specified in Sec. 648.59(b) through (d) is subject to the possession limits specified in Sec. 648.60(a)(5)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Non-regulated NE multispecies permit. A vessel issued a valid open access non-regulated NE multispecies permit may possess and land one Atlantic halibut and unlimited amounts of the other non-regulated NE multispecies, unless otherwise restricted by Sec. 648.86. The vessel is subject to restrictions on gear, area, and time of fishing specified in Sec. 648.80 and any other applicable provisions of this part.
