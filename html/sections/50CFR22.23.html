                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How do I apply for a permit? You must submit applications for permits under this section to the appropriate Regional Director--Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the appropriate Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2. Your application must contain the information and certification required by Sec.  13.12(a) of this subchapter, and the following additional information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Species and number of eagles proposed to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Location and description of property where taking is proposed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inclusive dates for which permit is requested;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method of taking proposed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Kind and number of livestock or domestic animals owned by applicant, if applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Kind and amount of alleged damage, or description of the risk posed to human health and safety or eagles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Name, address, age, and business relationship with applicant of any person the applicant proposes to act for him as his agent in the taking of such eagles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What are the permit conditions? In addition to the general conditions set forth in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to take bald or golden eagles

under this section are subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bald or golden eagles may be taken under permit by firearms, traps, or other suitable means except by poison or from aircraft;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The taking of eagles under permit may be done only by the permittee or his agents named in the permit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any eagle taken under authority of such permit will be promptly turned over to a Service agent or other game law enforcement officer designated in the permit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In addition to any reporting requirement on a permit, you must submit a report of activities conducted under the permit to the appropriate Regional Director--Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office within 10 days following completion of the taking operations or the expiration of the permit, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Issuance criteria. The Director will not issue a permit to take bald or golden eagles unless the Director has determined that such taking is compatible with the preservation of the bald or golden eagle. In making such determination, the Director will consider the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The direct or indirect effect which issuing such permit would be likely to have upon the wild population of bald or golden eagles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether evidence shows that bald or golden eagles have in fact become seriously injurious to wildlife or to agriculture or other interests in the particular locality to be covered by the permit and the injury complained of is substantial, or that bald or golden eagles pose a significant risk to human or eagle health and safety; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the only way to abate or prevent the damage caused by the bald or golden eagle is to take some or all of the offending birds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tenure of permits. The tenure of any permit to take bald or golden eagles under this section is that shown on the face of the permit. We will not issue these permits for terms longer than 90 days, except that permits to authorize disturbance associated with hazing eagles from the vicinity may be valid for up to 5 years. We may amend, suspend, or revoke permits issued for a period of longer than 90 days if new information indicates that revised permit conditions are necessary, or that suspension or revocation is necessary, to safeguard local or regional eagle populations.
