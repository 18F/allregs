Such bond shall run to the Secretary of  Veterans   Affairs for the use and benefit of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Veterans Service Center Manager may require a legal  custodian to furnish an agreement in lieu of a surety bond or additional  surety bond when funds are deposited in an interest or dividend-paying  account in a State or federally insured institution. The agreement will  provide that the legal custodian and institution agree that all funds  received from the Department of Veterans Affairs on behalf of the  beneficiary, which have been or will be deposited by the legal custodian  in the account, will be withdrawn only with the written consent of the  Veterans Service Center Manager or designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Substitution of surety; claims against defunct companies. If any  surety company is placed in receivership or ceases to do business in the  particular State, the Veterans Service Center Manager will take the  necessary action to have proper bonds substituted in Federal fiduciary  cases and refer the matter to the Regional Counsel for such other action  as may be appropriate.
