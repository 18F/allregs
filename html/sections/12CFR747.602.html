                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for an award of attorneys fees and expenses, an  applicant   must be a prevailing party in the proceeding for which it seeks an award  and must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth  of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business  interests and not more than 500 employees at the time the proceeding was  commenced (an applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be  considered as an ``individual'' rather than a ``sole owner of an  unincorporated business'' if the issues on which the applicant prevails  are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business  interests);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3))</em>  with not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the  Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with not more than 500  employees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other partnership, corporation, association, or public or  private organization with a net worth of not more than $7 million and  not more than 500 employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For the purpose of determining eligibility, the net worth of an  applicant and the number of employees of an applicant shall be  determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The applicant's net worth includes the value of any assets  disposed of for the purpose of meeting an eligibility standard and  excludes any obligations incurred for this purpose. Transfers of assets  or obligations incurred for less than reasonably equivalent value will  be presumed to have been made for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly  perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the  applicant's direction and control; part-time employees shall be included  on a proportional basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all  of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any  individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly  controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of  the applicant, or any corporation or other entity of which the applicant  directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares  or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this  subpart, unless the NCUA Board determines that such treatment would be  unjust and contrary to the purposes of the EAJA in light of the actual  relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the NCUA  Board may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other  than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances  that would make an award unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on  behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible  is not itself eligible for an award.
