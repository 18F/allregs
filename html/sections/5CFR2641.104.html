                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Agency means any department, independent establishment, commission,  administration, authority, board or bureau of the United States or  Government corporation. The term includes any independent agency not in  the legislative or judicial branches.</p><p class="depth0">Agency ethics official means the designated agency ethics official  (DAEO) or the alternate DAEO, appointed in accordance with 5 CFR  2638.202(b), and any deputy ethics official described in 5 CFR 2638.204.</p><p class="depth0">Department means one of the executive departments listed in 5 U.S.C.  101.</p><p class="depth0">Designated agency ethics official (DAEO) means the official  designated under 5 CFR 2638.201 to coordinate and manage an agency's  ethics program.</p><p class="depth0">Employee means, for purposes of determining the individuals subject  to 18 U.S.C. 207, any officer or employee of the executive branch or any  independent agency that is not a part of the legislative or judicial  branches. The term does not include the President or the Vice President,  an enlisted member of the Armed Forces, or an officer or employee of the  District of Columbia. The term includes an individual appointed as an  employee or detailed to the Federal Government under the  Intergovernmental Personnel Act (5 U.S.C. 3371-3376) or specifically  subject to section 207 under the terms of another statute. It  encompasses senior employees, very senior employees, special Government  employees, and employees serving without compensation. (This term is  redefined elsewhere in this part, as necessary, when the term is used  for other purposes.)</p><p class="depth0">Executive branch includes an executive department as defined in 5  U.S.C. 101, a Government corporation, an independent establishment  (other than the Government Accountability Office), the Postal Service,  the Postal Regulatory Commission, and also includes any other entity or  administrative unit in the executive branch.</p><p class="depth0">Former employee means an individual who has completed a period of  service as an employee. Unless otherwise indicated, the term encompasses  a former senior employee and a former very senior employee. An  individual becomes a former employee at the termination of Government  service, whereas an individual becomes a former senior employee or a  former very senior employee at the termination of service in a senior or  very senior employee position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1 to the definition of former employee: An individual served  as an employee of the Agency for International Development, an agency  within the executive branch. Since he was, therefore, an ``employee'' as  that term is defined in this section by virtue of having served in the  executive branch, he became a ``former employee'' when he terminated  Government service to pursue his hobbies.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2 to the definition of former employee: An individual served  as an employee of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA). Since the TVA is  a corporation owned or controlled by the Government of the United  States, she served as an employee in the ``executive branch'' as that  term is defined in this section. She became a ``former employee,''  therefore, when she terminated Government service to do some traveling.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3 to the definition of former employee: An individual  terminated a GS-14 position in the executive branch to accept a position  in the legislative branch. He did not become a ``former employee'' when  he terminated service in the executive branch since he did not terminate  ``Government service'' as that term is defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4 to the definition of former employee: An individual is  appointed by the President to serve as a special Government employee on  the Oncological Drug Advisory Committee at the Department of Health and   Human Services. The special Government employee meets with the committee  five days per year. She does not terminate Government service at the end  of each meeting of the committee and therefore does not at that time  become a ``former employee.'' She becomes a ``former employee'' when her  appointment terminates, provided that she is not reappointed without  break in service to the same or another Federal Government position.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5 to the definition of former employee: An individual is a  Major in the U.S. Army Reserve. The Major earns points toward retirement  by participating in weekend drills and performing active duty for  training for two weeks each year. The Major is not a special Government  employee when he performs weekend drills, but is considered to be one  while on active duty for training. The Major is considered to be a  ``former employee'' when he terminates each period of active duty for  training.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6 to the definition of former employee: A foreign service  officer served as a ``senior employee'' of the Department of State.  After retiring, and with no break in service, he accepted a civil  service appointment on a temporary basis, at the GS-15 level. Since he  did not terminate Government service, he did not become a ``former  employee'' when he retired from the foreign service. He did, however,  become a ``former senior employee.''</p><p class="depth0">Former senior employee is an individual who terminates service in a  senior employee position (without successive Government service in  another senior position).</p><p class="depth0">Former very senior employee is an individual who terminates service  in a very senior employee position (without successive Government  service in another very senior employee position).</p><p class="depth0">Government corporation means, for purposes of determining the  individuals subject to 18 U.S.C. 207, a corporation that is owned or  controlled by the Government of the United States. For purposes of  identifying or determining individuals with whom post-employment contact  is restricted, matters to which the United States is a party or has a  direct and substantial interest, decisions which a former senior or very  senior employee cannot seek to influence on behalf of a foreign entity,  and whether a former employee is acting on behalf of the United States,  it means a corporation in which the United States has a proprietary  interest as distinguished from a custodial or incidental interest as  shown by the functions, financing, control, and management of the  corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Government service means a period of time during which an individual  is employed by the Federal Government without a break in service. As  applied to a special Government employee (SGE), Government service  refers to the period of time covered by the individual's appointment or  appointments (or other act evidencing employment with the Government),  regardless of any interval or intervals between days actually served.  See example 4 to the definition of former employee in this section. In  the case of Reserve officers of the Armed Forces or officers of the  National Guard of the United States who are not otherwise employees of  the United States, Government service shall be considered to end upon  the termination of a period of active duty or active duty for training  during which they served as SGEs. See example 5 to the definition of  former employee in this section.</p><p class="depth0">He, his, and him include she, hers, and her, and vice versa.</p><p class="depth0">Judicial branch means the Supreme Court of the United States; the  United States courts of appeals; the United States district courts; the  Court of International Trade; the United States bankruptcy courts; any  court created pursuant to Article I of the United States Constitution,  including the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, the  United States Claims Court, and the United States Tax Court, but not  including a court of a territory or possession of the United States; the  Federal Judicial Center; and any other agency, office, or entity in the  judicial branch.</p><p class="depth0">Legislative branch means the Congress; it also means the Office of  the Architect of the Capitol, the United States Botanic Garden, the  Government Accountability Office, the Government Printing Office, the  Library of Congress, the Office of Technology Assessment, the  Congressional Budget Office, the United States Capitol Police, and any  other agency, entity, office, or commission established in the  legislative branch.</p><p class="depth0">Person includes an individual, corporation, company, association,  firm,   partnership, society, joint stock company, or any other organization,  institution, or entity, including any officer, employee, or agent of  such person or entity. Unless otherwise indicated, the term is all- inclusive and applies to commercial ventures and nonprofit organizations  as well as to foreign, State and local governments. The term includes  the ``United States'' as that term is defined in Sec. 2641.301(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">Senior employee means an employee, other than a very senior  employee, who is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Employed in a position for which the rate of pay is specified in  or fixed according to 5 U.S.C. 5311-5318 (the Executive Schedule);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Employed in a position for which the employee is paid at a rate  of basic pay which is equal to or greater than 86.5 percent of the rate  of basic pay for level II of the Executive Schedule; or, for a period of  two years following November 24, 2003, was employed on November 23, 2003  in a position for which the rate of basic pay was equal to or greater  than the rate of basic pay payable for level 5 of the Senior Executive  Service; for purposes of this paragraph, ``rate of basic pay'' does not  include locality-based adjustments or additional pay such as bonuses,  awards and various allowances;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Appointed by the President to a position under 3 U.S.C.  105(a)(2)(B);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Appointed by the Vice President to a position under 3 U.S.C.  106(a)(1)(B);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> An active duty commissioned officer of the uniformed services  serving in a position for which the pay grade (as specified in 37 U.S.C.  201) is pay grade O-7 or above; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Assigned from a private sector organization under chapter 37 of  5 U.S.C. (Information Technology Exchange Program).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1 to the definition of senior employee: A former  administrative law judge serves on a commission created within the  executive branch to adjudicate certain claims arising from a recent  military operation. The position is uncompensated but the judge receives  travel expenses. The judge is not employed in a position for which the  rate of pay is specified in or fixed according to the Executive  Schedule, is not serving in a position to which he was appointed by the  President or Vice President under 3 U.S.C. 105(a)(2)(B) or 106(a)(1)(B),  and is not employed in a position for which his rate of basic pay is  equal to or greater than 86.5 percent of the rate of basic pay for level  II of the Executive Schedule. He is not a senior employee.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2 to the definition of senior employee: A doctor is hired to  fill a ``senior-level'' position and is initially compensated pursuant  to 5 U.S.C. 5376 at a rate of basic pay slightly less than 86.5 percent  of the rate of basic pay payable for level II of the Executive Schedule.  If both the annual pay adjustment provided for in 5 CFR 534.504 and the  periodic pay adjustment authorized in 5 CFR 534.503 result in a rate of  basic pay equal to or above 86.5 percent of the rate of basic pay  payable for level II of the Executive Schedule, the doctor will become a  senior employee.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3 to the definition of senior employee: A criminal  investigator in the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of  Housing and Urban Development is a GS-15 employee but also receives Law  Enforcement Availability Pay (LEAP), pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 5545a. Even if  the sum of the employee's LEAP payment plus the employee's basic pay for  GS-15 equaled 86.5 percent of the rate of basic pay for level II of the  Executive Schedule, LEAP is not considered part of an employee's ``rate  of basic pay'' for purposes of section 207(c), and therefore the  employee would not be a ``senior employee.''</p><p class="depth0">Special Government employee means an officer or employee of the  executive branch or an independent agency, as specified in 18 U.S.C.  202(a). A special Government employee is retained, designated,  appointed, or employed to perform temporary duties either on a full-time  or intermittent basis, with or without compensation, for a period not to  exceed 130 days during any period of 365 consecutive days.</p><p class="depth0">Statemeans one of the fifty States of the United States and the  District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and any territory  or possession of the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Very senior employeemeans an employee who is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Employed in a position which is either listed in 5 U.S.C. 5312  or for which the rate of pay is equal to the rate of pay payable for  level I of the Executive Schedule;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Employed in a position in the Executive Office of the President  which is either listed in 5 U.S.C. 5313 or for which the rate of pay is  equal to the rate of pay payable for level II of the Executive Schedule;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Appointed by the President to a position under 3 U.S.C.  105(a)(2)(A); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Appointed by the Vice President to a position under 3 U.S.C.  106(a)(1)(A).</p>
