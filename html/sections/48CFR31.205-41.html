                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following types of costs are allowable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal, State, and local taxes (see part 29), except as  otherwise provided in paragraph (b) below that are required to be and  are paid or accrued in accordance with generally accepted accounting  principles. Fines and penalties are not considered taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxes otherwise allowable under subparagraph (a)(1) above, but  upon which a claim of illegality or erroneous assessment exists;  provided the contractor, before paying such taxes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Promptly requests instructions from the contracting officer  concerning such taxes; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Takes all action directed by the contracting officer arising  out of subparagraph (2)(i) above or an independent decision of the  Government as to the existence of a claim of illegality or erroneous  assessment, to (A) determine the legality of the assessment or (B)  secure a refund of such taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) above, the reasonable costs of  any action taken by the contractor at the direction or with the  concurrence of the contracting officer. Interest or penalties incurred  by the contractor for non-payment of any tax at the direction of the  contracting officer or by reason of the failure of the contracting  officer to ensure timely direction after a prompt request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Environmental Tax found at section 59A of the Internal  Revenue Code, also called the ``Superfund Tax.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following types of costs are not allowable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal income and excess profits taxes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taxes in connection with financing, refinancing, refunding  operations, or reorganizations (see 31.205-20 and 31.205-27).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Taxes from which exemptions are available to the contractor  directly, or available to the contractor based on an exemption afforded  the Government, except when the contracting officer determines that the  administrative burden incident to obtaining the exemption outweighs the  corresponding benefits accruing to the Government. When partial  exemption from a tax is attributable to Government contract activity,  taxes charged to such work in excess of that amount resulting from  application of the preferential treatment are unallowable. These  provisions intend that tax preference attributable to Government  contract activity be realized by the Government. The term exemption  means freedom from taxation in whole or in part and includes a tax  abatement or reduction resulting from mode of assessment, method of  calculation, or otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special assessments on land that represent capital improvements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Taxes (including excises) on real or personal property, or on  the value, use, possession or sale thereof, which is used solely in  connection with work other than on Government contracts (see paragraph  (c) below).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any excise tax in subtitle D, chapter 43 of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1986, as amended. That chapter includes excise taxes imposed in  connection with qualified pension plans, welfare plans, deferred  compensation plans, or other similar types of plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Income tax accruals designed to account for the tax effects of  differences between taxable income and pretax income as reflected by the  books of account and financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any tax imposed under 26 U.S.C. 5000C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Taxes on property (see subparagraph (b)(5) above) used solely in  connection with either non-Government or Government work should be  considered directly applicable to the respective category of work unless  the amounts involved are insignificant or comparable results would  otherwise be obtained; e.g., taxes on contractor-owned   work-in-process which is used solely in connection with non-Government  work should be allocated to such work; taxes on contractor-owned work- in-process inventory (and Government-owned work-in-process inventory  when taxed) used solely in connection with Government work should be  charged to such work. The cost of taxes incurred on property used in  both Government and non-Government work shall be apportioned to all such  work based upon the use of such property on the respective final cost  objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any taxes, interest, or penalties that were allowed as contract  costs and are refunded to the contractor shall be credited or paid to  the Government in the manner it directs. If a contractor or  subcontractor obtains a foreign tax credit that reduces its U.S. Federal  income tax return because of the payment of any tax or duty allowed as  contract costs, and if those costs were reimbursed by a foreign  government, the amount of the reduction shall be paid to the Treasurer  of the United States at the time the Federal income tax return is filed.  However, any interest actually paid or credited to a contractor incident  to a refund of tax, interest, or penalty shall be paid or credited to  the Government only to the extent that such interest accrued over the  period during which the contractor had been reimbursed by the Government  for the taxes, interest, or penalties.
