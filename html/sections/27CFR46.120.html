                            <p class="depth0">When a TTB officer discovers on a special tax stamp a material error  in the name, ownership, or address of the taxpayer, that officer will  require the taxpayer to surrender the erroneous tax stamp and prepare a  new Form 5630.5t, designated ``Amended Return,'' showing correctly all  of the information required in Sec. 46.101 and containing, in the body  of the form or in an attachment thereto, a statement of the reason for  requesting correction of the stamp. On receipt of the amended return and  an acceptable explanation for the error, the officer will make the  proper correction on the stamp and return it to the taxpayer. However,  if the error found by the TTB officer is on a special tax stamp issued  as a result of a return on Form 5630.5t filed under Sec. 46.101(b),  that officer will instruct the taxpayer to return the stamp, with a  statement showing the nature of the error and the correct data, to the  TTB officer who issued the stamp, for correction in accordance with  Sec. 46.119.</p><p class="depth0">Changes in Businesses Holding Special (Occupational) Tax Stamps</p>
