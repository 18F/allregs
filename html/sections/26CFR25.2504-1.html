                                Sec. 25.2504-1  Taxable gifts for preceding calendar periods.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 25.2502-1. The term ``aggregate sum of the taxable gifts  for each of the preceding calendar periods'' means the correct aggregate  of such gifts, not necessarily that returned for those calendar periods  and in respect of which tax was paid. All transfers that constituted  gifts in prior calendar periods under the laws, including the provisions  of law relating to exclusions from gifts, in effect at the time the  transfers were made are included in determining the amount of taxable  gifts for preceding calendar periods. The deductions other than for the  specific exemption (see paragraph (b) of this section) allowed by the  laws in effect at the time the transfers were made also are taken into  account in determining the aggregate sum of the taxable gifts for  preceding calendar periods. (The allowable exclusion from a gift is  $5,000 for years before 1939, $4,000 for the calendar years 1939 through  1942, $3,000 for the calendar years 1943 through 1981, and $10,000  thereafter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In determining the aggregate sum of the taxable gifts for the  ``preceding calendar periods'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(2)),  the total of the amounts allowed as deductions for the specific  exemption, under section 2521 (as in effect prior to its repeal by the  Tax Reform Act of 1976) and the corresponding provisions of prior laws,  shall not exceed $30,000. Thus, if the only prior gifts by a donor were  made in 1940 and 1941 (at which time the specific exemption allowable  was $40,000), and if in the donor's returns for those years the donor  claimed deductions totaling $40,000 for the specific exemption and  reported taxable gifts totaling $110,000, then in determining the  aggregate sum of the taxable gifts for the   preceding calendar periods, the deductions for the specific exemption  cannot exceed $30,000, and the donor's taxable gifts for such periods  will be $120,000 (instead of the $110,000 reported on the donor's  returns). (The allowable deduction for the specific exemption was  $50,000 for calendar years before 1936, $40,000 for calendar years 1936  through 1942, and $30,000 for 1943 through 1976.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the donor and the donor's spouse consented to have gifts made  to third parties considered as made one-half by each spouse, pursuant to  the provisions of section 2513 or section 1000(f) of the Internal  Revenue Code of 1939 (which corresponds to section 2513), these  provisions shall be taken into account in determining the aggregate sum  of the taxable gifts for the preceding calendar periods (under paragraph  (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If interpretations of the gift tax law in preceding calendar  periods resulted in the erroneous inclusion of property for gift tax  purposes that should have been excluded, or the erroneous exclusion of  property that should have been included, adjustments must be made in  order to arrive at the correct aggregate of taxable gifts for the  preceding calendar periods (under paragraph (a) of this section).  However, see section 1000 (e) and (g) of the 1939 Code relating to  certain discretionary trusts and reciprocal trusts. However, see Sec.  25.2504-2(b) regarding certain gifts made after August 5, 1997.  [T.D. 7238, 37 FR 28727, Dec. 29, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7910, 48 FR  40373, Sept. 7, 1983; T.D. 8845, 64 FR 67770, Dec. 3, 1999]</p>
