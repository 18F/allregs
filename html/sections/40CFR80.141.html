Beginning August 1, 1997, such gasoline  must contain detergent additive(s) meeting the certification  requirements of Sec. 80.161.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability of gasoline and PRC detergency requirement;  responsible parties. (1) Except as specifically exempted in Sec. 80.160,  the detergency requirements of this subpart apply to all gasoline,  whether intended for on-highway or nonroad use, including conventional,  reformulated, oxygenated, and leaded gasolines, as well as the gasoline  component of fuel mixtures of gasoline and alcohol fuels, gasoline used  as marine fuel, gasoline service accumulation fuel (as described in  Sec. 86.113-94(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this chapter), the gasoline component of fuel  mixtures of gasoline and methanol used for service accumulation in  flexible fuel vehicles (as described in Sec. 86.113-94(d) of this  chapter), gasoline used for factory fill purposes, and all additized  PRC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to paragraphs (c) through (f) of this section,  compliance with these requirements is the responsibility of parties who  directly or indirectly sell or dispense gasoline to the ultimate  consumer as well as parties who manufacture, supply, or transfer  detergent additives or detergent-additized post-refinery components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> (1) through (3) of this section. After  evaluating the adequacy of registration data provided by the detergent  manufacturer pursuant to these requirements, if EPA finds the data to be  deficient, EPA may disqualify the detergent package for use in complying  with the gasoline detergency requirements of this subpart, under the  provisions of paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compositional data. The compositional data supplied to EPA by  the additive manufacturer for purpose of registering a detergent  additive package under Sec. 79.21(a) of this chapter must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A complete listing of the components of the detergent additive  package, using standard chemical nomenclature when possible or providing  the chemical structure of any component for which the standard chemical  name is not precise. Polymeric components may be reported as the product  of other chemical reactants, provided that the supporting data specified  in Sec. 80.162(b) is also reported for such components.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The weight and/or volume percent (as applicable) of each  component of the package, with variability in these amounts restricted  according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For each detergent-active component of the package,  classification into one of the following designations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Polyalkyl amine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Polyether amine;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Polyalkylsuccinimide;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Polyalkylaminophenol;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Detergent-active carrier oil; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Other detergent-active component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allowable variation in compositional data. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A single  detergent additive registration may contain no variation in the identity  of any of the detergent-active components identified pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A single detergent additive registration may specify a range of  concentrations for identified detergent-active components, provided  that, if each such component were present in the detergent additive  package at the lower bound of its reported range of concentration, the  minimum recommended concentration reported in accordance with the  requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section would still provide the  deposit control effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The identity or concentration of non-detergent-active  components of the detergent additive package may vary under a single  registration, provided that the range of such variation is specified in  the registration, and that such variability does not reduce the deposit  control effectiveness of the additive package as compared with the level  of effectiveness claimed by the detergent registrant pursuant to the  requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section,  detergent additive packages which do not satisfy these restrictions must  be separately registered. EPA may disqualify an additive for use in  satisfying the requirements of this subpart if EPA determines that the  variability included within a given detergent additive registration may  reduce the deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package such  that it could invalidate the minimum recommended concentration reported  in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A change in minimum concentration requirements resulting from a  modification of detergent additive composition shall not require a new  detergent additive registration or a change in existing registration if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The modification is effected by a detergent blender only for its  own use or for the use of parties which are subsidiaries of, or share  common ownership with, the blender, and the modified detergent is not  sold or transferred to other parties; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The modification is a dilution of the additive for the purpose  of ensuring proper detergent flow in cold weather; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Gasoline is the only diluting agent used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The diluted detergent is subsequently added to gasoline at a  rate that attains the detergent's registered minimum recommended  concentration, taking into account the dilution; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> EPA is notified, either before or within seven days after the  dilution action, of the identity of the detergent, the identity of the  diluting material, the amount or percentage of the dilution, the change  in treat rate necessitated by the dilution, and the locations and time  period of diluted detergent usage. The notification shall be sent or  faxed to the address in Sec. 80.174(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Minimum recommended concentration. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The lower boundary of the  recommended range of concentration for the detergent additive package in  gasoline, which the additive manufacturer must report pursuant to the  registration requirements in Sec. 79.21(d) of this chapter, must equal  or exceed the minimum concentration which the manufacturer has  determined to be necessary for the control of deposits in the associated  fuel type, pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section. The minimum  recommended concentration shall be provided to EPA in units of gallons  of   detergent additive package per thousand gallons of gasoline or PRC,  reported to four digits. This concentration is the lowest additive  concentration (LAC) referred to elsewhere in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The minimum concentration reported in the detergent  registration according to the provisions of paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this  section must also be communicated in writing by the additive  manufacturer to each fuel manufacturer who purchases the subject  detergent for purpose of compliance with the gasoline detergency  requirements of this subpart, and to any additive manufacturer who  purchases the subject additive with the intent of reselling it to a fuel  manufacturer for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section,  EPA may require the additive manufacturer to submit data to support the  deposit control effectiveness of the detergent package at the specified  minimum effective concentration. EPA may disqualify an additive for use  in satisfying the requirements of this subpart upon finding that the  supporting data is inadequate. Manufacturers may be subject to the  liabilities and enforcement actions in Sec. Sec. 80.156 and 80.159 if  such a finding is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Once included in the registration for a detergent additive  package, the minimum concentration recommended by the detergent  manufacturer to detergent blenders and other users of the detergent  additive, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, may not be  changed without first notifying EPA. The notification must be sent by  certified mail to the address specified in Sec. 80.174(b). Changes to  the minimum recommended concentration must be supported by available  test data pursuant to paragraph (c)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A manufacturer may use a single set of test data to demonstrate  the deposit control effectiveness of more than one registered detergent  additive product, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The additive products contain all of the same detergent-active  components and no detergent-active components other than those contained  in common; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The minimum concentration recommended for the use of each such  additive product is specified such that, when each additive product is  mixed in gasoline at the recommended concentration, each of its  detergent-active components will be present at a final concentration no  less than the lowest concentration for that component shown to be  effective by the data available for the tested additive product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rate at which a detergent blender treats gasoline with a  detergent additive package must be no less than the minimum recommended  concentration reported for the subject detergent additive pursuant to  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, except under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a detergent blender believes that the minimum treat rate  recommended by the manufacturer of a detergent additive exceeds the  amount of detergent actually required for effective deposit control, and  possesses substantiating data consistent with the guidelines in  paragraph (e) of this section, then, upon informing EPA in writing of  these circumstances, the detergent blender may use the detergent at a  lower concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The notification to EPA must clearly specify the name of the  detergent product and its manufacturer, the concentration recommended by  the detergent manufacturer, and the lower concentration which the  detergent blender intends to use. The notification must also attest that  data are available to substantiate the deposit control effectiveness of  the detergent at the intended lower concentration. The notification must  be sent by certified mail to the address specified in Sec. 80.174(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At its discretion, EPA may require that the detergent blender  submit the test data purported to substantiate the claimed effectiveness  of the lower concentration of the detergent additive. EPA may also  require the manufacturer of the subject detergent additive to submit  test data substantiating the minimum recommended concentration specified  in the detergent additive registration. In either case, EPA will send a  letter to the appropriate party, and the supporting data will be due to  EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the detergent blender fails to submit the required supporting  data to EPA in the allotted time period, or if EPA judges the submitted  data to be inadequate to support the detergent blender's claim that the  lower concentration provides a level of deposit control consistent with  the requirements of this section, then EPA will disapprove the use of  the detergent at the lower concentration. Further, the detergent blender  may be subject to applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 80.156 and 80.159 for any gasoline or PRC it has additized at  the lower concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the detergent manufacturer fails to submit the required test  data to EPA within the allotted time period, EPA will proceed on the  assumption that data are not available to substantiate the minimum  recommended concentration specified in the detergent registration, and  the subject additive may be disqualified for use in complying with the  requirements of this subpart, pursuant to the procedures in paragraph  (g) of this section. The detergent manufacturer may also be subject to  applicable liabilities and penalties pursuant to Sec. Sec. 80.156 and  80.159.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If both parties submit the required information, EPA will  evaluate the quality and results of both sets of test data in relation  to each other and to industry-consensus test practices and standards, in  a manner consistent with the guidelines described in paragraph (e) of  this section. EPA will approve or disapprove the use of the detergent at  the lower concentration, and will inform both the detergent blender and  the detergent manufacturer of the results of its analysis within 60 days  of receipt of both sets of data.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Demonstration of deposit control efficiency. At its discretion,  EPA may require a detergent additive registrant to provide test data to  support the deposit control effectiveness of a detergent at the minimum  concentration recommended, pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section  and Sec. 79.21(d) of this chapter. The required supporting data must be  submitted to EPA within 30 days of receipt of EPA's request. EPA will  notify the submitter, within 60 days after receiving the supporting  data, whether the data is adequate to support the deposit control  efficiency claimed. Subject to the procedures specified in paragraph (g)  of this section, if the supporting data are not submitted or if EPA  finds the data insufficient, the detergent may be disqualified for use  by fuel manufacturers in complying with the requirements of this  subpart. EPA will use the following guidelines in determining the  adequacy of the supporting data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CARB-based supporting test data. For detergent additives which  are certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) for use in  the State of California (pursuant to Title 13, section 2257 of the  California Code of Regulations), the CARB certification data constitutes  adequate support of the detergent's effectiveness under this section,  with the exception that CARB detergent certification data specific to  California Phase II reformulated gasoline (pursuant to Title 13, Chapter  5, Article 1, Subarticle 2, California Code of Regulations, Standards  for Gasoline Sold Beginning March 1, 1996) will not be considered  adequate support for detergent effectiveness in gasolines that do not  conform to the compositional specifications for California's Phase II  reformulated gasoline. For CARB-based supporting data to be used to  demonstrate detergent performance, the minimum recommended concentration  reported in the detergent additive registration must be no less than the  concentration of the detergent-active components reported in the subject  CARB detergent certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> EPA will evaluate the adequacy of other supporting data  according to the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Test fuel guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The gasoline used in the supporting tests must contain the  detergent-active components of the subject detergent additive package in  an amount which corresponds to the minimum recommended concentrations  recorded in the respective detergent registration, or less than this  amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The test fuels must not contain any detergent-active components  other than those recorded in the subject detergent registration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The test fuels used must be reasonably typical of in-use fuels  in their tendency to form deposits. Test fuel   taken directly from commercial refinery production stock is acceptable.  Specially refined low-deposit-forming fuels such as indolene are not  acceptable. Other specially blended test fuels will be evaluated by EPA  for acceptability based on the extent to which such fuels adequately  represent the deposit-forming tendency of typical (average) in-use  fuels, as reflected in the levels of the following fuel parameters:  sulfur content, aromatic content, olefin content, T-90, and oxygenate  content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The composition of the blended test fuel(s) used in carburetor  deposit control testing, conducted to support the claimed effectiveness  of detergents used in leaded gasoline, should be reasonably typical of  in-use gasoline in its tendency to form carburetor deposits (or more  severe than typical in-use fuels) as defined by the olefin and sulfur  content. Test data using leaded fuels is preferred for this purpose, but  data collected using unleaded fuels may also be acceptable provided that  some correlation with additive performance in leaded fuels is available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test procedure guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To be acceptable, test data submitted to support the deposit  control effectiveness of a detergent additive must derive from testing  conducted in conformity with good engineering practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For demonstration of fuel injector and intake valve deposit  control performance, the tests specified in Sec. Sec. 80.165, or other  vehicle-based tests using generally accepted industry procedures and  standards, are preferred. Engine-based tests may also be acceptable,  assuming a reasonable correlation with vehicle-based tests and standards  can be demonstrated. Bench test data may be acceptable to demonstrate  fuel injector deposit control performance, assuming the results can be  correlated with vehicle- or engine-based tests and standards. Bench  testing will not be considered acceptable for demonstration of IVD  control performance. Examples of acceptable test procedures are  contained in the following references:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Intake Valve Deposit Test Procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Intake Valve Deposits--Fuel Detergency Requirements  Revisited'', Bill Bitting et al., Society of Automotive Engineers, SAE  Technical Paper No. 872117, 1987. \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), 400 Commonwealth Drive,  Warrendale, PA 15096-0001. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``BMW--10,000 Miles Intake Valve Test Procedure'', March 1,  1991, Section 2257, Title 13, California Code of Regulations. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ [Reserved] ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Effect on Intake Valve Deposits of Ethanol and Additives  Common to the Available Ethanol Supply'', Clifford Shilbolm et al., SAE  Technical Paper Series No. 902109, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fuel Injector Deposit Test Procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Test Method for Evaluating Port Fuel Injector (PFI) Deposits  in Vehicle Engines'', March 1, 1991, Section 2257, Title 13, California  Code of Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``A Vehicle Test Technique for Studying Port Fuel Injector  Deposits--A Coordinating Research Council Program'', Robert Tupa et al.,  SAE Technical paper No. 890213, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``The Effects of Fuel Composition and Additives on Multiport  Fuel Injector Deposits'', Jack Benson et al., SAE Technical Paper Series  No. 861533, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Injector Deposits--The Tip of Intake System Deposit  Problems'', Brian Taneguchi, et al., SAE Technical Paper Series No.  861534, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For demonstration of carburetor deposit control performance, any  generally accepted vehicle, engine, or bench test procedure for  carburetor deposit control will be considered adequate.

The test procedure will be due to EPA within 30 days of the  registrant's receipt of the request. Subject to the provisions in  paragraph (g) of this section, if the registrant fails to submit an  analytical procedure, or if EPA judges a submitted procedure to be  inadequate, EPA may deny or withdraw the detergent's eligibility to be  used to satisfy the detergency requirements in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The analytical procedure submitted by the registrant must be  able to both qualitatively and quantitatively identify each component of  the detergent additive package. To be acceptable, the procedure must  provide results that conform to reasonable and customary standards of  repeatability and reproducibility, and reasonable and customary limits  of detection and accuracy, for the type of test in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR)-based  procedure, including an actual infrared spectrum of the detergent  additive package and each component part of the detergent package  obtained from this test method, is preferred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disqualification of a detergent additive package. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When EPA  makes a preliminary determination that a detergent additive registrant  has failed to comply with the requirements of paragraph (c), (d)(3)(ii),  (e), or (f) of this section, either by failing to submit required  information for a subject detergent additive or by submitting  information which EPA deems inadequate, EPA shall notify the additive  registrant by certified mail, return receipt requested, setting forth  the basis for that determination and informing the registrant that the  detergent may lose its eligibility to be used to comply with the  detergency requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If EPA determines that the detergent registration was created by  fraud or other misconduct, such as a negligent disregard for the  truthfulness or accuracy of the required information or of the  application, the detergent registration will be considered void ab  initio and the revocation of qualification will be retroactive to  January 1, 1995 or the date on which the additive product was first  registered, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The registrant will be afforded 60 days from the date of receipt  of the notice of intent of detergent disqualification to submit written  comments concerning the notice, and to demonstrate or achieve compliance  with the specific data requirements which provide the basis for the  proposed disqualification. If the registrant does not respond in writing  within 60 days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent of  disqualification, the detergent disqualification shall become final by  operation of law and the Administrator shall notify the registrant of  such disqualification. If the registrant responds in writing within 60  days from the date of receipt of the notice of intent to disqualify, the  Administrator shall review and consider all comments submitted by the  registrant before taking final action concerning the proposed  disqualification. All correspondence regarding a disqualification must  be sent to the address specified in Sec. 80.174(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As part of a written response to a notice of intent to  disqualify, a registrant may request an informal hearing concerning the  notice. Any such request shall state with specificity the information  the registrant wishes to present at such a hearing. If an informal  hearing is requested, EPA shall schedule such a hearing within 90 days  from the date of receipt of the request. If an informal hearing is held,  the subject matter of the hearing shall be confined solely to whether or  not the registrant has complied with the specific data requirements  which provide the basis for the proposed disqualification. If an  informal hearing is held, the designated presiding officer may be any  EPA employee, the hearing procedures shall be informal, and the hearing  shall   not be subject to or governed by 40 CFR part 22 or by 5 U.S.C. 554, 556,  or 557.

Any disqualification  order issued after receipt of a timely written response by the  registrant shall become legally effective five days after it is  published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Upon making a final decision to disqualify a detergent additive  package pursuant to this paragraph (g), EPA shall inform all fuel  manufacturers and secondary additive manufacturers whose product  registrations report the potential use of the disqualified detergent  that such detergent is no longer eligible for compliance with the  requirements of this subpart. Such fuel manufacturers and secondary  additive manufacturers shall have 45 days in which to stop using the  ineligible detergent additive package and substitute an eligible  detergent additive. When applicable, EPA shall also notify such parties  that the detergent registration had been created by fraud or other  misconduct, pursuant to paragraph (g)(2) of this section.
