                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Notwithstanding any limitations on prepayment or voluntary termination under subpart B of this part, an owner may terminate the low income affordability restrictions through prepayment or voluntary termination, subject to compliance with the provisions of Sec. 248.165, under one of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commissioner approves a plan of action under Sec. 248.153(a), but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan and contained in an executed use agreement between the Commissioner and the owner, including section 8 assistance or a loan provided under part 219 of this chapter, but not including insurance of a rehabilitation or equity take-out loan under part 241 of this chapter, during the 15-month period beginning on the date of final approval of the plan of action;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the date that the project would have been eligible for prepayment pursuant to the terms of the mortgage, notwithstanding this part, the Commissioner approves a plan of action under Sec. 248.157 or Sec. 248.161, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan, including section 8 assistance, a loan provided under part 219 of this chapter, a grant provided under Sec. 248.157(o), or a grant under Sec. 248.161(d), before the earlier of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the first fiscal year beginning after such final approval; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expiration of the 6-month period beginning on the date of final approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commissioner approves a plan of action under Sec. Sec. 248.157 or 248.161 for any eligible low income housing not covered by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, but does not provide the assistance approved in such plan before the earlier of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The expiration of the 2-month period beginning on the commencement of the first fiscal year beginning after such final approval; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of final approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An owner who intended to transfer the project to a qualified purchaser under Sec. 248.157 or Sec. 248.161, and fully complied with the provisions of such section,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Did not receive any bona fide offers from any qualified purchasers within the applicable time periods; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Received and accepted a bona fide offer from a qualified purchaser, but the sales transaction fell through for reasons not attributable in whole or in part to the owner, and the owner then complied with the requirements of Sec. 248.157(l) and did not receive another bona fide offer from any qualified purchasers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 8 assistance. When providing section 8 assistance, the Commissioner may enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations, for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for rental assistance as provided in appropriations acts, to extend the term of such rental assistance for such additional period or periods necessary to carry out an approved plan of action. The contract and approved plan of action shall provide that, if the Commissioner is unable to extend the term of such rental assistance or is unable to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits to the owner comparable to those received under the

original approved plan of action, the Commissioner, upon the request of the owner, shall take the following actions, subject to the limitations under the following paragraphs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Modify the binding commitments made pursuant to Sec. 248.145(a)(2)-(10) that are dependent upon such rental assistance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Commissioner determines that such modification is infeasible, permit the owner to prepay the mortgage and terminate the plan of action and any implementing use agreements or restrictions, but only if the owner agrees in writing to comply with the provisions of Sec. 248.165.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to provide section 8 assistance. With regard to paragraph (b) of this section, the Commissioner shall notify the owner of an inability to either extend the term of section 8 rental assistance or to develop a revised package of incentives providing benefits comparable to those received under the original plan of action as soon as practicable upon discovering that fact. The owner shall inform the Commissioner in writing, within 30 days of receipt of the notice that, since the Commissioner is unable to fulfill the terms of the original plan of action, the owner intends to request that the Commissioner take action under paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section. The Commissioner shall, no later than 90 days from receiving the owner's notice, take action to extend the rental assistance contract and to continue the binding commitments under Sec. 248.145(a)(2)-(10).</p>
