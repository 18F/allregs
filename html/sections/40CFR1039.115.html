                            <p class="depth0">Engines that are required to meet the emission standards of this  part must meet the following requirements, except as noted elsewhere in  this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Crankcase emissions. Crankcase emissions may not be discharged  directly into the ambient atmosphere from any engine throughout its  useful life, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Engines may discharge crankcase emissions to the ambient  atmosphere if the emissions are added to the exhaust emissions (either  physically or mathematically) during all emission testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you take advantage of this exception, you must do the  following things:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Manufacture the engines so that all crankcase emissions can be  routed into the applicable sampling systems specified in 40 CFR part  1065.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Account for deterioration in crankcase emissions when  determining exhaust deterioration factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a), crankcase emissions that are  routed to the exhaust upstream of exhaust aftertreatment during all  operation are not considered to be discharged directly into the ambient  atmosphere.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)-(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjustable parameters. Engines that have adjustable parameters  must meet all the requirements of this part for any adjustment in the  physically adjustable range. An operating parameter is not considered  adjustable if you permanently seal it or if it is not normally  accessible using ordinary tools. We may require that you set adjustable  parameters to any specification within the adjustable range during any  testing, including certification testing, selective enforcement  auditing, or in-use testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prohibited controls. You may not design your engines with  emission-control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or  contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety  while operating. For example, this would apply if the engine emits a  noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes  to such an unreasonable risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Defeat devices. You may not equip your engines with a defeat  device. A defeat device is an auxiliary emission-control device that  reduces the effectiveness of emission controls under conditions that the  engine may reasonably be expected to encounter during normal operation  and use. This does not apply to auxiliary-emission control devices you  identify in your certification application if any of the following is  true:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The conditions of concern were substantially included in the  applicable test procedures described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You show your design is necessary to prevent engine (or  equipment) damage or accidents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The reduced effectiveness applies only to starting the engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> are active.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The auxiliary emission control device operates only in emergency  situations as defined in Sec.  1039.665 and meets all of the  requirements of that section, and you meet all of the requirements of  that section.
