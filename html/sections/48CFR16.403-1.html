                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract  specifies a target cost, a target profit, a price ceiling (but not a  profit ceiling or floor), and a profit adjustment formula. These  elements are all negotiated at the outset. The price ceiling is the  maximum that may be paid to the contractor, except for any adjustment  under other contract clauses. When the contractor completes performance,  the parties negotiate the final cost, and the final price is established  by applying the formula. When the final cost is less than the target  cost, application of the formula results in a final profit greater than  the target profit; conversely, when final cost is more than target cost,  application of the formula results in a final profit less than the  target profit, or even a net loss. If the final negotiated cost exceeds  the price ceiling, the contractor absorbs the difference as a loss.  Because the profit varies inversely with the cost, this contract type  provides a positive, calculable profit incentive for the contractor to  control costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. A fixed-price incentive (firm target) contract is  appropriate when the parties can negotiate at the outset a firm target  cost, target profit, and profit adjustment formula that will provide a  fair and reasonable incentive and a ceiling that provides for the  contractor to assume an appropriate share of the risk. When the  contractor assumes a considerable or major share of the cost  responsibility under the adjustment formula, the target profit should  reflect this responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. This contract type may be used only when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contractor's accounting system is adequate for providing  data to support negotiation of final cost and incentive price revision;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adequate cost or pricing information for establishing reasonable  firm targets is available at the time of initial contract negotiation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contract Schedule. The contracting officer shall specify in the  contract Schedule the target cost, target profit, and target price for  each item subject to incentive price revision.
