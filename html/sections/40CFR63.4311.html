                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Semiannual compliance reports. You must submit semiannual compliance reports for each affected source according to the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (8) of this section. The semiannual compliance reporting requirements of this section may be satisfied by reports required under other parts of the Clean Air Act (CAA), as specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dates. Unless the Administrator has approved a different schedule for submission of reports under Sec. 63.10(a), you must prepare and submit each semiannual compliance report according to the dates specified in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first semiannual compliance report must cover the first semiannual reporting period which begins the day after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. Sec. 63.4320, 63.4330, 63.4340, or 63.4350 that applies to your affected source and ends on June 30 or December 31, whichever date is the first date at least 6 months after the end of the initial compliance period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each subsequent semiannual compliance report must cover the subsequent semiannual reporting period from January 1 through June 30 or the semiannual reporting period from July 1 through December 31.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each semiannual compliance report must be postmarked or delivered no later than July 31 or January 31, whichever date is the first date following the end of the semiannual reporting period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For each affected source that is subject to permitting regulations pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71, and if the permitting authority has established dates for submitting semiannual reports pursuant to 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), you may submit the first and subsequent compliance reports according to the dates the permitting authority has established instead of according to the date specified in paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inclusion with title V report. Each affected source that has obtained a title V operating permit pursuant to 40 CFR part 70 or 40 CFR part 71 must report all deviations as defined in this subpart in the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A). If an affected source submits a semiannual compliance report pursuant to this section along with, or as part of, the semiannual monitoring report required by 40 CFR 70.6(a)(3)(iii)(A) or 40 CFR 71.6(a)(3)(iii)(A), and the semiannual compliance report includes all required information concerning deviations from any emission limitation in this subpart, its submission shall be deemed to satisfy any obligation to report the same deviations in the semiannual monitoring report. However, submission of a semiannual compliance report shall not otherwise affect any obligation the affected source may have to report deviations from permit requirements to the permitting authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> General requirements. The semiannual compliance report must contain the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3)(i) through (v) of this section, and the information specified in paragraphs (a)(4) through (8) and (c)(1) of this section that is applicable to your affected source.

If you switched between compliance options during the reporting period, you must report the beginning and ending dates you used each option.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If you used the emission rate without add-on controls, the emission rate with add-on controls, or the organic HAP overall control efficiency compliance option for web coating/printing operations (Sec. 63.4291(a)(2), (3), or (4)), or the emission rate without add-on controls or the emission rate with add-on controls compliance option for dyeing/finishing operations (Sec. 63.4291(c)(2) or (c)(3)), the calculation results for each compliance period ending each month during the 6-month reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No deviations. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations in Table 1 to this subpart and Sec. Sec. 63.4292, and 63.4293 that apply to you, the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations from the emission limitations during the reporting period. If you use the emission rate with add-on controls option, the organic HAP overall control efficiency option, or the oxidizer outlet organic HAP concentration option and there were no periods during which the continuous parameter monitoring systems (CPMS) were out-of-control as specified in Sec. 63.8(c)(7), the semiannual compliance report must include a statement that there were no periods during which the CPMS were out-of-control during the reporting period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Deviations: compliant material option.

If you use one of the add-on controls options in Sec. 63.4291(a) or (c) and there was a deviation from an emission limitation (including any periods when emissions bypassed the add-on control device and were diverted to the atmosphere), the semiannual compliance report must contain the information in paragraphs (a)(7)(i) through (xv) of this section. This includes periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction during which deviations occurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The beginning and ending dates of each compliance period during which the organic HAP emission rate exceeded the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you use the emission rate option, the calculations used to determine the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period in which a deviation occurred.
