The handler shall collect the assessment at the time the handler first makes any payment or any credit to the producer's account for the cotton. The handler shall give the producer a receipt indicating payment of the assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any cooperative marketing association or other person that accepts a bale of cotton from the producer of the cotton under an oral or written contract or agreement providing for the marketing of the cotton shall be the collecting handler for such cotton. Such association or person shall collect the assessment regardless of whether the cotton is marketed or tendered to CCC for price support loan. The handler shall collect the assessment at the time the handler first makes any cash advance, any payment, or any credit to the producer's account for the cotton. The handler shall give the producer a receipt indicating payment of the assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For bales of cotton tendered to CCC for Form A loan, except bales tendered pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ASCS County Office shall be the collecting handler except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The ASCS County Office shall collect the assessment when it makes disbursement based on the Form A loan documents. The producer's copy of the Cotton Producer's Note (Form CCC Cotton A) shall show payment of the assessment and shall constitute the producer's receipt for payment of the assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person (other than an ASCS County Office) who advances to the producer the loan value of the cotton as shown on a Cotton Producer's Note (Form CCC Cotton A) shall be the collecting handler for such cotton.

The handler shall collect the assessment at the time such cotton is ginned and shall give the producer a receipt indicating payment of the assessment. When a bale is ginned that contains any such cotton purchased from more than one producer, the handler shall collect each producer's proportionate share of the assessment and shall give each producer a receipt indicating the producer's proportionate share of the assessment payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any person who purchases cotton from a producer whereby the producer agrees to deliver a certain quantity of cotton but retains the right to establish the price at some future date shall be the collecting handler for such cotton. The handler shall collect the $1 per bale assessment at the time final settlement is made on the cotton. The handler shall give the producer a receipt indicating payment of the $1 per bale assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any person who consumes domestically or exports cotton of that person's own production shall be the collecting handler for such cotton. Such handler shall pay the assessment to the Cotton Board at the time the cotton is consumed or exported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any person who obtains ownership of a bale of cotton from the producer of the cotton by transfer of any kind or by any means, under conditions other than those described in paragraph (a), (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section shall be the collecting handler for such cotton. Such handler shall collect the assessment at the time such handler takes ownership of the cotton.
