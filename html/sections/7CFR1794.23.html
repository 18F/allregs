                            <p class="depth0">RUS will normally prepare an EA for all proposed actions which are  neither categorical exclusions (Sec. Sec. 1794.21 and 1794.22) nor  normally requiring an EIS (Sec. 1794.25). For certain actions within  this class, scoping and document procedures contained in  Sec. Sec. 1794.50 through 1794.54 shall be followed (see Sec. 1794.24).  The following are proposed actions which normally require an EA and  shall be subject to the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1794.40 through  1794.44.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Issuance or modification of RUS regulations concerning  environmental matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Telecommunications and water and waste programs. An EA shall be  prepared for applications for financial assistance for all proposed  actions not specifically defined as a CE or otherwise specifically  categorized by the Administrator on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electric program. Applications for financial assistance for  certain proposed actions normally require the preparation of an EA.  Proposed actions falling within this classification are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Construction of fuel cell, combustion turbine, combined cycle,  or diesel generating facilities of 50 MW (nameplate rating) or less at a  new site (no existing generating capacity) except for items covered by  Sec. 1794.22(a)(8). All new associated facilities and related electric  power lines shall be covered in the EA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Construction of fuel cell, combustion turbine, combined cycle,  or diesel generating facilities of 100 MW (nameplate rating) or less at  an existing generating site, except for items covered by  Sec. 1794.22(a)(8). All new associated facilities and related electric  power lines shall be covered in the EA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Construction of any other type of new electric generating  facility of 20 MW (nameplate rating) or less, except for items covered  by Sec. 1794.22(a)(8). All new associated facilities and related  electric power lines shall be covered in the EA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Repowering or uprating of an existing unit(s) at a fossil-fueled  generating station where the existing fuel combustion technology of the  affected unit(s) is substituted for another (e.g. coal or oil-fired  boiler is converted to a fluidized bed boiler or replaced with a  combustion turbine unit);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Installation of new generating units at an existing  hydroelectric facility or dam, or the replacement of existing generating  units at a hydroelectric facility or dam which will result in a change  in the normal maximum surface area or normal maximum surface elevation  of the existing impoundment. All new associated facilities and related  electric power lines shall be covered in the EA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A new drilling operation or the expansion of a mining or  drilling operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Construction of cooperative headquarters, maintenance, and  equipment storage facilities involving more than 10 acres (4 hectares)  of physical disturbance or fenced property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The construction of electric power lines and related facilities  designed for and capable of operation at a nominal voltage of 230 kV or  more involving more than three miles (4.8 kilometers) but not more than  25 miles (40 kilometers) of line;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The construction of electric power lines and related facilities  designed for or capable of operation at a nominal voltage of 69 kV or  more but less than 230 kV where more than 25 miles (40 kilometers) of  power line are involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The construction of substations or switching stations requiring  greater than five acres (2 hectares) of new physical disturbance at a  single site; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Construction of facilities designed for the transfer and  storage of ash, scrubber wastes, and other byproducts from coal-fired  electric generating stations that will be located beyond the existing  facility site boundaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Installing a heat recovery steam generator and steam turbine  with a rating of more than 200 MW on an existing combustion turbine  generation site for the purpose of combined cycle operation. All new  associated facilities and related electric power lines shall be covered  in the EA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Construction of a natural gas pipeline to serve an existing  gas-fueled generating facility.
