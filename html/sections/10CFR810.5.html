                            <p class="depth0">A person may request the advice of the Director, Nuclear Transfer and Supplier Policy Division (NN-43), on whether a proposed activity falls outside the scope of this part, is generally authorized under Sec. 810.7, or requires specific authorization under Sec. 810.8; however, unless authorized by the Secretary of Energy, in writing, no interpretation of the regulations in this part other than a written interpretation by the General Counsel is binding upon the Department. When advice is requested from the Director, Nuclear Transfer and Supplier Policy Division, or a binding, written determination is requested from the General Counsel, a response normally will be made within 30 days and, if this is not feasible, an interim response will explain the delay.
