The Cooperator is the responsible authority, without  recourse to the REE Agency, regarding the settlement and satisfaction of  all contractual and administrative issues arising out of procurements  entered into in support of a nonassistance agreement. This includes  disputes, claims, award protests, source evaluation or other matters of  a contractual nature. Matters concerning violation of statute are to be  referred to such Federal, State or local authority, as may have proper  jurisdiction.</p>
