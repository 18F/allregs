                            <p class="depth0">Requester category means one of five categories that agencies place requesters in for the purpose of determining whether a requester will be charged fees for search, review and duplication. This is separate from a fee waiver, which waives any fees charged. Fee waivers are covered in Sec. 706.24.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Commercial Use request is a request that asks for information for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit interest, which can include furthering those interests through litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An Educational Use request is one made on behalf of an educational institution, defined as any school that operates a program of scholarly research. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, a qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. Records requested for the intention of fulfilling credit requirements are not considered to be sought for an educational institution's use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Noncommercial Scientific Institution Use request is a request made on behalf of a noncommercial scientific institution, defined as an institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as defined in paragraph (a) of this section, and that is operated solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to further scientific research and not for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A News Media Request is a request made by a representative of the news media in that capacity. A representative of the news media is defined as any person or entity that actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations that broadcast news to the public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate news and make their products available through a variety of means to the general public. A request for records that supports the news-dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial use. ``Freelance'' journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as working for that entity. A publishing contract would provide the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, OPIC shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this determination. OPIC's decision to grant a requester media status will be made on a case-by-case basis based upon the requester's intended use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All Other Requesters is any request made for a use not covered by paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p>
