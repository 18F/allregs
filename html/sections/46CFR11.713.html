                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a first-class pilot has not served over a particular route  within the past 60 months, that person's license or MMC endorsement is  invalid for that route, and remains invalid until the individual has  made one re-familiarization round trip over that route, except as  provided in paragraph (b) of this section. Whether this requirement is  satisfied or not has no effect on the renewal of other licenses or MMC  endorsements. Roundtrips made within the 90-day period preceding renewal  will be valid for the duration of the renewed license or MMC  endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For certain long or extended routes, the OCMI may, at his or her  discretion, allow the re-familiarization requirement to be satisfied by  reviewing appropriate navigation charts, coast pilots tide and current  tables, local Notice to Mariners, and any other materials that would  provide the pilot with current knowledge of the route. Persons using  this method of re-familiarization must certify, when applying for  renewal of their license or MMC endorsement, the material they have  reviewed and the dates on which this was accomplished. Review within the  90-day period preceding renewal is valid for the duration of the renewed  MMC endorsement.</p>
