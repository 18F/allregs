                                Sec. 1.522-2  Manner of taxation of cooperative associations subject
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Farmers', fruit growers', or like associations,  organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section  521 and Sec. 1.521-1 shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 11  or section 1201, except that there shall be allowed as deductions from  gross income, in addition to the other deductions allowable under  chapter 1 of the Code, certain special deductions provided in section  522(b)(1)(A) and paragraph (c) of this section, and section 522(b)(1)(B)  and paragraph (d) of this section. Amounts allocated as patronage  dividends, refunds, or rebates, whether in cash, merchandise, capital  stock, revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of  indebtedness, letters of advice, or in some other manner that discloses  to each patron the dollar amount allocated, with respect to patronage  for the taxable year or for preceding taxable years, shall be taken into  account in the manner provided in section 522 and in Sec. 1.522-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Cooperative association exempt from tax before January 1, 1952.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the purpose of determining the method of accounting under  section 446 in the case of a cooperative association which was exempt  from tax for taxable years beginning prior to January 1, 1952, the  method of accounting, recognized under sections 41, 42, and 43 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and the regulations prescribed thereunder  and utilized in the return of such association for its last taxable year  to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 was applicable, shall be  deemed to constitute the method of accounting regularly employed by the  cooperative association. Any change from this method may be made only if  permission is obtained from the Commissioner to change to another  recognized method in accordance with section 446 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any case where inventories are an income-producing factor,  see sections 471 and 472 and the regulations thereunder. The elective  method of inventorying goods provided in section 472 may be adopted by  the cooperative association for any taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1953, inaccordance with the requirements of section 472 and  the regulations thereunder. However, in order to use such method for  such a taxable year the cooperative association (unless it has used such  method for a taxable year beginning after 1951 and before 1954 pursuant  to an election exercised as provided in 26 CFR (1939) 39.22(d)-3  (Regulations 118) must exercise the election provided in section 472 and  the regulations thereunder, even if it may have utilized such method for  accounting purposes for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1952.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following rules shall be applicable in computing the net  operating loss deduction provided in section 172: No net operating loss  carryover shall be allowed from a taxable year beginning prior to  January 1, 1952, for which the cooperative association was exempt from  tax under section 101(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. In the  case of a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1952, for which the  association was not exempt under section 101(12) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939 and of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1951,  the amount of the net operating loss   carryback or carryover from such year shall not be reduced by reference  to the income of any taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 1952,  for which the association was exempt from tax under section 101(12) of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1939. However, any taxable year beginning  prior to January 1, 1952, for which the cooperative association was  exempt under section 101(12) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall  be taken into account in determining the period for which a net  operating loss may be carried back or carried over, as the case may be.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The adjustments to the cost or other basis provided in sections  1011 and 1016 and the regulations thereunder, are applicable for the  entire period since the acquisition of the property. Thus, proper  adjustment to basis must be made under section 1016 for depreciation,  obsolescence, amortization, and depletion for all taxable years  beginning prior to January 1, 1952, although the cooperative association  was exempt from tax under section 521 or corresponding provisions of  prior law for such years. However, no adjustment for percentage or  discovery depletion is to be made for any year during which the  association was exempt from tax. If a cooperative association has made a  proper election in accordance with section 1020 and the regulations  prescribed thereunder with respect to a taxable year beginning before  1952 in which the association was not exempt from tax, the adjustment to  basis for depreciation for such years shall be limited in accordance  with the provisions of section 1016(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of tax exempt and partially taxable bonds purchased  at a premium and subject to amortization under section 171, proper  adjustment to basis must be made to reflect amortization with respect to  such premium from the date of acquisition of the bond. (For principles  governing the method of computation, see the example in paragraph (b) of  Sec. 1.1016-9, relating to mutual savings banks, building and loan  associations, and cooperative banks.) The basis of a fully taxable bond  purchased at a premium shall be adjusted from the date of the election  to amortize such premium in accordance with the provisions of section  171 except that no adjustment shall be allowable for such portion of the  premium attributable to the period prior to the election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a mortgage acquired at a premium where the  principal of such mortgage is payable in installments, adjustments to  the basis for the premium must be made for all taxable years (whether or  not the association was exempt from tax under section 521 during such  years) in which installment payments are received. Such adjustments may  be made on an individual mortgage basis or on a composite basis by  reference to the average period of payments of the mortgage loans of  such association. For the purpose of this adjustment, the term premium  includes the excess of the acquisition value of the mortgage over its  maturity value. The acquisition value of the mortgage is the cost  including buying commissions, attorneys' fees or brokerage fees, but  such value does not include amounts paid for accrued interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deduction for dividends paid. There is allowable as a deduction  from the gross income of a cooperative association operated in  compliance with the requirements of section 521 and Sec. 1.521-1,  amounts paid as dividends during the taxable year upon the capital stock  of the cooperative association. For the purpose of the preceding  sentence, the term capital stock includes common stock (whether voting  or nonvoting), preferred stock, or any other form of capital represented  by capital retain certificates, revolving fund certificates, letters of  advice, or other evidence of a proprietary interest in a cooperative  association. Such deduction is applicable only to the taxable year in  which the dividends are actually or constructively paid to the holder of  capital stock or other proprietary interest of the cooperative  association. If a dividend is paid by check and the check bearing a date  within the taxable year is deposited in the mail, in a cover properly  stamped and addressed tothe shareholder at his last known address, at  such time that in the ordinary handling of the mails the check would be  received by such holder within the taxable year, a presumption arises  that the dividend was paid to such holder in   such year. The determination of whether a dividend has been paid to such  holder by the corporation during its taxable year is in no way dependent  upon the method of accounting regularly employed by the corporation in  keeping its books. For further rules as to the determination of the  right to a deduction for dividends paid, under certain specific  circumstances, see section 561 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Deduction for amounts allocated from income not derived from  patronage. There is allowable as a deduction from the gross income of a  cooperative association operated in compliance with the requirements of  section 521 and Sec. 1.521-1 amounts allocated during the taxable year  to patrons with respect to its income not derived from patronage  (whether or not such income was derived during such taxable year)  whether such amounts are paid in cash, merchandise, capital stock,  revolving fund certificates, retain certificates, certificates of  indebtedness, letters of advice, or in some other manner that discloses  to each patron the dollar amount allocated to him. For this purpose,  allocations made after the close of the taxable year and on or before  the 15th day of the ninth month following the close of the taxable year  shall be considered as made on the last day of such taxable year to the  extent that such allocations are attributable toincome derived during  the taxable year or during years prior to the taxable year. As used in  this paragraph, the term income not derived from patronage means  incidental income derived from sources not directly related to the  marketing, purchasing, or service activities of the cooperative  association. For example, income derived from the lease of premises,  from investment in securities, from the sale or exchange of capital  assets, constitutes income not derived from patronage. Business done  with the United States shall constitute income not derived from  patronage. In order that the deduction for income not derived from  patronage may be applicable, it is necessary that the amount sought to  be deducted be allocated on a patronage basis in proportion, insofar as  is practicable, to the amount of business done by or for patrons during  the period to which such income is attributable. Thus, if capital gains  are realized from the sale or exchange of capital assets acquired and  disposed of during the taxable year, income realized from such gains  must be allocated to patrons of such year in proportion to theamount of  business done by such patrons during the taxable year. Similarly, if  capital gains are realized by the association from the sale or exchange  of capital assets held for a period of more than one taxable year income  realized from such gains must be allocated, in proportion insofar as is  practicable, to the patrons of the taxable years during which the asset  was owned by the association, and to the amount of business done by such  patrons during such taxable years.</p>
