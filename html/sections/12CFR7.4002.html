                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to impose charges and fees. A national bank may charge  its customers non-interest charges and   fees, including deposit account service charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Considerations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All charges and fees should be arrived at by  each bank on a competitive basis and not on the basis of any agreement,  arrangement, undertaking, understanding, or discussion with other banks  or their officers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The establishment of non-interest charges and fees, their  amounts, and the method of calculating them are business decisions to be  made by each bank, in its discretion, according to sound banking  judgment and safe and sound banking principles. A national bank  establishes non-interest charges and fees in accordance with safe and  sound banking principles if the bank employs a decision-making process  through which it considers the following factors, among others:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost incurred by the bank in providing the service;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The deterrence of misuse by customers of banking services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The enhancement of the competitive position of the bank in  accordance with the bank's business plan and marketing strategy; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The maintenance of the safety and soundness of the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest. Charges and fees that are ``interest'' within the  meaning of 12 U.S.C. 85 are governed by Sec. 7.4001 and not by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State law. The OCC applies preemption principles derived from  the United States Constitution, as interpreted through judicial  precedent, when determining whether State laws apply that purport to  limit or prohibit charges and fees described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> National bank as fiduciary. This section does not apply to  charges imposed by a national bank in its capacity as a fiduciary, which  are governed by 12 CFR part 9.  [66 FR 34791, July 2, 2001]</p>
