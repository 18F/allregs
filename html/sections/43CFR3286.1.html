made of interests in land within a Participating Area without the prior approval of the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0">14.2 A Working Interest Owner may exercise the right to surrender, when such right is vested in it by any non-Federal lease, sublease, or operating agreement, provided that each party who will or might acquire the Working Interest in such lease by such surrender or by forfeiture is bound by the terms of this Agreement, and further provided that no relinquishment shall be made of such land within a Participating Area without the prior written consent of the non-Federal Lessor.</p><p class="depth0">14.3 If, as the result of relinquishment, surrender, or forfeiture, the Working Interests become vested in the fee owner or lessor of the Unitized Substances, such owner may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Accept those Working Interest rights and obligations subject to this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lease the portion of such land as is included in a Participating Area established hereunder, subject to this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement, and provide for the independent operation of any part of such land that is not then included within a Participating Area established hereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> accept the Working Interest rights and obligations subject to this Agreement and the Unit Operating Agreement, or (2) lease such lands as provided in 14.3 above within six (6) months after the relinquished, surrendered, or forfeited Working Interest becomes vested in

unitized Working Interests in accordance with their respective Working Interest ownerships, and such owners of Working Interests shall compensate the fee owner or lessor of Unitized Substances in such lands by paying sums equal to the rentals, minimum royalties, and royalties applicable to such lands under the lease or leases in effect when the Working Interests were relinquished, surrendered, or forfeited.</p><p class="depth0">14.5 Subject to the provisions of 14.4 above, an appropriate accounting and settlement shall be made for all benefits accruing to or payments and expenditures made or incurred on behalf of any surrendered or forfeited Working Interest subsequent to the date of surrender or forfeiture, and payment of any moneys found to be owing by such an accounting shall be made as between the parties within thirty (30) days.</p><p class="depth0">14.6 In the event no Unit Operating Agreement is in existence and a mutually acceptable agreement cannot be consummated between the proper parties, the authorized officer may prescribe such reasonable and equitable conditions of agreement as he deems warranted under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">14.7 The exercise of any right vested in a Working Interest Owner to reassign such Working Interest to the party from whom it was obtained shall be subject to the same conditions as set forth in this Article XIV in regard to the exercise of a right to surrender.</p><p class="depth0">Article XV--Rentals</p><p class="depth0">15.1 ny unitized lease on non-Federal land containing provisions that would terminate such lease unless (1) drilling operations are commenced upon the land covered thereby within the time therein specified or (2) rentals are paid for the privilege of deferring such drilling operations, the rentals required thereby shall, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, be deemed to accrue as to the portion of the lease not included within a Participating Area and become payable during the term thereof as extended by this Agreement, and until the required drillings are commenced upon the land covered thereby.</p><p class="depth0">15.2 Nothing herein operates to relieve the lessees of any land from their respective lease obligations for the payment of any rental or royalty due under their leases.</p><p class="depth0">15.3 Rental and royalty due on the leases committed to

such party's sole risk, costs, and expense, drill a well to test any formation of deposit for which a Participating Area has not been established or to test any formation or deposit for which a Participating Area has been established if such location is not within said Participating Area, unless within 30 days of receipt of notice from said party of his intention to drill the well, the Unit Operator elects and commences to drill such a well in like manner as other wells are drilled by the Unit Operator under this Agreement.</p><p class="depth0">16.2 If any well drilled by a Working
