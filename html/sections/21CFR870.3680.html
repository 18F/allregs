A temporary  pacemaker electrode is a device consisting of flexible insulated  electrical conductors with one end connected to an external pacemaker  pulse generator and the other end applied to the heart. The device is  used to transmit a pacing electrical stimulus from the pulse generator  to the heart and/or to transmit the electrical signal of the heart to  the pulse generator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Classification.

A permanent  pacemaker electrode is a device consisting of flexible insulated  electrical conductors with one end connected to an implantable pacemaker  pulse generator and the other end applied to the heart. The device is  used to transmit a pacing electrical stimulus from the pulse generator  to the heart and/or to transmit the electrical signal of the heart to  the pulse generator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Classification.

A PMA or  notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and  Drug Administration on or before October 4, 2012, for any permanent  pacemaker electrode device that was in commercial distribution before  May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before October 4, 2012, been found to  be substantially equivalent to any permanent pacemaker electrode device  that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other  pacemaker repair or replacement material device shall have an approved  PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in  commercial distribution.
