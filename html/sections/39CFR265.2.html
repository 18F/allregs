                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the policy of the Postal Service to make its official records available to the public to the maximum extent consistent with the public interest. This policy requires a practice of full disclosure subject only to the specific exemptions required or authorized by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exemptions from mandatory disclosure provided by section 552(b) of title 5, and section 410(c) of title 39, U.S.C., for various types of records, reflect the fact that under some circumstances the public interest may be better served by leaving the disclosure of particular records to the discretion of the Postal Service than by requiring their disclosure. As to those records the disclosure of which is not prohibited by statute, Executive Order, or regulation, the discretion vested in the Postal Service is exercised after giving consideration to the following: The effect of non-disclosure on the public's right to know about a particular matter; the effect of disclosure on the right of privacy of any affected individuals; the effect of disclosure on the public interest in the economical, efficient, and orderly operation of the nation's mail system; and any other factors that may be relevant under the circumstances.
