                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Authority. 12 U.S.C. 24(Seventh), 93a, 181, 214a, 214b, 215,  215a, 215a-1, 215a-3, 215c, 1815(d)(3), 1828(c), 1831u, and 2903.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section sets forth the provisions governing business  combinations and the standards for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> OCC review and approval of an application for a business  combination between a national bank and another depository institution  resulting in a national bank or between a national bank and one of its  nonbank affiliates; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Requirements of notices and other procedures for national banks  involved in other combinations with depository institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Licensing requirements. A national bank shall submit an  application and obtain prior OCC approval for a business combination  between the national bank and another depository institution when the  resulting institution is a national bank. A national bank shall give  notice to the OCC prior to engaging in a combination where the resulting  institution will not be a national bank. A national bank shall submit an  application and obtain prior OCC approval for any merger between the  national bank and one or more of its nonbank affiliates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definitions--For purposes of this Sec. 5.33:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bank means any national bank or any state bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Business combination means any merger or consolidation between a  national bank and one or more depository institutions in which the  resulting institution is a national bank, the acquisition by a national  bank of all, or substantially all, of the assets of another depository  institution, the assumption by a national bank of deposit liabilities of  another depository institution, or a merger between a national bank and  one or more of its nonbank affiliates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Business reorganization means either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A business combination between eligible banks, or between an  eligible bank and an eligible depository institution, that are  controlled by the same holding company or that will be controlled by the  same holding company prior to the combination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A business combination between an eligible bank and an interim  bank chartered in a transaction in which a person or group of persons  exchanges its shares of the eligible bank for shares of a newly formed  holding company and receives after the transaction substantially the  same proportional share interest in the holding company as it held in  the eligible bank (except for changes in interests resulting from the  exercise of dissenters' rights), and the reorganization involves no  other transactions involving the bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Company means a corporation, limited liability company,  partnership, business trust, association, or similar organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>, a  company or shareholder is deemed to control another company if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such company or shareholder, directly or indirectly, or acting  through one or more other persons owns, controls, or has power to vote  25 percent or more of any class of voting securities of the other  company, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Such company or shareholder controls in any manner the election  of a majority of the directors or trustees of the other company. No  company shall be deemed to own or control another company by virtue of  its ownership or control of shares in a fiduciary capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Home state means, with respect to a national bank, the state in  which the main office of the bank is located and, with respect to a  state bank, the state by which the bank is chartered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Interim bank means a national bank that does not operate  independently but exists solely as a vehicle to accomplish a business  combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Nonbank affiliate of a national bank means any company (other  than a bank or Federal savings association)   that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the  national bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Policy--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Factors--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bank Merger Act. When the OCC evaluates  an application for a business combination under the Bank Merger Act, the  OCC considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Competition. (1) The OCC considers the effect of a proposed  business combination on competition. The applicant shall provide a  competitive analysis of the transaction, including a definition of the  relevant geographic market or markets. An applicant may refer to the  Manual for procedures to expedite its competitive analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The OCC will deny an application for a business combination if  the combination would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of  any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the  business of banking in any part of the United States. The OCC also will  deny any proposed business combination whose effect in any section of  the United States may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to  create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of  trade, unless the probable effects of the transaction in meeting the  convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh the  anticompetitive effects of the transaction. For purposes of weighing  against anticompetitive effects, a business combination may have  favorable effects in meeting the convenience and needs of the community  if the depository institution being acquired has limited long-term  prospects, or if the resulting national bank will provide significantly  improved, additional, or less costly services to the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. The OCC  considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of  the existing or proposed institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Convenience and needs of community. The OCC considers the  probable effects of the business combination on the convenience and  needs of the community served. The applicant shall describe these  effects in its application, including any planned office closings or  reductions in services following the business combination and the likely  impact on the community. The OCC also considers additional relevant  factors, including the resulting national bank's ability and plans to  provide expanded or less costly services to the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Community Reinvestment Act. When the OCC evaluates an  application for a business combination under the Community Reinvestment  Act, the OCC considers the performance of the applicant and the other  depository institutions involved in the business combination in helping  to meet the credit needs of the relevant communities, including low- and  moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking  practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Money laundering. The OCC considers the effectiveness of any  insured depository institution involved in the business combination in  combating money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition and retention of branches. An applicant shall  disclose the location of any branch it will acquire and retain in a  business combination. The OCC considers the acquisition and retention of  a branch under the standards set out in Sec. 5.30, but it does not  require a separate application under Sec. 5.30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsidiaries. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An applicant must identify any subsidiary to  be acquired in a business combination and state the activities of each  subsidiary. The OCC does not require a separate application under  Sec. 5.34 or a separate notice under Sec. 5.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant proposing to acquire, through a business  combination, a subsidiary of any entity other than a national bank must  provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities  that would be required if the applicant were establishing the subsidiary  pursuant to Secs. 5.34 or 5.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interim bank--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Application. An applicant for a business  combination that plans to use an interim bank to accomplish the  transaction shall file an application to organize an interim bank as  part of the application for the related business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditional approval. The OCC grants conditional approval to  form an   interim bank when it acknowledges receipt of the application for the  related business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Corporate status. An interim bank becomes a legal entity and  may enter into legally valid agreements when it has filed, and the OCC  has accepted, the interim bank's duly executed articles of association  and organization certificate. OCC acceptance occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On the date the OCC advises the interim bank that its articles  of association and organization certificate are acceptable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On the date the interim bank files articles of association and  an organization certificate that conform to the form for those documents  provided by the OCC in the Manual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other corporate procedures. An applicant should consult the  Manual to determine what other information is necessary to complete the  chartering of the interim bank as a national bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nonconforming assets. An applicant shall identify any  nonconforming activities and assets, including nonconforming  subsidiaries, of other institutions involved in the business  combination, that will not be disposed of or discontinued prior to  consummation of the transaction. The OCC generally requires a national  bank to divest or conform nonconforming assets, or discontinue  nonconforming activities, within a reasonable time following the  business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fiduciary powers. An applicant shall state whether the resulting  bank intends to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to Sec. 5.26(b) (1)  or (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Expiration of approval. Approval of a business combination, and  conditional approval to form an interim bank charter, if applicable,  expires if the business combination is not consummated within one year  after the date of OCC approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Adequacy of disclosure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An applicant shall inform  shareholders of all material aspects of a business combination and shall  comply with any applicable requirements of the Federal securities laws  and securities regulations of the OCC. Accordingly, an applicant shall  ensure that all proxy and information statements prepared in connection  with a business combination do not contain any untrue or misleading  statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary  in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank applicant with one or more classes of  securities subject to the registration provisions of section 12 (b) or  (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78l(b) or 78l(g),  shall file preliminary proxy material or information statements for  review with the Director, Securities and Corporate Practices Division,  OCC, Washington, DC 20219. Any other applicant shall submit the proxy  materials or information statements it uses in connection with the  combination to the appropriate district office no later than when the  materials are sent to the shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> National bank  applicant. Section 5.8 (a) through (c) does not apply to a national bank  applicant that is subject to specific statutory notice requirements for  a business combination. A national bank applicant shall follow, as  applicable, the public notice requirements contained in 12 U.S.C.  1828(c)(3) (business combinations), 12 U.S.C. 215(a) (consolidation  under a national bank charter), 12 U.S.C. 215a(a)(2) (merger under a  national bank charter), paragraph (g)(2) of this section (merger or  consolidation with a Federal savings association resulting in a national  bank), paragraph (g)(4) of this section (merger with a nonbank affiliate  under a national bank charter), and paragraph (g)(5) of this section  (merger with nonbank affiliate not under national bank charter).  Sections 5.10 and 5.11 do not apply to mergers of a national bank with  its nonbank affiliate. However, if the OCC concludes that an application  presents significant and novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the  OCC may determine that some or all provisions in Secs. 5.10 and 5.11  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim bank. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to an  application to organize an interim bank. However, if the OCC concludes  that an application presents significant and novel policy, supervisory,  or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of   Sec. Sec. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply. The OCC treats an application to  organize an interim bank as part of the related application to engage in  a business combination and does not require a separate public notice and  public comment process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Provisions governing consolidations and mergers with different  types of entities. (1) Consolidations and mergers under 12 U.S.C. 215 or  215a of a national bank with other national banks and State banks as  defined in 12 U.S.C. 215b</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> resulting in a national bank.A national  bank entering into a consolidation or merger authorized pursuant to 12  U.S.C. 215 or 215a, respectively, is subject to the approval procedures  and requirements with respect to treatment of dissenting shareholders  set forth in those provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consolidations and mergers with Federal savings associations  under 12 U.S.C. 215c resulting in a national bank. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the approval  of the OCC, any national bank and any Federal savings association may  consolidate or merge with a national bank as the resulting institution  by complying with the following procedures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A national bank entering into the consolidation or merger shall  follow the procedures of 12 U.S.C. 215 or 215a, respectively, as if the  Federal savings association were a state or national bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A Federal savings association entering into the consolidation or  merger also shall follow the procedures of 12 U.S.C. 215 or 215a,  respectively, as if the Federal savings association were a state bank or  national bank, except where the laws or regulations governing Federal  savings associations specifically provide otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The OCC may conduct an appraisal or reappraisal of dissenters'  shares of stock in a national bank involved in a consolidation with a  Federal savings association if all parties agree that the determination  is final and binding on each party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Consolidation or merger of a national bank resulting in a State  bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a) under 12 U.S.C. 214a or a Federal  savings association under 12 U.S.C. 215c--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Policy. Prior OCC approval  is not required for the merger or consolidation of a national bank with  a state bank or Federal savings association when the resulting  institution will be a state bank or Federal savings association.  Termination of a national bank's status as a national banking  association is automatic upon completion of the requirements of 12  U.S.C. 214a, in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 214b, in the case of a merger  or consolidation when the resulting institution is a state bank, or  paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section, in the case of a merger or  consolidation when the resulting institution is a Federal savings  association, and consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Procedures. A national bank desiring to merge or consolidate  with a state bank or a Federal savings association when the resulting  institution will be a state bank or Federal savings association shall  submit a notice to the appropriate district office advising of its  intention. The national bank shall submit this notice at the time the  application to merge or consolidate is filed with the responsible agency  under the Bank Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(c). The OCC then provides  instructions to the national bank for terminating its status as a  national bank, including requiring the bank to provide the appropriate  district office with the bank's charter (or a copy) in connection with  the consummation of the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special procedures for merger or consolidation into a Federal  savings association. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> With the exception of the procedures in  paragraph (g)(3)(iii)(B) of this section, a national bank entering into  a merger or consolidation with a Federal savings association when the  resulting institution will be a Federal savings association shall comply  with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 214a and 12 U.S.C. 214c as if the  Federal savings association were a state bank. However, for these  purposes the references in 12 U.S.C. 214c to ``law of the State in which  such national banking association is located'' and ``any State  authority'' mean ``laws and regulations governing Federal savings  associations''   and ``Office of Thrift Supervision,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> National bank shareholders who dissent from a plan to merge or  consolidate may receive in cash the value of their national bank shares  if they comply with the requirements of 12 U.S.C. 214a as if the Federal  savings association were a state bank. The OCC conducts an appraisal or  reappraisal of the value of the national bank shares held by dissenting  shareholders only if all parties agree that the determination will be  final and binding. The parties shall also agree on how the total  expenses of the OCC in making the appraisal will be divided among the  parties and paid to the OCC. The plan of merger or consolidation must  provide, consistent with the requirements of the Office of Thrift  Supervision, the manner of disposing of the shares of the resulting  Federal savings association not taken by the dissenting shareholders of  the national bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Mergers of a national bank with its nonbank affiliates under 12  U.S.C. 215a-3 resulting in a national bank. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With the approval of the  OCC, a national bank may merge with one or more of its nonbank  affiliates, with the national bank as the resulting institution, in  accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, provided that the law  of the state or other jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is  organized allows the nonbank affiliate to engage in such mergers. The  transaction is also subject to approval by the FDIC under the Bank  Merger Act, 12 U.S.C. 1828(c). In determining whether to approve the  merger, the OCC shall consider the purpose of the transaction, its  impact on the safety and soundness of the bank, and any effect on the  bank's customers, and may deny the merger if it would have a negative  effect in any such respect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank entering into the merger shall follow the  procedures of 12 U.S.C. 215a as if the nonbank affiliate were a state  bank, except as otherwise provided herein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonbank affiliate entering into the merger shall follow the  procedures for such mergers set out in the law of the state or other  jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The rights of dissenting shareholders and appraisal of  dissenters' shares of stock in the nonbank affiliate entering into the  merger shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the law of the  state or other jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is  organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The corporate existence of each institution participating in the  merger shall be continued in the resulting national bank, and all the  rights, franchises, property, appointments, liabilities, and other  interests of the participating institutions shall be transferred to the  resulting national bank, as set forth in 12 U.S.C. 215a(a), (e), and (f)  in the same manner and to the same extent as in a merger between a  national bank and a state bank under 12 U.S.C. 215a(a), as if the  nonbank affiliate were a state bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Mergers of an uninsured national bank with its nonbank  affiliates under 12 U.S.C. 215a-3 resulting in a nonbank affiliate. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  With the approval of the OCC, a national bank that is not an insured  bank as defined in 12 U.S.C. 1813(h) may merge with one or more of its  nonbank affiliates, with the nonbank affiliate as the resulting entity,  in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph, provided that the  law of the state or other jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate  is organized allows the nonbank affiliate to engage in such mergers. In  determining whether to approve the merger, the OCC shall consider the  purpose of the transaction, its impact on the safety and soundness of  the bank, and any effect on the bank's customers, and may deny the  merger if it would have a negative effect in any such respect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank entering into the merger shall follow the  procedures of 12 U.S.C. 214a, as if the nonbank affiliate were a state  bank, except as otherwise provided in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A nonbank affiliate entering into the merger shall follow the  procedures for such mergers set out in the law of the state or other  jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> National bank shareholders who dissent from an approved  plan to merge may receive in cash the value of   their national bank shares if they comply with the requirements of 12  U.S.C. 214a as if the nonbank affiliate were a state bank. The OCC may  conduct an appraisal or reappraisal of dissenters' shares of stock in a  national bank involved in the merger if all parties agree that the  determination is final and binding on each party and agree on how the  total expenses of the OCC in making the appraisal will be divided among  the parties and paid to the OCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rights of dissenting shareholders and appraisal of  dissenters' shares of stock in the nonbank affiliate involved in the  merger shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the law of the  state or other jurisdiction under which the nonbank affiliate is  organized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The corporate existence of each entity participating in the  merger shall be continued in the resulting nonbank affiliate, and all  the rights, franchises, property, appointments, liabilities, and other  interests of the participating national bank shall be transferred to the  resulting nonbank affiliate as set forth in 12 U.S.C. 214b, in the same  manner and to the same extent as in a merger between a national bank and  a state bank under 12 U.S.C. 214a, as if the nonbank affiliate were a  state bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Interstate combinations under 12 U.S.C. 1831u. A business  combination between insured banks with different home States under the  authority of 12 U.S.C. 1831u must satisfy the standards and requirements  and comply with the procedures of 12 U.S.C. 1831u and either 12 U.S.C.  215, 215a, and 215a-1, as applicable, if the resulting bank is a  national bank, or 12 U.S.C. 214a, 214b, and 214c if the resulting bank  is a State bank. For purposes of 12 U.S.C. 1831u, the acquisition of a  branch without the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets  of a bank is treated as the acquisition of a bank whose home State is  the State in which the branch is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Expedited review for business reorganizations and streamlined  applications. A filing that qualifies as a business reorganization as  defined in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, or a filing that qualifies  as a streamlined application as described in paragraph (j) of this  section, is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 45th day after the  application is received by the OCC, or the 15th day after the close of  the comment period, whichever is later, unless the OCC notifies the  applicant that the filing is not eligible for expedited review, or the  expedited review process is extended, under Sec. 5.13(a)(2). An  application under this paragraph must contain all necessary information  for the OCC to determine if it qualifies as a business reorganization or  streamlined application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Streamlined applications. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An applicant may qualify for a  streamlined business combination application in the following  situations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At least one party to the transaction is an eligible bank, and  all other parties to the transaction are eligible banks or eligible  depository institutions, the resulting national bank will be well  capitalized immediately following consummation of the transaction, and  the total assets of the target institution are no more than 50 percent  of the total assets of the acquiring bank, as reported in each  institution's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the  quarter immediately preceding the filing of the application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The acquiring bank is an eligible bank, the target bank is not  an eligible bank or an eligible depository institution, the resulting  national bank will be well capitalized immediately following  consummation of the transaction, and the applicants in a prefiling  communication request and obtain approval from the appropriate district  office to use the streamlined application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The acquiring bank is an eligible bank, the target bank is not  an eligible bank or an eligible depository institution, the resulting  bank will be well capitalized immediately following consummation of the  transaction, and the total assets acquired do not exceed 10 percent of  the total assets of the acquiring national bank, as reported in each  institution's Consolidated Report of Condition and Income filed for the  quarter immediately preceding the filing of the application; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transaction under paragraph (g)(4) of this  section, the acquiring bank is an eligible bank, the   resulting national bank will be well capitalized immediately following  consummation of the transaction, the applicants in a prefiling  communication request and obtain approval from the appropriate district  office to use the streamlined application, and the total assets acquired  do not exceed 10 percent of the total assets of the acquiring national  bank, as reported in the bank's Consolidated Report of Condition and  Income filed for the quarter immediately preceding the filing of the  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a business combination qualifies for a streamlined  application, the applicant should consult the Manual to determine the  abbreviated application information required by the OCC. The OCC  encourages prefiling communications between the applicants and the  appropriate district office before filing under paragraph (j) of this  section.
