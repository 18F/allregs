main office of the national bank is located and, with respect to a state bank, the state by which the bank is chartered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Interim national bank or interim Federal savings association means a national bank or Federal savings association that does not operate independently but exists solely as a vehicle to accomplish a business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Nonbank affiliate of a national bank means any company (other than a bank or Federal savings association) that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the national bank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Other combination means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any merger or consolidation between a national bank or a Federal savings association and one or more depository institutions or state trust companies, in which the resulting institution is not a national bank or Federal savings association;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a Federal stock savings association, any merger or consolidation with a credit union in which the resulting institution is a credit union;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The transfer by a national bank or a Federal savings association of any deposit liabilities to another insured depository institution, a credit union or any other institution; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The acquisition by a national bank or a Federal savings association of all, or substantially all, of the assets, or the assumption of all or substantially all of the liabilities, of any company other than a depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Savings association and state savings association have the meaning set forth in section 3(b)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> State trust company means a trust company organized under state law that is not engaged in the business of receiving deposits, other than trust funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Policy--(1) Factors--(i) In general. When the OCC evaluates any application for a business combination, the OCC considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The capital level of any resulting national bank or Federal savings association</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The conformity of the transaction to applicable law, regulation, and supervisory policies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The purpose of the transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The impact of the transaction on safety and soundness of the national bank or Federal savings association; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The effect of the transaction on the national bank's or Federal savings association's shareholders (or members in the case of a mutual savings association), depositors, other creditors, and customers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bank Merger Act. When the OCC evaluates an application for a business combination under the Bank Merger Act, the OCC also considers the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Competition. (1) The OCC considers the effect of a proposed business combination on competition. The applicant shall provide a competitive analysis of the transaction, including a definition of the relevant geographic market or markets. An applicant may refer to the Comptroller's Licensing Manual for procedures to expedite its competitive analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The OCC will deny an application for a business combination if the combination would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any part of the United States. The OCC also will deny any proposed business combination whose effect in any section of the United States may be substantially to lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, or which in any other manner would be in restraint of trade, unless the probable effects of the transaction in meeting the convenience and needs of the community clearly outweigh the anticompetitive effects of the transaction. For purposes of weighing against anticompetitive effects, a business combination may have favorable effects in meeting the convenience and needs of the community if the depository institution being acquired has limited long-term prospects, or if the resulting national bank or Federal savings association will provide significantly improved, additional, or less costly services to the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Financial and managerial resources and future prospects. The OCC considers the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the existing or proposed institutions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Convenience and needs of community. The OCC considers the probable effects of the business combination on the convenience and needs of the community served. The applicant shall describe these effects in its application, including any planned office closings or reductions in services following the business combination and the likely impact on the community. The OCC also considers additional relevant factors, including the resulting national bank's or Federal savings association's ability and plans to provide expanded or less costly services to the community.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Money laundering. The OCC considers the effectiveness of any insured depository institution involved in the business combination in combating money laundering activities, including in overseas branches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Financial stability. The OCC considers the risk to the stability of the United States banking and financial system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Deposit concentration limit. The OCC will not approve a transaction that would violate the deposit concentration limit in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(13) for certain interstate merger transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Community Reinvestment Act. When the OCC evaluates an application for a business combination under the Community Reinvestment Act, the OCC also considers the performance of the applicant and the other depository institutions involved in the business combination in helping to meet the credit needs of the relevant communities, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with safe and sound banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Acquisition and retention of branches. An applicant shall disclose the location of any branch it will acquire and retain in a business combination, including approved but unopened branches. The OCC considers the acquisition and retention of a branch under the standards set out in Sec. 5.30 or Sec. 5.31, as applicable, but it does not require a separate application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsidiaries. (i) An applicant must identify any subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment to be acquired in a business combination and state the activities of each subsidiary or other company in which the applicant would be acquiring an investment. The OCC does not require a separate application or notice under Sec. Sec. 5.34, 5.35, 5.36, 5.38, 5.39, 5.58, and 5.59.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An national bank applicant proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, financial subsidiary investment, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a national bank must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the applicant were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to Sec. 5.34, Sec. 5.35, Sec. 5.36, or Sec. 5.39.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A Federal savings association applicant proposing to acquire, through a business combination, a subsidiary, bank service company investment, service corporation investment, or other equity investment of any entity other than a Federal savings association must provide the same information and analysis of the subsidiary's activities, or of the investment, that would be required if the applicant were establishing the subsidiary, or making such investment, pursuant to Sec. 5.35, Sec. 5.38, Sec. 5.58, or Sec. 5.59.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interim national bank or interim Federal savings association--(i) Application. An applicant for a business combination that plans to use an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association to accomplish the transaction shall file an application to organize an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association as part of the application for the related business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conditional approval. The OCC grants conditional preliminary approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association when it acknowledges receipt of the application for the related business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Corporate status. An interim national bank or interim Federal savings association becomes a legal entity and may enter into legally valid agreements when it has filed, and the OCC has accepted, the interim national bank's duly executed articles of association and organization certificate or the Federal savings association's charter and bylaws. OCC acceptance occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> On the date the OCC advises the interim national bank that its articles of association and organization certificate are acceptable or advises the interim Federal savings association that its charter and bylaws are acceptable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> On the date the interim national bank files articles of association and an organization certificate that conform to the form for those documents provided by the OCC in the Comptroller's Licensing Manual or the date the interim Federal savings association files a charter and bylaws that conform to the requirements set out in this part 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other corporate procedures. An applicant should consult the Comptroller's Licensing Manual to determine what other information is necessary to complete the chartering of the interim national bank as a national bank or the interim Federal savings association as a Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nonconforming assets. (i) An applicant shall identify any nonconforming activities and assets, including nonconforming subsidiaries, of other institutions involved in the business combination that will not be disposed of or discontinued prior to consummation of the transaction. The OCC generally requires a national bank or Federal savings association to divest or conform nonconforming assets, or discontinue nonconforming activities, within a reasonable time following the business combination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any resulting Federal savings association shall conform to the requirements of sections 5(c) and 10(m) of the Home Owners' Loan Act (12 U.S.C. 1464(c) and 1467a(m)) within the time period prescribed by the OCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Fiduciary powers. (i) An applicant shall state whether the resulting national bank or Federal savings association intends to exercise fiduciary powers pursuant to Sec. 5.26(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an applicant intends to exercise fiduciary powers after the combination and requires OCC approval for such powers, the applicant must include the information required under Sec. 5.26(e)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Expiration of approval. Approval of a business combination, and conditional approval to form an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association, if applicable, expires if the business combination is not consummated within six months after the date of OCC approval, unless the OCC grants an extension of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Adequacy of disclosure. (i) An applicant shall inform shareholders of all material aspects of a business combination and shall comply with any applicable requirements of the Federal securities laws and securities regulations of the OCC. Accordingly, an applicant shall ensure that all proxy and information statements prepared in connection with a business combination do not contain any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact, or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A national bank or Federal savings association applicant with one or more classes of securities subject to the registration provisions of section 12(b) or (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78 l (b) or 78 l (g), shall file preliminary proxy material or information statements for review with the Director, Securities and Corporate Practices Division, OCC, Washington, DC 20219. Any other applicant shall submit the proxy materials or information statements it uses in connection with the combination to the appropriate OCC licensing office no later than when the materials are sent to the shareholders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability--(1) National bank or Federal savings association applicant--(i) In general. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the

OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that some or all provisions in Sec. Sec. 5.8, 5.10 and 5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Statutory notice. If an application is subject to the Bank Merger Act or to another statute that requires notice to the public, a national bank or Federal savings association applicant shall follow the public notice requirements contained in 12 U.S.C. 1828(c)(3) or the other statute and sections 5.8(b) through 5.8(e), 5.10, and 5.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interim national bank or interim Federal savings association. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to an application to organize an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant or novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of Sec. Sec. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply. The OCC treats an application to organize an interim national bank or interim Federal savings association as part of the related application to engage in a business combination and does not require a separate public notice and public comment process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State bank, or state savings association, state trust company, or credit union as resulting institution. Sections 5.7 through 5.13 do not apply to transactions covered by paragraphs (g)(6) or (g)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Provisions governing consolidations and mergers with different types of entities--(1) Consolidations and mergers under 12 U.S.C. 215 or 215a of a national bank with other national banks and state banks as defined in 12 U.S.C. 215b(1) resulting in a national bank.

However, for these purposes the references in 12 U.S.C. 214c to ``law of the State in which such national banking association is located'' and ``any State authority'' mean ``laws and regulations governing Federal savings associations'' and ``Office of the Comptroller of the Currency'' respectively.
