                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part applies to any program for which Federal financial  assistance is authorized under a law administered by the Department,  including programs and activities that are federally-assisted under the  laws listed in appendix A to this subpart. It applies to money paid,  property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance extended  after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an application  approved prior to such effective date. This part does not apply to (1)  any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or guaranty  contracts, (2) money paid, property transferred, or   other assistance extended before the effective date of this part, (3)  any assistance to any individual who is the ultimate beneficiary, or (4)  except to the extent described in Sec. 17.3, any employment practice,  under any such program, of any employer, employment agency, or labor  organization. The fact that a statute under which Federal financial  assistance is extended to a program or activity is not listed in  appendix A to subpart A shall not mean, if title VI is otherwise  applicable, that such program or activity is not covered. Other statutes  now in force or hereafter enacted may be added to this list by notice  published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any program receiving Federal financial assistance in the  form, or for the acquisition, of real property or an interest in real  property, to the extent that rights to space on, over, or under any such  property are included as part of the program receiving that assistance,  the nondiscrimination requirement of that part shall extend to any  facility located wholly or in part of the space.
