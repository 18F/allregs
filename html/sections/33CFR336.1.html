                                Sec. 336.1  Discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicable laws. Section 404 of the CWA governs the discharge of  dredged or fill material into waters of the U.S. Although the Corps does  not process and issue permits for its own activities, the Corps  authorizes its own discharges of dredged or fill material by applying  all applicable substantive legal requirements, including public notice,  opportunity for public hearing, and application of the section 404(b)(1)  guidelines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CWA requires the Corps to seek state water quality  certification for discharges of dredged or fill material into waters of  the U.S.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 307 of the Coastal Zone Management Act (CZMA) requires  that certain activities that a Federal agency conducts or supports be  consistent with the Federally-approved state management plan to the  maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures. If changes in a previously approved disposal plan  for a Corps navigation project warrant re-evaluation under the CWA, the  following procedures should be followed by district enginers prior to  discharging dredged material into waters of the U.S. except where  emergency action as described in Sec. 337.7 of this chapter is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A public notice providing opportunity for a public hearing  should be issued at the earliest practicable time. The public  notification procedures of Sec. 337.1 of this chapter should be  followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The public hearing procedures of 33 CFR part 327 should be  followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As soon as practicable, the district engineer will request from  the state a 401 water quality certification and, if applicable, provide  a coastal zone consistency determination for the Corps activity using  the procedures of Sec. 336.1(b) (8) and (9), respectively, of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Discharges of dredged material will be evaluated using the  guidelines authorized under section 404(b)(1) of the CWA, or using the  ODA regulations, where appropriate. If the guidelines alone would  prohibit the designation of a proposed discharge site, the economic  impact on navigation and anchorage of the failure to use the proposed  discharge site will also be considered in evaluating whether the  proposed discharge is to be authorized under CWA section 404(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The EPA Administrator can prohibit or restrict the use of any  defined area as a discharge site under 404(c) whenever he determines,  after notice and opportunity for public hearing and after consultation  with the Secretary of the Army, that the discharge of such materials  into such areas will have an unacceptable adverse effect on municipal  water supplies, shellfish beds and fishery areas, wildlife, or  recreation areas. Upon notification of the prohibition of a discharge  site by the Administrator the district engineer will complete the  administrative processing of the proposed project up to the point of  signing the Statement of Findings (SOF) or Record of Decision (ROD). The  unsigned SOF or ROD along with a report described in Sec. 337.8 of this  chapter will be forwarded through the appropriate Division office to the  Dredging Division, Office of the Chief of Engineers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In accordance with the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),  and the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (40 CFR  parts 1500-1508), an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) or  Environmental Assessment (EA) will be prepared for all Corps of  Engineers projects involving the discharge of dredged or fill material,  unless such projects are included within a categorical exclusion found  at 33 CFR part 230 or addressed within an existing EA or EIS. If a  proposed maintenance activity will result in a deviation in the  operation and maintenance plan as described in the EA or EIS, the  district engineer will determine the need to prepare a new EA, EIS, or  supplement. If a new EA, EIS, or supplement is required, the procedures  of 33 CFR part 230 will be followed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If it can be anticipated that related work by other Federal or  non-Federal interests will occur in the same area as Corps projects, the  district engineer should use all reasonable means to include it in the  planning, processing, and review of Corps projects. Related work  normally includes, but is not necessarily limited to, maintenance  dredging of approach channels and berthing areas connected to Federal  navigation channels. The district engineer should coordinate the related  work with interested Federal, state, regional, and local agencies and  the general public at the same time he does so for the Corps project.  The district engineer should ensure that related work meets all  substantive and procedural requirements of 33 CFR parts 320 through 330.  Documents covering Corps maintenance activities normally should also  include an appropriate discussion of ancillary maintenance work.  District engineers should assist local interests to obtain from the  state any necessary section 401 water quality certification and, if  required, the section 307 coastal zone consistency concurrence. The  absence of such certification or concurrence by the state or the denial  of a Corps permit for related work shall not be cause for delay of the  Federal project. Local sponsors will be responsible for funding any  related work. If permitting of the related work complies with all legal  requirements and is not contrary to the public interest, section 10,  404, and 103 permits normally will be issued by the district engineer in  a separate SOF or ROD. Authorization by nationwide or regional general  permit may be appropriate. If the related work does not receive a  necessary state water quality certification and/or CZMA consistency  concurrence, or are determined to be contrary to the public interest the  district engineer should re-examine the project viability to ensure that  continued maintenance is warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> State water quality certification: Section 401 of the CWA  requires the Corps to seek state water quality certification for dredged  material disposal into waters of the U.S. The state certification  request must be processed to a conclusion by the state within a  reasonable period of time. Otherwise, the certification requirements of  section 401 are deemed waived. The district engineer will request water  quality certification from the state at the earliest practicable time  using the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In addition to the Corps section 404 public notice, information  and data demonstrating compliance with state water quality standards  will be provided to the state water quality certifying agency along with  the request for   water quality certification. The information and data may be included  within the 404(b)(1) evaluation. The district engineer will request  water quality certification to be consistent with the maintenance  dredging schedule for the project. Submission of the public notice,  including information and data demonstrating compliance with the state  water quality standards, will constitute a valid water quality  certification request pursuant to section 401 of the CWA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the proposed disposal activity may violate state water  quality standards, after consideration of disposal site dilution and  dispersion, the district engineer will work with the state to acquire  data to satisfy compliance with the state water quality standards. The  district engineer will use the technical manual ``Management Strategy  for Disposal of Dredged Material: Contaminant Testing and Controls'' or  its appropriate updated version as a guide for developing the  appropriate tests to be conducted on such dredged material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the state does not take final action on a request for water  quality certification within two months from the date of the initial  request, the district engineer will notify the state of his intention to  presume a waiver as provided by section 401 of the CWA. If the state  agency, within the two-month period, requests an extension of time, the  district engineer may approve one 30-day extension unless, in his  opinion, the magnitude and complexity of the information contained in  the request warrants a longer or additional extension period. The total  period of time in which the state must act should not exceed six months  from the date of the initial request. Waiver of water quality  certification can be conclusively presumed after six months from the  date of the initial request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The procedures of Sec. 337.2 will be followed if the district  engineer determines that the state data acquisition requirements exceed  those necessary in establishment of the Federal standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)(iv)</em> to take  final action on Federal consistency determinations; otherwise state  concurrence can be presumed. The district engineer will provide the  state a consistency determination at the earliest practicable time using  the following procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Corps section 404 public notice and any additional  information that the district engineer determines to be appropriate will  be provided the state coastal zone management agency along with the  consistency determination. The consistency determination will consider  the maintenance dredging schedule for the project. Submission of the  public notice and, as appropriate, any additional information as  determined by the district engineer will constitute a valid coastal zone  consistency determination pursuant to section 307 of the CZMA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the district engineer decides that a consistency  determination is not required for a Corps activity, he may provide the  state agency a written determination that the CZMA does not apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The district engineer may provide the state agency a general  consistency determination for routine or repetitive activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the state fails to provide a response within 45 days from  receipt of the initial consistency determination, the district engineer  will presume state agency concurrence. If the state agency, within the  45-day period, requests an extension of time, the district engineer will  approve one 15-day extension unless, in his opinion, the magnitude and  complexity of the information contained in the consistency determination  warrants a longer or additional extension period. The longer or  additional extension period shall not exceed six months from the date of  the initial consistency determination.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the district engineer determines that the state  recommendations to achieve consistency to the maximum degree practicable  exceed either his authority or funding for a proposed dredging or  disposal activity, he will so notify the state coastal zone management  agency indicating that the Corps   has complied to the maximum extent practicable with the state's coastal  zone management program. If the district engineer determines that state  recommendations to achieve consistency to the maximum degree practicable  do not exceed his authority or funding but, nonetheless, are excessive,  he will follow the procedures of Sec. 337.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Evaluation factors. The following factors will be used, as  appropriate, to evaluate the discharge of dredged material into waters  of the U.S. Other relevant factors may also be evaluated, as needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> guidelines or ocean disposal  criteria, will be designated the Federal standard for the proposed  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Water quality. The 404(b)(1) guidelines at 40 CFR part 230 and  ocean dumping criteria at 40 CFR part 220 implement the environmental  protection provisions of the CWA and ODA, respectively. These guidelines  and criteria provide general regulatory guidance and objectives, but not  a specific technical framework for evaluating or managing contaminated  sediment that must be dredged. Through the section 404(b)(1) evaluation  process (or ocean disposal criteria for the territorial sea), the  district engineer will evaluate the water quality impacts of the  proposed project. The evaluation will include consideration of state  water quality standards. If the district engineer determines the dredged  material to be contaminated, he will follow the guidance provided in the  most current published version of the technical manual for contaminant  testing and controls. This manual is currently cited as: Francingues,  N.R., Jr., et al. 1985. ``Management Strategy for Disposal of Dredged  Material: Contaminant Testing and Controls,'' Miscellaneous Paper D-85- 1, U.S. Army Waterways Experiment Station, Vicksburg, Mississippi. The  procedures of Sec. 336.1(b)(8) will be followed for state water quality  certification requests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coastal zone consistency. As appropriate, the district engineer  will determine whether the proposed project is consistent with the state  coastal zone management program to the maximum extent practicable. The  procedures of Sec. 336.1(b)(9) will be followed for coastal zone  consistency determinations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wetlands. Most wetland areas constitute a productive and  valuable public resource, the unnecessary alteration or destruction of  which should be discouraged as contrary to the public interest. The  district engineer will, therefore, follow the guidance in 33 CFR  320.4(b) and EO 11990, dated May 24, 1977, when evaluating Corps  operations and maintenance activities in wetlands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Endangered species. All Corps operations and maintenance  activities will be reviewed for the potential impact on threatened or  endangered species, pursuant to the Endangered Species Act of 1973. If  the district engineer determines that the proposed activity will not  affect listed species or their critical habitat, a statement to this  effect should be included in the public notice. If the proposed activity  may affect listed species or their critical habitat, appropriate  discussions will be initiated with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or  National Marine Fisheries Service, and a statement to this effect should  be included in the public notice. (See 50 CFR part 402).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Historic resources. Archeological, historical, or architectural  resource surveys may be required to locate and identify previously  unrecorded historic properties in navigation channels and   at dredged or fill material disposal sites. If properties that may be  historic are known or found to exist within the navigation channel or  proposed disposal area, field testing and analysis may sometimes be  necessary in order to evaluate the properties against the criteria of  the National Register of Historic Places. Such testing should be limited  to the amount and kind needed to determine eligibility for the National  Register; more detailed and extensive work on a property may be  prescribed later, as the outcome of review under section 106 of the  National Historic Preservation Act. Historic properties are not normally  found in previously constructed navigation channels or previously used  disposal areas. Therefore, surveys to identify historic properties  should not be conducted for maintenance dredging and disposal activities  proposed within the boundaries of previously constructed navigation  channels or previously used disposal areas unless there is good reason  to believe that historic properties exist there.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The district engineer will establish whether historic properties  located in navigation channels or at disposal sites are eligible for  inclusion in the National Register of Historic Places in accordance with  applicable regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation  and the Department of the Interior.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The district engineer will take into account the effects of any  proposed actions on properties included in or eligible for inclusion in  the National Register of Historic Places, and will request the comments  of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation, in accordance with  applicable regulations of the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Scenic and recreational values. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance dredging and  disposal activities may involve areas which possess recognized scenic,  recreational, or similar values. Full evaluation requires that due  consideration be given to the effect which dredging and disposal of the  dredged or fill material may have on the enhancement, preservation, or  development of such values. Recognition of these values is often  reflected by state, regional, or local land use classification or by  similar Federal controls or policies. Operations and maintenance  activities should, insofar as possible, be consistent with and avoid  adverse effects on the values or purposes for which such resources have  been recognized or set aside, and for which those classifications,  controls, or policies were established. Special consideration must be  given to rivers named in section 3 of the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and  those proposed for inclusion as provided by section 4 and 5 of the Act,  or by later legislation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other areas named in Acts of Congress or Presidential  Proclamations, such as National Rivers, National Wilderness Areas,  National Seashores, National Parks, and National Monuments, should be  given full consideration when evaluating Corps operations and  maintenance activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Fish and wildlife. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In those cases where the Fish and  Wildlife Coordination Act (FWCA) applies, district engineers will  consult, through the public notification process, with the Regional  Directors of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine  Fisheries Service and the head of the agency responsible for fish and  wildlife for the state in which the work is to be performed, with a view  to the conservation of fish and wildlife resources by considering ways  to prevent their direct and indirect loss and damage due to the proposed  operation and maintenance activity. The district engineer will give full  consideration to these views on fish and wildlife conservation in  evaluating the activity. The proposed operations may be modified in  order to lessen the damage to such resources. The district engineer  should include such justifiable means and measures for fish and wildlife  resources that are found to be appropriate. Corps funding of Fish and  Wildlife Service activities under the Transfer of Funds Agreement  between the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Corps is not applicable  for Corps operation and maintenance projects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> District engineers should consider ways of reducing unavoidable  adverse environmental impacts of dredging and disposal activities. The  determination as to the extent of implementation of   such measures will be done by the district engineer after weighing the  benefits and detriments of the maintenance work and considering  applicable environmental laws, regulations, and other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Marine sanctuaries. Operations and maintenance activities  involving the discharge of dredged or fill material in a marine  sanctuary established by the Secretary of Commerce under authority of  section 302 of the ODA should be evaluated for the impact on the marine  sanctuary. In such a case, certification should be obtained from the  Secretary of Commerce that the proposed project is consistent with the  purposes of Title III of the ODA and can be carried out within the  regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Commerce to control  activities within the marine sanctuary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Other state requirements. District engineers will make all  reasonable efforts to comply with state water quality standards and  Federally approved coastal zone programs using the procedures of  Secs. 336.1(b) (8), (9), and 337.2. District engineers should not seek  state permits or licenses unless authorized to do so by a clear,  explicit, and unambiguous Congressional waiver of Federal sovereign  immunity, giving the state authority to impose that requirement on  Federal activities (e.g., CWA sections 401 and 404(t), and CZMA section  307 (c)(1) and (c)(2)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Additional factors. In addition to the factors described in  paragraphs (c)(1) through (9) of this section, the following factors  should also be considered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The evaluation of Corps operations and maintenance activities  involving the discharge of dredged or fill material into waters of the  U.S. is a continuing process and should proceed concurrently with the  processing of state water quality certification and, if required, the  provision of a coastal zone consistency determination to the state. If a  local agency having jurisdiction over or concern with the particular  activity comments on the project through the public notice coordination,  due consideration should be given to those official views as a  reflection of local factors.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where officially adopted state, regional, or local land use  classifications, determinations, or policies are applicable, they  normally will be presumed to reflect local views and will be considered  in addition to other national factors.</p>
