HHS considers the following circumstances to be aggravating circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The frequency of violation indicates a pattern of widespread occurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The violation(s) resulted in significant financial and other impacts on the average affected individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The entity does not provide documentation showing that substantially all of the violations were corrected.</p>
