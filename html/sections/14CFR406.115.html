                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Service required. A person must serve on each other party at the  time of filing a copy of any document filed with the Federal Docket  Management System. Service on a party's attorney or representative of  record is adequate service on the party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method of service. A person must serve documents by personal  delivery or by mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certificate of service. A person may attach a certificate of  service to a document filed with the FDMS. Any certificate of service  must include a statement, dated and signed by the individual filing the  document, that the document was served on each party, the method of  service, and the date of service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Date of service. The date of service is the date of personal  delivery; or if   mailed, the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, the date  shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, or other  mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of  service or postmark. The date shown in the FDMS index is not necessarily  the date of service. It is the date the FDMS received the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional time after service by mail. Whenever a party has a  right or a duty to act or to make any response within a prescribed  period after service by mail, or on a specified date after service by  mail, 5 days is added to the prescribed period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Service by the administrative law judge. The administrative law  judge must serve a copy of each document including, but not limited to,  notices of pre-hearing conferences and hearings, rulings on motions,  decisions, and orders, upon each party to the proceedings by personal  delivery or by mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Service made. A document is deemed served in accordance with  this subpart if it was properly addressed; was sent in accordance with  this subpart; and was returned, not claimed, or refused. Service is  considered valid as of the date and the time that the document was  mailed, or personal delivery of the document was refused.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Presumption of service. There is a presumption of service where  a party or a person, who customarily receives mail, or receives it in  the ordinary course of business, at either the person's residence or the  person's principal place of business, acknowledges receipt of the  document.
