                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Methods and limitations. In conformity with these  rules, any party may, without leave of the Commission or Judge, obtain  discovery by one or more of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Production of documents or things or permission to enter upon  land or other property for inspection and other purposes (Sec. 2200.53);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Requests for admission to the extent provided in Sec. 2200.54;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Interrogatories to the extent provided in Sec. 2200.55.  Discovery is not available under these rules through depositions except  to the extent provided in Sec. 2200.56. In the absence of a specific  provision, procedure shall be in accordance with the Federal Rules of  Civil Procedure, except that the provisions of Federal Rule of Civil  Procedure 26(a) do not apply to Commission proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time for discovery. A party may initiate all forms of discovery  in conformity with these Rules at any time after the filing of the first  responsive pleading or motion that delays the filing of an answer, such  as a motion to dismiss. Discovery shall be initiated early enough to  permit completion of discovery no later than 7 days prior to the date  set for hearing, unless the Judge orders otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service of discovery papers. Every paper relating to discovery  required to be served on a party shall be served on all parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of discovery. The information or response sought through  discovery may concern any matter that is not privileged and that is  relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending case. It is not  ground for objection that the information or response sought will be  inadmissible at the hearing, if the information or response appears  reasonably calculated to lead to discovery of admissible evidence,  regardless of which party has the burden of proof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. The frequency or extent of the discovery methods  provided by these rules may be limited by the Commission or Judge if it  is determined that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or duplicative,  or is obtainable from some other source that is more convenient, less  burdensome, or less expensive;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The party seeking discovery has had ample opportunity to obtain  the information sought by discovery in the action; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The discovery is unduly burdensome or expensive, taking into  account the needs of the case, limitations on the parties' resources,  and the importance of the issues in litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Privilege--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claims of privilege. The initial claim of  privilege shall specify the privilege claimed and the general nature of  the material for which the privilege is claimed. In response to an order  from the Judge or the Commission, or in response to a motion to compel,  the claim shall: Identify the information that would be disclosed; set  forth the privilege that is claimed; and allege the facts showing that  the information is privileged. The claim shall be supported by  affidavits, depositions, or testimony and shall specify the relief  sought. The claim may be accompanied by a motion for a protective order  or by a motion that the allegedly privileged information be received and  the claim ruled upon in camera, that is, with the record and   hearing room closed to the public, or ex parte, that is, without the  participation of parties and their representatives. The Judge may enter  an order and impose terms and conditions on his or her examination of  the claim as justice may require, including an order designed to ensure  that the allegedly privileged information not be disclosed until after  the examination is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upholding or rejecting claims of privilege. If the Judge upholds  the claim of privilege, the Judge may order and impose terms and  conditions as justice may require, including a protective order. If the  Judge overrules the claim, the person claiming the privilege may obtain  as of right an order sealing from the public those portions of the  record containing the allegedly privileged information pending  interlocutory or final review of the ruling, or final disposition of the  case, by the Commission. Interlocutory review of such an order shall be  given priority consideration by the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Protective orders. In connection with any discovery procedures  and where a showing of good cause has been made, the Commission or Judge  may make any order including, but not limited to, one or more of the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the discovery not be had;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the discovery may be had only on specified terms and  conditions, including a designation of the time or place;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery  other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of  the discovery be limited to certain matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> That discovery be conducted with no one present except persons  designated by the Commission or Judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> That a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of  the Commission or Judge;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> That a trade secret or other confidential research, development,  or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a  designated way;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> That the parties simultaneously file specified documents or  information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the  Commission or Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to cooperate; Sanctions. A party may apply for an order  compelling discovery when another party refuses or obstructs discovery.  For purposes of this paragraph, an evasive or incomplete answer is to be  treated as a failure to answer. If a Judge enters an order compelling  discovery and there is a failure to comply with that order, the Judge  may make such orders with regard to the failure as are just. The orders  may issue upon the initiative of a Judge, after affording an opportunity  to show cause why the order should not be entered, or upon the motion of  a party. The orders may include any sanction stated in Federal Rule of  Civil Procedure 37, including the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An order that designated facts shall be taken to be established  for purposes of the case in accordance with the claim of the party  obtaining that order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An order refusing to permit the disobedient party to support or  to oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting it from  introducing designated matters in evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An order striking out pleadings or parts thereof, or staying  further proceedings until the order is obeyed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An order dismissing the action or proceeding or any part  thereof, or rendering a judgment by default against the disobedient  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unreasonable delays. None of the discovery procedures set forth  in these rules shall be used in a manner or at a time which shall delay  or impede the progress of the case toward hearing status or the hearing  of the case on the date for which it is scheduled, unless, in the  interests of justice, the Judge shall order otherwise. Unreasonable  delays in utilizing discovery procedures may result in termination of  the party's right to conduct discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Show cause orders. All show cause orders issued by the  Commission or Judge under paragraph (f) of this section shall be served  upon the affected party by certified mail, return receipt requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Supplementation of responses. A party who has responded to a  request for discovery with a response that was   complete when made is under no duty to supplement the response to  include information thereafter acquired, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A party is under a duty seasonably to supplement the response  with respect to any question directly addressed to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity and location of persons having knowledge of  discoverable matters; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identity of each person expected to be called as an expert  witness at the hearing, the subject matter on which the person is  expected to testify, and the substance of the person's testimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A party is under a duty seasonably to amend a prior response if  the party obtains information upon the basis of which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The party knows that the response was incorrect when made; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The party knows that the response though correct when made is  no longer true and the circumstances are such that a failure to amend  the response is in substance a knowing concealment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A duty to supplement responses may be imposed by order of the  court, agreement of the parties, or at any time prior to the hearing  through new requests for supplementation of prior responses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Filing of discovery. Requests for production or inspection under  Sec. 2200.53, requests for admission under Sec. 2200.54 and responses  thereto, interrogatories under Sec. 2200.55 and the answers thereto, and  depositions under Sec. 2200.56 shall be served upon other counsel or  parties, but shall not be filed with the Commission or the Judge. The  party responsible for service of the discovery material shall retain the  original and become the custodian.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Relief from discovery requests. If relief is sought under  Secs. 2200.101 or 2200.52(e), (f), or (g) concerning any  interrogatories, requests for production or inspection, requests for  admissions, answers to interrogatories, or responses to requests for  admissions, copies of the portions of the interrogatories, requests,  answers, or responses in dispute shall be filed with the Judge or  Commission contemporaneously with any motion filed under Secs. 2200.101  or 2200.52(e), (f), or (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Use at hearing. If interrogatories, requests, answers,  responses, or depositions are to be used at the hearing or are necessary  to a prehearing motion which might result in a final order on any claim,  the portions to be used shall be filed with the Judge or the Commission  at the outset of the hearing or at the filing of the motion insofar as  their use can be reasonably anticipated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Use on review or appeal. When documentation of discovery not  previously in the record is needed for review or appeal purposes, upon  an application and order of the Judge or Commission the necessary  discovery papers shall be filed with the Executive Secretary of the  Commission.
