L. 98-615, 98 Stat. 3195.

The ``first regular monthly payment'' is generally preceded by estimated payments before the claim can be adjudicated and by an adjustment check (including the difference between the estimated rate and the initially adjudicated rate).</p><p class="depth0">Former spouse means a living person who was married for at least 9 months to an employee, Member, or retiree who performed at least 18 months of creditable service in a position covered by CSRS and whose marriage to the employee was terminated prior to the death of the employee, Member, or retiree.

If a jurisdiction would recognize more than one marriage in law or equity, the Office of Personnel

Interest, mortality, and inflation rates used in computing the present value are those used by the Board of Actuaries of the Civil Service Retirement System for valuation of the System, based on dynamic assumptions.
