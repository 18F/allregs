                            <p class="depth0">In some cases the Administrator will notify the petitioner that the petition, while technically complete, is inadequate to justify the establishment of a tolerance or the tolerance requested by petitioner. This may be due to the fact that the data are not sufficiently clear or complete. In such cases, the petitioner may withdraw the petition pending its clarification or the obtaining of additional data. This withdrawal may be without prejudice to a future filing. A deposit for fees as specified in Sec. 180.33 shall accompany the resubmission of the petition.
