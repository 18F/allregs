                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Shortened procedures. When required by the circumstances and  consistent with the public interest, the Department may take action,  without notice, on exemption applications prior to the expiration of the  normal period for filing answers and replies. When required in a  particular proceeding, the Department may specify a lesser time for the  filing of answers and replies, and notify interested persons of this  time period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications. Applications for emergency exemption need not  conform to the requirements of this subpart or of subpart A of this part  (except as provided in this section and in Sec. 302.303(d) concerning  emergency cabotage requests). However, an application for emergency  exemption must normally be in writing and must state in detail the facts  and evidence that support the application, the grounds for the  exemption, and the public interest basis for the authority sought. In  addition, the application shall state specific reasons that justify  departure from the normal exemption application procedures. The  application shall also identify those persons notified as required by  paragraph (c) of this section. The Department may require additional  information from any applicant before acting on an application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oral requests. The Department will consider oral requests,  including telephone requests, for emergency exemption authority under  this section in circumstances that do not permit the immediate filing of  a written application. All oral requests must, however, provide the  information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, except that  actual evidence in support of the application need not be tendered when  the request is made. All oral requests must be confirmed by written  application, together with all supporting evidence, within three (3)  business days of the original request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. Except when the Department decides that no notice need  be given, applicants for emergency exemption shall notify, as  appropriate, those persons specified in Sec. 302.304(b) of this  subpart. Such notification shall be made in the same manner, contain the  same information, and be dispatched at the same time, as the application  made to the Department.</p>
