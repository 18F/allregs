                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Direct costs means those expenditures a DON activity actually  makes in searching for, reviewing (in the case of commercial  requesters), and duplicating documents to respond to a FOIA request.  Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performing  the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of that  rate to cover benefits), and the costs of operating duplicating  machinery. These factors have been included in the fee rates prescribed  in this subpart. Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such  as costs of space, heating or lighting the facility in which the records  are stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a document  in response to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the form of paper  copy, microfiche, audiovisual, or machine readable documentation (e.g.,  magnetic tape or disc), among others. Every effort will be made to  ensure that the copy provided is in a form that is reasonably usable,  the requester shall be notified that the copy provided is the best  available, and that the activity's master copy shall be made available  for review upon appointment. For duplication of computer tapes and  audiovisual, the actual cost, including the operator's time, shall be  charged. In practice, if a DON activity estimates that assessable  duplication charges are likely to exceed $25.00, it shall notify the  requester of the estimate, unless the requester has indicated in advance  his or her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a  notice shall offer a requester the opportunity to confer with activity  personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or  her needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review refers to the process of examining documents located in  response to a FOIA request to determine whether one or more of the  statutory exemptions permit withholding. It also includes processing the  documents for disclosure, such as excising them for release. Review does  not include the time spent resolving general legal or policy issues  regarding the application of exemptions. It should be noted that charges  for commercial requesters may   be assessed only for the initial review. DON activities may not charge  for reviews required at the administrative appeal level of an exemption  already applied. However, records or portions of records withheld in  full under an exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may  be reviewed again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not  previously considered. The costs for such a subsequent review would be  properly assessable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Search refers to time spent looking, both manually and  electronically, for material that is responsive to a request. Search  also includes a page-by-page or line-by-line identification (if  necessary) of material in the record to determine if it, or portions  thereof are responsive to the request. DON activities should ensure that  searches are done in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as  to minimize costs for both the activity and the requester. For example,  activities should not engage in line-by-line searches when duplicating  an entire document known to contain responsive information would prove  to be the less expensive and quicker method of complying with the  request. Time spent reviewing documents in order to determine whether to  apply one or more of the statutory exemptions is not search time, but  review time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DON activities may charge for time spent searching for records,  even if that search fails to locate records responsive to the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DON activities may also charge search and review (in the case of  commercial requesters) time if records located are determined to be  exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In practice, if the DON activity estimates that search charges  are likely to exceed $25.00, it shall notify the requester of the  estimated amount of fees, unless the requester has indicated in advance  his or her willingness to pay fees as high as those anticipated. Such a  notice shall offer the requester the opportunity to confer with activity  personnel with the object of reformulating the request to meet his or  her needs at a lower cost.</p>
