                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To carry out the metropolitan transportation planning process under this subpart, a metropolitan planning organization (MPO) shall be designated for each urbanized area with a population of more than 50,000 individuals (as determined by the Bureau of the Census).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> MPO designation shall be made by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the affected population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census) or in accordance with procedures established by applicable State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each Governor with responsibility for a portion of a multistate metropolitan area and the appropriate MPOs shall, to the extent practicable, provide coordinated transportation planning for the entire MPA. The consent of Congress is granted to any two or more States to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enter into agreements or compacts, not in conflict with any law of the United States, for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in support of activities authorized under 23 U.S.C. 134 and 49 U.S.C. 5303 as the activities pertain to interstate areas and localities within the States; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish such agencies, joint or otherwise, as the States may determine desirable for making the agreements and compacts effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each MPO that serves a TMA, when designated or redesignated under this section, shall consist of local elected officials, officials of public agencies that administer or operate major modes of transportation in the metropolitan planning area, and appropriate State transportation officials. Where appropriate, MPOs may increase the representation of local elected officials, public transportation agencies, or appropriate State officials on their policy boards and other committees as a means for encouraging greater involvement in the metropolitan transportation planning process, subject to the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To the extent possible, only one MPO shall be designated for each urbanized area or group of contiguous urbanized areas. More than one MPO may be designated to serve an urbanized area only if the Governor(s) and the existing MPO, if applicable, determine that the size and complexity of the urbanized area make designation of more than one MPO appropriate. In those cases where two or more MPOs serve the same urbanized area, the MPOs shall establish official, written agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division of transportation planning responsibilities among the MPOs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nothing in this subpart shall be deemed to prohibit an MPO from using the staff resources of other agencies, non-profit organizations, or contractors to carry out selected elements of the metropolitan transportation planning process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An MPO designation shall remain in effect until an official redesignation has been made in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An existing MPO may be redesignated only by agreement between the Governor and units of general purpose

local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Redesignation of an MPO serving a multistate metropolitan planning area requires agreement between the Governors of each State served by the existing MPO and units of general purpose local government that together represent at least 75 percent of the existing metropolitan planning area population (including the largest incorporated city, based on population, as named by the Bureau of the Census).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> For the purposes of redesignation, units of general purpose local government may be defined as elected officials from each unit of general purpose local government located within the metropolitan planning area served by the existing MPO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Redesignation of an MPO (in accordance with the provisions of this section) is required whenever the existing MPO proposes to make:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A substantial change in the proportion of voting members on the existing MPO representing the largest incorporated city, other units of general purpose local government served by the MPO, and the State(s); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A substantial change in the decisionmaking authority or responsibility of the MPO, or in decisionmaking procedures established under MPO by-laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The following changes to an MPO do not require a redesignation (as long as they do not trigger a substantial change as described in paragraph (k) of the section):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The identification of a new urbanized area (as determined by the Bureau of the Census) within an existing metropolitan planning area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adding members to the MPO that represent new units of general purpose local government resulting from expansion of the metropolitan planning area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adding members to satisfy the specific membership requirements for an MPO that serves a TMA; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Periodic rotation of members representing units of general-purpose local government, as established under MPO by-laws.</p>
