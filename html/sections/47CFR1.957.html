                            <p class="depth0">Each candidate for an amateur radio license which requires the  applicant to pass one or more examination elements must present the  Volunteer Examiners (VEs) with a properly completed FCC Form 605 prior  to the examination. Upon completion of the examination, the VEs will  grade the test papers. If the applicant is successful, the VEs will  forward the candidate's application to a Volunteer-Examiner Coordinator  (VEC). The VEs will then issue a certificate for sucessful completion of  an amateur radio operator examination. The VEC will forward the  application to the Commission's Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, facility.  [63 FR 68935, Dec. 14, 1998]</p>
