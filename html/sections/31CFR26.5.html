If the WGMA and the Department of the Treasury determine that a project would have a significant impact on the human environment, but that the level of environmental analysis planned by the MDB is insufficient, the Department of the Treasury will instruct the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB to request that the MDB upgrade the project to an environmental category requiring additional environmental analysis. Members of the public may call the MDB Office to inquire about upgrade requests for specific projects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additional environmental information.

The MDB Office will provide this environmental information to the entities described in Sec. 26.2(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such environmental information is insufficient to provide an adequate basis for analyzing the environmental impact of the proposed project and alternatives to the proposed project, the Department of the Treasury will instruct the United States Executive Director of the concerned MDB not to vote in favor of the project.</p>
