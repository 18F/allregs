                            <p class="depth0">Concentrated fruit juice reduced with water to its original density,  or to 22 degrees Brix, or to any degree of Brix between its original  density and 22 degrees Brix, and unconcentrated fruit juice reduced with  water to not less than 22 degrees Brix, is considered juice for the  purpose of standard wine production. Concentrated fruit juice reduced  with water to any degree of Brix greater than 22 degrees Brix may be  further reduced with water to any degree of Brix between its original  density and 22 degrees Brix. The proprietor, prior to using concentrated  fruit juice in wine production, shall obtain a statement in which the  producer certifies the kind of fruit from which it was produced and the  total solids content of the juice before and after concentration.  Concentrated or unconcentrated fruit juice may be used in juice or wine  made from the same kind of fruit for the purposes of chaptalizing or  sweetening, as provided in this part. Concentrated fruit juice, or juice  which has been concentrated and reconstituted, may not be used in  standard wine production if at any time it was concentrated to more than  80 degrees Brix.
