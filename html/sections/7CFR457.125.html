The price elections you choose for each type must have the same percentage relationship to the maximum price offered by us for each type. For example, if you choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for one type, you must also choose 100 percent of the maximum price election for all other types.</p><p class="depth0">3. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 (Contract Changes) of the Basic Provisions (Sec. 457.8), the contract change date is August 31 preceding the cancellation date for California, and December 31 preceding the cancellation date for all other states.</p><p class="depth0">4.

Upon such agreement, the insurance period for that acreage will end when you put the acreage to another use or abandon the crop. If agreement on the appraised amount of production is not reached:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you do not elect to continue to care for the crop, we may give you consent to put the acreage to another use if you agree to leave intact, and provide sufficient care for,

representative samples of the crop in locations acceptable to us (The amount of production to count for such acreage will be based on the harvested production or appraisals from the samples at the time harvest should have occurred. If you do not leave the required samples intact, or fail to provide sufficient care for the samples, our appraisal made prior to giving you consent to put the acreage to another use will be used to determine the amount of production to count); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you elect to continue to care for the crop, the amount of production to count for the acreage will be the harvested production, or our reappraisal if additional damage occurs and the crop is not harvested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All harvested production from the insurable acreage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mature safflower may be adjusted for excess moisture and quality deficiencies. If moisture adjustment is applicable, it will be made prior to any adjustment for quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Production will be reduced by 0.12 percent for each 0.1 percentage point of moisture in excess of 8 percent. We may obtain samples of the production to determine the moisture content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Production will be eligible for quality adjustment if such production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Has a test weight below 35 pounds per bushel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Has seed damage in excess of 25 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contains substances or conditions that are identified by the Food and Drug Administration or other public health organizations of the United States as being injurious to human or animal health.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Quality will be a factor in determining your loss only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The deficiencies, substances, or conditions resulted from a cause of loss against which insurance is provided under these crop provisions and that occurred within the insurance period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The deficiencies, substances, or conditions result in a value per pound that is less than the local market price;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All determinations of these deficiencies, substances, or conditions are made using samples of the production obtained by us or by a disinterested third party approved by us;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With regard to deficiencies in quality (except test weight, which may be determined by our loss adjuster), the samples are analyzed by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A grader licensed under the United States Agricultural Marketing Act or the United States Warehouse Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A grader licensed under State law and employed by a warehouse operator who has a storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A grader not licensed under State law, but who is employed by a warehouse operator who has a commodity storage agreement with the Commodity Credit Corporation and is in compliance with State law regarding warehouses; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> With regard to substances or conditions injurious to human or animal health, the samples are analyzed by a laboratory approved by us.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Safflower production that is eligible for quality adjustment, as specified in sections 11(d) (2) and (3), will be reduced as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with the quality adjustment factors contained in the Special Provisions; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If quality adjustment factors are not contained in the Special Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> By determining the value per pound and the local market price on the earlier of the date such quality adjusted production is sold or the date of final inspection for the unit. Discounts used to establish the value per pound will be limited to those which are usual, customary, and reasonable. The value per pound will not be reduced for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Moisture content;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Damage due to uninsured causes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Drying, handling, processing, or any other costs associated with normal harvesting, handling, and marketing of safflower. We may obtain values per pound from any buyer of our choice. If we obtain values per pound from one or more buyers located outside your local market area, we will reduce such values per pound by the additional costs required to deliver the production to those buyers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Divide the value per pound by the local market price to determine the quality adjustment factor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Multiply the adjustment factor by the number of pounds of the damaged production remaining after any reduction due to excessive moisture to determine the net production to count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Any production harvested from other plants growing in the insured crop may be counted as production of the insured crop on a weight basis.</p><p class="depth0">12. Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">Your prevented planing coverage will be 60 percent of your production guarantee for timely planted acreage. If you have limited or aditional levels of coverage, as specified in 7 CFR part 400, subpart T, and pay an additional premium, you may increase your prevented planting coverage to a level specified in the actuarial documents.
