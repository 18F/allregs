                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Components shall charge for processing requests  under the FOIA in accordance with the provisions of this section and  with the OMB Guidelines. In order to resolve any fee issues that arise  under this section, a component may contact a requester for additional  information. Components shall ensure that searches, review, and  duplication are conducted in the most efficient and the least expensive  manner. A component ordinarily will collect all applicable fees before  sending copies of records to a requester. Requesters must pay fees by  check or money order made payable to the Treasury of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Commercial use request is a request that asks for information  for a use or a purpose that furthers a commercial, trade, or profit  interest, which can include furthering those interests through  litigation. A component's decision to place a requester in the  commercial use category will be made on a case-by-case basis based on  the requester's intended use of the information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct costs are those expenses that an agency incurs in  searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of commercial use  requests, reviewing) records in order to respond to a FOIA request. For  example, direct costs include the salary of the employee performing the  work (i.e., the basic rate of pay for the employee, plus 16 percent of  that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating computers and  other electronic equipment, such as photocopiers and scanners. Direct  costs do not include overhead expenses such as the costs of space, and  of heating or lighting a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Duplication is reproducing a copy of a record, or of the  information contained in it, necessary to respond to a FOIA request.  Copies can take the form of paper, audiovisual materials, or electronic  records, among others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Educational institution is any school that operates a program of  scholarly research. A requester in this fee category must show that the  request is authorized by, and is made under the auspices of, an  educational institution and that the records are not sought for a  commercial use, but rather are sought to further scholarly research. To  fall within this fee category, the request must serve the scholarly  research goals of the institution rather than an individual research  goal.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A request from a professor of geology at a university for  records relating to soil erosion, written on letterhead of the  Department of Geology, would be presumed to be from an educational  institution.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A request from the same professor of geology seeking drug  information from the Food and Drug Administration in furtherance of a  murder mystery he is writing would not be   presumed to be an institutional request, regardless of whether it was  written on institutional stationery.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A student who makes a request in furtherance of the  completion of a course of instruction would be presumed to be carrying  out an individual research goal, rather than a scholarly research goal  of the institution and would not qualify as part of this fee category.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Noncommercial scientific institution is an institution that is  not operated on a ``commercial'' basis, as defined in paragraph (b)(1)  of this section and that is operated solely for the purpose of  conducting scientific research the results of which are not intended to  promote any particular product or industry. A requester in this category  must show that the request is authorized by and is made under the  auspices of a qualifying institution and that the records are sought to  further scientific research and are not for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Representative of the news media is any person or entity  organized and operated to publish or broadcast news to the public that  actively gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the  public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a  distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. The term  ``news'' means information that is about current events or that would be  of current interest to the public. Examples of news media entities  include television or radio stations that broadcast ``news'' to the  public at large and publishers of periodicals that disseminate ``news''  and make their products available through a variety of means to the  general public, including news organizations that disseminate solely on  the Internet. A request for records supporting the news-dissemination  function of the requester shall not be considered to be for a commercial  use. ``Freelance'' journalists who demonstrate a solid basis for  expecting publication through a news media entity shall be considered as  a representative of the news media. A publishing contract would provide  the clearest evidence that publication is expected; however, components  shall also consider a requester's past publication record in making this  determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Review is the examination of a record located in response to a  request in order to determine whether any portion of it is exempt from  disclosure. Review time includes processing any record for disclosure,  such as doing all that is necessary to prepare the record for  disclosure, including the process of redacting the record and marking  the appropriate exemptions. Review costs are properly charged even if a  record ultimately is not disclosed. Review time also includes time spent  both obtaining and considering any formal objection to disclosure made  by a confidential commercial information submitter under Sec.  16.7, but  it does not include time spent resolving general legal or policy issues  regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Search is the process of looking for and retrieving records or  information responsive to a request. Search time includes page-by-page  or line-by-line identification of information within records and the  reasonable efforts expended to locate and retrieve information from  electronic records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charging fees. In responding to FOIA requests, components shall  charge the following fees unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been  granted under paragraph (k) of this section. Because the fee amounts  provided below already account for the direct costs associated with a  given fee type, components should not add any additional costs to  charges calculated under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Search. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requests made by educational institutions,  noncommercial scientific institutions, or representatives of the news  media are not subject to search fees. Search fees shall be charged for  all other requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of  this section. Components may properly charge for time spent searching  even if they do not locate any responsive records or if they determine  that the records are entirely exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each quarter hour spent by personnel searching for  requested records, including electronic searches that do not require new  programming,   the fees shall be as follows: professional--$10.00; and clerical/ administrative--$4.75.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requesters shall be charged the direct costs associated with  conducting any search that requires the creation of a new computer  program to locate the requested records. Requesters shall be notified of  the costs associated with creating such a program and must agree to pay  the associated costs before the costs may be incurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For requests that require the retrieval of records stored by an  agency at a Federal records center operated by the National Archives and  Records Administration (NARA), additional costs shall be charged in  accordance with the Transactional Billing Rate Schedule established by  NARA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duplication. Duplication fees shall be charged to all  requesters, subject to the restrictions of paragraph (d) of this  section. A component shall honor a requester's preference for receiving  a record in a particular form or format where it is readily reproducible  by the component in the form or format requested. Where photocopies are  supplied, the component shall provide one copy per request at a cost of  five cents per page. For copies of records produced on tapes, disks, or  other media, components shall charge the direct costs of producing the  copy, including operator time. Where paper documents must be scanned in  order to comply with a requester's preference to receive the records in  an electronic format, the requester shall pay the direct costs  associated with scanning those materials. For other forms of  duplication, components shall charge the direct costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. Review fees shall be charged to requesters who make  commercial use requests. Review fees shall be assessed in connection  with the initial review of the record, i.e., the review conducted by a  component to determine whether an exemption applies to a particular  record or portion of a record. No charge will be made for review at the  administrative appeal stage of exemptions applied at the initial review  stage. However, if a particular exemption is deemed to no longer apply,  any costs associated with a component's re-review of the records in  order to consider the use of other exemptions may be assessed as review  fees. Review fees shall be charged at the same rates as those charged  for a search under paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Restrictions on charging fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No search fees will be  charged for requests by educational institutions (unless the records are  sought for a commercial use), noncommercial scientific institutions, or  representatives of the news media.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a component fails to comply with the time limits in which to  respond to a request, and if no unusual or exceptional circumstances, as  those terms are defined by the FOIA, apply to the processing of the  request, it may not charge search fees, or, in the instances of requests  from requesters described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section, may not  charge duplication fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No search or review fees will be charged for a quarter-hour  period unless more than half of that period is required for search or  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use,  components shall provide without charge:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first 100 pages of duplication (or the cost equivalent for  other media); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The first two hours of search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When, after first deducting the 100 free pages (or its cost  equivalent) and the first two hours of search, a total fee calculated  under paragraph (c) of this section is $25.00 or less for any request,  no fee will be charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a  component determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed in  accordance with this section will exceed $25.00, the component shall  notify the requester of the actual or estimated amount of the fees,  including a breakdown of the fees for search, review or duplication,  unless the requester has indicated a willingness to pay fees as high as  those anticipated. If only a portion of the fee can be estimated  readily, the component shall advise the requester accordingly. If the  requester is a noncommercial use requester, the notice shall specify  that the requester is entitled to the statutory entitlements of 100  pages of duplication at no charge and, if the requester is charged  search fees, two   hours of search time at no charge, and shall advise the requester  whether those entitlements have been provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In cases in which a requester has been notified that the actual  or estimated fees are in excess of $25.00, the request shall not be  considered received and further work will not be completed until the  requester commits in writing to pay the actual or estimated total fee,  or designates some amount of fees the requester is willing to pay, or in  the case of a noncommercial use requester who has not yet been provided  with the requester's statutory entitlements, designates that the  requester seeks only that which can be provided by the statutory  entitlements. The requester must provide the commitment or designation  in writing, and must, when applicable, designate an exact dollar amount  the requester is willing to pay. Components are not required to accept  payments in installments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the requester has indicated a willingness to pay some  designated amount of fees, but the component estimates that the total  fee will exceed that amount, the component shall toll the processing of  the request when it notifies the requester of the estimated fees in  excess of the amount the requester has indicated a willingness to pay.  The component shall inquire whether the requester wishes to revise the  amount of fees the requester is willing to pay or modify the request.  Once the requester responds, the time to respond will resume from where  it was at the date of the notification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Components shall make available their FOIA Public Liaison or  other FOIA professional to assist any requester in reformulating a  request to meet the requester's needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Charges for other services. Although not required to provide  special services, if a component chooses to do so as a matter of  administrative discretion, the direct costs of providing the service  shall be charged. Examples of such services include certifying that  records are true copies, providing multiple copies of the same document,  or sending records by means other than first class mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Charging interest. Components may charge interest on any unpaid  bill starting on the 31st day following the date of billing the  requester. Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate provided in 31  U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from the billing date until payment is  received by the component. Components shall follow the provisions of the  Debt Collection Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749), as amended,  and its administrative procedures, including the use of consumer  reporting agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Aggregating requests. When a component reasonably believes that  a requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to  divide a single request into a series of requests for the purpose of  avoiding fees, the component may aggregate those requests and charge  accordingly. Components may presume that multiple requests of this type  made within a 30-day period have been made in order to avoid fees. For  requests separated by a longer period, components will aggregate them  only where there is a reasonable basis for determining that aggregation  is warranted in view of all the circumstances involved. Multiple  requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Advance payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For requests other than those described in  paragraphs (i)(2) or (i)(3) of this section, a component shall not  require the requester to make an advance payment before work is  commenced or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already  completed (i.e., payment before copies are sent to a requester) is not  an advance payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a component determines or estimates that a total fee to be  charged under this section will exceed $250.00, it may require that the  requester make an advance payment up to the amount of the entire  anticipated fee before beginning to process the request. A component may  elect to process the request prior to collecting fees when it receives a  satisfactory assurance of full payment from a requester with a history  of prompt payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a requester has previously failed to pay a properly  charged FOIA fee to any component or agency within   30 calendar days of the billing date, a component may require that the  requester pay the full amount due, plus any applicable interest on that  prior request, and the component may require that the requester make an  advance payment of the full amount of any anticipated fee before the  component begins to process a new request or continues to process a  pending request or any pending appeal. Where a component has a  reasonable basis to believe that a requester has misrepresented the  requester's identity in order to avoid paying outstanding fees, it may  require that the requester provide proof of identity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In cases in which a component requires advance payment, the  request shall not be considered received and further work will not be  completed until the required payment is received. If the requester does  not pay the advance payment within 30 calendar days after the date of  the component's fee determination, the request will be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Other statutes specifically providing for fees. The fee schedule  of this section does not apply to fees charged under any statute that  specifically requires an agency to set and collect fees for particular  types of records. In instances where records responsive to a request are  subject to a statutorily-based fee schedule program, the component shall  inform the requester of the contact information for that program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Requirements for waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records  responsive to a request shall be furnished without charge or at a  reduced rate below the rate established under paragraph (c) of this  section, where a component determines, based on all available  information, that the requester has demonstrated that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure of the requested information is in the public  interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public  understanding of the operations or activities of the government, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of the information is not primarily in the  commercial interest of the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In deciding whether disclosure of the requested information is  in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly  to public understanding of operations or activities of the government,  components shall consider all four of the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request must concern identifiable operations  or activities of the Federal Government, with a connection that is  direct and clear, not remote or attenuated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disclosure of the requested records must be meaningfully  informative about government operations or activities in order to be  ``likely to contribute'' to an increased public understanding of those  operations or activities. The disclosure of information that already is  in the public domain, in either the same or a substantially identical  form, would not contribute to such understanding where nothing new would  be added to the public's understanding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The disclosure must contribute to the understanding of a  reasonably broad audience of persons interested in the subject, as  opposed to the individual understanding of the requester. A requester's  expertise in the subject area as well as the requester's ability and  intention to effectively convey information to the public shall be  considered. It shall be presumed that a representative of the news media  will satisfy this consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The public's understanding of the subject in question must be  enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. However, components  shall not make value judgments about whether the information at issue is  ``important'' enough to be made public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To determine whether disclosure of the requested information is  primarily in the commercial interest of the requester, components shall  consider the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Components shall identify any commercial interest of the  requester, as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, that would be  furthered by the requested disclosure. Requesters shall be given an  opportunity to provide explanatory information regarding this  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A waiver or reduction of fees is justified where the public  interest is greater than any identified commercial   interest in disclosure. Components ordinarily shall presume that where a  news media requester has satisfied the public interest standard, the  public interest will be the interest primarily served by disclosure to  that requester. Disclosure to data brokers or others who merely compile  and market government information for direct economic return shall not  be presumed to primarily serve the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where only some of the records to be released satisfy the  requirements for a waiver of fees, a waiver shall be granted for those  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requests for a waiver or reduction of fees should be made when  the request is first submitted to the component and should address the  criteria referenced above. A requester may submit a fee waiver request  at a later time so long as the underlying record request is pending or  on administrative appeal. When a requester who has committed to pay fees  subsequently asks for a waiver of those fees and that waiver is denied,  the requester shall be required to pay any costs incurred up to the date  the fee waiver request was received.</p>
