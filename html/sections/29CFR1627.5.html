An individual seeking membership  is considered to be a person who files an application for membership or  who, in some other manner, indicates a specific intention to be  considered for membership, but does not include any individual who is  serving for a stated limited probationary period prior to permanent  employment and formal union membership. A person who merely makes an  inquiry about the labor organization or, for example, about its general  program, is not considered to be an individual seeking membership in a  labor organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When an enforcement action is commenced under section 7 of the  Act regarding a labor organization, the Commission or its authorized  representative shall require the labor organization to retain any record  required to be kept under paragraph (b) of this section which is  relative to such action until the final disposition thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whenever a labor organization has an obligation as an  ``employer'' or as an ``employment agency'' under the Act, the labor  organization must also comply with the recordkeeping requirements set  forth in Sec. 1627.3 or Sec. 1627.4, as appropriate.
