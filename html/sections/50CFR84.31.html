                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The primary objective of the proposal will be to acquire, restore, enhance, or manage coastal wetlands to benefit coastal wetlands and the hydrology, water quality, and fish and wildlife dependent upon them. The Program will not provide grants, for example, for construction or repair of boat ramps or docks for recreational purposes and construction or support of research facilities or activities. The purpose of the ranking criteria is to provide a means for selecting the best projects--those that produce the maximum benefits to coastal wetlands and the fish and wildlife that depend on them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposal ranking factors--(1) Ranking criteria. As explained in Sec.  84.32, we will evaluate proposals according to 13 ranking criteria. These criteria have varying point values. Proposals must address each of these 13 criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ranking criteria. As explained in Sec.  84.32, we will evaluate proposals according to 13 ranking criteria. These criteria have varying point values. Proposals must address each of these 13 criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional considerations. Even though the criteria provide the primary evaluation of proposals, we may factor additional considerations into the ranking decision at the national level. In case of a tie, we will use these additional considerations to rank proposals having identical scores.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The criteria in Sec.  84.32 are not listed in priority order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Points are assigned on the basis of a completed project, rather than current conditions, e.g., count 50 acres of estuarine emergent wetlands if 50 acres of that habitat type will be restored when the project is completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A range of points rather than a set point value allows the reviewer to distinguish between, for example, a proposal that provides some foraging habitat for a threatened species versus one that provides critical nesting habitat of several endangered species. Scoring guidance is included with the individual criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A total of 64 points is possible under the scoring system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If a grant proposal is not selected, the State may resubmit it for reconsideration in subsequent fiscal years. Resubmission of a grant proposal is the responsibility of the applicant.</p>
