                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The HCA (non-delegable) shall select, appoint, and terminate the appointment of Contracting Officers--i.e., those individuals who are authorized to obligate the Government to the expenditure of funds for contracts and orders with dollar values that exceed (or

are expected to exceed) the micro-purchase threshold. The procedures for selecting and appointing Contracting Officers apply to HHS employees. HCAs may not issue HHS Contracting Officer warrants to contractor personnel. OPDIVs shall follow local procedures in the event that the signature of another authorized official, in addition to that of the HCA, is required to appoint or terminate the appointment of Contracting Officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The HCA shall use Standard Form (SF) 1402, ``Certificate of Appointment,'' (also known as a warrant) to appoint personnel, whether in the General Schedule (GS) 1102 series or other series, as Contracting Officers. The SF 1402 shall indicate the Contracting Officer's warrant level--i.e., maximum dollar signature authority (e.g., $1 million or ``unlimited'') and any other limitations or restrictions. The HCA shall make changes to a Contracting Officer appointment (other than a termination of an appointment as provided in 301.603-4) by issuing a revised SF 1402. FAR 1.603-1 prescribes the requirements for preparing and maintaining Contracting Officer warrants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Before an HCA may appoint an individual as a Contracting Officer, the individual must be certified in accordance with either the Federal Acquisition Certification in Contracting (FAC-C) program or the HHS Simplified Acquisition Certification (SAC) program, as appropriate, at the level required for the warrant authority requested. See 301.603-72 and the HHS Contracting Workforce Training and Certification Handbook.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The dollar amount of an individual transaction determines whether a Contracting Officer has the authority to sign it in accordance with the delegated authority specified on the SF 1402. For new or follow-on awards, the dollar amount of an individual transaction is the amount obligated at the time of contract or order award plus any potential option amounts or future funding amounts established by the transaction. However, under an existing contract or order, when an option is subsequently exercised or a contact or order is otherwise modified to add funding, the dollar amount of the modification (individual transaction) determines whether a Contracting Officer has the necessary delegated authority to sign it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For individuals that will exercise acquisition authorities (other than solely purchase card authorities) at or below the micro-purchase threshold, the HCA may--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use a document other than the SF 1402, such as a memorandum, that indicates a maximum dollar signature authority for individual transactions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine training requirements for individuals who will exercise acquisition authorities at dollar levels below the micro-purchase threshold level.</p>
