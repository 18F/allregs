Overflow  pipes shall discharge into the toilet, through the tank.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Floor Connection. Water closets must be securely bolted to an  approved flange or other approved fitting that is secured to the floor  by means of corrosion-resistant screws. The bolts must be of solid brass  or other corrosion-resistant material and must not be less than \1/4\  inch in diameter.
