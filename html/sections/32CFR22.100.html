Those other parts of the DoDGARs, which are referenced as appropriate in this part, are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The DoD implementation, in 2 CFR part 1125, of OMB guidance on nonprocurement debarment and suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Governmentwide rule on drug-free workplace requirements, in 32 CFR part 26.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Governmentwide rule on lobbying restrictions, in 32 CFR part 28.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Administrative requirements for grants and agreements awarded to specific types of recipients:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For State and local governmental organizations, in the Governmentwide rule at 32 CFR part 33.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For institutions of higher education and other nonprofit organizations, at 32 CFR part 32.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For for-profit organizations, at 32 CFR part 34.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The organization of this part parallels the award and administration process, from pre-award through post-award matters. It therefore is organized in the same manner as the parts of the DoDGARs (32 CFR parts 32, 33, and 34) that prescribe administrative requirements for specific types of recipients.
