                                Sec.  1.924  Suspension or revocation of eligibility for federal loans,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3720B and the procedures set forth in 31 CFR 285.13 and Sec.  901.6, a person owing an outstanding non-tax debt that is in delinquent status shall not be eligible for Federal financial assistance unless exempted under paragraph (d) of this section or waived under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal financial assistance or financial assistance means any Federal loan (other than a disaster loan), loan insurance, or loan guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section only, a debt is in a delinquent status if

the debt has not been paid within 90 days of the payment due date or by the end of any grace period provided by statute, regulation, contract, or agreement. The payment due date is the date specified in the initial written demand for payment. Further guidance concerning the delinquent status of a debt may be found at 31 CFR 285.13(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the written request and recommendation of the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of the Treasury may grant exemptions from the provisions of this section. The standards for exemptions granted for classes of debts are set forth in 31 CFR 285.13(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> VA's Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief Financial Officer may waive the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section only on a person-by-person basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> VA's Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief Financial Officer may waive the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section only on a person-by-person basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief Financial Officer should balance the following factors when deciding whether to grant a waiver:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the denial of the financial assistance to the person would tend to interfere substantially with or defeat the purposes of the financial assistance program or otherwise would not be in the best interests of the Federal government; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the granting of the financial assistance to the person is contrary to the government's goal of reducing losses by requiring proper screening of potential borrowers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When balancing the factors described in paragraph (e)(2)(i) and (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the Chief Financial Officer or Deputy Chief Financial Officer should consider:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The age, amount, and cause(s) of the delinquency and the likelihood that the person will resolve the delinquent debt; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the total debt, delinquent or otherwise, owed by the person and the person's credit history with respect to repayment of debt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A centralized record shall be retained of the number and type of waivers granted under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In non-bankruptcy cases, in seeking the collection of statutory penalties, forfeitures, or other similar types of claims, VA may suspend or revoke any license, permit, or other privilege granted a debtor when the debtor inexcusably or willfully fails to pay such a debt. The debtor should be advised in VA's written demand for payment of VA's ability to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges. VA may suspend or disqualify any lender, contractor, or broker who is engaged in making, guaranteeing, insuring, acquiring, or participating in loans from doing further business with VA or engaging in programs sponsored by VA if such lender, contractor, or broker fails to pay its debts to the Government within a reasonable time, or if such lender, contractor, or broker has been suspended, debarred, or disqualified from participation in a program or activity by another Federal agency. The failure of any surety to honor its obligations in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 9305 should be reported to Treasury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> In bankruptcy cases, before advising the debtor of the intention to suspend or revoke licenses, permits, or privileges, VA should seek legal advice from VA's General Counsel or Regional Counsel concerning the impact of the Bankruptcy Code, particularly 11 U.S.C. 362 and 525, which may restrict such action.
