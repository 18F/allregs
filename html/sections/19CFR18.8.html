An acceptable proof of proper delivery of bonded merchandise to Customs at the port of destination or exportation is a properly receipted copy of the in-bond document (the appropriate Customs Form 7512 or 7520, or the carnet). When sealing is waived, any loss found to exist at the port of destination or exportation shall be presumed to have occurred while the merchandise was in the possession of the carrier, unless conclusive evidence to the contrary is produced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Carriers shall be liable for payment of liquidated damages under the carriers bond for any shortage, failure to deliver, or irregular delivery, as provided in such bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the penalties described in paragraph (b) of this section, the carrier shall pay any internal-revenue taxes, duties, or other taxes accruing to the United States on the missing merchandise, together with all costs, charges, and expenses caused by the failure to make the required transportation, report, and delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In any case in which liquidated damages are imposed in accordance with this section and the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer is satisfied by evidence submitted to him with a petition for relief filed in accordance with the provisions of part 172 of this chapter that any violation of the terms and conditions of the bond occurred without any intent to evade any law or regulation, the Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer, in accordance with delegated authority, may cancel such claim upon the payment of any lesser amount or without the payment of any amount as may be deemed appropriate under the law and in view of the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> The domestic guaranteeing association shall be jointly and severally liable with the initial bonded carrier for duties and taxes accruing to the U.S., and any other charges imposed, in lieu thereof, as the result of any shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery at the port of destination or port of exit of merchandise covered by a TIR carnet. The liability of the domestic guaranteeing association is limited to $50,000 per TIR carnet for duties, taxes, and sums collected in lieu thereof. Penalties imposed as liquidated damages on the initial bonded carrier, and sums assessed the guaranteeing association in lieu of duties and taxes for any shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery shall be in accordance with this section. If a TIR carnet has not been discharged or has been discharged subject to a reservation, the guaranteeing association shall be notified within 1 year of the date upon which the carnet is taken on charge, including time for receipt of the notification, except that if the discharge shall have been obtained improperly or fraudulently the period shall be 2 years. However, in cases which become the subject of legal proceedings during the above-mentioned period, no claim for payment shall be made more than 1 year after the date when the decision of the court becomes enforceable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The domestic guaranteeing association shall be jointly and severally liable with the initial bonded carrier for duties and taxes accruing to the U.S., and any other charges imposed, in lieu thereof, as the result of any shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelivery at the port of destination or port of exit of merchandise covered by a TIR carnet.

The amount paid shall be refunded if, within a period of 1 year from the date on which the claim for payment was made, it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Customs that no irregularity occurred. The Fines, Penalties, and Forfeitures Officer may cancel liquidated damages assessed against the guaranteeing association to the extent authorized by paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The domestic guaranteeing association shall be jointly and severally liable with the initial bonded carrier for pecuniary penalties, liquidated damages, duties, and taxes accruing to the United States and any other charges imposed as the result of any shortage, irregular delivery, or nondelitery at the port of destination or port of exit of merchandise covered by an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet. However, the liability of the guaranteeing association shall not exceed the amount of the import duties by more than 10 percent. If an A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet is unconditionally discharged with respect to certain goods, the guaranteeing association will no longer be liable on the carnet with respect to those goods unless it is subsequently discovered that the discharge of the carnet was obtained fraudulently or improperly or that there has been a breach of the conditions of temporary admission or of transit. No claim for payment shall be made more than one year following the date of expiration of the validity of the carnet. The guaranteeing association shall be allowed a period of six months from the date of any claim by the port director in which to furnish proof of the reexportation of the goods or of any other proper discharge of the A.T.A. or TECRO/AIT carnet. If such proof is not furnished within the time specified, the guranteeing association shall either deposit or provisionally pay the sums. The deposit or payment shall become final three months after the date of the deposit or payment, during which time the guaranteeing association may still furnish proof of the reexportation of

the goods to recover the sums deposited or paid.
