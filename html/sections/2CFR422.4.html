                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Before USDA will rely on a research institution to conduct an  inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of an allegation in accordance  with this part, the research institution where the research misconduct  is alleged must provide the ARIO its policies and procedures related to  research misconduct at the institution. The research institution has the  option of providing either a written copy of such policies and  procedures or a Web site address where such policies and procedures can  be accessed. The ARIO to whom the policies and procedures were made  available shall convene a panel comprised of the USDA RIO and ARIOs from  the Forest Service, the Agricultural Research Service, and the National  Institute of Food and Agriculture. The Panel will review the research  institution's policies and procedures for compliance with the OSTP  Policy and render a decision regarding the research institution's  ability to adequately resolve research misconduct allegations. The ARIO  will inform the research institution of the Panel's determination that  its inquiry, investigation, and adjudication procedures are sufficient.  If the Panel determines that the research institution does not have  sufficient policies and procedures in place to conduct inquiry,  investigation, and adjudication proceedings, or that the research  institution is in any way unfit or unprepared to handle the inquiry,  investigation, and adjudication   in a prompt, unbiased, fair, and independent manner, the ARIO will  inform the research institution in writing of the Panel's decision. An  appropriate USDA agency, as determined by the Panel, will then conduct  the inquiry, investigation, and adjudication of research misconduct in  accordance with this part. If an allegation of research misconduct is  made regarding extramural research conducted at a Federal research  institution (whether USDA or not), it is presumed that the Federal  research institution has research misconduct procedures consistent with  the OSTP Policy. USDA reserves the right to convene the Panel to assess  the sufficiency of a Federal agency's research misconduct procedures,  should there be any question whether the agency's procedures will ensure  a fair, unbiased, equitable, and independent inquiry, investigation, and  adjudication process.</p>
