                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any fishing vessel of the United States used for commercial  fishing for HMS on the high seas in the Convention Area must have on  board a valid high seas fishing permit, or a copy thereof, that has a  valid WCPFC Area Endorsement, or a copy thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. Only a fishing vessel that has a valid high seas  fishing permit is eligible to receive a WCPFC Area Endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A WCPFC Area Endorsement may be applied for at  the same time the underlying high seas permit is applied for, or at any  time thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of a high seas fishing vessel may apply  for a WCPFC Area Endorsement by completing an application form,  available from the Pacific Islands Regional Administrator, and  submitting the complete and accurate application, signed by the  applicant, to the Pacific Islands Regional Administrator, along with the  required fees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The application must be accompanied by a bow-to-stern side-view  photograph of the vessel in its current form and appearance. The  photograph must meet the specifications prescribed on the application  form and clearly show that the vessel is marked   in accordance with the vessel identification requirements of Sec.  300.217.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fees. NMFS will charge a fee to recover the administrative  expenses of issuance of a WCPFC Area Endorsement. The amount of the fee  will be determined in accordance with the procedures of the NOAA Finance  Handbook, available from the Pacific Islands Regional Administrator, for  determining administrative costs of each special product or service. The  fee is specified in the application form. The appropriate fee must  accompany each application. Failure to pay the fee will preclude  issuance of the WCPFC Area Endorsement. Payment by a commercial  instrument later determined to be insufficiently funded is grounds for  invalidating the WCPFC Area Endorsement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Pacific Islands Regional Administrator will  issue a WCPFC Area Endorsement within 30 days of receipt of a complete  application that meets the requirements of this section and upon payment  of the appropriate fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an incomplete or improperly completed application is  submitted, the Pacific Islands Regional Administrator will notify the  applicant of such deficiency within 30 days of the date of receipt of  the application. If the applicant fails to correct the deficiency and  send a complete and accurate application to the Pacific Islands Regional  Administrator within 30 days of the date of the notification of  deficiency, the application will be considered withdrawn and no further  action will be taken to process the application. Following withdrawal,  the applicant may at any time submit a new application for  consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Validity. A WCPFC Area Endorsement issued under this subpart  expires upon the expiration of the underlying high seas fishing permit,  and shall be void whenever the underlying high seas fishing permit is  void, suspended, sanctioned or revoked. A WCPFC Area Endorsement is also  subject to suspension or revocation independent of the high seas fishing  permit. Renewal of a WCPFC Area Endorsement prior to its expiration is  the responsibility of the WCPFC Area Endorsement holder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Change in application information. Any change in the required  information provided in an approved or pending application for a WCPFC  Area Endorsement must be reported by the vessel owner or operator to the  Pacific Islands Regional Administrator in writing within 15 days of such  change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Transfer. A WCPFC Area Endorsement issued under this subpart is  valid only for the vessel, owner, and high seas fishing permit to which  it is issued and is not transferable or assignable to another high seas  fishing permit or to another vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Display. A valid WCPFC Area Endorsement, or a photocopy or  facsimile copy thereof, issued under this subpart must be on board the  vessel and available for inspection by any authorized officer while the  vessel is at sea and must be available for inspection by any WCPFC  inspector while the vessel is on the high seas in the Convention Area.
