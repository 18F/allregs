                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. When the Secretary notifies a treatment program in writing that its certification has been immediately suspended, the appellant may request an expedited review of the suspension and any proposed revocation. The appellant must submit this request in writing to the reviewing official within 10 days of the date the OTP received notice of the suspension. The request for review must include a copy of the suspension and any proposed revocation, a brief statement of why the decision to suspend and propose revocation is incorrect, and the appellant's request for an oral presentation, if desired. A copy of the request for review must also be sent to the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reviewing official's response. As soon as practicable after the request for review is received, the reviewing official will send an acknowledgment with a copy to the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review file and briefs. Within 10 days of the date the request for review is received, but no later than 2 days before an oral presentation, each party shall submit to the reviewing official the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A review file containing essential documents relevant to the review, tabbed, indexed, and organized chronologically; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A written statement, not to exceed 20 double-spaced pages, explaining the party's position concerning the suspension and any proposed revocation. No reply brief is permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Oral presentation. If an oral presentation is requested by the appellant or otherwise granted by the reviewing official in accordance with Sec.  8.27(a), the presiding official will attempt to schedule the oral presentation within 20 to 30 days of the date of appellant's request for review at a time and place determined by the presiding official following consultation with the parties. The presiding official may hold a pre-hearing conference in accordance with Sec.  8.27(c) and will conduct the oral presentation in accordance with the procedures of Sec. Sec.  8.27(e), (f), and (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Written decision. The reviewing official shall issue a written decision upholding or denying the suspension or proposed revocation and will attempt to issue the decision within 7 to 10 days of the date of the oral presentation or within 3 days of the date on which the transcript is received or the date of the last submission by either party, whichever is later. All other provisions set forth in Sec.  8.33 apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Transmission of written communications. Because of the importance of timeliness for these expedited procedures, all written communications between the parties and between either party and the reviewing official shall be sent by facsimile transmission, personal service, or commercial overnight delivery service.</p>
