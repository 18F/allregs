(Note: the treatment residuals generated by these activities may be subject to the requirements of this part.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The closed-vent system and control device shall be designed and operated in accordance with Sec. 61.349 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Each cover seal, access hatch, and all other openings shall be checked by visual inspection initially and quarterly thereafter to ensure that no cracks or gaps occur and that access hatches and other openings are closed and gasketed properly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 61.350 of this subpart, when a broken seal or gasket or other problem is identified, or when detectable emissions are measured, first efforts at repair shall be made as soon as practicable, but not later than 15 calendar days after identification.
