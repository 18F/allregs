                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(5)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(iv)</em>  of this section for each dryer associated with such a work station:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the  manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that  provides a record indicating whether the exhaust stream from the dryer  was directed to the control device or was diverted from the control  device. The time and flow control position must be recorded at least  once per hour, as well as every time the flow direction is changed. The  flow control position indicator shall be installed at the entrance to  any bypass line that could divert the exhaust stream away from the  control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car- seal or a lock-and-key type configuration; a visual inspection of the  seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month  to ensure that the valve or damper is maintained in the closed position  and the exhaust stream is not diverted through the bypass line.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that any bypass line valve or damper is in the closed  position through continuous monitoring of valve position. The monitoring  system shall be inspected at least once every month to ensure that it is  functioning properly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use an automatic shutdown system in which the press is stopped  when flow is diverted away from the control device to any bypass line.  The automatic system shall be inspected at least once every month to  ensure that it is functioning properly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All continuous emission monitors shall comply with performance  specifications (PS) 8 or 9 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix B, as  appropriate. The requirements of appendix F of 40 CFR part 60 shall also  be followed. In conducting the quarterly audits required by appendix F,  owners or operators must challenge the monitors with compounds  representative of the gaseous emission stream being controlled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All temperature monitoring equipment shall be installed,  calibrated, maintained, and operated according to manufacturers  specifications. The calibration of the chart recorder, data logger, or  temperature indicator shall be verified every three months; or the chart  recorder, data logger, or temperature indicator shall be replaced. The  replacement shall be done either if the owner or operator chooses not to  perform the calibration, or if the equipment cannot be calibrated  properly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An owner or operator complying with Sec. Sec.  63.824-63.825  through continuous emission monitoring of a control device shall  install, calibrate, operate, and maintain continuous emission monitors  to measure total organic volatile matter concentration and volumetric  gas flow rate in accordance with Sec.  63.824(b)(1)(ii), Sec.   63.825(b)(2)(ii), Sec.  63.825(c)(2), or Sec.  63.825(d)(2), as  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An owner or operator complying with the requirements of  Sec. Sec.  63.824-63.825 through the use of an oxidizer and  demonstrating continuous compliance through monitoring of an oxidizer  operating parameter shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an oxidizer other than a catalytic oxidizer, install,  calibrate, operate, and maintain a temperature monitoring device  equipped with a continuous recorder. The device shall have an accuracy  of q1 percent of the temperature being monitored in  +C or q1 +C, whichever is greater. The  thermocouple or temperature sensor shall be installed in the combustion  chamber at a location in the combustion zone.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a catalytic oxidizer, install, calibrate, operate, and  maintain a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous  recorder. The device shall be capable of monitoring temperature with an  accuracy of q1 percent of the temperature being monitored in  +C or q1 +C, whichever is greater. The  thermocouple or temperature sensor shall be installed in the vent stream  at the nearest feasible point to the catalyst bed inlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An owner or operator complying with the requirements of  Sec. Sec.  63.824-63.825 through the use of a control device and  demonstrating continuous compliance by monitoring an operating parameter   to ensure that the capture efficiency measured during the initial  compliance test is maintained, shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit to the Administrator with the compliance status report  required by Sec.  63.9(h) of the General Provisions, a plan that</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identifies the operating parameter to be monitored to ensure  that the capture efficiency measured during the initial compliance test  is maintained,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Discusses why this parameter is appropriate for demonstrating  ongoing compliance, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Identifies the specific monitoring procedures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Set the operating parameter value, or range of values, that  demonstrate compliance with Sec. Sec.  63.824-63.825, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct monitoring in accordance with the plan submitted to  the Administrator unless comments received from the Administrator  require an alternate monitoring scheme.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any excursion from the required operating parameters which are  monitored in accordance with paragraphs (a)(4) and (a)(5) of this  section, unless otherwise excused, shall be considered a violation of  the emission standard.
