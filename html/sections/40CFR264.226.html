                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During construction and installation, liners (except in the case of existing portions of surface impoundments exempt from Sec. 264.221(a)) and cover systems (e.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage, and imperfections (e.g., holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign materials). Immediately after construction or installation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Synthetic liners and covers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Soil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes, or other structural non-uniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or cover.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While a surface impoundment is in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of overtopping control systems;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sudden drops in the level of the impoundment's contents; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Severe erosion or other signs of deterioration in dikes or other containment devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prior to the issuance of a permit, and after any extended period of time (at least six months) during which the impoundment was not in service, the owner or operator must obtain a certification from a qualified engineer that the impoundment's dike, including that portion of any dike which provides freeboard, has structural integrity. The certification must establish, in particular, that the dike:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Will withstand the stress of the pressure exerted by the types and amounts of wastes to be placed in the impoundment; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Will not fail due to scouring or piping, without dependence on any liner system included in the surface impoundment construction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under Sec. 264.221 (c) or (d) must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator required to have a leak detection system under Sec. 264.221 (c) or (d) must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at least once each week during the active life and closure period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the final cover is installed, the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded at least monthly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of liquids in the sumps must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time during the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at units on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator must return to monthly recording of amounts of liquids removed from each sump until the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two consecutive months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Pump operating level'' is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and approved by the Regional Administrator based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the sump.
