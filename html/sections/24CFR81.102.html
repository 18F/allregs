                                Sec. 81.102  Verification and enforcement to ensure GSE data integrity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Independent verification authority. The Secretary may  independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the data,  information, and reports provided by each GSE, including conducting on- site verification, when such steps are reasonably related to determining  whether a GSE is complying with 12 U.S.C. 4541-4589 and the GSE's  Charter Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The senior officer of each GSE who is  responsible for submitting to HUD the fourth quarter Annual Mortgage  Report and the AHAR under sections 309(m) and (n) of the Fannie Mae  Charter Act or sections 307(e) and (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, as  applicable, or for submitting to the Secretary such other report(s),  data, or information for which certification is requested in writing by  the Secretary, shall certify such report(s), data or information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The certification shall state as follows: ``To the best of my  knowledge and belief, the information provided herein is true, correct  and complete.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary determines that a GSE has failed to provide the  certification required by paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section,  or that a GSE has provided the certification required by paragraph (b)  in connection with data, information or report(s) that the Secretary  later determines are not true, correct and complete, the Secretary may  pursue the enforcement remedies under paragraph (e) of this section. For  data, information or report(s) subject to paragraphs (c) or (d)   of this section, the Secretary may pursue the enforcement remedies  described in paragraph (e) only in connection with material errors,  omissions or discrepancies as those terms are defined in Sec. 81.102(c)  or (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Verification procedure and adjustment to correct errors,  omissions or discrepancies in AHAR data for the immediately preceding  year. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This paragraph (c) pertains to the GSEs' submission of year- end data. For purposes of this paragraph, ``year-end data'' means data  that HUD receives from the GSEs related to housing goals performance in  the immediately preceding year and covering data reported in the fourth  quarter Annual Mortgage Report and the GSE's AHAR. An ``error'' means a  technical mistake, such as a mistake in coding or calculating data. An  ``omission'' means a GSE's failure to count units in the denominator. A  ``discrepancy'' means any difference between HUD's analysis of data and  the analysis contained in a GSE's submission of data, including a  discrepancy in goal or Special Affordable subgoal performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If HUD finds errors, omissions or discrepancies in a GSE's year- end data submissions relative to HUD's regulations, HUD will first  notify the GSE by telephone or e-mail transmission of each such error,  omission or discrepancy. The GSE must respond within five working days  of each such notification. HUD may, in its discretion or upon a request  by a GSE within the five working day period, extend the response period  for up to an additional 20 working days. Information exchanges during  the five working day period following initial notification, and any  subsequent extensions of time that may be granted, may be by electronic  mail. Any person with delegated authority from the Secretary, or the  Director of HUD's Financial Institution Regulation Division, or his or  her designee, shall be responsible for issuing initial notifications  regarding errors, omissions, or discrepancies; making determinations on  the adequacy of responses received; approving any extensions of time  permitted under this provision; and managing the data verification  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If each error, omission or discrepancy is not resolved to HUD's  satisfaction during the initial five working day period from  notification, and any extension period, the Secretary will notify the  GSE in writing and seek clarification or additional information to  correct the error, omission or discrepancy. The GSE shall have 10  working days (or such longer period as the Secretary may establish, not  to exceed 30 working days) from the date of the Secretary's written  notice to respond in writing to the notice. If the GSE fails to submit a  written response to the Secretary within this period, or if the  Secretary determines that the GSE's written response fails to correct or  otherwise resolve each error, omission or discrepancy in its reported  year-end data to the Secretary's satisfaction, the Secretary will  determine the appropriate adjustments to the numerator and the  denominator of the applicable housing goal(s) and Special Affordable  subgoal(s) due to the GSE's failure to provide the Secretary with  accurate submissions of data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Secretary, or his or her designee, shall inform a GSE in  writing, at least five working days prior to HUD's release of its  official performance figures to the public, of HUD's determination of  official goals performance figures, including any adjustments. During  the five working days prior to such public release, a GSE may request,  in writing, a reconsideration of HUD's final determination of its  performance and must provide the basis for requesting the  reconsideration. If the request is granted, the Secretary will consider  the GSE's request for reconsideration of its determination of goals  performance and make a final determination regarding the GSE's  performance, within 10 working days of the Secretary's granting of the  GSE's written request for reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Should the Secretary determine that additional enforcement  action against the GSE is warranted for material errors, omissions or  discrepancies with regard to a housing goal or Special Affordable  subgoal, it may pursue additional remedies under paragraph (e) of this  section. An error, omission or discrepancy is material if it results in  an overstatement of credit for a   housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal, and, without such  overstatement, the GSE would have failed to meet such housing goal or  Special Affordable subgoal for the immediately preceding year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustment to correct prior year reporting errors, omissions or  discrepancies--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The Secretary may require a GSE to correct a  material error, omission or discrepancy in a GSE's prior year's data  reported in the fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report and the GSE's AHAR  under sections 309(m) and (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act or sections  307(e) and (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, as applicable. An error, omission  or discrepancy is material if it results in an overstatement of credit  for a housing goal or Special Affordable subgoal and, without such  overstatement, the GSE would have failed to meet such housing goal or  Special Affordable subgoal for the prior year. A ``prior year'' for  purposes of this section is any one of the two years immediately  preceding the latest year for which data on housing goals performance  was reported to HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedural requirements. In the event the Secretary determines  that a GSE's prior year's fourth quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR  contain a material error, omission or discrepancy, the Secretary will  provide the GSE with an initial letter containing written findings and  determinations within 24 months of the end of the relevant GSE reporting  year. The GSE shall have an opportunity, not to exceed 30 days from the  date of receipt of the Secretary's initial letter, to respond in writing  with supporting documentation, to contest the Secretary's initial  determination that there was a material error, omission or discrepancy  in a prior year's data. The Secretary shall then issue a final  determination letter within 60 days of the date of HUD's receipt of the  GSE's written response or, if no response is received, within 90 days of  the date of the GSE's receipt of the Secretary's initial letter. The  Secretary may extend the period for issuing a final determination letter  by an additional 30 days and may grant the GSE an opportunity, for a  period not to exceed 10 working days from the date of the GSE's receipt  of the determination letter to request that the determination be  reconsidered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Secretary determines that a GSE's prior year's fourth  quarter Annual Mortgage Report or AHAR contained a material error,  omission or discrepancy, the Secretary may direct the GSE to correct the  overstatement by purchasing mortgages to finance the number of units  that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year's goal  performance (or, for the Special Affordable subgoal, the number or  dollar amount, as applicable, of mortgage purchases that HUD has  determined were overstated), or that equal the percentage of the  overstatement in the prior year's goal or Special Affordable subgoal  performance as applied to the most current year-end performance,  whichever is less. Units or mortgages purchased to remedy an  overstatement in the housing goals or the Special Affordable subgoal  must be eligible to qualify under the same goal or Special Affordable  subgoal that HUD has determined were overstated in the prior year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a GSE does not purchase a sufficient amount or type of  mortgages to meet the requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(3) of this  section as directed by the Secretary by no later than the end of the  calendar year immediately following the year in which the Secretary  notifies the GSE of such overstatement (unless, upon written request  from the GSE, the Secretary, in his or her discretion, determines that a  grant of additional time is appropriate to correct or compensate for the  overstatement) the Department may pursue any or all of the following  remedies:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Issue a notice that the GSE has failed a housing goal or Special  Affordable subgoal in the prior year;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Seek additional enforcement remedies under paragraph (e) of  this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Pursue any other civil or administrative remedies as are  available to it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional enforcement options--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. In the event the  Secretary determines, either as a result of his or her independent  verification authority   described in paragraph (a) of this section, or by the authority set  forth in paragraphs (b), (c) or (d) of this section, that any of the  following circumstances has occurred with respect to data, information  or report(s) required by sections 309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae  Charter Act, sections 307(e) or (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, or subpart E  of this part, the Secretary may regard this as a GSE's failure to submit  such data, information or report(s) and, accordingly, the Secretary may  take the additional enforcement actions authorized by paragraph (e)(2)  of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A GSE fails to submit the certification required by paragraphs  (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section in connection with such data,  information or report(s); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A GSE submits the certification required by paragraph (b) of  this section, but the Secretary later determines that the data,  information or report(s) are not true, correct and complete. For data,  information or report(s) subject to paragraphs (c) or (d) of this  section, the Secretary may pursue the additional enforcement remedies  under paragraph (e)(2) only in connection with material errors,  omissions or discrepancies, as those terms are defined in Sec.  81.102(c) or (d). In addition, the Secretary may only pursue such  remedies in connection with material errors, omissions or discrepancies  arising under paragraph (d) of this section if the GSE has failed to  purchase a sufficient amount or type of mortgages, as provided in  paragraphs (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remedies. (i) Submissions required under the GSE's charter acts.  After the Secretary makes a determination under paragraph (e)(1) of this  section that any of the circumstances described in paragraphs (e)(1)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  or (ii) has occurred with respect to data, information, or report(s)  required by sections 309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act, or by  sections 307(e) or (f) of the Freddie Mac Act, the Secretary may pursue  any or all of the following remedies in accordance with paragraph  (e)(3), or applicable law, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A cease-and-desist order against the GSE for failing to submit  the required data, information or report(s) in accordance with this  section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Civil money penalties against the GSE for failing to submit the  required data, information or report(s) in accordance with this section;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any other civil or administrative remedies or penalties against  the GSE that may be available to the Secretary by virtue of the GSE's  failing to submit or certify the required data, information or report(s)  in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  has occurred with respect to data, information or report(s) required  under subpart E of this part (but that are not required by sections  309(m) or (n) of the Fannie Mae Charter Act or by sections 307(e) or (f)  of the Freddie Mac Act), the Secretary may pursue any civil or  administrative remedies or penalties against the GSE that may be  available to the Secretary. The Secretary shall pursue such remedies  under applicable law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures. The Secretary shall comply with the procedures set  forth in subpart G of this part in connection with any enforcement  action that he or she may initiate against a GSE under paragraph (e) of  this section.
