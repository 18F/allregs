under the ``Freedom of Information Act.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requesters must describe the records sought in sufficient detail to enable Agency personnel who are familiar with the subject area of the request to identify and locate the record with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible, requesters should include specific information that may assist a FOIA office in identifying the requested records, such as the date, title or name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record, case number, file designation, or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought, the FOIA office shall inform the requester of what additional information is needed or why the request is deficient. The FOIA office will also notify the requester that it will not be able to comply with the FOIA request unless the additional information requested is provided within 20 working days from the date of the letter. If the additional information is not provided within that timeframe, the request will be closed without further notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If after being asked to clarify a request, the requester provides additional information to the FOIA office but fails to provide sufficient details or information to allow the FOIA office to ascertain exactly what records are being requested and locate them, or in general to process the request, the FOIA office will notify the requester that the request has not been properly made and the request will be closed. The FOIA office will advise him/her that they may submit a new request for the information; however, the requester will need to provide more detailed information to allow processing of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> NASA need not comply with a blanket or categorical request (such as ``all matters relating to'' a general subject) where it is not reasonably feasible to determine what record is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> NASA will in good faith attempt to identify and locate the record(s) sought and will consult with the requester when necessary and appropriate for that purpose in accordance with these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> NASA is not required to create or compile records in response to a FOIA request.</p>
