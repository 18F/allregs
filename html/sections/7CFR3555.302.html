The lender must determine that any repairs funded by protective advances are cost effective. Repairs funded by protective advances must be planned, performed and inspected in accordance with Sec. 3555.202 and as further described by the Agency. The lender must obtain prior Agency concurrence or a waiver of concurrence as provided for in Sec. 3555.301(h) before issuing protective advances under this paragraph only for protective advances of a significant amount as specified by the Agency.</p>
