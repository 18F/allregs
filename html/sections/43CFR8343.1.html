These standards include, among others, the requirements that: (1) The spark arrester shall have an efficiency to retain or destroy at least 80 percent of carbon particles for all flow rates, and (2) the spark arrester has been warranted by its manufacturer as meeting this efficiency requirement for at least 1,000 hours subject to normal use, with maintenance and mounting in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendation. A spark arrester is not required when an off-road vehicle is being operated in an area which has 3 or more inches of snow on the ground.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vehicles operating during night hours, from a half-hour after sunset to a half-hour before sunrise, shall comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Headlights shall be of sufficient power to illuminate an object at 300 feet at night under normal, clear atmospheric conditions.
