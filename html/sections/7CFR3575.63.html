                            <p class="depth0">The Loan Note Guarantee will not be issued until:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The lender certifies that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No changes have been made in the lender's loan conditions and  requirements since the issuance of the Conditional Commitment for  Guarantee except those approved in the interim by the Agency in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All planned property acquisition has been completed and all  development has been substantially completed in accordance with plans,  specifications, and applicable building codes. No costs have exceeded  the amounts approved by the lender and the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Required insurance is in effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All equal opportunity and Fair Housing Plan requirements have  been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The loan has been properly closed and the required security  instruments have been obtained on any after-acquired property that  cannot be covered initially under State statutory provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The borrower has marketable title to the collateral then owned  by the borrower, subject to the instrument securing the loan to be  guaranteed and subject to any other exceptions approved, in writing, by  the Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> When required, the entire amount of the loan for working capital  has been disbursed except in cases where the Agency has approved  disbursement over an extended time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> All other requirements of the Conditional Commitment for  Guarantee have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Lien priorities are consistent with requirements of the  Conditional Commitment for Guarantee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The loan proceeds have been disbursed for purposes and in  amounts consistent with the Conditional Commitment for Guarantee and as  specified on the application for the guaranteed loan. A copy of a  detailed statement by the lender detailing the use of loan funds will be  attached to support this certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> There has been no substantive adverse change in the borrower's  financial condition nor any other adverse change in the borrower during  the period of time from the Agency's issuance of the Conditional  Commitment for Guarantee to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. The  lender's certification must address all adverse changes of the borrower  and the guarantors. For purposes of this paragraph,   the term borrower includes any parent, affiliate, or subsidiary of the  borrower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> All Federal, State, and local design and construction  requirements have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The lender understands and will meet the requirements of the  Debt Collection Act (chapter 37 of title 31 of the United States Code).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The lender would not make the loan without an Agency guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The lender has executed and delivered the Lender's Agreement and  closing report for the guaranteed loan along with the appropriate  guarantee fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The lender has advised the Agency of plans to sell or assign any  part of the loan as provided in the Lender's Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where applicable, the lender must certify that the borrower has  obtained:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A legal opinion relative to the title to rights-of-way and  easements. Lenders are responsible for ensuring that borrowers have  obtained valid, continuous, and adequate rights-of-way and easements  needed for the construction, operation, and maintenance of a facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A title opinion or title insurance showing ownership of the land  and all mortgages or other lien defects, restrictions, or encumbrances,  if any. It is the responsibility of the lender to ensure that the  borrower has obtained and recorded such releases, consents, or  subordinations to such property rights from holders of outstanding liens  or other instruments as may be necessary for the construction,  operation, and maintenance of the facility and to provide the required  security. For example, when a site is for major structures for utility- type facilities (such as a gas distribution system) and the lender and  borrower are able to obtain only a right-of-way or easement on such a  site rather than a fee simple title, such a title opinion must be  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For loans exceeding $150,000, the lender has certified its  compliance with the Anti-Lobby Act (18 U.S.C. 1913). Also, if any funds  have been, or will be, paid to any person for influencing or attempting  to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a Member of Congress,  an officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a Member of  Congress in connection with this commitment providing for the United  States to guarantee a loan, the lender shall completely disclose such  lobbying activities in accordance with 31 U.S.C. 1352.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the Loan Note Guarantee cannot be issued before the  Conditional Commitment expires, the lender must submit a written request  for an extension of the expiration date. The lender must document and  certify to paragraph (a)(1) and (a)(11) of this section specifically  identifying any modifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Coincident with, or immediately after, loan closing, the lender  will contact the Agency and provide those documents and certifications  required in this section. For loans to public bodies, lenders may  require an opinion from recognized bond counsel regarding the adequacy  of the preparation and issuance of the debt instruments. Only when the  Agency is satisfied that all conditions for the guarantee have been met  will the Loan Note Guarantee be executed.</p>
