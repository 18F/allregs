                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(5)</em> of  this section for each hour in which quality-assured data from the outlet  SO2 and/or NOX monitoring system(s) are not  obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator may use the missing data substitution  procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 75.31 through 75.33   to provide substitute data for any missing data hour(s) in which the  add-on emission controls are documented to be operating properly, as  described in the quality assurance/quality control program for the unit,  required by section 1 in appendix B of this part. To provide the  necessary documentation, the owner or operator shall, for each missing  data period, record parametric data to verify the proper operation of  the SO2 or NOX add-on emission controls during  each hour, as described in paragraph (d) of this section. For any  missing data hour(s) in which such parametric data are either not  provided or, if provided, do not demonstrate that proper operation of  the SO2 or NOX add-on emission controls has been  maintained, the owner or operator shall substitute (as applicable) the  maximum potential NOX concentration (MPC) as defined in  section 2.1.2.1 of appendix A to this part, the maximum potential  NOX emission rate, as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter,  or the maximum potential concentration for SO2, as defined by  section 2.1.1.1. Alternatively, for SO2 or NOX,  the owner or operator may substitute, if available, the hourly  SO2 or NOX concentration recorded by a certified  inlet monitor, in lieu of the MPC. For each hour in which data from an  inlet monitor are reported, the owner or operator shall use a method of  determination code (MODC) of ``22'' (see Table 4a in Sec. 75.57). In  addition, under Sec. 75.64(c), the designated representative shall  submit as part of each electronic quarterly report, a certification  statement, verifying the proper operation of the SO2 or  NOX add-on emission control for each missing data period in  which the missing data procedures of Sec. Sec. 75.31 through 75.33 were  applied; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, applies only to a unit which, as  provided in Sec. 75.74(a) or Sec. 75.74(b)(1), reports NOX  mass emissions on a year-round basis under a state or Federal  NOX mass emissions reduction program that adopts the  emissions monitoring provisions of this part. If the add-on  NOX emission controls installed on such a unit are operated  only during the ozone season or are operated in a more efficient manner  during the ozone season than outside the ozone season, the owner or  operator may implement the missing data provisions of paragraph (a)(1)  of this section in the following alternative manner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The historical, quality-assured NOX emission rate or  NOX concentration data may be separated into two categories,  i.e., data recorded inside the ozone season and data recorded outside  the ozone season;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purposes of the missing data lookback periods described  under Sec. Sec. 75.33 (c)(1), (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(5) of this section,  the substitute data values shall be taken from the appropriate database,  depending on the date(s) and hour(s) of the missing data period. That  is, if the missing data period occurs inside the ozone season, the ozone  season data shall be used to provide substitute data. If the missing  data period occurs outside the ozone season, data from outside the ozone  season shall be used to provide substitute data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A missing data period that begins outside the ozone season and  continues into the ozone season shall be considered to be two separate  missing data periods, one ending on April 30, hour 23, and the other  beginning on May 1, hour 00;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For missing data hours outside the ozone season, the procedures  of Sec. 75.33 may be applied unconditionally, i.e., documentation of the  operational status of the emission controls is not required in order to  apply the standard missing data routines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data  availability for SO2 or NOX, calculated in  accordance with Sec. 75.32, is less than 90.0 percent and is greater  than or equal to 80.0 percent; and parametric data establishes that the  add-on emission controls were operating properly (i.e. within the range  of operating parameters provided in the quality assurance/quality  control program) during the hour, the owner or operator may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Replace the maximum SO2 concentration recorded in the  720 quality-assured monitor operating hours immediately preceding the  missing data period, with the maximum controlled SO2 concentration  recorded in the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Replace the maximum NOX concentration(s) or  NOX emission rate(s) from the appropriate load bin(s) (based  on a lookback through the 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours  immediately preceding the missing data period), with the maximum  controlled NOX concentration(s) or emission rate(s) from the  appropriate load bin(s) in the same 2,160 quality-assured monitor  operating hour lookback period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designated representative may petition the Administrator  under Sec. 75.66 for approval of site-specific parametric monitoring  procedure(s) for calculating substitute data for missing SO2  pollutant concentration, NOX pollutant concentration, and  NOX emission rate data in accordance with the requirements of  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and appendix C to this part. The  owner or operator shall record the data required in appendix C to this  part, pursuant to Sec. 75.58(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each missing data hour in which the percent monitor data  availability for SO2 or NOX, calculated in  accordance with Sec. 75.32, is below 80.0 percent and parametric data  establish that the add-on emission controls were operating properly  (i.e. within the range of operating parameters provided in the quality  assurance/quality control program),in lieu of reporting the maximum  potential value, the owner or operator may substitute, as applicable,  the greater of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum expected SO2 concentration or 1.25 times  the maximum hourly controlled SO2 concentration recorded in  the previous 720 quality-assured monitor operating hours;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum expected NOX concentration or 1.25 times  the maximum hourly controlled NOX concentration recorded in  the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor operating hours at the  corresponding unit load range or operational bin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The maximum controlled hourly NOX emission rate  (MCR) or 1.25 times the maximum hourly controlled NOX  emission rate recorded in the previous 2,160 quality-assured monitor  operating hours at the corresponding unit load range or operational bin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For the purposes of implementing the missing data options in  paragraphs (a)(5)(i) through (a)(5)(iii) of this section, the maximum  expected SO2 and NOX concentrations shall be  determined, respectively, according to sections 2.1.1.2 and 2.1.2.2 of  appendix A to this part. The MCR shall be calculated according to the  basic procedure described in section 2.1.2.1(b) of appendix A to this  part, except that the words ``maximum potential NOX emission  rate (MER)'' shall be replaced with the words ``maximum controlled  NOX emission rate (MCR)'' and the NOX MEC shall be  used instead of the NOX MPC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For an affected unit equipped with add-on SO2  emission controls, the designated representative may petition the  Administrator to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described  in appendix C of this part, for calculating substitute SO2  concentration data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall  use the procedures in Sec. Sec. 75.31, 75.33, or 75.34(a) for providing  substitute data for missing SO2 concentration data unless a  parametric monitoring procedure has been approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the monitor data availability is 90.0 percent or more for  an outlet SO2 pollutant concentration monitor, the owner or  operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric  monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, even if the Administrator has approved a  parametric monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For an affected unit with NOX add-on emission  controls, the designated representative may petition the Administrator  to approve a parametric monitoring procedure, as described in appendix C  of this part, in order to calculate substitute NOX emission  rate data for missing data periods. The owner or operator shall use the  procedures in Sec. 75.31 or 75.33 for providing substitute data for  missing NOX emission rate data prior to receiving the  Administrator's approval for a parametric monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where monitor data availability for a NOX continuous  emission monitoring system is 90.0 percent or more, the owner or  operator may calculate substitute data using an approved parametric  monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, even if the Administrator has approved a  parametric monitoring procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In order to implement the options in paragraphs (a)(1), (a)(3)  and (a)(5) of this section; and Sec. Sec. 75.31(c)(3) and 75.72(c)(3),  the owner or operator shall keep records of information as described in  Sec. 75.58(b)(3) to verify the proper operation of all add-on  SO2 or NOX emission controls, during all periods  of SO2 or NOX emission missing data. If the owner  or operator elects to implement the missing data option in paragraph  (a)(2) of this section, the records in Sec. 75.58(b)(3) are required to  be kept only for the ozone season. The owner or operator shall document  in the quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) program required by  section 1 of appendix B to this part, the parameters monitored and (as  applicable) the ranges and combinations of parameters that indicate  proper operation of the controls. The owner or operator shall provide  the information recorded under Sec. 75.58(b)(3) and the related QA/QC  program information to the Administrator, to the EPA Regional Office, or  to the appropriate State or local agency, upon request.
