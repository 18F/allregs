                                Sec. 10.196  Cost or value of materials produced in a beneficiary
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ``Materials produced in a beneficiary country or countries''  defined. For purposes of Sec. 10.195, the words ``materials produced in  a beneficiary country or countries'' refer to those materials  incorporated in an article which are either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary  country or two or more beneficiary countries; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to the limitations set forth in Sec. 10.195(a),  substantially transformed in any beneficiary country or two or more  beneficiary countries into a new or different article of commerce which  is then used in any beneficiary country in the production or manufacture  of a new or different article which is imported directly into the U.S.</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in one  beneficiary country is sent to another beneficiary country where it is  tanned to create nonperishable ``crust leather''. The tanned product is  then imported directly into the U.S. Because the material of which the  imported article is composed is wholly the growth, product, or  manufacture of one of more beneficiary countries, the entire cost or  value of that material may be counted toward the 35 percent value  requirement set forth in Sec. 10.195.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in a non- beneficiary country is sent to a beneficiary country where it is tanned  to create nonperishable ``crust leather''. The tanned skin is then  imported directly into the U.S. Although the tanned skin represents a  new or different article of commerce produced in a beneficiary country  within the meaning of Sec. 10.195(a), the cost or value of the raw skin  may not be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement because (1)  the tanned material of which the imported article is composed is not  wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of a beneficiary country and  (2) the tanning operation creates the imported article itself rather  than an intermediate article which is then used in the beneficiary  country in the production or manufacture of an article imported into the  U.S. The tanned skin would be eligible for duty-free treatment only if  the direct costs attributable to the tanning operation represent at  least 35 percent of the appraised value of the imported article.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in a non- beneficiary country is sent to a beneficiary country where it is   tanned to create nonperishable ``crust leather''. The tanned material is  then cut, sewn and assembled with a metal buckle imported from a non- beneficiary country to create a finished belt which is imported directly  into the U.S. Because the operations performed in the beneficiary  country involved both the substantial transformation of the raw skin  into a new or different article and the use of that intermediate article  in the production or manufacture of a new or different article imported  into the U.S., the cost or value of the tanned material used to make the  imported article may be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement.  The cost or value of the metal buckle imported into the beneficiary  country may not be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement  because the buckle was not substantially transformed in the beneficiary  country into a new or different article prior to its incorporation in  the finished belt.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. A raw, perishable skin of an animal grown in the U.S.  Virgin Islands is sent to a beneficiary country where it is tanned to  create nonperishable ``crust leather'', which is then imported directly  into the U.S. The tanned skin represents a new or different article of  commerce produced in a beneficiary country within the meaning of Sec.  10.195(a), and under Sec. 10.195(b), the raw skin from which the tanned  product was made is considered to have been grown in a beneficiary  country for the purpose of applying the 35 percent value requirement.  The tanned material of which the imported article is composed is  considered to be wholly the growth, product, or manufacture of one or  more beneficiary countries with the result that the entire cost or value  of that material may be counted toward the 35 percent value requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Questionable origin. When the origin of a material either is not  ascertainable or is not satisfactorily demonstrated to the port  director, the material shall not be considered to have been grown,  produced, or manufactured in a beneficiary country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of cost or value of materials produced in a  beneficiary country. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost or value of materials produced in a  beneficiary country or countries includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When not included in the manufacturer's actual cost for the  materials, the freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred  in transporting the materials to the manufacturer's plant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The actual cost of waste or spoilage (material list), less the  value of recoverable scrap; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Taxes and/or duties imposed on the materials by any beneficiary  country, provided they are not remitted upon exportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge,  or at less than fair market value, its cost or value shall be determined  by computing the sum of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture  of the material, including general expenses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An amount for profit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Freight, insurance, packing, and all other costs incurred in  transporting the material to the manufacturer's plant.  If the pertinent information needed to compute the cost or value of a  material is not available, the appraising officer may ascertain or  estimate the value thereof using all reasonable ways and means at his  disposal.</p>
