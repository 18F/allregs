(1) FFV's arriving on fishing grounds where fishing vessels are already fishing or have set their gear for that purpose must ascertain the position and extent of gear already placed in the sea and must not place themselves or their fishing gear so as to interfere with or obstruct fishing operations already in progress. Vessels using mobile gear must avoid fixed fishing gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operator of each FFV must maintain on its bridge a current plot of broadcast fixed-gear locations for the area in which it is fishing, as required by the regulations for the fishery in which the FFV is engaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Gear conflicts. The operator of each FFV that is involved in a conflict or that retrieves the gear of another vessel must immediately notify the appropriate USCG commander identified in tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502 and request disposal instructions. Each report must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name of the reporting vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of the incident and articles retrieved, including the amount, type of gear, condition, and identification markings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The location of the incident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The date and time of the incident.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disposal of fishing gear and other articles.

These articles and substances include, but are not limited to, fishing gear, net scraps, bale straps, plastic bags, oil drums, petroleum containers, oil, toxic chemicals or any manmade items retrieved in an FFV's gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The operator of an FFV may not abandon fishing gear in the EEZ.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If these articles or substances are encountered, or in the event of accidental or emergency placement into the EEZ, the vessel operator must immediately report the incident to the appropriate USCG Commander indicated in tables 1 and 2 to Sec. 600.502, and give the information required in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
