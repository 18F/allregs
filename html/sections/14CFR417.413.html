                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A launch operator must define a hazard area that confines the adverse effects of a hardware system should an event occur that presents a public hazard or launch location hazard. A launch operator must prohibit public access to the hazard area whenever a hazard is present unless the requirements for public access of paragraph (b) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public access. A launch operator must establish a process for authorizing public access if visitors or members of the public must have access to a launch operator's facility or launch location. The process must ensure that each member of the public is briefed on the hazards within the facility and related safety warnings, procedures, and rules that provide protection, or a launch operator must ensure that each member of the public is accompanied by a knowledgeable escort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hazard controls during public access. A launch operator must establish procedural controls that prevent hazardous operations from taking place while members of the public have access to the launch location and must verify that system hazard controls are

in place that prevent initiation of a hazardous event. Hazard controls and procedures that prevent initiation of a hazardous event include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of lockout devices or other restraints on system actuation switches or other controls to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent actuation of a hazardous system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disconnect ordnance systems from power sources, incorporate the use of safing plugs, or have safety devices in place that prevent inadvertent initiation. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated safety devices must not be ongoing while the public has access to the hazard area. Install safing pins on safe and arm devices and mechanically actuated devices. Disconnect explosive transfer lines, not protected by a safe and arm device or a mechanically actuated device or equivalent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When systems or tanks are loaded with hypergols or other toxic materials, close the system or tank and verify it is leak-tight with two verifiable closures, such as a valve and a cap, to every external flow path or fitting. Such a system must also be in a steady-state condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Keep each pressurized system below its maximum allowable working pressure and do not allow it to be in a dynamic state. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated pressure system valves must not be ongoing while the public has access to the associated hazard area. Launch vehicle systems must not be pressurized to more than 25% of the system's design burst pressure, when the public has access to the associated hazard area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Do not allow sources of ionizing or non-ionizing radiation, such as, x-rays, nuclear power sources, high-energy radio transmitters, radar, and lasers to be present or verify they are to be inactive when the public has access to the associated hazard area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Guard physical hazards to prevent potential physical injury to visiting members of the public. Physical hazards include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Potential falling objects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Falls from an elevated height; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Protection from potentially hazardous vents, such as pressure relief discharge vents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Maintain and verify that safety devices or safety critical systems are operating properly prior to permitting public access.</p>
