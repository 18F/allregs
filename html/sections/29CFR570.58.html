                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Findings and declaration of fact. The following occupations  involved in the operation of power-driven hoisting apparatus are  particularly hazardous for minors between 16 and 18 years of age:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Work of operating, tending, riding upon, working from,  repairing, servicing, or disassembling an elevator, crane, derrick,  hoist, or high-lift truck, except operating or riding inside an  unattended automatic operation passenger elevator. Tending such  equipment includes assisting in the hoisting tasks being performed by  the equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Work of operating, tending, riding upon, working from,  repairing, servicing, or disassembling a manlift or freight elevator,  except 16- and 17-year-olds may ride upon a freight elevator operated by  an assigned operator. Tending such equipment includes assisting in the  hoisting tasks being performed by the equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2">Crane shall mean a power-driven machine for lifting and lowering a  load and moving it horizontally, in which the hoisting mechanism is an  integral part of the machine. The term shall include all types of  cranes, such as cantilever gantry, crawler, gantry, hammerhead, ingot  pouring, jib, locomotive, motor-truck, overhead traveling, pillar jib,  pintle, portal, semi-gantry, semi-portal, storage bridge, tower, walking  jib, and wall cranes.</p><p class="depth2">Derrick shall mean a power-driven apparatus consisting of a mast or  equivalent members held at the top by guys or braces, with or without a  boom, for use with a hoisting mechanism or operating ropes. The term  shall include all types of derricks, such as A-frame, breast, Chicago  boom, gin-pole, guy, and stiff-leg derrick.</p><p class="depth2">Elevator shall mean any power-driven hoisting or lowering mechanism  equipped with a car or platform which moves in guides in a substantially  vertical direction. The term shall include both passenger and freight  elevators (including portable elevators or tiering machines), but shall  not include dumbwaiters.</p><p class="depth2">High-lift truck shall mean a power-driven industrial type of truck  used for lateral transportation that is equipped with a power-operated  lifting device usually in the form of a fork or platform capable of  tiering loaded pallets or skids one above the other. Instead of a fork  or a platform, the lifting device may consist of a ram, scoop, shovel,  crane, revolving fork, or other attachments for handling specific loads.  The term shall mean and include highlift trucks known under such names  as fork lifts, fork trucks, fork lift trucks, tiering trucks, backhoes,  front-end loaders, skid loaders, skid-steer loaders, Bobcat loaders, or  stacking trucks, but shall not mean low-lift trucks or low-lift platform  trucks that are designed for the transportation of but not the tiering  of materials.</p><p class="depth2">Hoist shall mean a power-driven apparatus for raising or lowering a  load by the application of a pulling force that does not include a car  or platform running in guides. The term shall include all types of  hoists, such as base mounted electric, clevis suspension, hook  suspension, monorail, overhead electric, simple drum, and trolley  suspension hoists.</p><p class="depth2">Manlift shall mean a device intended for the conveyance of persons  that consists of platforms or brackets mounted on, or attached to, an  endless belt, cable, chain or similar method of suspension; with such  belt, cable or chain operating in a substantially vertical direction and  being supported by and driven through pulleys, sheaves or sprockets at  the top and bottom. The term shall also include truck- or equipment- mounted aerial platforms commonly referred to as scissor lifts, boom- type mobile elevating work platforms, work assist vehicles, cherry   pickers, basket hoists, and bucket trucks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section shall not prohibit the operation of  an automatic elevator and an automatic signal operation elevator  provided that the exposed portion of the car interior (exclusive of  vents and other necessary small openings), the car door, and the  hoistway doors are constructed of solid surfaces without any opening  through which a part of the body may extend; all hoistway openings at  floor level have doors which are interlocked with the car door so as to  prevent the car from starting until all such doors are closed and  locked; the elevator (other than hydraulic elevators) is equipped with a  device which will stop and hold the car in case of overspeed or if the  cable slackens or breaks; and the elevator is equipped with upper and  lower travel limit devices which will normally bring the car to rest at  either terminal and a final limit switch which will prevent the movement  in either direction and will open in case of excessive over travel by  the car.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of this exception the term automatic elevator  shall mean a passenger elevator, a freight elevator, or a combination  passenger-freight elevator, the operation of which is controlled by  pushbuttons in such a manner that the starting, going to the landing  selected, leveling and holding, and the opening and closing of the car  and hoistway doors are entirely automatic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of this exception, the term automatic signal  operation elevator shall mean an elevator which is started in response  to the operation of a switch (such as a lever or pushbutton) in the car  which when operated by the operator actuates a starting device that  automatically closes the car and hoistway doors--from this point on, the  movement of the car to the landing selected, leveling and holding when  it gets there, and the opening of the car and hoistway doors are  entirely automatic.
