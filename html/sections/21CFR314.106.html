                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The acceptance of foreign data in an application  generally is governed by Sec. 312.120 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As sole basis for marketing approval. An application based  solely on foreign clinical data meeting U.S. criteria for marketing  approval may be approved if: (1) The foreign data are applicable to the  U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; (2) the studies have been  performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and (3)  the data may be considered valid without the need for an on-site  inspection by FDA or, if FDA considers such an inspection to be  necessary, FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site  inspection or other appropriate means. Failure of an application to meet  any of these criteria will result in the application not being  approvable based on the foreign data alone. FDA will apply this policy  in a flexible manner according to the nature of the drug and the data  being considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consultation between FDA and applicants. Applicants are  encouraged to meet with agency officials in a ``presubmission'' meeting  when approval based solely on foreign data will be sought.
