The Office of Federal Procurement Policy, in cooperation with USDA, has the responsibility to coordinate this policy's implementation in the Federal procurement regulations. These guidelines are not intended to address full implementation of these requirements into the Federal procurement framework. This will be accomplished through revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal agency preferred procurement programs.

Each procurement program shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On or before July 31, 2015, each Federal agency shall develop a procurement program which will assure that qualified biobased products are purchased to the maximum extent practicable and which is consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurement laws. Each procurement program shall contain:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A preference program for purchasing qualified biobased products,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A promotion program to promote the preference program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provisions for the annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of the procurement program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In developing the preference program, Federal agencies shall adopt one of the following options, or a substantially equivalent alternative, as part of the procurement program:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A policy of awarding contracts on a case-by-case basis to the vendor offering a qualified biobased product composed of the highest percentage of biobased content practicable except when such products:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Are not available within a reasonable time;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fail to meet performance standards set forth in the applicable specifications, or the reasonable performance standards of the Federal agency; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Are available only at an unreasonable price.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A policy of setting minimum biobased content specifications in such a way as to assure that the required biobased content of qualified biobased products is consistent with section 9002 of FSRIA and the requirements of the guidelines in this part except when such products:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Are not available within a reasonable time;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Fail to meet performance standards for the use to which they will be put, or the reasonable performance standards of the Federal agency; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Are available only at an unreasonable price.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In implementing the preference program, Federal agencies shall treat as eligible for the preference biobased products from ``designated countries,'' as that term is defined in section 25.003 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation, provided that those products otherwise meet all requirements for participation in the preference program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procurement specifications. After the publication date of each designated product category and each designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock category, Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for products procured by Federal agencies shall ensure within a specified time frame that their specifications require the use of qualified biobased products, consistent with the guidelines in this part. USDA will specify the allowable time frame in each designation rule. The biobased content of qualified biobased products within a designated product category or a designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock category may vary considerably from product to product based on the mix of ingredients used in its manufacture. Likewise, the biobased content of qualified biobased products that qualify because they are made from materials within designated intermediate ingredient or feedstock categories may also vary significantly. In procuring qualified biobased products, the percentage of biobased content should be maximized, consistent with achieving the desired performance for the product.
