                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act authorizes three forms of benefits to, or on behalf of,  requesters determined to be eligible by the Secretary:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment or reimbursement for reasonable and necessary medical  services and items to diagnose or treat a covered injury, or to  diagnose, treat, or prevent its health complications, as described in  Sec.  110.31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lost employment income incurred as a result of a covered injury,  as described in Sec.  110.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Death benefits to certain survivors if the Secretary determines  that   the death of the injured countermeasure recipient was the direct result  of a covered injury, as described in Sec.  110.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In general, the benefits paid under the Program, are secondary  to any obligation of any third-party payer to provide or pay for such  benefits. The benefits available under the CICP usually will be paid  only after the requester has in good faith attempted to obtain all other  available coverage from all third-party payers with an obligation to pay  for or provide such benefits (e.g., medical insurance for medical  services or items, workers' compensation program(s) for lost employment  income). However, as provided in Sec.  110.84, the Secretary has the  discretion to pay benefits under this Program before a potential third- party payer makes a determination on the availability of similar  benefits and has the right to later pursue a claim against any third- party payer with a legal or contractual obligation to pay for, or  provide, such benefits.</p>
