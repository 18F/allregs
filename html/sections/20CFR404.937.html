The Hearing Office Chief  Administrative Law Judge will find that a claimant or other individual  poses a threat to the safety of our employees or other participants in  the hearing when he or she determines that the individual has made a  threat and there is a reasonable likelihood that the claimant or other  individual could act on the threat or when evidence suggests that a  claimant or other individual poses a threat. In making a finding under  this paragraph, the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will  consider all relevant evidence, including any information we have in the  claimant's record and any information we have regarding the claimant's  or other individual's past conduct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge determines  that the claimant or other individual poses a reasonable threat to the  safety of our employees or other participants in the   hearing, the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge will either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Require the presence of a security guard at the hearing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require that the hearing be conducted by video teleconference  or by telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we have banned a claimant from any of our facilities, we will  provide the claimant with the opportunity for a hearing that will be  conducted by telephone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The actions of the Hearing Office Chief Administrative Law Judge  taken under this section are final and not subject to further review.
