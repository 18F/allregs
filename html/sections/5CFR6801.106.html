                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prohibition on supervisory employee's seeking credit. (1) A supervisory employee may not, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of his or her spouse or child or anyone else (including any business or nonprofit organization), seek or accept credit from, or renew or renegotiate credit with, a depository institution or any of its affiliates if the institution or affiliate is a party to an application, enforcement action, investigation, or other particular matter involving specific parties pending before the Board and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A supervisory employee may not, on his or her own behalf, or on behalf of his or her spouse or child or anyone else (including any business or nonprofit organization), seek or accept credit from, or renew or renegotiate credit with, a depository institution or any of its affiliates if the institution or affiliate is a party to an application, enforcement action, investigation, or other particular matter involving specific parties pending before the Board and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The supervisory employee is assigned to the matter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The supervisory employee is aware of the pendency of the matter

and knows that he or she will participate in the matter by action, advice or recommendation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The prohibition in paragraph (a)(1) of this section also applies for three months after the supervisory employee's participation in the matter has ended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit sought by spouse and other related persons. A supervisory employee must disqualify himself or herself from participating (by action, advice or recommendation) in any application, enforcement action, investigation or other particular matter involving specific parties to which a depository institution or any of its affiliates is a party as soon as the supervisory employee learns that any of the following related persons are seeking or have sought or accepted credit from, or have renewed or renegotiated credit with, the depository institution or any of its affiliates while the matter is pending before the Board:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee's spouse or dependent child;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A company or business if the employee or the employee's spouse or dependent child owns or controls more than 10 percent of its equity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A partnership if the employee, or the employee's spouse or dependent child is a general partner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception.

The Board's Designated Agency Ethics Official, after consulting with the relevant division director, may grant a written waiver from the prohibition in paragraph (a) of this section, or the disqualification requirement in paragraph (b) of this section, based on a determination that participation in matters otherwise prohibited by this section would not create an appearance of loss of impartiality or use of public office for private gain, and would not otherwise be inconsistent with the Office of Government Ethics' Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635) or prohibited by law.</p>
