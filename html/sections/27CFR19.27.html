                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. If a proprietor wishes to use an alternate method  or procedure as described in Sec. 19.26, the proprietor must submit a  written letterhead application to the appropriate TTB officer for  approval. The application must identify the method or procedure  specified in the regulation, must describe the proposed alternate method  or procedure in detail, and must explain why the alternate method or  procedure is needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval and use. The proprietor may not use an alternate method  or procedure until the appropriate TTB   officer has in writing approved the proprietor's application. During the  period that the proprietor is authorized to use the alternate method or  procedure, the proprietor must comply with any conditions imposed on its  use by TTB. TTB may withdraw the approval to use the alternate method or  procedure if TTB finds that the revenue is jeopardized, that the  alternate method or procedure hinders effective administration of the  laws or regulations, that the proprietor has violated any of the  conditions imposed by TTB, or that the circumstances that gave rise to  the need for the alternate method or procedure no longer exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Retention. The proprietor must retain each alternate method or  procedure approval as part of the proprietor's records and must make the  approval available for examination by TTB officers upon request.
