                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If there appears to be a failure or threatened  failure to comply with this part and if the noncompliance or threatened  noncompliance cannot be corrected by informal means, compliance with  this part may be effected by suspending, terminating, or refusing any  financial assistance approved but not yet disbursed to an applicant or,  in the case of a loan which has been partially disbursed, by refusing to  make further disbursements. In addition, compliance may be effected by  any other means authorized by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such other means may include but are not limited to (i) legal  action by SBA to enforce its right, embodied in the assurances described  in Sec. 112.8, to accelerate the maturity of the recipient's obligation;  (ii) a reference to the Department of Justice with a recommendation that  appropriate proceedings be brought to enforce any rights of the United  States under any law of the United States, including other titles of the  Act; and (iii) any applicable proceedings under State or local law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Noncompliance with Sec. 112.8. If an applicant fails or refuses  to furnish an assurance required under Sec. 112.8 or otherwise fails or  refuses to comply with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to that  section Federal financial assistance may be refused in accordance with  the procedures of paragraph (c) of this section. SBA shall not be  required to provide assistance in such a case during the pendency of the  administrative proceedings under such paragraph except that SBA shall  continue assistance during the pendency of such proceedings where such  assistance is due and payable pursuant to an application therefor  approved prior to the effective date of this part. Such proceedings  shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of part 134 of this  chapter by an Administrative Law Judge of the Office of Hearings and  Appeals, who shall issue an initial decision in the case. The  Administrator shall be the reviewing official for purposes of  Sec. 134.228. The applicant's failure to file a timely motion in  accordance with Secs. 134.222 and 134.211, requesting that the matter be  scheduled for an oral hearing, shall constitute waiver of the right to  an oral hearing but shall not prevent the submission of written  information and argument for the record in accordance with the  provisions of part 134.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conditions precedent. No order suspending, terminating, or  refusing financial assistance shall become effective until (1) SBA has  advised the applicant or recipient of his failure to comply and has  determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2)  there has been an express finding on the record after an opportunity for  an oral hearing, of a failure by the applicant or recipient to comply  with a requirement imposed by or pursuant to this part; (3) the initial  decision has become final pursuant to Sec. 134.227(b); and (4) the  expiration of 30 days after SBA has filed with the committee of the  House and the committee of the Senate having legislative jurisdiction of  the form of financial assistance involved, a full written report of the  circumstances and the grounds for such action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other means authorized by law. No action to effect compliance by  any other means authorized by law shall be taken until (1) SBA has  determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means; (2) the  action has been approved by the Administrator or his designee; (3) the  applicant or recipient or other person has been notified of its failure  to comply and of the action to be taken to effect compliance; and (4)  the expiration of at least 10 days from the mailing of such notice to  the   applicant or recipient or other person. During this period of at least  10 days from the mailing of such notice to the applicant or recipient or  other person. During this period of at least 10 days additional efforts  shall be made to persuade the applicant or recipient or other person to  comply with this part and to take such corrective action as may be  appropriate.
