                            <p class="depth0">This section contains provisions that apply for a limited number of calendar years or model years. These provisions supercede the other provisions of this part. The provisions of this section do not apply for Category 3 engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compliance date of standards. Certain companies may delay compliance with emission standards. Companies wishing to take advantage of this provision must inform the Designated Officer of their intent to do so in writing before the date that compliance with the standards would otherwise be mandatory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Post-manufacture marinizers may elect to delay the model year of the Tier 2 standards for commercial engines as specified in Sec. 94.8 by one year for each engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small-volume manufacturers may elect to delay the model year of the Tier 2 standards for recreational engines as specified in Sec. 94.8 by five years for each engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Early banking of emission credits. (1) A manufacturer may optionally certify engines manufactured before the date the Tier 2 standards take effect to earn emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading program. Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part. Manufacturers may begin earning credits for recreational engines on December 9, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may optionally certify engines manufactured before the date the Tier 2 standards take effect to earn emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading program. Such optionally certified engines are subject to all provisions relating to mandatory certification and enforcement described in this part. Manufacturers may begin earning credits for recreational engines on December 9, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consistent with the provisions of Subpart D of this part, NOX and PM emission credits may be generated from engines prior to the applicable effective compliance date of the applicable standard (i.e., the effective compliance date in Sec. 94.8(a), as applicable), relative to baseline emission rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(i)</em> THC+NOX credits generated under this paragraph (b) shall be calculated as specified in Sec. 92.305, except that the baseline emission rate may be either the applicable standard or a measured THC+NOX baseline level for the configuration with the lowest NOX emission rate in the applicable engine family. The additional credits resulting from using a measured baseline (instead of the applicable standard) shall be discounted by 10 percent. This discount does not apply to the portion of the credits resulting from the engine's emissions being below the applicable standard. Baseline emission rates may not exceed the IMO NOX limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> THC+NOX credits generated under this paragraph (b) shall be calculated as specified in Sec. 92.305, except that the baseline emission rate may be either the applicable standard or a measured THC+NOX baseline level for the configuration with the lowest NOX emission rate in the applicable engine family. The additional credits resulting from using a measured baseline (instead of the applicable standard) shall be discounted by 10 percent. This discount does not apply to the portion of the credits resulting from the engine's emissions being below the applicable standard. Baseline emission rates may not exceed the IMO NOX limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PM credits generated under this paragraph (b) shall be calculated as specified in Sec. 94.305, except that the applicable standard may be replaced by a measured PM baseline emission rate for the configuration with the lowest NOX emission rate in the applicable engine family that is approved in advance by the Administrator. The additional credits resulting from using a measured baseline (instead of the applicable standard) shall be discounted by 10 percent. This discount does not apply to the portion of the credits resulting from the engine's emissions being below the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> For post-manufacture marinizers, measured baseline emission levels may be based on emissions from a single engine for each engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For post-manufacture marinizers, measured baseline emission levels may be based on emissions from a single engine for each engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For all other manufacturers, measured baseline emission levels must be based on the average of emissions from at least three engines for each engine family.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Administrator must approve any measured baselines in advance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For an engine to be eligible to generate early credits under this paragraph (b), its certified emission levels for all pollutants must be below the Tier 2 standards listed in Sec. 94.8, with the following exception: PMMs may include in this early credit program Category 1 marine engines with certified emissions above the Tier 2 standards listed in Sec. 94.8. Early credits generated by Category 1 marine engines with certified emissions above the Tier 2 standards listed in Sec. 94.8 may not be used for model year 2008 or later engines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Testing of Category 1 engines subject to the requirements of this part that is conducted by the Administrator shall be performed using test fuels that meet the specifications in Sec. 94.108 and have a sulfur content no higher than 0.20 weight percent, unless the PM emission rates are corrected for the effect of a higher fuel sulfur content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Post-manufacture marinizers may import an uncertified engine for marinization, in cases where the engine in the final marinized configuration is

not subject to the standards of this part because:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The model year of the marinized engine is prior to the first model year for which engines of that size are subject to the standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The post-manufacture marinizer is marinizing the engine under paragraph (a) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The post-manufacture marinizer is granted hardship relief from the Tier 2 standards under Sec. 94.209(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Compliance date of NTE requirements (1) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, the requirements of Sec. 94.8(e) for commercial marine engines start with 2010 model year engines for post-manufacture marinizers and 2007 model year engines for all other engine manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, the requirements of Sec. 94.8(e) for recreational marine engines start with 2012 model year engines for post-manufacture marinizers and 2009 model year engines for all other engine manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Manufacturers may submit test data collected using the Annex VI test procedures to show compliance with Tier 1 standards for model years before 2007. Note: Starting in 2007, EPA may approve a manufacturer's request to continue using alternate procedures under Sec. 94.102(c), as long as the manufacturer satisfies EPA that the differences in testing will not affect NOX emission rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Flexibility for engines over 560kW. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, manufacturers may choose to delay certification of marine engines with less than 2.5 liters per cylinder and rated power above 560 kW, that are derived from a land-based nonroad engine with a rated power greater than 560 kW, if they do all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Certify all of their applicable marine engines with less than 2.5 liters per cylinder and rated power above 560 kW to a NOX standard of 6.4 g/kW-hr for model years 2008 through 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notify EPA in writing before 2004 of their intent to use this provision. This notification must include a signed statement certifying that the manufacturer will comply with all the provisions of this paragraph (g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Add a permanent, legible label, written in block letters in English, to a readily visible part of each engine exempted under this paragraph (f). This label must include at least the following items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine displacement (in liters), rated power, and model year of the engine or whom to contact for further information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The statement ``THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 94.12(g) FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Flexibility for small-volume boat builders. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this part, manufacturers may sell uncertified recreational engines to small-volume boat builders during the first five years for which the emission standards in Sec. 94.8 apply, subject to the following provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The U.S.-directed production volume of boats from any small-volume boat builder using uncertified engines during the total five-year period may not exceed 80 percent of the manufacturer's average annual production for the three years prior to the general applicability of the recreational engine standards in Sec. 94.8, except as allowed in paragraph (h)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small-volume boat builders may exceed the production limits in paragraph (h)(1) of this section, provided they do not exceed 20 boats during the five-year period or 10 boats in any single calendar year. This does not apply to boats powered by engines with displacement greater than 2.5 liters per cylinder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Small-volume boat builders must keep records of all the boats and engines produced under this paragraph (h), including boat and engine model numbers, serial numbers, and dates of manufacture. Records must also include information verifying compliance with the limits in paragraph (h)(1) or (2) of this section. Keep these records until at least two full years after you no longer use the provisions in this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturers must add a permanent, legible label, written in block letters in English, to a readily visible part of each engine exempted under this paragraph (h).</p><p class="depth0">This label must include at least the following items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The label heading ``EMISSION CONTROL INFORMATION''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Your corporate name and trademark.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine displacement (in liters), rated power, and model year of the engine or whom to contact for further information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The statement ``THIS ENGINE IS EXEMPT UNDER 40 CFR 94.12(h)</p><p class="depth0">FROM EMISSION STANDARDS AND RELATED REQUIREMENTS.''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Early use of future provisions. For model years 2009 through 2013, certain marine engines will be subject to the requirements of this part 94 while others will be subject to the requirements of 40 CFR part 1042. Manufacturers may ask for flexibility in making the transition to the new regulations as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You may ask to use a combination of the test procedures of this part and those of 40 CFR part 1042. This might include the early use of the duty cycles and NTE specifications that apply for Tier 3 or Tier 4 engines. We will approve your request only if you show us that it does not affect your ability to demonstrate compliance with the applicable emission standards. This generally requires that the combined procedures would result in emission measurements at least as high as those that would be measured using the procedures specified in this part. Alternatively, you may demonstrate that the combined effects of the procedures is small relative to your compliance margin (the degree to which your engines are below the applicable standards).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> You may ask to comply with the administrative requirements of 40 CFR parts 1042 and 1068 instead of the equivalent requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Transition to new category thresholds. Beginning model year 2012, engines with maximum engine power at or below 3700 kW with per-cylinder displacement at or above 5.0 liters and below 7.0 liters are Category 1 engines subject to 40 CFR part 1042. Similarly, beginning model year 2014, engines with maximum engine power above 3700 kW with per-cylinder displacement at or above 5.0 liters and below 7.0 liters are Category 1 engines subject to 40 CFR part 1042. For purposes of this paragraph (j), maximum engine power has the meaning given in 40 CFR 1042.901.
