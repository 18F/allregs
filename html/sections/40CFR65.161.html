                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, (2), (3), or  (4) of this section, as applicable (The provisions of this section apply  to owners and operators of storage vessels and low-throughput transfer  racks only if specified by the applicable monitoring plan established  under Sec. 65.165(c)(1) and (2)):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record of values measured at least once every 15 minutes or  each measured value for systems that measure more frequently than once  every 15 minutes; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A record of block average values for 15-minute or shorter  periods calculated from all measured data values during each period or  from at least one measured data value per minute if measured more  frequently than once per minute; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For data collected from an automated continuous parameter  monitoring system, a record of block hourly average values calculated  from each 15-minute block average period or from at least one measured  value per minute if measured more frequently than once per minute, and a  record of the most recent 3 valid hours of continuous (15-minute or  shorter) records meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of  this section. Records meeting the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) or  (2) of this section shall also be kept for all periods that include CPMS  breakdown or malfunction. During these periods, it is not necessary to  calculate hourly averages; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A record as required by an alternative approved under Sec.  65.162(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excluded data. Monitoring data recorded during the following  periods shall not be included in any average computed to determine  compliance under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, preventive maintenance,  calibration checks, and zero (low-level) and high-level adjustments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Periods of non-operation of the process unit (or portion  thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the  monitoring applies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Startups, shutdowns, and malfunctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section unless  an alternative monitoring or recordkeeping system has been requested and  approved under Sec. 65.162(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, daily  average values of each continuously monitored parameter shall be  calculated for each operating day. Data meeting the specifications of  paragraph (b) of this section shall not be included in the average. The  data shall be reported in the periodic report as specified in Sec.  65.166(f), if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The daily average shall be calculated as the average of all  values for a monitored parameter recorded during the operating day as  specified in paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section. The average  shall cover a 24-hour period if operation is continuous, or the number  of hours of operation per operating day if operation is not continuous  (for example, for high-throughput transfer racks, the average shall  cover periods of loading). If values are measured more frequently than  once per minute, a single value for each minute may be used to calculate  the daily average instead of all measured values.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The operating day shall be the period defined in the operating  permit or the Initial Compliance Status Report. It may be from midnight  to midnight or another daily period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, or (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Valid data. Unless determined to be excluded data according to  paragraph (b) of this section, the data collected pursuant to paragraphs  (a) through (c) of this section shall be considered valid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> or (2) of  this section as provided in Sec. 65.4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The monitoring system can detect unrealistic or impossible data  during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or  malfunctions (for example, a temperature reading of -200 [deg]C on a  boiler) and will alert the operator by alarm or other means. The owner  or operator shall record the occurrence. All instances of the alarm or  other alert in an operating day constitute a single occurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The monitoring system shall generate a running average of the  monitoring values, updated at least hourly throughout each operating  day, that have been obtained during that operating day, and the  capability to observe this average is readily available to the  Administrator on-site during the operating day. All instances in an  operating day constitute a single occurrence. The owner or operator  shall record the occurrence of any period meeting the following  criteria:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The running average is above the maximum or below the minimum  established limits;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The running average is based on at least six 1-hour average  values;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The running average reflects a period of operation other than a  startup, shutdown, or malfunction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The monitoring system shall be capable of detecting unchanging  data during periods of operation other than startups, shutdowns, or  malfunctions except in circumstances where the presence of unchanging  data is the expected operating condition based on past experience (for  example, pH in some scrubbers), and will alert the operator by alarm or  other means. The owner or operator shall record the occurrence. All  instances of the alarm or other alert in an operating day constitute a  single occurrence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The monitoring system shall alert the owner or operator by an  alarm if the running average parameter value calculated under paragraph  (e)(1)(ii) of this section reaches a set point that is appropriately  related to the established limit for the parameter that is being  monitored.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The owner or operator shall verify and document the proper  functioning of the monitoring system, including its ability to comply  with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section, at the  following times:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Upon initial installation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Annually after initial installation; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> After any change to the programming or equipment constituting  the monitoring system, that might reasonably be expected to alter the  monitoring system's ability to comply with the requirements of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator shall retain the following records:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identification of each parameter for each item of equipment for  which the owner or operator has elected to comply with the requirements  of Sec. 65.162(e).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A description of the applicable monitoring system(s) and of how  compliance will be achieved with each requirement of paragraphs  (e)(1)(i) through (v) of this section. The description shall identify  the location and format (for example, on-line storage; log entries) for  each required record. If the description changes, the owner or operator  shall retain both the current and the most recent outdated description.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A description and the date of any change to the monitoring  system that would reasonably be expected to affect its ability to comply  with the requirements of paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Owners and operators shall retain the current description of the  monitoring system as long as the description is current, but not less  than 5 years from the date of its creation. The current description  shall be retained on-site at all times or be accessible from a central  location by computer or other means that provide access within 2 hours  after a request. The owner or operator shall retain the most recent  outdated description at least until 5 years from the date of its  creation. The outdated description shall be retained   on-site (or accessible from a central location by computer that provides  access within 2 hours after a request) at least 6 months after being  outdated. Thereafter, the outdated description may be stored off-site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iv)</em> of this section, the owner or operator is no longer  required to record the daily average value for that parameter for that  unit of equipment for any operating day when the daily average value is  less than the maximum or greater than the minimum established limit.  With approval by the Administrator, monitoring data generated prior to  the compliance date of this subpart shall be credited toward the period  of 6 consecutive months if the parameter limit and the monitoring were  required and/or approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the owner or operator elects not to retain the daily average  values, the owner or operator shall notify the Administrator in the next  periodic report. The notification shall identify the parameter and unit  of equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there is an excursion as defined in paragraph (e)(2)(iv) of  this section on any operating day after the owner or operator has ceased  recording daily averages as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this  section, the owner or operator shall immediately resume retaining the  daily average value for each day and shall notify the Administrator in  the next periodic report. The owner or operator shall continue to retain  each daily average value until another period of 6 consecutive months  has passed without an excursion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall retain the records specified in  paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (vi) of this section for the duration  specified in Sec. 65.4. For any calendar week, if compliance with  paragraphs (e)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section does not result in  retention of a record of at least one occurrence or measured parameter  value, the owner or operator shall record and retain at least one  parameter value during a period of operation other than a startup,  shutdown, or malfunction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section, an excursion  means that the daily average value of monitoring data for a parameter is  greater than the maximum or less than the minimum established value  except as provided in the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The daily average value during any startup, shutdown, or  malfunction shall not be considered an excursion for purposes of this  paragraph (e) if the owner or operator operates the source in accordance  with Sec. 65.3(a).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Excused excursions described in Sec. 65.156(d)(2) and  excursions described in Sec. 65.156(d)(3) do not count toward the  number of excursions for purposes of this paragraph (e).
