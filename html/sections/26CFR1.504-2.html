[T.D. 8308, 55 FR 35592, Aug. 31, 1990]    Sec. 1.505(c)-1T  Questions and answers relating to the notification  requirement for recognition of exemption under paragraphs (9), (17) and  (20) of Section 501(c) (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What does section 505(c) of the Internal Revenue Code provide?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Section 505(c) provides that an organization will not be  recognized as exempt under section 501(c)(9) as a voluntary employees'  beneficiary association, under section 501(c)(17) as a trust forming  part of a plan providing for the payment of supplemental unemployment  compensation benefits, or under section 501(c)(20) as a trust forming  part of a qualified group legal services plan unless notification is  given to the Internal Revenue Service. The notification required of a  trust created pursuant to section 501(c)(20) and forming part of a  qualified group legal services plan is set forth in Q&A-2.; The  notification required of an organization organized after July 18, 1984,  and applying for exempt status as an organization described in section  501(c) (9) or (17) is set forth in Q&A-3; through Q&A-8.; The notification  required of an organization organized on or before July 18, 1984, and  claiming exemption as an organization described in section 501(c) (9) or  (17) is set forth in Q&A-9; through Q&A-11.; However, an organization that  has previously notified the Internal Revenue Service of its claim to  exemption under section 501(c) (9), (17), or (20) or its claim to  exemption under those sections pursuant to another provision of the  Code, is not required, under section 505(c), to submit a renotification  (See Q&A-2; and Q&A-12;).</p><p class="depth0">Section 501(c)(20) Trusts</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What is the notice required of a trust created pursuant to  section 501(c)(20) and forming part of a qualified group legal services  plan under section 120?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) A trust claiming exemption as an organization described in  section 501(c)(20) will be recognized as exempt if the exclusive  function of the trust is to form part of a qualified group legal  services plan or plans. Exemption of the trust under section 501(c)(20)  will generally be dependent upon and coextensive with recognition of the  plan as a qualified group legal services plan. Therefore, a trust  organized pursuant to section 501(c)(20) after July 18, 1984, need not  file a separate notice with the Internal Revenue Service of its claim to  exemption because the notice required by section 120(c)(4) will suffice  for purposes of section 505(c), provided a copy of the trust instrument  is filed with the Form 1024 submitted by the group legal services plan.  If the trust instrument has not been filed with the Form 1024 submitted  by the group legal services plan, the trust must comply with (and  exemption will be dependent upon) the filing applicable to a trust  organized on or before July 18, 1984. For the notice required and  effective dates of exemption of a qualified group legal services plan  under section 120, see Sec. 1.120-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A trust organized on or before July 18, 1984, that claims exempt  status as a trust described in section 501(c)(20) and that forms   part of a qualified group legal services plan which has been recognized  as exempt under section 120, must file a copy of its trust instrument  with the Internal Revenue Service before February 4, 1987. If a copy of  the trust instrument is filed within the time provided, the trust's  exemption will be recognized retroactively to the date the qualified  group legal services plan was recognized as exempt under section 120.  However, if a copy of the trust instrument is filed after the time  provided, exemption will be recognized only for the period after the  copy of the trust instrument is filed with the Internal Revenue Service.  See Q&A-7; for a further discussion of date of filing. A trust that has  previously filed a copy of its trust instrument with the Service need  not refile that document.</p><p class="depth0">Section 501(c)(9) and (17) Organizations Organized After July 18, 1984</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: What is the notice required of an organization or trust,  organized after July 18, 1984, that is applying for recognition of tax  exempt status under section 501(c) (9) or (17)?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: An organization or trust that is organized after July 18, 1984,  will not be treated as described in paragraphs (9) or (17) of section  501(c), unless the organization notifies the Internal Revenue Service  that it is applying for recognition of exemption. In addition, unless  the required notice is given in the manner and within the time  prescribed by these regulations, an organization will not be treated as  exempt for any period before the giving of the required notice. The  notice is filed by submitting a properly completed and executed Form  1024, ``Application for Recognition of Exemption Under Section 501(a) or  for Determination Under Section 120'' together with the additional  information required under Q&A-4; and Q&A-5.; The notice is filed with the  district director for the key district in which the organization's  principal place of business or principal office is located.</p><p class="depth0">The notice may be filed by either the plan administrator (as defined  in section 414(g)) or the trustee. The Internal Revenue Service will not  accept a Form 1024 for any organization or trust before such entity has  been organized.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What information, in addition to the information required by  Form 1024, must be submitted by an organization or trust seeking  recognition of exemption under section 501(c) (9) or (17)?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: A notice will not be considered complete unless, in addition to  a properly completed and executed Form 1024, the organization or trust  submits a full description of the benefits available to participants  under section 501(c) (9) or (17). Moreover, both the terms and  conditions of eligibility for membership and the terms and conditions of  eligibility for benefits must be set forth. This information may be  contained in a separate document, such as a plan document, or it may be  contained in the creating document of the entity (e.g., the articles of  incorporation or association, or a trust indenture). For benefits  provided through a policy or policies of insurance, all such policies  must be included with the notice. Where individual policies of insurance  are provided to the participants, single exemplar copies, typical of  policies generally issued to participants, are acceptable, provided they  adequately describe all forms of insurance available to participants. In  providing a full description of the benefits available, the benefits  provided must be sufficiently described so that each benefit is  definitely determinable. A benefit is definitely determinable if the  amount of the benefit, its duration, and the persons eligible to receive  it are ascertainable from the plan document or other instrument. Thus, a  benefit is not definitely determinable if the rules governing either its  amount, its duration, or its recipients are not ascertainable from the  plan document or other instrument but are instead subject to the  discretion of a person or committee. Likewise, a benefit is not  definitely determinable if the amount for any individual is based upon a  percentage share of any item that is within the discretion of the  employer. However, a disability benefit will not fail to be considered  definitely determinable merely because the determination of whether an  individual is disabled is made under established guidelines by an  authorized person or committee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is the notice required of collectively bargained plans?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: If an organization or trust claiming exemption under section  501(c) (9) or (17) is organized and maintained pursuant to a collective  bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more  employer, only one Form 1024 is required to be filed for the  organization or trust, regardless of the number of employers originally  participating in the agreement. Moreover, once a Form 1024 is filed  pursuant to a collective bargaining areement, an additional Form 1024 is  not required to be filed by an employer who thereafter participates in  that agreement. When benefits are provided pursuant to a collective  bargaining agreement, the notice will not be considered complete unless,  in addition to a properly completed and executed Form 1024, a copy of  the collective bargaining agreement is also submitted together with the  additional information delineated in Q&A-4.;</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: When must the required notice be filed by an organization or  trust, organized after July 18, 1984, that seeks recognition of  exemption under section 501(c) (9) or (17)?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: An organization or trust applying for exemption must file the  required notice by the later of February 4, 1987 or 15 months   from the end of the month in which the organization or trust was  organized. An extension of time for filing the required notice may be  granted by the district director if the request is submitted before the  end of the applicable period and it is demonstrated that additional time  is needed.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: What is the effective date of exemption for a new organization  or trust, organized after July 18, 1984, that has submitted the required  notice?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: If the required notice is filed within the time provided by  these regulations, the organization's exemption will be recognized  retroactively to the date the organization was organized, provided its  purpose, organization and operation (including compliance with the  applicable nondiscrimination requirements) during the period prior to  the date of the determination letter are in accordance with the  applicable law. However, if the required notice is filed after the time  provided by these regulations, exemption will be recognized only for the  period after the application is filed with the Internal Revenue Service.  The date of filing is the date of the United States postmark on the  cover in which an exemption application is mailed or, if no postmark  appears on the cover, the date the application is stamped as received by  the Service. If an extension for filing the required notice has been  granted to the organization, a notice filed on or before the last day  specified in the extension will be considered timely and not the  otherwise applicable date under Q&A-6.;</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: What is the effect on exemption of the filing of an incomplete  notice?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: Although a properly completed and executed Form 1024 together  with the required additional information (See Q&A-4; and Q&A-5;) must be  submitted to satisfy the notice required by section 505(c), the failure  to file, within the time specified, all of the information necessary to  complete such notice will not alone be sufficient to deny recognition of  exemption from the date of organization to the date the completed  information is submitted to the Service. If the notice which is filed  with the Service within the required time is substantially complete, and  the organization supplies the necessary additional information requested  by the Service within the additional time allowed, the original notice  will be considered timely. However, if the notice is not substantially  complete or the additional information is not provided within the  additional time allowed, exemption will be recognized only from the date  of filing of the additional information.  Section 501(c)(9) and (17) Organizations Organized on or Before July 18,</p><p class="depth0">1984</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: What is the notice required of an organization or trust  organized on or before July 18, 1984, that claims exempt status as an  organization described in section 501(c) (9) or (17)?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Section 505(c) provides a special rule for existing  organizations and trusts organized on or before July 18, 1984. Such an  organization or trust will not be treated as described in paragraphs (9)  or (17) of section 501(c) unless the organization or trust notifies the  Internal Revenue Service in the manner and within the time prescribed in  these regulations that it is claiming exemption under the particular  section. The type of notice, the manner for filing that notice, and the  additional information required is the same as that set forth in Q&A-3;  through Q&A-5; for new organizations.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: When must the required notice be filed by an organization or  trust organized on or before July 18, 1984?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: An organization or trust organized on or before July 18, 1984,  that claims exempt status as an organization described in section 501(c)  (9) or (17), must file the required notice before February 4, 1987. An  extension of time for filing the required notice may be granted by the  district director if the request is submitted before the due date of the  notice and it is demonstrated that additional time is needed.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: What is the effective date of exemption for an organization or  trust organized on or before July 18, 1984, that has submitted the  required notice?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: If the required notice is filed within the time provided by  these regulations, the organization's exemption will be recognized  retroactively to the date the organization was organized, provided its  purpose, organization and operation (including compliance with the  applicable nondiscrimination requirements) during the period prior to  the date of the determination letter are in accordance with the  applicable law. If, on the other hand, the required notice is filed  after the time provided by these regulations, exemption will be  recognized only for the period after the notice is received by the  Internal Revenue Service. See Q&A-7; for a further discussion of date of  filing. See also Q&A-8; for the effect on exemption of a notice that has  been timely filed but is incomplete.</p><p class="depth0">Exceptions to Notice Requirement</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: Are any organizations or trusts claiming recognition of  exemption as an organization described in section 501(c) (9) or (17)  excepted from the notice requirement of section 505(c)?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: An organization or trust that has previously notified the  Internal Revenue Service of its claim to exemption by filing Form 1024  is not required, under section 505(c), to renotify the Service. Thus, an  organization that has filed a Form 1024 that is pending with the Service  need not refile that form. Also, an organization that has received a  ruling or determination letter from the   Service recognizing its exemption from taxation need not submit the  notification required by section 505(c).
