When the grantee has failed to comply with the terms of the agreement, the District Director will promptly report the facts to the State Director. The State Director will consider termination or suspension of the grant usually only after a Grantee has been classified as ``high risk'' in accordance with Sec. 1944.417(b)(2). When the State Director determines that the grantee has a reasonable potential to correct deficiencies the grant may be suspended. The State Director will request written authorization from the National Office to suspend a grantee. The suspension will adhere to 2 CFR part 200 as adopted by USDA through 2 CFR part 400. The grantee will be notified of the grant suspension in writing by the State Director.

The State Director may also withhold further disbursement of grant funds and prohibit the grantee from incurring additional obligations of grant funds with written approval of the National Office. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will allow all necessary and proper costs which grantee could not reasonably avoid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination for cause. The grant agreement may be terminated in whole, or in part, at any time before date of completion, whenever FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 determines that the grantee has failed to comply with terms of the Agreement. The State Director will notify the grantee in writing giving the reasons for the action and inform the grantee of its rights of appeal by use of exhibit B-3 of subpart B of part 1900 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination for convenience. FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 or the grantee may terminate the grant in whole, or in part, when both parties agree that the continuation of the grant would not produce beneficial results. The two parties will agree in writing to the termination conditions including the effective date. No notice of rights of appeal will be issued by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354.
