                            <p class="depth0">A federal license or permit activity, or a federal assistance  activity, is ``consistent with the objectives or purposes of the Act''  if it satisfies each of the following three requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The activity furthers the national interest as articulated in  Sec. 302 or Sec. 303 of the Act, in a significant or substantial  manner,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The national interest furthered by the activity outweighs the  activity's adverse coastal effects, when those effects are considered  separately or cumulatively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There is no reasonable alternative available which would permit  the activity to be conducted in a manner consistent with the enforceable  policies of the management program. The Secretary may consider but is  not limited to considering previous appeal decisions, alternatives  described in state objection letters and alternatives and other  information submitted during the appeal. The Secretary shall not  consider an alternative unless the State agency submits a statement, in  a brief or other supporting material, to the Secretary that the  alternative would permit the activity to be conducted in a manner  consistent with the enforceable policies of the management program.
