                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> On-site reviews--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Required reviews for troubled PHAs. Except  as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, HUD will conduct an on- site review of PHA program management for any PHA assigned an overall  performance rating of troubled to assess the magnitude and seriousness  of the PHA's noncompliance with performance requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On-site reviews for small PHAs. Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, HUD may elect not to conduct an on-site review of a  troubled PHA, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The PHA has less than 250 assisted units; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> HUD determines that an on-site review is unnecessary to  determine the   needs of the PHA and the actions required to address the program  deficiencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> HUD written report. HUD must provide the PHA a written report of  its on-site review containing HUD findings of program management  deficiencies, the apparent reasons for the deficiencies, and  recommendations for improvement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> PHA corrective action plan. Upon receipt of the HUD written  report on its on-site review, the PHA must write a corrective action  plan and submit it to HUD for approval. The corrective action plan must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Specify goals to be achieved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify obstacles to goal achievement and ways to eliminate or  avoid them;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify resources that will be used or sought to achieve goals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify an PHA staff person with lead responsibility for  completing each goal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify key tasks to reach each goal;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Specify time frames for achievement of each goal, including  intermediate time frames to complete each key task; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide for regular evaluation of progress toward improvement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Be signed by the PHA board of commissioners chairperson and by  the PHA executive director. If the PHA is a unit of local government or  a state, the corrective action plan must be signed by the Section 8  program director and by the chief executive officer of the unit of  government or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring. The PHA and HUD must monitor the PHA's  implementation of its corrective action plan to ensure performance  targets are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use of administrative fee reserve prohibited. Any PHA assigned  an overall performance rating of troubled may not use any part of the  administrative fee reserve for other housing purposes (see 24 CFR  982.155(b)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upgrading poor performance rating. HUD shall change an PHA's  overall performance rating from troubled to standard or high performer  if HUD determines that a change in the rating is warranted because of  improved PHA performance and an improved SEMAP score.  (Information collection requirements in this section have been approved  by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 2577-0215)  [63 FR 48555, Sept. 10, 1998, as amended at 68 FR 37672, June 24, 2003]</p>
