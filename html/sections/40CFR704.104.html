A process with fugitive, inadvertent, or emergency pressure relief releases remains an enclosed process so long as measures are taken to prevent worker exposure to and environmental contamination from the releases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ``Small processor'' means a processor that meets either the standard in paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section or the standard in paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> First standard. A processor of a chemical substance is small if its total annual sales, when combined with those of its parent company, if any, are less than $40 million. However, if the annual processing volume of a particular chemical substance at any individual site owned or controlled by the processor is greater than 45,400 kilograms (100,000 pounds), the processor shall not qualify as small for purposes of reporting on the processing of that chemical substance at that site, unless the processor qualifies as small under paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Second standard.

EPA will use the Inflation Index described in the definition of ``small manufacturer'' that is set forth in Sec. 704.3 for purposes of adjusting the total annual sales values of this small processor definition.
