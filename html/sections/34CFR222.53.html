This is done as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each fiscal year determine the amount of an LEA's  expenditures for special education and related services and for early  intervention services provided to all children with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section is  divided by the average daily attendance (ADA) of the total number of  children with disabilities the LEA served during that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount determined in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section  is then multiplied by the total ADA of the LEA's federally connected  children with disabilities claimed by the LEA for that fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the amount of section 8003(d) funds the LEA received (or was  credited) for the fiscal year exceeds the amount obtained in paragraph  (d)(2)(iii) of this section, an overpayment equal to the excess section  8003(d) funds is established. This overpayment may be reduced or  eliminated to the extent that the LEA can demonstrate that the average  per pupil expenditure for special education and related services and for  early intervention services provided to federally connected children  with disabilities exceeded its average per pupil expenditure for serving  non-federally connected children with disabilities.
