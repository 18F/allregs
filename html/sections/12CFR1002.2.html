(1) The term means:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested in an application unless the creditor makes a counteroffer (to grant credit in a different amount or on other terms) and the applicant uses or expressly accepts the credit offered;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A termination of an account or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A refusal to increase the amount of credit available to an applicant who has made an application for an increase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term does not include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A change in the terms of an account expressly agreed to by an applicant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any action or forbearance relating to an account taken in connection with inactivity, default, or delinquency as to that account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A refusal or failure to authorize an account transaction at point of sale or loan, except when the refusal is a termination or an unfavorable change in the terms of an account that does not affect all or substantially all of a class of the creditor's accounts, or when the refusal is a denial of an application for an increase in the amount of credit available under the account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A refusal to extend credit because applicable law prohibits the creditor from extending the credit requested; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A refusal to extend credit because the creditor does not offer the type of credit or credit plan requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An action that falls within the definition of both paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section is governed by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Age refers only to the age of natural persons and means the number of fully elapsed years from the date of an applicant's birth.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Applicant means any person who requests or who has received an extension of credit from a creditor, and includes any person who is or may become contractually liable regarding an extension of credit. For purposes of Sec. 1002.7(d), the term includes guarantors, sureties, endorsers, and similar parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application means an oral or written request for an extension of credit that is made in accordance with procedures used by a creditor for the type of credit requested.

The creditor shall exercise reasonable diligence in obtaining such information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Business credit refers to extensions of credit primarily for business or commercial (including agricultural) purposes, but excluding extensions of credit of the types described in Sec.

The term creditor includes a creditor's assignee, transferee, or subrogee who so participates. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1002.4(a) and (b), the term creditor also includes a person who, in the ordinary course of business, regularly refers applicants or prospective applicants to creditors, or selects or offers to select creditors to whom requests for credit may be made.

To qualify as an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system, the system must be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Based on data that are derived from an empirical comparison of sample groups or the population of creditworthy and non-creditworthy applicants who applied for credit within a reasonable preceding period of time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Developed for the purpose of evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants with respect to the legitimate business interests of the creditor utilizing the system (including, but not limited to, minimizing bad debt losses and operating expenses in accordance with the creditor's business judgment);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Developed and validated using accepted statistical principles and methodology; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Periodically revalidated by the use of appropriate statistical principles and methodology and adjusted as necessary to maintain predictive ability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A creditor may use an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system obtained from another person or may obtain credit experience from which to develop such a system. Any such system must satisfy the criteria set forth in paragraph (p)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section; if the creditor is unable during the development process to validate the system based on its own credit experience in accordance with paragraph (p)(1) of this section, the system must be validated when sufficient credit experience becomes available. A system that fails this validity test is no longer an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system for that creditor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Extend credit and extension of credit mean the granting of credit in any form (including, but not limited to, credit granted in addition to any existing credit or credit limit; credit granted pursuant to an open-end credit plan; the refinancing or other renewal of credit, including the issuance of a new credit card in place of an expiring credit card or in substitution for an existing credit card; the consolidation of two or more obligations; or the continuance of existing credit without any special effort to collect at or after maturity).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Good faith means honesty in fact in the conduct or transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Inadvertent error means a mechanical, electronic, or clerical error that a creditor demonstrates was not intentional and occurred notwithstanding the maintenance of procedures reasonably adapted to avoid such errors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Judgmental system of evaluating applicants means any system for evaluating the creditworthiness of an applicant other than an empirically derived, demonstrably and statistically sound, credit scoring system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Marital status means the state of being unmarried, married, or separated, as defined by applicable state law. The term ``unmarried'' includes persons who are single, divorced, or widowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Negative factor or value, in relation to the age of elderly applicants, means utilizing a factor, value, or weight that is less favorable regarding elderly applicants than the creditor's experience warrants or is less favorable than the factor, value, or weight assigned to the class of applicants that are not classified as elderly and are most favored by a creditor on the basis of age.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Open-end credit means credit extended under a plan in which a creditor may permit an applicant to make purchases or obtain loans from time to time directly from the creditor or indirectly by use of a credit card, check, or other device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Person means a natural person, corporation, government or governmental subdivision or agency, trust, estate, partnership, cooperative, or association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Pertinent element of creditworthiness, in relation to a judgmental system of evaluating applicants, means any information about applicants that a creditor obtains and considers and that has a demonstrable relationship to a determination of creditworthiness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(z)</em> Prohibited basis means race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided that the applicant has the capacity to enter into a binding contract); the fact that all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program; or the fact that the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act or any state law upon which an exemption has been granted by the Bureau.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(aa)</em> State means any state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or any territory or possession of the United States.</p>
