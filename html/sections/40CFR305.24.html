                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Default. A party may be found to be in default: after motion,  upon failure of the Claims Official to file a   timely answer to the Request for a Hearing; after motion or sua sponte,  upon failure to comply with a prehearing or hearing order of the  Presiding Officer; or after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to appear  at a conference or hearing without good cause being shown. No finding of  default on the basis of failure to appear at a hearing shall be made  against the Claims Official unless the Requestor presents sufficient  evidence to the Presiding Officer to establish a prima facie case in  support of his claim. Any motion for a default order shall include a  proposed default order and shall be served upon all parties. The alleged  defaulting party shall have 10 days from service to reply to the motion.  Default by the Claims Official constitutes, for purposes of the pending  action only, an admission of all facts alleged in the claim and a waiver  of his right to a hearing on such factual allegations. Default by the  Requestor may result in the dismissal of the Request for a Hearing with  prejudice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures upon default. When the Presiding Officer finds a  default has occurred, he shall issue a default order against the  defaulting party. The default order shall constitute the final order in  the proceeding, and shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of a default order. A default order shall include  findings of fact showing the grounds for the order; conclusions  regarding all material issues of law; costs to be assessed pursuant to  Sec. 305.36, if applicable; and, the amount to be awarded the claimant,  if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Setting aside a default order. For good cause shown, the  Presiding Officer may set aside a default order.</p>
