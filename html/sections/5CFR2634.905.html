                                Sec. 2634.905  Use of alternative procedures.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With the prior written approval of OGE, an agency may use an  alternative procedure in lieu of filing the OGE Form 450 or OGE Optional  Form 450-A. The alternative procedure may be an agency-specific form to  be filed in place thereof. An agency must submit for approval a  description of its proposed alternative procedure to OGE.</p><p class="depth2">Example to paragraph (a). A nonsupervisory auditor at an agency is  regularly assigned to cases involving possible loan improprieties by  financial institutions. Prior to undertaking each enforcement review,  the auditor reviews the file to determine if she, her spouse, minor or  dependent child, or any general partner, organization in which she  serves as an officer, director, trustee, employee, or general partner,  or organization with which she is negotiating or has an agreement or an  arrangement for future employment, or a close friend or relative is a  subject of the investigation, or will be in any way affected by the  investigation. Once she determines that there is no such relationship,  she signs and dates a certification which verifies that she has reviewed  the file and has determined that no conflict of interest exists. She  then files the certification with the head of her auditing division at  the agency. On the other hand, if she cannot execute the certification,  she informs the head of her auditing division. In response, the division  will either reassign the case or review the conflicting interest to  determine whether a waiver would be appropriate. This alternative  procedure, if approved by the Office of Government Ethics in writing,  may be used in lieu of requiring the auditor to file a confidential  financial disclosure report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An agency may use the OGE Optional Form 450-A (Confidential  Certificate of No New Interests) in place of the OGE Form 450 if the  agency head or designee determines it is adequate to prevent possible  conflicts of interest.This form may be used by eligible filers, as  described in this paragraph, who can certify, after reexamining their  most recent previous OGE Form 450, that they (and their spouse and  dependent children) have acquired no new interests required to be  reported on   OGE Form 450, and that they have not changed jobs (no new position  description or other significant change in duties) at their agency since  filing that previous report. OGE Optional Form 450-A will be used under  the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OGE Optional Form 450-A will only be made available for use by  current employees who are not special Government employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OGE Optional Form 450-A will only be used by incumbent filers,  as described in Sec. 2634.903(a) of this subpart, in lieu of filing an  annual OGE Form 450, who have a previous OGE Form 450 on file with their  agency for the position they currently hold. Its due date is as  specified in Sec. 2634.903(a), unless extended under Sec. 2634.903(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As indicated on the OGE Optional Form 450-A, eligible filers may  use OGE Optional Form 450-A, if applicable to their circumstances, or  they may file a new OGE Form 450, at their option. Therefore, a blank  OGE Form 450 and its accompanying written instructions should ordinarily  be distributed to them, along with the blank OGE Optional Form 450-A.  The instructions to OGE Form 450 will also provide guidance on what is  meant by ``reportable'' interests on OGE Optional Form 450-A. In lieu of  distributing a blank OGE Form 450 and its instructions, agencies may  choose to develop separate guidance on the meaning of ``reportable''  interests, or they may refer certificate users to guidance contained in  any available source, such as the Office of Government Ethics' Web site  on the Internet or agency-approved electronic software for OGE Form 450.  Filers would then also have to be advised of where to obtain a blank OGE  Form 450, if needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> OGE Optional Form 450-A may be used by eligible filers for a  maximum of three consecutive years before they are required to complete  a new OGE Form 450 every fourth year, on a uniform basis for all  incumbent (annual) filers, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section. Agencies may, however, elect to permit use of the OGE Optional  Form 450-A for only one year (or two years), and to require a new OGE  Form 450 every second (or third) year, on a uniform basis for all  incumbent filers, as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In each year divisible by four, beginning in 2000 (or divisible  by two or three, beginning in 1998, for agencies that choose one of the  more frequent options described in the second sentence of paragraph  (b)(4) of this section), all incumbent filers, as described in  Sec. 2634.903(a) of this subpart, must file a new OGE Form 450 rather  than OGE Optional Form 450-A, regardless of how recently they may have  filed an OGE Form 450 (either as a new entrant or as an annual filer who  was not eligible to use, or chose not to use, the optional certificate).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> When submitting OGE Optional Form 450-A, filers are not required  to attach a copy of their previous OGE Form 450, unless their agency  determines that it is necessary. Filers should be encouraged, however,  to retain a copy of their previous OGE Form 450, so that it will be  readily available for their examination prior to completing an OGE  Optional Form 450-A.  [57 FR 11826, Apr. 7, 1992; 57 FR 21855, May 22, 1992, as amended at 62  FR 33976, June 24, 1997; 71 FR 28235, May 16, 2006]</p>
