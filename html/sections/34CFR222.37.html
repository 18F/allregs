The sampling must include attendance data for all children for at least 30 school days. The data must be collected during at least three periods evenly distributed throughout the school year. Each collection period must consist of at least five consecutive school days.

If the Secretary determines that those data are, in effect, equivalent to attendance data, the Secretary allows use of the requested data and determines the method by which the ADA of the LEA's federally connected children will be calculated.
