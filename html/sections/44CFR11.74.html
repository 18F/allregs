Claims which arose during the  conduct of personal business are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subrogation claims. Claims based upon payment or other  consideration to a proper claimant are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assigned claims. Claims based upon assignment of a claim by a  proper claimant are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Conditional vendor claims. Claims asserted by or on behalf of a  conditional vendor are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claims by improper claimants. Claims by persons not designated  in Sec. 11.71 are not payable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Articles of extraordinary value. Claims are not payable for  valuable or expensive articles, such as cameras, watches, jewelry, furs,  or other articles of extraordinary value, when shipped with household  goods or as unaccompanied baggage (shipment includes storage). This  prohibition does not apply to articles in the personal custody of the  claimant or articles properly checked, provided that reasonable  protection or security measures have been taken, by the claimant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Articles acquired for other persons. Claims are not payable for  articles intended directly or indirectly for persons other than the  claimant or members of the claimants' immediate household. This  prohibition includes articles acquired at the request of others and  articles for sale.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Property used for business. Claims are not payable for property  normally used for business or profit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Unserviceable property.

Claims are not normally payable for fees  paid to obtain estimates of repair in conjunction with submitting a  claim under this subpart. However, where, in the opinion of the  adjudicating authority, the claimant could not obtain an estimate  without paying a fee, such a claim may be considered in an amount  reasonable in relation to the value for the cost of repairs of the  articles involved, provided that the evidence furnished clearly  indicates that the amount of the fee paid will not be deducted from the  cost of repairs if the work is accomplished by the estimator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Items fraudulently claimed. Claims are not payable for items  fraudulently claimed. When investigation discloses that a claimant,  claimant's agent, claimant's employee, or member of claimant's family  has intentionally misrepresented an item claimed as to cost, condition,  costs to repair, etc., the item will be disallowed in its entirety even  though some actual damage has been sustained. However, if the remainder  of the claim is proper, it may be paid. This does not preclude  appropriate disciplinary action if warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Minimum amount. Loss or damage amounting to less than $10.</p>
