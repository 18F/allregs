                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps and the National  Defense Cadet Corps programs are designed for physically fit citizens  attending participating schools. They provide meaningful leadership  instruction of benefit to the student and of value to the Armed Forces.  The programs provide unique educational opportunities for young citizens  through their participation in a Federally-sponsored course while  pursuing a normal civilian education. Students will acquire:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An understanding of the fundamental concept of leadership,  military art and science,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An introduction to related professional knowledge, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An appreciation of requirements for national security. The dual  roles of citizen/soldier and soldier/citizen are studied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participants in either of the programs will acquire relevant  knowledge and develop personally. Schools conducting these programs will  offer their students the challenge of intellectual inquiry under the  direction of instructors who are experienced leaders. (JROTC instructors  are active duty or retired members of the US Army. NDCC schools may  employ retired or Reserve members.) These programs provide an atmosphere  designed to develop the qualities of leadership. Through classroom and  other activities, the students will acquire the knowledge, self- discipline, patriotism, sense of responsibility, and responsiveness to  constituted authority which will better prepare them for the future.  These programs will enable cadets to better serve their country as  leaders, as citizens, and in military service should they enter it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The programs were set up as part of the National Defense Act of  1916. The principle of maintaining national programs of training for the  young citizens attending school was validated during congressional  hearings preceding passage of the ROTC Vitalization Act of 1964. The  JROTC and NDCC are not, of themselves, officer-producing programs but  should create favorable attitudes and impressions toward the Services  and toward careers in the Armed Forces. JROTC/NDCC cadets may qualify  for an advantageous position in the Senior ROTC and for a higher pay  grade upon enlistment in a Regular or Reserve component of the Armed  Forces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Participation in JROTC/NDCC does not obligate the student to  perform military or any other Federal service. Although all qualified  students of JROTC/NDCC host schools are encouraged to take part in these  programs, they are not required by Federal law to do so. State,  community, or school authorities decree whether students must be in the  programs.</p>
