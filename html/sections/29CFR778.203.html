                                Sec. 778.203  Premium pay for work on Saturdays, Sundays, and other
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Under section 7(e)(6) and 7(h) of the Act, extra compensation provided by a Premium rate of at least time and one-half which is paid for work on Saturdays, Sundays, holidays, or regular days of rest or on the sixth or seventh day of the workweek (hereinafter referred to as ``special days'') may be treated as an overtime premium for the purposes of the Act. If the premium rate is less than time and one-half, the extra compensation provided by such rate must be included in determining the employee's regular rate of pay and cannot be credited toward statutory overtime due, unless it qualifies as an overtime premium under section 7(e)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> ``Special days'' rate must be at least time and one-half to qualify as overtime premium: The premium rate must be at least ``one and one-half times the rate established in good faith for like work performed in nonovertime hours on other days.'' Where an employee is hired on the basis of a salary for a fixed workweek or at a single hourly rate of pay, the rate paid for work on ``special days'' must be at least time and one-half his regular hourly rate in order to qualify under section 7(e)(6). If the employee is a pieceworker or if he works at more than one job for which different hourly or piece rates have been established and these are bona fide rates applicable to the work when performed during nonovertime hours, the extra compensation provided by a premium rate of at least one and one-half times either (1) the bona fide rate applicable to the type of job the employee performs on the ``special days'', or (2) the average hourly earnings in the week in question, will qualify as an overtime premium under this section. (For a fuller discussion of computation on the average rate, see Sec. 778.111; on the rate applicable to the job, see Sec. Sec. 778.415 through 778.421; on the ``established'' rate, see Sec. 778.400.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Bona fide base rate required. The statute authorizes such premiums paid for work on ``special days'' to be treated as overtime premiums only if they are actually based on a ``rate established in good faith for like work performed in nonovertime hours on other days.'' This phrase is used for the purpose of distinguishing the bona fide employment standards contemplated by section 7(e)(6) from fictitious schemes and artificial or evasive devices as discussed in Subpart F of this part. Clearly, a rate which yields the employee less than time and one-half the minimum rate prescribed by the Act would not be a rate established in good faith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Work on the specified ``special days'': To qualify as an overtime premium under section 7(e)(6), the extra compensation must be paid for work on the specified days. The term ``holiday'' is read in its ordinary usage to refer to those days customarily observed in the community in celebration of some historical or religious occasion. A day of rest arbitrarily granted to employees because of lack of work is not a ``holiday'' within the meaning of this section, nor is it a ``regular day of rest.'' The term ``regular day of rest'' means a day on which the employee in accordance with his regular prearranged schedule is not expected to report for work. In some instances the ``regular day of rest'' occurs on the same day or days each week for a particular employee; in other cases, pursuant to a swing shift schedule, the schedule day of rest rotates in a definite pattern, such as 6 days work followed by 2 days of rest. In either case the extra compensation provided by a premium rate for work on such scheduled days of rest (if such rate is at least one and one-half times the bona fide rate established for like work during nonovertime hours on other days) may be treated as an overtime premium and thus need not be included in computing

the employee's regular rate of pay and may be credited toward overtime payments due under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Payment of premiums for work performed on the ``special day'': To qualify as an overtime premium under section 7(e)(6), the premium must be paid because work is performed on the days specified and not for some other reason which would not qualify the premium as an overtime premium under section 7(e)(5), (6), or (7). (For examples distinguishing pay for work on a holiday from idle holiday pay, see Sec. 778.219.) Thus a premium rate paid to an employee only when he received less than 24 hours' notice that he is required to report for work on his regular day of rest is not a premium paid for work on one of the specified days; it is a premium imposed as a penalty upon the employer for failure to give adequate notice to compensate the employee for the inconvenience of disarranging his private life. The extra compensation is not an overtime premium. It is part of his regular rate of pay unless such extra compensation is paid the employee on infrequent and sporadic occasions so as to qualify for exclusion under section 7(e)(2) in which event it need not be included in computing his regular rate of pay, as explained in Sec. 778.222.


Sec. 778.204  ``Clock pattern'' premium pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overtime premiums under section 7(e)(7). Where a collective bargaining agreement or other applicable employment contract in good faith establishes certain hours of the day as the basic, normal, or regular workday (not exceeding 8 hours) or workweek (not exceeding the maximum hours standard applicable under section 7(a)) and provides for the payment of a premium rate for work outside such hours, the extra compensation provided by such premium rate will be treated as an overtime premium if the premium rate is not less than one and one-half times the rate established in good faith by the contract or agreement for like work performed during the basic, normal or regular workday or workweek.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Premiums for hours outside established working hours. To qualify as an overtime premium under section 7(e)(7) the premium must be paid because the work was performed during hours ``outside of the hours established * * * as the basic * * * workday or workweek'' and not for some other reason. Thus, if the basic workday is established in good faith as the hours from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. a premium of time and one-half paid for hours between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. would qualify as an overtime premium. However, where the contract does not provide for the payment of a premium except for work between midnight and 6 a.m. the premium would not qualify under this section since it is not a premium paid for work outside the established workday but only for certain special hours outside the established workday, in most instances because they are undesirable hours. Similarly, where payments of premium rates for work are made after 5 p.m. only if the employee has not had a meal period or rest period, they are not regarded as overtime premiums; they are premiums paid because of undesirable working conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payment in pursuance of agreement. Premiums of the type which section 7(e)(7) authorizes to be treated as overtime premiums must be paid ``in pursuance of an applicable employment contract or collective bargaining agreement,'' and the rates of pay and the daily and weekly work periods referred to must be established in good faith by such contract or agreement. Although as a general rule a collective bargaining agreement is a formal agreement which has been reduced to writing, an employment contract for purposes of section 7(e)(7) may be either written or oral. Where there is a written employment contract and the practices of the parties differ from its provisions, it must be determined whether the practices of the parties have modified the contract. If the practices of the parties have modified the written provisions of the contract, the provisions of the contract as modified by the practices of the parties will be controlling in determining whether the requirements of section 7(e)(7) are satisfied. The determination as to the existence of the requisite provisions in an applicable oral employment contract will necessarily be based on all the facts, including those showing the terms of

the oral contract and the actual employment and pay practices thereunder.</p>
