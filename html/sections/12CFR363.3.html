                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual audit of financial statements. Each insured depository  institution shall engage an independent public accountant to audit and  report on its annual financial statements in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards or the PCAOB's auditing standards, if  applicable, and section 37 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12  U.S.C. 1831n). The scope of the audit engagement shall be sufficient to  permit such accountant to determine and report whether the financial  statements are presented fairly and in accordance with GAAP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Internal control over financial reporting. For each insured  depository institution with total assets of $1 billion or more at the  beginning of the institution's fiscal year, the independent public  accountant who audits the institution's financial statements shall  examine, attest to, and report separately on the assertion of management  concerning the effectiveness of the institution's internal control  structure and procedures for financial reporting. The attestation and  report shall be made in accordance with generally accepted standards for  attestation engagements or the PCAOB's auditing standards, if  applicable. The accountant's report must not be dated prior to the date  of the management report and management's assessment of the  effectiveness   of internal control over financial reporting. Notwithstanding the  requirements set forth in applicable professional standards, the  accountant's report must include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement identifying the internal control framework used by  the independent public accountant, which must be the same as the  internal control framework used by management, to evaluate the  effectiveness of the insured depository institution's internal control  over financial reporting;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the independent public accountant's evaluation  included controls over the preparation of regulatory financial  statements in accordance with regulatory reporting instructions  including identification of such regulatory reporting instructions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement expressing the independent public accountant's  conclusion as to whether the insured depository institution's internal  control over financial reporting is effective as of the end of its  fiscal year. The report must disclose all material weaknesses in  internal control over financial reporting that the independent public  accountant has identified that have not been remediated prior to the  insured depository institution's fiscal year-end. The independent public  accountant is precluded from concluding that the insured depository  institution's internal control over financial reporting is effective if  there are one or more material weaknesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice by accountant of termination of services. An independent  public accountant performing an audit under this part who ceases to be  the accountant for an insured depository institution shall notify the  FDIC, the appropriate Federal banking agency, and any appropriate State  bank supervisor in writing of such termination within 15 days after the  occurrence of such event, and set forth in reasonable detail the reasons  for such termination. The written notice shall be filed at the place  identified in Sec. 363.4(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Communications with audit committee. In addition to the  requirements for communications with audit committees set forth in  applicable professional standards, the independent public accountant  must report the following on a timely basis to the audit committee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All critical accounting policies and practices to be used by the  insured depository institution,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All alternative accounting treatments within GAAP for policies  and practices related to material items that the independent public  accountant has discussed with management, including the ramifications of  the use of such alternative disclosures and treatments, and the  treatment preferred by the independent public accountant, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other written communications the independent public accountant  has provided to management, such as a management letter or schedule of  unadjusted differences.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retention of working papers. The independent public accountant  must retain the working papers related to the audit of the insured  depository institution's financial statements and, if applicable, the  evaluation of the institution's internal control over financial  reporting for seven years from the report release date, unless a longer  period of time is required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Independence. The independent public accountant must comply with  the independence standards and interpretations of the AICPA, the SEC,  and the PCAOB. To the extent that any of the rules within any one of  these independence standards (AICPA, SEC, and PCAOB) is more or less  restrictive than the corresponding rule in the other independence  standards, the independent public accountant must comply with the more  restrictive rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Peer reviews and inspection reports. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to commencing any  services for an insured depository institution under this part, the  independent public accountant must have received a peer review, or be  enrolled in a peer review program, that meets acceptable guidelines.  Acceptable peer reviews include peer reviews performed in accordance  with the AICPA's Peer Review Standards and inspections conducted by the  PCAOB.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 15 days of receiving notification that a peer review has  been accepted or a PCAOB inspection report has been issued, or before  commencing any audit under this part, whichever is   earlier, the independent public accountant must file two copies of the  most recent peer review report and the public portion of the most recent  PCAOB inspection report, if any, accompanied by any letters of comments,  response, and acceptance, with the FDIC, Accounting and Securities  Disclosure Section, 550 17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429, if the  report has not already been filed. The peer review reports and the  public portions of the PCAOB inspection reports will be made available  for public inspection by the FDIC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 15 days of the PCAOB making public a previously nonpublic  portion of an inspection report, the independent public accountant must  file two copies of the previously nonpublic portion of the inspection  report with the FDIC, Accounting and Securities Disclosure Section, 550  17th Street, NW., Washington, DC 20429. Such previously nonpublic  portion of the PCAOB inspection report will be made available for public  inspection by the FDIC.</p>
