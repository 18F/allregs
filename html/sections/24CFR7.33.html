                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Information to be included in complaint. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complaint filed  should include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The specific claim or personnel matter which is alleged to be  discriminatory;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date the act or matter occurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The protected basis or bases on which the alleged  discrimination occurred;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Facts and other pertinent information to support the claim(s)  of discrimination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The relief desired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To expedite the processing of complaints of discrimination, the  Complainant may use the HUD EEO-1 Complaint Form to file the complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amendments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Complainant may amend a complaint at any time  prior to the conclusion of the investigation to include issues or claims  like or related to those raised in the complaint. After requesting a  hearing, a Complainant may file a motion with the EEOC Administrative  Judge to amend a complaint to include issues or claims like or related  to those raised in the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Department shall acknowledge receipt of a complaint or an  amendment to a complaint in writing and inform the Complainant of the  date on which the complaint or amendment was filed. The Department shall  advise the Complainant in the acknowledgment of the EEOC office and its  address where a request for a hearing shall be sent. Such acknowledgment  shall also advise the Complainant that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Complainant has the right to appeal the dismissal of or  final action on a complaint; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Department is required to conduct an impartial and  appropriate investigation of the complaint within 180 days of the filing  of the complaint unless the parties agree in writing to extend the time  period. When a complaint has been amended, the Department shall complete  its investigation within the earlier of 180 days after the last  amendment to the complaint or 360 days after the filing of the original  complaint, except that the Complainant may request a hearing from an  EEOC Administrative Judge on the consolidated complaints any time after  180 days from the date of the first filed complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Joint processing and consolidation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complaints of  discrimination filed by two or more Complainants consisting of  substantially similar allegations of discrimination or relating to the  same matter may be consolidated by the Department or the EEOC for joint  processing after appropriate notification to the parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same  Complainant shall be consolidated by the Department for joint processing  after appropriate notification to the Complainant. When a complaint has  been consolidated with one or more earlier filed complaints, the  Department shall complete its investigation within the earlier of 180  days after the filing of the last complaint or 360 days after the filing  of the original complaint, except that the Complainant may request a  hearing from an EEOC Administrative Judge on the consolidated complaints  any time after 180 days from the date of the first filed complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> EEOC Administrative Judges or the EEOC may, in their discretion,  consolidate two or more complaints of discrimination filed by the same  Complainant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Class complaints--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A class is a group of  employees, former employees or applicants for employment who, it is  alleged, have been or are being adversely affected by the Department's  personnel management policy or practice that discriminates against the  group on the basis of their common race, color, religion, sex, national  origin, age, disability, or in reprisal for participating in protected  EEO activity or for opposing a practice made illegal under the EEO  statutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A class complaint is a written complaint of discrimination  filed on behalf of a class by the agent of the class that satisfies the  requirements of 29 CFR 1614.204.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pre-complaint processing. A current or former employee or  applicant who wishes to file a class complaint must be counseled in  accordance with 29 CFR 1614.105. A Complainant may move for class  certification at any reasonable point in the process when it becomes  apparent that there are class implications to the claim raised in an  individual complaint. If a Complainant moves for class certification  after completing the counseling process in 29 CFR 1614.105, no  additional counseling is required. Class certification shall be denied  by the EEOC Administrative Judge, when the Complainant has unduly  delayed in moving for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certification. Class complaints are certified by an EEOC  Administrative Judge in accordance with the provisions of 29 CFR  1614.204.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Mixed case complaints--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions. A mixed case complaint  is a complaint of employment discrimination filed with a Federal agency  based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability,  or in reprisal for participating in protected EEO activity or for  opposing a policy or practice made illegal by the EEO statutes, related  to or stemming from an action that can be appealed to the Merit Systems  Protection Board (MSPB). The complaint may contain only a claim of  employment discrimination or the complaint may contain additional claims  that the MSPB has jurisdiction to address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Election. An aggrieved person may initially file a mixed case  complaint with the Department pursuant to this section or an appeal on  the same matter with the MSPB pursuant to 5 CFR 1201.151, but not both.  The Department shall inform every employee who is the subject of an  action that is appealable to the MSPB and who has either orally or in  writing raised the issue of discrimination during the processing of the  action of the right to file either a mixed case complaint with the  Department or to file a mixed case appeal with the MSPB. If a person  files a mixed case appeal with the MSPB instead of a mixed case  complaint and the MSPB dismisses the appeal for jurisdictional reasons,  the Department shall promptly notify the individual in writing of the  right to contact an EEO counselor within 45 days of receipt of this  notice and to file an EEO complaint, subject to 29 CFR 1614.107.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Procedures for agency processing of mixed case complaints. When  a complainant elects to proceed initially under 29 CFR part 1614,  subpart C, rather than with the MSPB, the procedures in 29 CFR part  1614, subpart A, shall govern the processing of the mixed case complaint  with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the time the Department advises a Complainant of the  acceptance of a mixed case complaint, the Department shall also advise  the Complainant that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If a final decision is not issued within 120 days of the date of  filing of the mixed case complaint, the Complainant may appeal the  matter to the MSPB at any time thereafter as specified at 5 CFR  1201.154(b)(2) or may file a civil action as specified at 29 CFR  1614.310(g), but not both; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the Complainant is dissatisfied with the Department's final  decision on the mixed case complaint, the Complainant may appeal the  matter to MSPB (not EEOC) within 30 days of receipt of the Department's  final decision;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon completion of the investigation, the notice provided the  Complainant in accordance with 29 CFR 1614.108(f) will advise the  Complainant that a final decision will be issued within 45 days without  a hearing; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At the time that the Department issues its final decision on a  mixed case complaint, the Department shall advise the Complainant of the  right to appeal the matter to the MSPB (not EEOC) within 30 days of  receipt and of the right to file a civil action as provided at 29 CFR  1614.310(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dismissal. The Department may dismiss a mixed case complaint for  the reasons provided in, and under the conditions prescribed in 29 CFR  1614.107. If MSPB's Administrative Judge finds that MSPB does not have  jurisdiction over the matter, the Department shall resume processing of  the complaint as a non-mixed case EEO complaint.</p>
