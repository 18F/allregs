                                Sec. 1.864-5  Foreign source income effectively connected with
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section applies only to a nonresident alien  individual or a foreign corporation that is engaged in a trade or  business in the United States at some time during a taxable year  beginning after December 31, 1966, and to the income, gain, or loss of  such person from sources without the United States. The income, gain, or  loss of such person for the taxable year from sources without the United  States which is specified in paragraph (b) of this section shall be  treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct  of a trade or business in the United States, only if he also has in the  United States at some time during the taxable year, but not necessarily  at the time the income, gain, or loss is realized, an office or other  fixed place of business, as defined in Sec. 1.864-7, to which such  income, gain, or loss is attributable in accordance with Sec. 1.864-6.  The income of such person for the taxable year from sources without the  United States which is specified in paragraph (c) of this section shall  be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States when derived by a  foreign corporation carrying on a life insurance business in the United  States. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, no  income, gain, or loss of a nonresident alien individual or a foreign  corporation for the taxable year from sources without the United States  shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that person. Any  income, gain, or loss described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section  which, if it were derived by the taxpayer from sources within the United  States for the taxable year, would not be treated under Sec. 1.864-4 as  effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade  or business in the United States shall not be treated under this section  as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a  trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Income other than income attributable to U.S. life insurance  business. Income, gain, or loss from sources without the United States  other than income described in paragraph (c) of this section shall be  taken into account pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section in applying  Sec. Sec. 1.864-6 and 1.864-7 only if it consists of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rents, royalties, or gains on sales of intangible property. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>  Rents or royalties for the use of, or for the privilege of using,  intangible personal property located outside the United States or from  any interest in such property, including rents or royalties for the use,  or for the privilege of using, outside the United States, patents,  copyrights, secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade  brands, franchises, and other like properties, if such rents or  royalties are derived in the active conduct of the trade or business in  the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Gains or losses on the sale or exchange of intangible personal  property located outside the United States or from any interest in such  property, including gains or losses on the sale or exchange of the  privilege of using, outside the United States, patents, copyrights,  secret processes and formulas, good will, trademarks, trade brands,  franchises, and other like properties, if such gains or losses are  derived in the active conduct of the trade or business in the United  States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether or not such an item of income, gain, or loss is  derived in the active conduct of a trade or business in the United  States shall be determined from the facts and circumstances of each  case. The frequency with which a nonresident alien individual or a  foreign corporation enters into transactions of the type from which the  income, gain, or loss is derived shall not of itself determine that the  income, gain, or loss is derived in the active conduct of a trade or  business.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> This subparagraph shall not apply to rents or royalties for the  use of, or for the privilege of using, real property or tangible  personal property,   or to gain or loss from the sale or exchange of such property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Dividends or interest, or gains or loss from sales of stocks or  securities--(i) In general. Dividends or interests from any transaction,  or gains or losses on the sale or exchange of stocks or securities,  realized by (a) a nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation  in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in  the United States or (b) a foreign corporation engaged in business in  the United States whose principal business is trading in stocks or  securities for its own account. Whether the taxpayer is engaged in the  active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the  United States for purposes of this subparagraph shall be determined in  accordance with the principles of paragraph (c)(5)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of Sec. 1.864-4.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> is applicable to  payments made after November 13, 1997.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Incidental investment activity. This subparagraph shall not  apply to income, gain, or loss realized by a nonresident alien  individual or foreign corporation on stocks or securities held, sold, or  exchanged in connection with incidental investment activities carried on  by that person. Thus, a foreign corporation which is primarily a holding  company owning significant percentages of the stocks or securities  issued by other corporations shall not be treated under this  subparagraph as a corporation the principal business of which is trading  in stocks or securities for its own account, solely because it engages  in sporadic purchases or sales of stocks or securities to adjust its  portfolio. The application of this subdivision may be illustrated by the  following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. F, a foreign corporation, owns voting stock in foreign  corporations M, N, and P, its holdings in such corporations constituting  15, 20, and 100 percent, respectively, of all classes of their  outstanding voting stock. Each of such stock holdings by F represents  approximately 20 percent of its total assets. The remaining 40 percent  of F's assets consist of other investments, 20 percent being invested in  securities issued by foreign governments and in stocks and bonds issued  by other corporations in which F does not own a significant percentage  of their outstanding voting stock, and 20 percent being invested in  bonds issued by N. None of the assets of F are held primarily for sale;  but if the officers of that corporation were to decide that other  investments would be preferable to its holding of such assets, F would  sell the stocks and securities and reinvest the proceeds therefrom in  other holdings. Any income, gain, or loss which F may derive from this  investment activity is not considered to be realized by a foreign  corporation described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sale of goods or merchandise through U.S. office. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Income,  gain, or loss from the sale of inventory items or of property held  primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, as  described in section 1221(1), where the sale is outside the United  States but through the office or other fixed place of business which the  nonresident alien or foreign corporation has in the United States,  irrespective of the destination to which such property is sent for use,  consumption, or disposition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> This subparagraph shall not apply to income, gain, or loss  resulting from a sales contract entered into on or before February 24,  1966. See section 102(e)(1) of the Foreign Investors Tax Act of 1966 (80  Stat. 1547). Thus, for example, the sales office in the United States of  a foreign corporation enters into negotiations for the sale of 500,000  industrial bearings which the corporation produces in a foreign country  for consumption in the Western Hemisphere. These negotiations culminate   in a binding agreement entered into on January 1, 1966. By its terms  delivery under the contract is to be made over a period of 3 years  beginning in March of 1966. Payment is due upon delivery. The income  from sources without the United States resulting from this sale  negotiated by the U.S. sales office of the foreign corporation shall not  be taken into account under this subparagraph for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> This subparagraph shall not apply to gains or losses on the  sale or exchange of intangible personal property to which subparagraph  (1) of this paragraph applies or of stocks or securities to which  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph applies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Income attributable to U.S. life insurance business. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All of  the income for the taxable year of a foreign corporation described in  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph from sources without the United  States, which is attributable to its U.S. life insurance business, shall  be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that corporation.  Thus, in determining its life insurance company taxable income from its  U.S. business for purposes of section 802, the foreign corporation shall  include all of its items of income from sources without the United  States which would appropriately be taken into account in determining  the life insurance company taxable income of a domestic corporation. The  income to which this subparagraph applies shall be taken into account  for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section without reference to  Sec. Sec. 1.864-6 and 1.864-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A foreign corporation to which subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph applies is a foreign corporation carrying on an insurance  business in the United States during the taxable year which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Without taking into account its income not effectively connected  for that year with the conduct of any trade or business in the United  States, would qualify as a life insurance company under part I (section  801 and following) of subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, if it were a  domestic corporation, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By reason of section 842 is taxable under that part on its  income which is effectively connected for that year with its conduct of  any trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Excluded foreign source income. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section, no income from sources without the United  States shall be treated as effectively connected for any taxable year  with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by a  nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation if the income  consists of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dividends, interest, or royalties paid by a related foreign  corporation. Dividends, interest, or royalties paid by a foreign  corporation in which the nonresident alien individual or the foreign  corporation described in paragraph (a) of this section owns, within the  meaning of section 958(a), or is considered as owning, by applying the  ownership rules of section 958(b), at the time such items are paid more  than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of  stock entitled to vote.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subpart F income of a controlled foreign corporation. Any income  of the foreign corporation described in paragraph (a) of this section  which is subpart F income for the taxable year, as determined under  section 952(a), even though part of the income is attributable to  amounts which, if distributed by the foreign corporation, would be  distributed with respect to its stock which is owned by shareholders who  are not U.S. shareholders within the meaning of section 951(b). This  subparagraph shall not apply to any income of the foreign corporation  which is excluded in determining its subpart F income for the taxable  year for purposes of section 952(a). Thus, for example, this  subparagraph shall not apply to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreign base company shipping income which is excluded under  section 954(b)(2),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign base company income amounting to less than 10 percent  (30 percent in the case of taxable years of foreign corporations ending  before January 1, 1976) of gross income which by reason of section  954(b)(3)(A) does not become subpart F income for the taxable year,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any income excluded from foreign base company income under  section 954(b)(4), relating to exception for   foreign corporations not availed of to reduce taxes,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any income derived in the active conduct of a trade or business  which is excluded under section 954(c)(3), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any income received from related persons which is excluded under  section 954(c)(4).  This subparagraph shall apply to the foreign corporation's entire  subpart F income for the taxable year determined under section 952(a),  even though no amount is included in the gross income of a U.S.  shareholder under section 951(a) with respect to that subpart F income  because of the minimum distribution provisions of section 963(a) or  because of the reduction under section 970(a) with respect to an export  trade corporation. This subparagraph shall apply only to a foreign  corporation which is a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning  of section 957 and the regulations thereunder. The application of this  subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth4">Example 1. Controlled foreign corporation M, incorporated under the  laws of foreign country X, is engaged in the business of purchasing and  selling merchandise manufactured in foreign country Y by an unrelated  person. M negotiates sales, through its sales office in the United  States, of its merchandise for use outside of country X. These sales are  made outside the United States, and the merchandise is sold for use  outside the United States. No office maintained by M outside the United  States participates materially in the sales made through its U.S. sales  office. These activities constitute the only activities of M. During the  taxable year M derives $100,000 income from these sales made through its  U.S. sales office, and all of such income is foreign base company sales  income by reason of section 954(d)(2) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.954- 3. The entire $100,000 is also subpart F income, determined under  section 952(a). In addition, all of this income would, without reference  to section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this subparagraph, be treated as  effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade  or business in the United States by M. Through its entire taxable year  60 percent of the one class of stock of M is owned within the meaning of  section 958(a) by U.S. shareholders, as defined in section 951(b), and  40 percent of its one class of stock is owned within the meaning of  section 958(a) by persons who are not U.S. shareholders, as defined in  section 951(b). Although only $60,000 of the subpart F income of M for  the taxable year is includible in the income of the U.S. shareholders  under section 951(a), the entire subpart F income of $100,000  constitutes income which, by reason of section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this  subparagraph, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.</p><p class="depth4">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that the  foreign base company sales income amounts to $150,000 determined in  accordance with paragraph (d)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.954-1, and that M also  has gross income from sources without the United States of $50,000 from  sales, through its sales office in the United States, of merchandise for  use in country X. These sales are made outside the United States. All of  this income would, without reference to section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and  this subparagraph, be treated as effectively connected for the taxable  year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.  Since the foreign base company income of $150,000 amounts to 75 percent  of the entire gross income of $200,000, determined as provided in  paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of Sec. 1.954-1, the entire $200,000 constitutes  foreign base company income under section 954(b)(3)(B). Assuming that M  has no amounts to be taken into account under paragraphs (1), (2), (4),  and (5) of section 954(b), the $200,000 is also subpart F income,  determined under section 952(a). This subpart F income of $200,000  constitutes income which, by reason of section 864(c)(4)(D)(ii) and this  subparagraph, is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States by M.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest on certain deposits. Interest which, by reason of  section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest on deposits with banks,  savings and loan associations, and insurance companies paid or credited  before January 1, 1976) and paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.864-4, is  determined to be income from sources without the United States because  it is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of  a trade or business in the United States by the nonresident alien  individual or foreign corporation.  [T.D. 7216, 37 FR 23429, Nov. 3, 1972, as amended by T.D. 7893, 48 FR  22507, May 19, 1983; T.D. 8735, 62 FR 53501, Oct. 14, 1997]</p>
