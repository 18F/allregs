                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except to the extent specifically prohibited by this section, during the pendency of termination proceedings the plan administrator must continue to carry out the normal operations of the plan, such as putting participants into pay status, collecting contributions due the plan, and investing plan assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibitions after issuing notice of intent to terminate. The plan administrator may not make loans to plan participants beginning on the first day he or she issues a notice of intent to terminate, and from that date until a distribution is permitted pursuant to Sec. 4041.50, the plan administrator may not--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distribute plan assets pursuant to, or (except as required by this part) take any other actions to implement, the termination of the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, in any form other than as an annuity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on benefit payments on or after proposed termination date. Beginning on the proposed termination date, the plan administrator must reduce benefits to the level determined under part 4022, subpart D, of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to qualify for distress termination. In any case where the PBGC determines, pursuant to Sec. 4041.44(c) or Sec. 4041.46(c)(1), that the requirements for a distress termination are not satisfied--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section, other than those in paragraph (b)(1), will cease to apply--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon expiration of the period during which reconsideration may be requested under Secs. 4041.44(e) and 4041.46(e) or, if earlier, at the time the plan administrator decides not to request reconsideration; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If reconsideration is requested, upon PBGC issuance of its decision on reconsideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any benefits that were not paid pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be due and payable as of the effective date of the PBGC's determination, together with interest from the date (or dates) on which the unpaid amounts were originally due until the date on which they are paid in full at the rate or rates prescribed under Sec. 4022.81(c)(3) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of subsequent insufficiency. If the plan administrator makes a finding of subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits pursuant to Sec. 4041.49(b), or the PBGC notifies the plan administrator that it has made a finding of subsequent insufficiency for guaranteed benefits pursuant to Sec. 4041.40(d), the prohibitions in paragraph (b) of this section will apply in accordance with Sec. 4041.49(e).
