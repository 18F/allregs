                            <p class="depth0">The policy of EPA for cost-reimbursement, term form contracts is to  make provisional payment of fee (i.e. the fixed fee on cost-plus-fixed- fee type contracts or the base fee on cost-plus-award-fee type  contracts) on a percentage of work completed basis, when such a method  will not prove detrimental to proper contract performance. Percentage of  work completed is the ratio of the direct labor hours performed in  relation to the direct labor hours set forth in the contract in clause  1552.212-70, ``Level of Effort--Cost Reimbursement Term Contract.''  Provisional payment of fee will remain subject to withholding  provisions, such as 48 CFR 52.216-8, Fixed Fee.  [56 FR 43711, Sept. 4, 1991]</p>
