                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of this subpart, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">Acutely Hazardous Laboratory Waste means a laboratory waste, defined in the Environmental Management Plan as posing significant potential hazards to human health or the environment and which must include RCRA ``P'' wastes, and may include particularly hazardous substances as designated in a University's Chemical Hygiene Plan under OSHA, or Extremely Hazardous Substances under the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency means any occurrence such as, but not limited to, equipment failure, rupture of containers or failure of control equipment which results in the potential uncontrolled release of a hazardous chemical into the environment and which requires agency or fire department notification and/or reporting.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Management Plan (EMP) means a written program developed and implemented by the university which sets forth standards and procedures, responsibilities, pollution control equipment, performance criteria, resources and work practices that both protect human health and the environment from the hazards presented by laboratory wastes within a laboratory and between a laboratory and the hazardous waste accumulation area, and satisfies the plan requirements defined elsewhere in this Subpart. Certain requirements of this plan are satisfied through the use of the Chemical Hygiene Plan (see, 29 CFR 1910.1450), or equivalent, and other relevant plans, including a waste minimization plan. The elements of the Environmental Management Plan must be easily accessible, but may be integrated into existing plans, incorporated as an attachment, or developed as a separate document.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Objective means an overall environmental goal of the organization which is verifiable.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Performance means results of the data collected pursuant to implementation of the Environmental Management Plan as measured against policy, objectives and targets.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Target means an environmental performance requirement of the organization which is quantifiable, where practicable, verifiable and designed to be achieved within a specified time frame.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous Chemical means any chemical which is a physical hazard or a health hazard. A physical hazard means a chemical for which there is scientifically valid evidence that it is a combustible liquid, a compressed gas, explosive, flammable, an organic peroxide, an oxidizer, pyrophoric, unstable (reactive) or water-reactive. A health hazard means a chemical for which there is statistically significant evidence based on at least one study conducted in accordance with established scientific principles that acute or

chronic health effects may occur in exposed employees. The term ``health hazard'' includes chemicals which are carcinogens, toxic or highly toxic agents, reproductive toxins, irritants, corrosives, sensitizers, hepatotoxins, nephrotoxins, neurotoxins, agents which act on the hematopoietic system and agents which damage the lungs, skin, eyes or mucous membranes.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous Chemical of Concern means a chemical that the organization has identified as having the potential to be of significant risk to human health or the environment if not managed in accordance with procedures or practices defined by the organization.</p><p class="depth0">Hazardous Waste Accumulation Area means the on-site area at a University where the University will make a solid and hazardous waste determination with respect to laboratory wastes.</p><p class="depth0">In-Line Waste Collection means a system for the automatic collection of laboratory waste which is directly connected to or part of a laboratory scale activity and which is constructed or operated in a manner which prevents the release of any laboratory waste therein into the environment during collection.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory means, for the purpose of this Subpart, an area within a facility where the laboratory use of hazardous chemicals occurs. It is a workplace where relatively small quantities of hazardous chemicals are used on a non-production basis. The physical extent of individual laboratories within an organization will be defined by the Environmental Management Plan. A laboratory may include more than a single room if the rooms are in the same building and under the common supervision of a laboratory supervisor.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory Clean-Out means an evaluation of the chemical inventory of a laboratory as a result of laboratory renovation, relocation or a change in laboratory supervision that may result in the transfer of laboratory wastes to the hazardous waste accumulation area.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory Environmental Management Standard means the provisions of this Subpart and includes the requirements for preparation of Environmental Management Plans and the inclusion of Minimum Performance Criteria within each Environmental Management Plan.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory Scale means work with substances in which containers used for reactions, transfers and other handling of substances are designed to be safely and easily manipulated by one person. ``Laboratory Scale'' excludes those workplaces whose function is to produce commercial quantities of chemicals.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory Waste means a hazardous chemical that results from laboratory scale activities and includes the following: excess or unused hazardous chemicals that may or may not be reused outside their laboratory of origin; hazardous chemicals determined to be RCRA hazardous waste as defined in 40 CFR Part 261; and hazardous chemicals that will be determined not to be RCRA hazardous waste pursuant to Sec. 262.106.</p><p class="depth0">Laboratory Worker means a person who is assigned to handle hazardous chemicals in the laboratory and may include researchers, students or technicians.</p><p class="depth0">Legal and Other Requirements means requirements imposed by, or as a result of, governmental permits, governmental laws and regulations, judicial and administrative enforcement orders, non-governmental legally enforceable contracts, research grants and agreements, certification specifications, formal voluntary commitments and organizational policies and standards.</p><p class="depth0">Senior Management means senior personnel with overall responsibility, authority and accountability for managing laboratory activities within the organization.</p><p class="depth0">Universities means the following academic institutions; University of Vermont, Boston College, and the University of Massachusetts Boston, which are participants in this Laboratory XL project and which are subject to the requirements set forth in this Subpart J.</p>
