                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What is a medical consultant? A medical consultant is a person  who is a member of a team that makes disability determinations in a  State agency, as explained in Sec. 416.1015, or who is a member of a  team that makes disability determinations for us when we make disability  determinations ourselves.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What qualifications must a medical consultant have? A medical  consultant must be an acceptable medical source identified in  Sec. 416.913(a)(1) or (a)(3) through (a)(5); that is, a licensed  physician (medical or osteopathic), a licensed optometrist, a licensed  podiatrist, or a qualified speech-language   pathologist. The medical consultant must meet any appropriate  qualifications for his or her specialty as explained in Sec. 416.913(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Are there any limitations on what medical consultants who are  not physicians can evaluate? Medical consultants who are not physicians  are limited to evaluating the impairments for which they are qualified,  as described in Sec. 416.913(a). Medical consultants who are not  physicians also are limited as to when they may serve as a member of a  team that makes a disability determination. For example, a speech- language pathologist who is a medical consultant in a State agency may  be a member of a team that makes a disability determination in a claim  only if a speech or language impairment is the only impairment in the  claim or if there is a combination of a speech or language impairment  with another impairment but the speech or language impairment alone  would justify a finding of disability. In all other cases, a physician  will be a member of the team that makes a disability determination,  except in cases in which this function may be performed by a  psychological consultant as discussed in paragraph (f) of this section  and Sec. 416.1015(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What is a psychological consultant? A psychological consultant  is a psychologist who has the same responsibilities as a medical  consultant explained in paragraph (a) of this section, but who can  evaluate only mental impairments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What qualifications must a psychological consultant have? A  psychological consultant used in cases where there is evidence of a  mental impairment must be a qualified psychologist. For disability  program purposes, a psychologist will not be considered qualified unless  he or she:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is licensed or certified as a psychologist at the independent  practice level of psychology by the State in which he or she practices;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Possesses a doctorate degree in psychology from a program in  clinical psychology of an educational institution accredited by an  organization recognized by the Council on Post-Secondary Accreditation;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is listed in a national register of health service providers in  psychology which the Commissioner of Social Security deems appropriate;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Possesses 2 years of supervised clinical experience as a  psychologist in health service, at least 1 year of which is post masters  degree.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Are there any limitations on what a psychological consultant can  evaluate? Psychological consultants are limited to the evaluation of  mental impairments, as explained in Sec. 416.1015(d). Psychological  consultants also are limited as to when they can serve as a member of a  team that makes a disability determination. They may do so only when a  mental impairment is the only impairment in the claim or when there is a  combination of a mental impairment with another impairment but the  mental impairment alone would justify a finding of disability.
