L. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2399).</p><p class="depth0">Actual emissions is defined in subpart D of this part for the purpose of granting a compliance extension for an early reduction of hazardous air pollutants.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the United States Environmental Protection Agency or his or her authorized representative (e.g., a State that has been delegated the authority to implement the provisions of this part).</p><p class="depth0">Affected source, for the purposes of this part, means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory for which a section 112(d) standard or other relevant standard is established pursuant to section 112 of the Act. Each relevant standard will define the ``affected source,'' as defined in this paragraph unless a different definition is warranted based on a published justification as to why this definition would result in significant administrative, practical, or implementation problems and why the different definition would resolve those problems. The term ``affected source,'' as used in this part, is separate and distinct from any other use of that term in EPA regulations such as those implementing title IV of the Act. Affected source may be defined differently for part 63 than affected facility and stationary source in parts 60 and 61, respectively. This definition of ``affected source,'' and the procedures for adopting an alternative definition of ``affected source,'' shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative emission limitation means conditions established pursuant to sections 112(i)(5) or 112(i)(6) of the Act by the Administrator or by a State with an approved permit program.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative emission standard means an alternative means of emission limitation that, after notice and opportunity for public comment, has been demonstrated by an owner or operator to the Administrator's satisfaction to achieve a reduction in emissions of any air pollutant at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions of such pollutant achieved under a relevant design,

equipment, work practice, or operational emission standard, or combination thereof, established under this part pursuant to section 112(h) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative test method means any method of sampling and analyzing for an air pollutant that is not a test method in this chapter and that has been demonstrated to the Administrator's satisfaction, using Method 301 in appendix A of this part, to produce results adequate for the Administrator's determination that it may be used in place of a test method specified in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Approved permit program means a State permit program approved by the Administrator as meeting the requirements of part 70 of this chapter or a Federal permit program established in this chapter pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</p><p class="depth0">Area source means any stationary source of hazardous air pollutants that is not a major source as defined in this part.</p><p class="depth0">Commenced means, with respect to construction or reconstruction of an affected source, that an owner or operator has undertaken a continuous program of construction or reconstruction or that an owner or operator has entered into a contractual obligation to undertake and complete, within a reasonable time, a continuous program of construction or reconstruction.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance date means the date by which an affected source is required to be in compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established by the Administrator (or a State with an approved permit program) pursuant to section 112 of the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance schedule means: (1) In the case of an affected source that is in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a statement that the source will continue to comply with such requirements; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an affected source that is required to comply with applicable requirements by a future date, a statement that the source will meet such requirements on a timely basis and, if required by an applicable requirement, a detailed schedule of the dates by which each step toward compliance will be reached; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of an affected source not in compliance with all applicable requirements established under this part, a schedule of remedial measures, including an enforceable sequence of actions or operations with milestones and a schedule for the submission of certified progress reports, where applicable, leading to compliance with a relevant standard, limitation, prohibition, or any federally enforceable requirement established pursuant to section 112 of the Act for which the affected source is not in compliance. This compliance schedule shall resemble and be at least as stringent as that contained in any judicial consent decree or administrative order to which the source is subject. Any such schedule of compliance shall be supplemental to, and shall not sanction noncompliance with, the applicable requirements on which it is based.</p><p class="depth0">Construction means the on-site fabrication, erection, or installation of an affected source. Construction does not include the removal of all equipment comprising an affected source from an existing location and reinstallation of such equipment at a new location. The owner or operator of an existing affected source that is relocated may elect not to reinstall minor ancillary equipment including, but not limited to, piping, ductwork, and valves. However, removal and reinstallation of an affected source will be construed as reconstruction if it satisfies the criteria for reconstruction as defined in this section. The costs of replacing minor ancillary equipment must be considered in determining whether the existing affected source is reconstructed.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this part, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous monitoring system (CMS) is a comprehensive term that may include, but is not limited to, continuous emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parameter monitoring systems, or other manual or automatic

Failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">Monitoring means the collection and use of measurement data or other information to control the operation of a process or pollution control device or to verify a work practice standard relative to assuring compliance with applicable requirements. Monitoring is composed of four elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indicator(s) of performance--the parameter or parameters you measure or observe for demonstrating proper operation of the pollution control measures or compliance with the applicable emissions limitation or standard. Indicators of performance may include direct or predicted emissions measurements (including opacity), operational

parametric values that correspond to process or control device (and capture system) efficiencies or emissions rates, and recorded findings of inspection of work practice activities, materials tracking, or design characteristics. Indicators may be expressed as a single maximum or minimum value, a function of process variables (for example, within a range of pressure drops), a particular operational or work practice status (for example, a damper position, completion of a waste recovery task, materials tracking), or an interdependency between two or among more than two variables.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Measurement techniques--the means by which you gather and record information of or about the indicators of performance. The components of the measurement technique include the detector type, location and installation specifications, inspection procedures, and quality assurance and quality control measures. Examples of measurement techniques include continuous emission monitoring systems, continuous opacity monitoring systems, continuous parametric monitoring systems, and manual inspections that include making records of process conditions or work practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring frequency--the number of times you obtain and record monitoring data over a specified time interval.

Examples of averaging time include a 3-hour average in units of the emissions limitation, a 30-day rolling average emissions value, a daily average of a control device operational parametric range, and an instantaneous alarm.</p><p class="depth0">New affected source means the collection of equipment, activities, or both within a single contiguous area and under common control that is included in a section 112(c) source category or subcategory that is subject to a section 112(d) or other relevant standard for new sources. This definition of ``new affected source,'' and the criteria to be utilized in implementing it, shall apply to each section 112(d) standard for which the initial proposed rule is signed by the Administrator after June 30, 2002. Each relevant standard will define the term ``new affected source,'' which will be the same as the ``affected source'' unless a different collection is warranted based on consideration of factors including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Emission reduction impacts of controlling individual sources versus groups of sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cost effectiveness of controlling individual equipment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Flexibility to accommodate common control strategies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cost/benefits of emissions averaging;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Incentives for pollution prevention;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Feasibility and cost of controlling processes that share common equipment (e.g., product recovery devices);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Feasibility and cost of monitoring; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">New source means any affected source the construction or reconstruction of which is commenced after the Administrator first proposes a relevant emission standard under this part establishing an emission standard applicable to such source.</p><p class="depth0">One-hour period, unless otherwise defined in an applicable subpart, means any 60-minute period commencing on the hour.</p><p class="depth0">Opacity means the degree to which emissions reduce the transmission of light and obscure the view of an object in the background. For continuous opacity monitoring systems, opacity means the fraction of incident light that is attenuated by an optical medium.</p><p class="depth0">Owner or operator means any person who owns, leases, operates, controls, or supervises a stationary source.</p><p class="depth0">Performance audit means a procedure to analyze blind samples, the content

of which is known by the Administrator, simultaneously with the analysis of performance test samples in order to provide a measure of test data quality.</p><p class="depth0">Performance evaluation means the conduct of relative accuracy testing, calibration error testing, and other measurements used in validating the continuous monitoring system data.</p><p class="depth0">Performance test means the collection of data resulting from the execution of a test method (usually three emission test runs) used to demonstrate compliance with a relevant emission standard as specified in the performance test section of the relevant standard.</p><p class="depth0">Permit modification means a change to a title V permit as defined in regulations codified in this chapter to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</p><p class="depth0">Permit program means a comprehensive State operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661) and regulations codified in part 70 of this chapter and applicable State regulations, or a comprehensive Federal operating permit system established pursuant to title V of the Act and regulations codified in this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Permit revision means any permit modification or administrative permit amendment to a title V permit as defined in regulations codified in this chapter to implement title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</p><p class="depth0">Permitting authority means: (1) The State air pollution control agency, local agency, other State agency, or other agency authorized by the Administrator to carry out a permit program under part 70 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator, in the case of EPA-implemented permit programs under title V of the Act (42 U.S.C. 7661).</p><p class="depth0">Pollution Prevention means source reduction as defined under the Pollution Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 13101-13109).
