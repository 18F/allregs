                            <p class="depth0">MBE and WBE participation must be reported by all recipients, including those recipients exempted under Sec. 33.411 from the requirement to apply the fair share objectives, on EPA Form 5700-52A. Recipients of Continuing Environmental Program Grants under 40 CFR part 35, subpart A, recipients of Performance Partnership Grants (PPGs) under 40 CFR part 35, subpart B; General Assistance Program (GAP) grants for tribal governments and intertribal consortia; and institutions of higher education, hospitals and other non-profit organizations receiving financial assistance agreements, will report on MBE and WBE participation on an annual basis. All other financial assistance agreement recipients, including recipients of financial assistance agreements capitalizing revolving loan funds, will report on MBE and WBE participation semiannually. Recipients of financial assistance agreements that capitalize revolving loan programs must require entities receiving identified loans to submit their MBE and WBE participation reports on a semiannual basis to the financial assistance agreement recipient, rather than to EPA.
