e-mail, and DOT has approved an exception. All fields in the form must be completed; carriers are to enter ``0'' where there were no complaints in a given category. Each annual report must contain the following certification signed by your authorized representative: ``I, the undersigned, do certify that this report has been prepared under my direction in accordance with the regulations in 14 CFR Part 382. I affirm that, to the best of my knowledge and belief, this is a true, correct, and complete report.'' Electronic signatures will be accepted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must retain correspondence and record of action taken on all disability-related complaints for three years after receipt of the complaint or creation of the record of action taken.

The report shall be mailed, by the date specified in paragraph (d) of this section, to the following address: U.S. Department of Transportation, Aviation Consumer Protection Division (C-75), 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., West Building, Room W96-432, Washington, DC 20590.</p>
