                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section is intended to meet the testing requirements  under section 4 of TSCA. The in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation test  can be used to detect gene mutations induced by chemical substances.  Suitable cell lines include L5178Y mouse lymphoma cells, the CHO, AS52  and V79 lines of Chinese hamster cells, and TK6 human lymphoblastoid  cells under paragraph (g)(1) of this section. In these cell lines the  most commonly-used genetic endpoints measure mutation at thymidine  kinase (TK) and hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT),  and a transgene of xanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (XPRT).  The TK, HPRT and XPRT mutation tests detect different spectra of genetic  events. The autosomal location of TK and XPRT may allow the detection of  genetic events (e.g. large deletions) not detected at the HPRT locus on  X-chromosomes (For a discussion see the references in paragraphs (g)(2),  (g)(3), (g)(4),(g)(5), and (g)(6) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Source. The source material used in developing this TSCA test  guideline is the OECD guideline 476 (February 1997). This source is  available at the address in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:</p><p class="depth0">Base pair substitution mutagens are substances which cause  substitution of one or several base pairs in the DNA.</p><p class="depth0">Forward mutation is a gene mutation from the parental type to the  mutant form which gives rise to an alteration or a loss of the enzymatic  activity or the function of the encoded protein.</p><p class="depth0">Frameshift mutagens are substances which cause the addition or  deletion of single or multiple base pairs in the DNA molecule.</p><p class="depth0">Mutant frequency is the number of mutant cells observed divided by  the number of viable cells.</p><p class="depth0">Phenotypic expression time is a period during which unaltered gene  products are depleted from newly mutated cells.</p><p class="depth0">Relative suspension growth is an increase in cell number over the  expression period relative to the negative control.</p><p class="depth0">Relative total growth is an increase in cell number over time  compared to a control population of cells; calculated as the product of  suspension growth relative to the negative control times cloning  efficiency relative to negative control.</p><p class="depth0">Survival is the cloning efficiency of the treated cells when plated  at the end of the treatment period; survival is usually expressed in  relation to the survival of the control cell population.</p><p class="depth0">Viability is the cloning efficiency of the treated cells at the time  of plating in selective conditions after the expression period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Initial considerations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the in vitro mammalian cell gene  mutation test, cultures of established cell lines or cell strains can be  used. The cells used are selected on the basis of growth ability in  culture and stability of the spontaneous mutation frequency. Tests  conducted in vitro generally require the use of an exogenous source of  metabolic activation. This metabolic activation system cannot mimic  entirely the mammalian in vivo conditions. Care should be taken to avoid  conditions which would lead to results not reflecting intrinsic  mutagenicity. Positive results which do not reflect intrinsic  mutagenicity may arise from changes in pH, osmolality or high levels of  cytotoxicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This test is used to screen for possible mammalian mutagens and  carcinogens. Many compounds that are positive in this test are mammalian  carcinogens; however, there is not a perfect correlation between this  test and carcinogenicity. Correlation is dependent on chemical class and  there is increasing evidence that there are carcinogens that are not  detected by this test because they appear to act through other, non- genotoxic mechanisms or mechanisms absent in bacterial cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Test method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principle. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cells deficient in thymidine  kinase (TK) due to the mutation TK\=\/- -<=TK-/ - are resistant to the cytotoxic effects of the pyrimidine  analogue trifluorothymidine (TFT). Thymidine kinase proficient cells are  sensitive to TFT, which causes the inhibition of cellular metabolism and  halts further cell division. Thus mutant cells are able to proliferate  in the presence of TFT, whereas normal cells, which contain thymidine  kinase, are not. Similarly, cells deficient in HPRT or XPRT are selected  by resistance to 6-thioguanine (TG) or 8-azaguanine (AG). The properties  of the test substance should be considered carefully if a base analogue  or a compound related to the selective agent is tested in any of the  mammalian cell gene mutation tests. For example, any suspected selective  toxicity by the test substance for mutant and non-mutant cells should be  investigated. Thus, performance of the selection system/agent shall be  confirmed when testing chemicals structurally related to the selective  agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cells in suspension or monolayer culture shall be exposed to  the test substance, both with and without metabolic activation, for a  suitable period of time and subcultured to determine cytotoxicity and to  allow phenotypic expression prior to mutant selection. Cytotoxicity is  usually determined by measuring the relative cloning efficiency  (survival) or relative total growth of the cultures after the treatment  period. The treated cultures shall be maintained in growth medium for a  sufficient period of time, characteristic of each selected locus and  cell type, to allow near-optimal phenotypic expression of induced  mutations. Mutant frequency is determined by seeding known numbers of  cells in medium containing   the selective agent to detect mutant cells, and in medium without  selective agent to determine the cloning efficiency (viability). After a  suitable incubation time, colonies shall be counted. The mutant  frequency is derived from the number of mutant colonies in selective  medium and the number of colonies in non-selective medium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description--(i) Preparations--(A) Cells. (1) A variety of cell  types are available for use in this test including subclones of L5178Y,  CHO, CHO-AS52, V79, or TK6 cells. Cell types used in this test should  have a demonstrated sensitivity to chemical mutagens, a high cloning  efficiency and a stable spontaneous mutant frequency. Cells should be  checked for mycoplasma contamination and should not be used if  contaminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The test should be designed to have a predetermined sensitivity  and power. The number of cells, cultures, and concentrations of test  substance used should reflect these defined parameters. The parameters  discussed in the reference under paragraph (g)(13) of this section may  be used. The minimal number of viable cells surviving treatment and used  at each stage in the test should be based on the spontaneous mutation  frequency. A general guide is to use a cell number which is at least ten  times the inverse of the spontaneous mutation frequency. However, it is  recommended to utilize at least 10\6\ cells. Adequate historical data on  the cell system used should be available to indicate consistent  performance of the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Media and culture conditions. Appropriate culture media and  incubation conditions (culture vessels, temperature, CO2  concentration and humidity) shall be used. Media should be chosen  according to the selective systems and cell type used in the test. It is  particularly important that culture conditions should be chosen that  ensure optimal growth of cells during the expression period and colony  forming ability of both mutant and non-mutant cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Preparation of cultures. Cells are propagated from stock  cultures, seeded in culture medium and incubated at 37 [deg]C. Prior to  use in this test, cultures may need to be cleansed of pre-existing  mutant cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Metabolic activation. Cells shall be exposed to the test  substance both in the presence and absence of an appropriate metabolic  activation system. The most commonly used system is a co-factor- supplemented post-mitochondrial fraction (S9) prepared from the livers  of rodents treated with enzyme-inducing agents such as Aroclor 1254 or a  combination of phenobarbitone and [beta]-naphthoflavone. The post- mitochondrial fraction is usually used at concentrations in the range  from 1-10% v/v in the final test medium. The choice and condition of a  metabolic activation system may depend upon the class of chemical being  tested. In some cases it may be appropriate to utilize more than one  concentration of post-mitochondrial fraction. A number of developments,  including the construction of genetically engineered cell lines  expressing specific activating enzymes, may provide the potential for  endogenous activation. The choice of the cell lines used should be  scientifically justified (e.g. by the relevance of the cytochrome P450  isoenzyme to the metabolism of the test substance).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Test substance/preparations. Solid test substances should be  dissolved or suspended in appropriate solvents or vehicles and diluted  if appropriate prior to treatment of the cells. Liquid test substances  may be added directly to the test systems and/or diluted prior to  treatment. Fresh preparations should be employed unless stability data  demonstrate the acceptability of storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Test conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Solvent/vehicle. The solvent/vehicle shall  not be suspected of chemical reaction with the test substance and shall  be compatible with the survival of the cells and the S9 activity. If  other than well-known solvent/vehicles are used, their inclusion should  be supported by data indicating their compatibility. It is recommended  that wherever possible, the use of an aqueous solvent/vehicle be  considered first. When testing water-unstable substances, the organic  solvents used should be free of water. Water can be removed by adding a  molecular sieve.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exposure concentrations. (1) Among the criteria to be considered   when determining the highest concentration are cytotoxicity and  solubility in the test system and changes in pH or osmolality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cytotoxicity should be determined with and without metabolic  activation in the main experiment using an appropriate indicator of cell  integrity and growth, such as relative cloning efficiency (survival) or  relative total growth. It may be useful to determine cytotoxicity and  solubility in a preliminary experiment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At least four analyzable concentrations shall be used. Where  there is cytotoxicity, these concentrations shall cover a range from the  maximum to little or no toxicity; this will usually mean that the  concentration levels should be separated by no more than a factor  between 2 and [radic]10. If the maximum concentration is based on  cytotoxicity then it shall result in approximately 10-20% but not less  than 10% relative survival (relative cloning efficiency) or relative  total growth. For relatively non-cytotoxic compounds the maximum  concentration should be 5 mg/ml, 5 [micro]l/ml, or 0.01 M, whichever is  the lowest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relatively insoluble substances should be tested up to or beyond  their limit of solubility under culture conditions. Evidence of  insolubility should be determined in the final treatment medium to which  cells are exposed. It may be useful to assess solubility at the  beginning and end of the treatment, as solubility can change during the  course of exposure in the test system due to presence of cells, S9,  serum etc. Insolubility can be detected by using the unaided eye. The  precipitate should not interfere with the scoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Controls. (1) Concurrent positive and negative (solvent or  vehicle) controls both with and without metabolic activation shall be  included in each experiment. When metabolic activation is used the  positive control chemical shall be one that requires activation to give  a mutagenic response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples of positive control substances include:  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Metabolic Activation condition              Locus                   Chemical                 CAS No. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Absence of exogenous metabolic         HPRT...................

[CAS no. 50-32-8] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other appropriate positive control reference substances may be  used, e.g., if a laboratory has a historical data base on 5-Bromo 2'- deoxyuridine [CAS No. 59-14-3], this reference substance could be used  as well. The use of chemical class-related positive control chemicals  may be considered, when available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Negative controls, consisting of solvent or vehicle alone in the  treatment medium, and treated in the same way as the treatment groups  shall be included. In addition, untreated controls should also be used  unless there   are historical control data demonstrating that no deleterious or  mutagenic effects are induced by the chosen solvent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedure--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treatment with test substance. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Proliferating  cells shall be exposed to the test substance both with and without  metabolic activation. Exposure shall be for a suitable period of time  (usually 3 to 6 hrs is effective). Exposure time may be extended over  one or more cell cycles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Either duplicate or single treated cultures may be used at each  concentration tested. When single cultures are used, the number of  concentrations should be increased to ensure an adequate number of  cultures for analysis (e.g. at least eight analyzsable concentrations).  Duplicate negative (solvent) control cultures should be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Gaseous or volatile substances should be tested by appropriate  methods, such as in sealed culture vessels. Methods described in the  references under paragraphs (g)(20) and (g)(21) of this section may be  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Measurement of survival, viability, and mutant frequency. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>  At the end of the exposure period, cells shall be washed and cultured to  determine survival and to allow for expression of the mutant phenotype.  Measurement of cytotoxicity by determining the relative cloning  efficiency (survival) or relative total growth of the cultures is  usually initiated after the treatment period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each locus has a defined minimum time requirement to allow near  optimal phenotypic expression of newly induced mutants (HPRT and XPRT  require at least 6-8 days, and TK at least 2 days). Cells are grown in  medium with and without selective agent(s) for determination of numbers  of mutants and cloning efficiency, respectively. The measurement of  viability (used to calculate mutant frequency) is initiated at the end  of the expression time by plating in non-selective medium.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the test substance is positive in the L5178Y TK\=\/ - test, colony sizing should be performed on at least one of  the test cultures (the highest positive concentration) and on the  negative and positive controls. If the test substance is negative in the  L5178Y TK\=\/- test, colony sizing should be performed on the  negative and positive controls. In studies using TK6TK\=\/-,  colony sizing may also be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Data shall  include cytotoxicity and viability determination, colony counts and  mutant frequencies for the treated and control cultures. In the case of  a positive response in the L5178Y TK\=\/- test, colonies are  scored using the criteria of small and large colonies on at least one  concentration of the test substance (highest positive concentration) and  on the negative and positive control. The molecular and cytogenetic  nature of both large and small colony mutants has been explored in  detail and is discussed in the references under paragraphs (g)(22) and  (g)(23) of this section. In the TK\=\/- test, colonies are  scored using the criteria of normal growth (large) and slow growth  (small) colonies (a scoring system similar to the one described in the  reference under paragraph (g)(24) of this section may be used). Mutant  cells that have suffered the most extensive genetic damage have  prolonged doubling times and thus form small colonies. This damage  typically ranges in scale from the losses of the entire gene to  karyotypically visible chromosome aberrations. The induction of small  colony mutants has been associated with chemicals that induce gross  chromosome aberrations. Less seriously affected mutant cells grow at  rates similar to the parental cells and form large colonies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Survival (relative cloning efficiencies) or relative total  growth shall be given. Mutant frequency shall be expressed as number of  mutant cells per number of surviving cells.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Individual culture data shall be provided. Additionally, all  data shall be summarized in tabular form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> There is no requirement for verification of a clear positive  response. Equivocal results shall be clarified by further testing  preferably using a modification of experimental conditions. Negative  results need to be confirmed on a case-by-case basis. In those cases  where confirmation of negative results is not considered necessary,  justification should be provided. Modification of study parameters to  extend the   range of conditions assessed should be considered in follow-up  experiments for either equivocal or negative results. Study parameters  that might be modified include the concentration spacing, and the  metabolic activation conditions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation and interpretation of results. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There are several  criteria for determining a positive result, such as a concentration- related, or a reproducible increase in mutant frequency. Biological  relevance of the results should be considered first. Statistical methods  may be used as an aid in evaluating the test results. Statistical  significance should not be the only determining factor for a positive  response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A test substance, for which the results do not meet the  criteria described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section is considered  non-mutagenic in this system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Although most studies will give clearly positive or negative  results, in rare cases the data set will preclude making a definite  judgement about the activity of the test substance. Results may remain  equivocal or questionable regardless of the number of times the  experiment is repeated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Positive results for an in vitro mammalian cell gene mutation  test indicate that the test substance induces gene mutations in the  cultured mammalian cells used. A positive concentration-response that is  reproducible is most meaningful. Negative results indicate that, under  the test conditions, the test substance does not induce gene mutations  in the cultured mammalian cells used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Test report.
