Waters identified in this  paragraph shall not be combined with waters identified in paragraph  (o)(1)(vi) of this section when performing a significant nexus analysis.  If waters identified in this paragraph are also an adjacent water under  paragraph (o)(1)(vi), they are an adjacent water and no case-specific  significant nexus analysis is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prairie potholes. Prairie potholes are a complex of glacially  formed wetlands, usually occurring in depressions that lack permanent  natural outlets, located in the upper Midwest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Carolina bays and Delmarva bays. Carolina bays and Delmarva bays  are ponded, depressional wetlands that occur along the Atlantic coastal  plain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pocosins. Pocosins are evergreen shrub and tree dominated  wetlands found predominantly along the Central Atlantic coastal plain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Western vernal pools. Western vernal pools are seasonal wetlands  located in parts of California and associated with topographic  depression, soils with poor drainage, mild, wet winters and hot, dry  summers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Texas coastal prairie wetlands. Texas coastal prairie wetlands  are freshwater wetlands that occur as a mosaic of depressions, ridges,  intermound flats, and mima mound wetlands located along the Texas Gulf  Coast.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water  identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section and all  waters located within 4,000 feet of the high tide line or ordinary high  water mark of a water identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) through (v) of  this section where they are determined on a case-specific basis to have  a significant nexus to a water identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i)  through (iii) of this section. For waters determined to have a  significant nexus, the entire water is a water of the United States if a  portion is located within the 100-year floodplain of a water identified  in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section or within 4,000  feet of the high tide line or ordinary high water mark. Waters  identified in this paragraph shall not be combined with waters  identified in paragraph (o)(1)(vi) of this section when performing a  significant nexus analysis. If waters identified in this paragraph are  also an adjacent water under paragraph (o)(1)(vi),   they are an adjacent water and no case-specific significant nexus  analysis is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following are not ``waters of the United States'' even where  they otherwise meet the terms of paragraphs (o)(1)(iv) through (viii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Waste treatment systems, including treatment ponds or lagoons  designed to meet the requirements of the Clean Water Act are not waters  of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior converted cropland.

Waters being used for established  normal farming, ranching, and silviculture activities (33 U.S.C.  1344(f)) are not adjacent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Neighboring. The term neighboring means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> All waters located within 100 feet of the ordinary high water  mark of a water identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) through (v) of this  section. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within  100 feet of the ordinary high water mark;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All waters located within the 100-year floodplain of a water  identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) through (v) of this section and not  more than 1,500 feet from the ordinary high water mark of such water.  The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located within 1,500  feet of the ordinary high water mark and within the 100-year floodplain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> All waters located within 1,500 feet of the high tide line of a  water identified in paragraphs (o)(1)(i) or (iii) of this section, and  all waters within 1,500 feet of the ordinary high water mark of the  Great Lakes. The entire water is neighboring if a portion is located  within 1,500 feet of the high tide line or within 1,500 feet of the  ordinary high water mark of the Great Lakes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Wetlands. The term wetlands means those areas that are  inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and  duration sufficient to support, and that under normal circumstances do  support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in  saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes,  bogs, and similar areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(A)</em> through (I) of this section. A water has a  significant nexus when any single function or combination of functions  performed by the water, alone or together with similarly situated waters  in the region, contributes significantly to the chemical, physical, or  biological integrity of the nearest water identified in paragraphs  (o)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section. Functions relevant to the  significant nexus evaluation are the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sediment trapping,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nutrient recycling,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pollutant trapping, transformation, filtering, and transport,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Retention and attenuation of flood waters,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Runoff storage,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Contribution of flow,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Export of organic matter,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Export of food resources, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Provision of life cycle dependent aquatic habitat (such as  foraging, feeding, nesting, breeding, spawning, or use as a nursery  area) for species located in a water identified in paragraphs (o)(1)  through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ordinary high water mark. The term ordinary high water mark  means that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water  and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line  impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil,  destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and  debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of  the surrounding areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> High tide line. The term high tide line means the line of  intersection of the land with the water's surface at the maximum height  reached by a rising tide. The high tide line may be determined, in the  absence of actual data, by a line of oil or scum along shore objects, a  more or less continuous deposit of fine shell or debris on the foreshore  or berm, other physical markings or characteristics, vegetation lines,  tidal gages, or other suitable means that delineate the general height  reached by a rising tide. The line encompasses spring high tides and  other high tides that occur with periodic frequency but does not include  storm surges in which there is a departure from the normal or predicted  reach of the tide due to the piling up of water against a coast by  strong winds such as those accompanying a hurricane or other intense  storm.</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p>
