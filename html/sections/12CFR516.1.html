                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part explains OTS procedures for processing applications, notices, or filings (applications). Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, subparts A and E of this part apply whenever an OTS regulation requires any person (you) to file an application with OTS. Subparts B, C, and D, however, only apply when an OTS regulation incorporates the procedures in the subpart or where otherwise required by OTS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part does not apply to any of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An application related to a transaction under section 13(c) or (k) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, 12 U.S.C. 1823(c) or (k).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request for reconsideration, modification, or appeal of a final OTS action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request related to litigation, an enforcement proceeding, a supervisory directive or supervisory agreement. Such requests include a request seeking approval under, modification of, or termination of an order issued under part 508 or 509 of this chapter, a supervisory agreement, a supervisory directive, a consent merger agreement or a document negotiated in settlement of an enforcement matter or other litigation, unless an applicable OTS regulation specifically requires an application under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An application filed under an OTS regulation that prescribes other application processing procedures and time frames for the approval of applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an OTS regulation for a specific type of application prescribes some application processing procedures, or time frames, OTS will apply this part to the extent necessary to process the application. For example, if an OTS

regulation for a specific type of application does not identify time periods for the processing of an application, the time periods in this part apply.
