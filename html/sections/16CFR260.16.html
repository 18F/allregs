                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is deceptive to misrepresent, directly or by implication,  that a product or package is made with renewable materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Research suggests that reasonable consumers may interpret  renewable materials claims differently than marketers may intend. Unless  marketers have substantiation for all their express and reasonably  implied claims, they should clearly and prominently qualify their  renewable materials claims. For example, marketers may minimize the risk  of unintended implied claims by identifying the material used and  explaining why the material is renewable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Marketers should also qualify any ``made with renewable  materials'' claim unless the product or package (excluding minor,  incidental components) is made entirely with renewable materials.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: A marketer makes the unqualified claim that its flooring  is ``made with renewable materials.'' Reasonable consumers likely  interpret this claim to mean that the flooring also is made with  recycled content, recyclable, and biodegradable. Unless the marketer has  substantiation for these implied claims, the unqualified ``made with  renewable materials'' claim is deceptive. The marketer could qualify the  claim by stating, clearly and prominently, ``Our flooring is made from  100 percent bamboo, which grows at the same rate, or faster, than we use  it.'' The marketer still is responsible for substantiating all remaining  express and reasonably implied claims.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: A marketer's packaging states that ``Our packaging is  made from 50% plant-based renewable materials. Because we turn fast- growing plants into bio-plastics, only half of our product is made from  petroleum-based materials.'' By identifying the material used and  explaining why the material is renewable, the marketer has minimized the  risk of unintended claims that the product is made with recycled  content, recyclable, and biodegradable. The marketer has adequately  qualified the amount of renewable materials in the product.</p>
