                                Sec. 405.1110  MAC reviews on its own motion.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The MAC may decide on its own motion to review a decision or dismissal issued by an ALJ. CMS or any of its contractors may refer a case to the MAC for it to consider reviewing under this authority anytime within 60 calendar days after the date of an ALJ's decision or dismissal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral of cases. (1) CMS or any of its contractors may refer a case to the MAC if, in their view, the decision or dismissal contains an error of law material to the outcome of the claim or presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the public interest. CMS may also request that the MAC take own motion review of a case if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> CMS or any of its contractors may refer a case to the MAC if, in their view, the decision or dismissal contains an error of law material to the outcome of the claim or presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the public interest.

The written referral will state the reasons why CMS believes the MAC must review the case on its own motion. CMS will send a copy of its referral to all parties to the ALJ's action who received a copy of the hearing decision under Sec. 405.1046(a) or the notice of dismissal under Sec. 405.1052(b), and to the ALJ. Parties to the ALJ's action may file exceptions to the referral by submitting written comments to the MAC within 20 calendar days of the referral notice. A party submitting comments to the MAC must send such comments to CMS and all other parties to the ALJ's decision who received a copy of the hearing decision under Sec. 405.1046(a) or the notice of dismissal under Sec. 405.1052(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standard of review. (1) Referral by CMS after participation at the ALJ level. If CMS or its contractor participated in an appeal at the ALJ level, the MAC exercises its own motion authority if there is an error of law material to the outcome of the case, an abuse of discretion by the ALJ, the decision is not consistent with the preponderance of the evidence of record, or there is a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest. In deciding whether to accept review under this standard, the MAC will limit its consideration of the ALJ's action to those exceptions raised by CMS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Referral by CMS after participation at the ALJ level.

The MAC will accept review if the decision or dismissal contains an error of law material to the outcome of the case or presents a broad policy or procedural issue that may affect the general public interest. In deciding whether to accept review, the MAC will limit its consideration of the ALJ's action to those exceptions raised by CMS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> MAC's action. If the MAC decides to review a decision or dismissal on its own motion, it will mail the results of its action to all the parties to the hearing and to CMS if it is not already a party to the hearing. The MAC may adopt, modify, or reverse the decision or dismissal, may remand the case to an ALJ for further proceedings or may dismiss a hearing request. The MAC must issue its action no later than 90 calendar days after receipt of the CMS referral, unless the 90 calendar day period has been extended as provided in this subpart. The MAC may not, however, issue its action before the 20 calendar day comment period has expired, unless it determines that the agency's referral does not provide a basis for reviewing the case. If the MAC does not act within the applicable adjudication

deadline, the ALJ's decision or dismissal is binding on the parties to the ALJ decision.
