                            <p class="depth0">Performance-based payments may be made either on a whole contract or  on a deliverable item basis, unless otherwise prescribed by agency  regulations. Financing payments to be made on a whole contract basis are  applicable to the entire contract, and not to specific deliverable  items. Financing payments to be made on a deliverable item basis are  applicable to a specific individual deliverable item. (A deliverable  item for these purposes is a separate item with a distinct unit price.  Thus, a contract line item for 10 airplanes, with a unit price of  $1,000,000 each, has 10 deliverable items-the separate planes. A   contract line item for 1 lot of 10 airplanes, with a lot price of  $10,000,000, has only one deliverable item-the lot.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishing performance bases. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The basis for performance- based payments may be either specifically described events (e.g.,  milestones) or some measurable criterion of performance. Each event or  performance criterion that will trigger a finance payment shall be an  integral and necessary part of contract performance and shall be  identified in the contract, along with a description of what constitutes  successful performance of the event or attainment of the performance  criterion. The signing of contracts or modifications, the exercise of  options, the passage of time, or other such occurrences do not represent  meaningful efforts or actions and shall not be identified as events or  criteria for performance-based payments. An event need not be a critical  event in order to trigger a payment, but the Government must be able to  readily verify successful performance of each such event or performance  criterion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Events or criteria may be either severable or cumulative. The  successful completion of a severable event or criterion is independent  of the accomplishment of any other event or criterion. Conversely, the  successful accomplishment of a cumulative event or criterion is  dependent upon the previous accomplishment of another event. A contract  may provide for more than one series of severable and/or cumulative  performance events or criteria performed in parallel. The contracting  officer shall include the following in the contract:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The contract shall not permit payment for a cumulative event or  criterion until the dependent event or criterion has been successfully  completed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contract shall specifically identify severable events or  criteria.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contract shall specifically identify cumulative events or  criteria and identify which events or criteria are preconditions for the  successful achievement of each event or criterion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Because performance-based payments are contract financing,  events or criteria shall not serve as a vehicle to reward the contractor  for completion of performance levels over and above what is required for  successful completion of the contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If payment of performance-based finance amounts is on a  deliverable item basis, each event or performance criterion shall be  part of the performance necessary for that deliverable item and shall be  identified to a specific contract line item or subline item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishing performance-based finance payment amounts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  contracting officer shall establish a complete, fully defined schedule  of events or performance criteria and payment amounts when negotiating  contract terms. If a contract action significantly affects the price, or  event or performance criterion, the contracting officer responsible for  pricing the contract modification shall adjust the performance-based  payment schedule appropriately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Total performance-based payments shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reflect prudent contract financing provided only to the extent  needed for contract performance (see 32.104(a)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not exceed 90 percent of the contract price if on a whole  contract basis, or 90 percent of the delivery item price if on a  delivery item basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The contract shall specifically state the amount of each  performance-based payment either as a dollar amount or as a percentage  of a specifically identified price (e.g., contract price or unit price  of the deliverable item). The payment of contract financing has a cost  to the Government in terms of interest paid by the Treasury to borrow  funds to make the payment. Because the contracting officer has wide  discretion as to the timing and amount of the performance-based  payments, the contracting officer shall ensure that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total contract price is fair and reasonable, all factors  considered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Performance-based payment amounts are commensurate with the  value of the performance event or performance criterion and are not  expected to result in an unreasonably low   or negative level of contractor investment in the contract. To confirm  sufficient investment, the contracting officer may request expenditure  profile information from offerors, but only if other information in the  proposal, or information otherwise available to the contracting officer,  is expected to be insufficient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless agency procedures prescribe the bases for establishing  performance-based payment amounts, contracting officers may establish  them on any rational basis, including (but not limited to)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engineering estimates of stages of completion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engineering estimates of hours or other measures of effort to  be expended in performance of an event or achievement of a performance  criterion; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The estimated projected cost of performance of particular  events.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When subsequent contract modifications are issued, the  contracting officer shall adjust the performance-based payment schedule  as necessary to reflect the actions required by those contract  modifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Instructions for multiple appropriations. If there is more than  one appropriation account (or subaccount) funding payments on the  contract, the contracting officer shall provide instructions to the  Government payment office for distribution of financing payments to the  respective funds accounts. Distribution instructions shall be consistent  with the contract's liquidation provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Liquidating performance-based finance payments. Performance- based amounts shall be liquidated by deducting a percentage or a  designated dollar amount from the delivery payments. The contracting  officer shall specify the liquidation rate or designated dollar amount  in the contract. The method of liquidation shall ensure complete  liquidation no later than final payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the contracting officer establishes the performance-based  payments on a delivery item basis, the liquidation amount for each line  item is the percent of that delivery item price that was previously paid  under performance-based finance payments or the designated dollar  amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the performance-based finance payments are on a whole  contract basis, liquidation is by predesignated liquidation amounts or  liquidation percentages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Competitive negotiated solicitations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a solicitation  requests offerors to propose performance-based payments, the  solicitation shall specify--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> What, if any, terms shall be included in all offers; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which and how offeror-proposed performance-based  payment terms will be evaluated. Unless agencies prescribe other  evaluation procedures, if the contracting officer anticipates that the  cost of providing performance-based payments would have a significant  impact on determining the best value offer, the solicitation should  state that the evaluation of the offeror's proposed prices will include  an adjustment to reflect the estimated cost to the Government of  providing each offeror's proposed performance-based payments (see  Alternate I to the provision at 52.232-28).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Review the proposed terms to ensure they comply with this  section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section.
