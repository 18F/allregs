                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The administrative law judge shall issue a written  decision that gives the findings of fact and the reasons for the  decision. The administrative law judge must base the decision on the  preponderance of the evidence offered at the hearing or otherwise  included in the record. The administrative law judge shall mail a copy  of the decision to all the parties at their last known address. The  Appeals Council may also receive a copy of the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fully favorable oral decision entered into the record at the  hearing. The administrative law judge may enter a fully favorable oral  decision based on the preponderance of the evidence into the record of  the hearing proceedings. If the administrative law judge enters a fully  favorable oral decision into the record of the hearing proceedings, the  administrative law judge may issue a written decision that incorporates  the oral decision by reference. The administrative law judge may use  this procedure only in those categories of cases that we identify in  advance. The administrative law judge may only use this procedure in  those cases where the administrative law judge determines that no  changes are required in the findings of fact or the reasons for the  decision as stated at the hearing. If a fully favorable decision is  entered into the record at the hearing, the administrative law judge  will also include in the record, as an exhibit entered into the record  at the hearing, a document that sets forth the key data, findings of  fact, and narrative rationale for the decision. If the decision  incorporates by reference the findings and the reasons stated in an oral  decision at the hearing, the parties shall also be provided, upon  written request, a record of the oral decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recommended decision. Although an administrative law judge will  usually make a decision, the administrative law judge may send the case  to the Appeals Council with a recommended   decision based on a preponderance of the evidence when appropriate. The  administrative law judge will mail a copy of the recommended decision to  the parties at their last known addresses and send the recommended  decision to the Appeals Council.
