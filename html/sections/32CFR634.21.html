                                Sec. 634.21  Department of Defense Form 2220.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use. DD Form 2220 will be used to identify registered POVs on  Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and DLA installations or  facilities. The form is produced in single copy for conspicuous  placement on the front of the vehicle only (windshield or bumper). If  allowed by state laws, the decal is placed in the center by the rear  view mirror or the lower portion of the driver's side windshield. The  requirement to affix the DD Form 2220 to the front windshield or bumper  of registered vehicles is waived for General Officers and Flag Officers  of all Armed Services, Armed Service Secretaries, Political Appointees,  Members of Congress, and the Diplomatic Corps.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each Service and DLA will procure its own forms and installation  and expiration tabs. For the Army, the basic decal will be ordered  through publications channels and remain on the vehicle until the  registered owner disposes of the vehicle, separates from active duty or  other conditions specified in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. Air  Force, DLA, and Army retirees may retain DD Form 2220. Army retirees are  required to follow the same registration and VRS procedures as active  duty personnel. Upon termination of affiliation with the service, the  registered owner or authorized operator is responsible for removing the  DD Form 2220 from the vehicle and surrender of the decal to the issuing  office. Army installation commanders are responsible for the costs of  procuring decals with the name of their installation and related  expiration tabs. Air Force installations will use the installation tag  (4[sec] by \1/2\[sec]) to identify the Air Force Installation where the  vehicle is registered. Air Force personnel may retain the DD Form 2220  upon reassignment, retirement, or separation provided the individual is  still eligible for continued registration, the registration is updated  in SFMIS, and the installation tab is changed accordingly. Position the  decal directly under the DD Form 2220.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For other Armed Services and DLA, DD Form 2220 and installation  and expiration tabs will be removed from POV's by the owner prior to  departure from their current installation, retirement, or separation  from military or government affiliation, termination of ownership,  registration, liability insurance, or other conditions further  identified by local policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specifications. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DD Form 2220 and installation and expiration  tabs will consist of international blue borders and printing on a white  background. Printer information will include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Form title (Department of Defense Registered Vehicle).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alphanumeric individual form identification number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> DOD seal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name of the installation will be specified on a separate tab  abutting the decal. Each Service or DLA may choose optional color codes  for the registrant. Army and installations having vehicle registration  programs will use the following standard color scheme for the  installation tab:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Blue-officers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Red-enlisted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Green DA civilian employees (including NAF employees).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Black-contractor personnel and other civilians employed on the  installation. White will be used for contract personnel on Air Force  installations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An expiration tab identifying the month and year (6-2004), the  year (2000) or simply ``00'' will be abutted to right of the decal. For  identification purposes, the date of expiration will be shown in bold  block numbers on a lighter contrasting background such as traffic  yellow, lime, or orange.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DD Form 2220 and any adjoining tabs will be theft resistant when  applied to glass, metal, painted, or rubberized surfaces and  manufactured so as to obliterate or self destruct when removal is  attempted. Local policy guided by state or host nation laws will specify  the exact placement of DD Form 2220.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For Navy and Marine Corps military personnel the grade insignia  will be affixed on placards, approximately 5 inches by 8 inches in size,  and placed on the driver's side dashboard. Placards should be removed  from view when the vehicle is not located on a military installation.</p>
