                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan designates the Department of Labor as the agency  responsible for administering the Plan throughout the State. It proposes  to define the occupational safety and health issue covered by it as  defined by the Secretary of Labor in Sec. 1902.2(c)(1) of this chapter.  All occupational safety and health standards promulgated by the United  States Secretary of Labor have been adopted under the Plan as well as a  certain standard deemed to be ``as effective as'' the Federal standard,  except those found in parts 1915, 1916, 1917 and 1918 of this chapter  (ship repairing, ship building, ship breaking and longshoring). All  Federal standards adopted by the State became effective on December 29,  1972.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within the plan there is enabling legislation revising chapter  338 of the Kentucky Revised Statutes which became law on March 27, 1972;  as well as legislation enacted and approved in a Special Session of the  Legislature in   1972 amending the enabling legislation. The law as enacted and modified  gives the Department of Labor, Division of Occupational Safety and  Health, the statutory authority to implement an occupational safety and  health plan modeled after the Federal Act. There are provisions within  it granting the Commissioner of Labor the authority to inspect  workplaces and to issue citations for the abatement of violations and  there is also included a prohibition against advance notice of such  inspections. The law is also intended to insure employer and employee  representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors and to call  attention to possible violations; notification of employees or their  representatives when no compliance action is taken as a result of  employee alleged violations; protection of employees against  discrimination in terms and conditions of employment; and adequate  safeguards to protect trade secrets. There is provision made for the  prompt restraint of imminent danger situations and a system of penalties  for violation of the statute. There are also provisions creating the  Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board and the Kentucky  Occupational Safety and Health Review Board. The Law has further  provision that the Department of Labor will enter into an agreement with  the Public Service Commission (PSC) which shall serve as the State  agency in the administration of all matters relating to occupational  safety and health with respect to employees of public utilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan includes an opinion from the Attorney General that the  Law is consistent with the Constitution of the State. There is also set  forth in the Plan a Time Schedule for the Development of a Public  Employee Program. The Plan also contains a comprehensive description of  personnel employed under the State's merit system as well as its  proposed budget and resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Kentucky plan includes the following documents as of the  date of approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan description documents, including the Kentucky  Occupational Safety and Health Act, and appendices in three (3) volumes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Letter for James R. Yocum, Commissioner of the Kentucky  Department of Labor, to Basil A. Needham, Jr., Regional Administrator,  Atlanta, Georgia Office, Occupational Safety and Health Administration,  June 14, 1973, submitting additions and clarifications to the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Letter from James R. Yocum to the Assistant Secretary of Labor,  John H. Stender, July 13, 1973, submitting assurances that the State  will submit certain amendments to the 1974 Session of its Legislature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The public comments will also be available for inspection and  copying with the plan documents.  [38 FR 20324, July 31, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 24896, June 13, 1985]</p>
