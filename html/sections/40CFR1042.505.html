                                Sec.  1042.505  Testing engines using discrete-mode or ramped-modal
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how to test engines under steady-state  conditions. In some cases, we allow you to choose the appropriate  steady-state duty cycle for an engine; you may also choose between  discrete-mode and ramped-modal testing. In all cases, you must use the  duty cycle you select in your application for certification for all  testing you perform for that engine family. If we test your engines to  confirm that they meet emission standards, we will use the duty cycles  you select for your own testing. If you submit certification test data  using more than one duty cycle, any of the selected duty cycles may be  used for any subsequent testing. We may also perform other testing as  allowed by the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may perform steady-state testing with either discrete-mode  or ramped-modal cycles as described in 40 CFR Part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measure emissions by testing the engine on a dynamometer with  one of the following duty cycles (as specified) to determine whether it  meets the emission standards in Sec. Sec.  1042.101 or 1042.104:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General cycle. Use the 4-mode duty cycle or the corresponding  ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (a) of Appendix II of this  part for commercial propulsion marine engines that are   used with (or intended to be used with) fixed-pitch propellers,  propeller-law auxiliary engines, and any other engines for which the  other duty cycles of this section do not apply. Use this duty cycle also  for commercial variable-speed propulsion marine engines that are used  with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch propellers or with  electrically coupled propellers, unless these engines are not intended  for sustained operation (e.g., for at least 30 minutes) at all four  modes when installed in the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recreational marine engines. Except as specified in paragraph  (b)(3) of this section, use the 5-mode duty cycle or the corresponding  ramped-modal cycle described in paragraph (b) of Appendix II of this  part for recreational marine engines with maximum engine power at or  above 37 kW.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Controllable-pitch and electrically coupled propellers. Use the  4-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in  paragraph (c) of Appendix II of this part for constant-speed propulsion  marine engines that are used with (or intended to be used with)  controllable-pitch propellers or with electrically coupled propellers.  Use this duty cycle also for variable-speed propulsion marine engines  that are used with (or intended to be used with) controllable-pitch  propellers or with electrically coupled propellers if the duty cycles in  paragraph (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section do not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Constant-speed auxiliary engines. Use the 5-mode duty cycle or  the corresponding ramped-modal cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039,  Appendix II, paragraph (a) for constant-speed auxiliary engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Variable-speed auxiliary engines. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use the duty cycle  specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for propeller-law  auxiliary engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the 6-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal  cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039, Appendix II, paragraph (b) for  variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power below 19 kW  that are not propeller-law engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Use the 8-mode duty cycle or the corresponding ramped-modal  cycle described in 40 CFR Part 1039, Appendix III, paragraph (c) for  variable-speed auxiliary engines with maximum engine power at or above  19 kW that are not propeller-law engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> to replace full-load operation with the maximum load for  which the engine is designed to operate for extended periods.
