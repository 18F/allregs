                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Statement of principles. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Because freedom of the press can be  no broader than the freedom of members of the news media to investigate  and report the news, the Department's policy is intended to provide  protection to members of the news media from certain law enforcement  tools, whether criminal or civil, that might unreasonably impair  newsgathering activities. The policy is not intended to extend special  protections to members of the news media who are subjects or targets of  criminal investigations for conduct not based on, or within the scope  of, newsgathering activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether to seek information from, or records of,  members of the news media, the approach in every instance must be to  strike the proper balance among several vital interests: Protecting  national security, ensuring public safety, promoting effective law  enforcement and the fair administration of justice, and safeguarding the  essential role of the free press in fostering government accountability  and an open society.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this  section, only to obtain information from, or records of, members of the  news media when the information sought is essential to a successful  investigation, prosecution, or litigation; after all reasonable  alternative attempts have been made to obtain the information from  alternative sources; and after negotiations with the affected member of  the news media have been pursued and appropriate notice to the affected  member of the news media has been provided, unless the Attorney General  determines that, for compelling reasons, such negotiations or notice  would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the  investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present an  imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When the Attorney General has authorized the use of a subpoena,  court order issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2703(d) or 3123, or warrant to  obtain   from a third party communications records or business records of a  member of the news media, the affected member of the news media shall be  given reasonable and timely notice of the Attorney General's  determination before the use of the subpoena, court order, or warrant,  unless the Attorney General determines that, for compelling reasons,  such notice would pose a clear and substantial threat to the integrity  of the investigation, risk grave harm to national security, or present  an imminent risk of death or serious bodily harm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope.--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Covered individuals and entities. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The policy  governs the use of certain law enforcement tools to obtain information  from, or records of, members of the news media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The protections of the policy do not extend to any individual  or entity where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the  individual or entity is--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A foreign power or agent of a foreign power, as those terms are  defined in section 101 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of  1978 (50 U.S.C. 1801);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A member or affiliate of a foreign terrorist organization  designated under section 219(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act  (8 U.S.C. 1189(a));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Designated as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist by the  Department of the Treasury under Executive Order 13224 of September 23,  2001 (66 FR 49079);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A specially designated terrorist as that term is defined in 31  CFR 595.311 (or any successor thereto);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A terrorist organization as that term is defined in section  212(a)(3)(B)(vi) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C.  1182(a)(3)(B)(vi));</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Committing or attempting to commit a crime of terrorism, as that  offense is described in 18 U.S.C. 2331(5) or 2332b(g)(5);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Committing or attempting the crime of providing material support  or resources to terrorists, as that offense is defined in 18 U.S.C.  2339A;

 and the use by law enforcement authorities of subpoenas, or court orders  issued pursuant to 18 U.S.C. 2703(d) (``2703(d) order'') or 18 U.S.C.  3123 (``3123 order''), to obtain from third parties ``communications  records'' or ``business records'' of members of the news media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The policy also governs applications for warrants to search the  premises or property of members of the news media, pursuant to Federal  Rule of Criminal Procedure 41; or to obtain from third-party  ``communication service providers'' the communications records or  business records of members of the news media, pursuant to 18 U.S.C.  2703(a) and (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ``Communications records'' include the  contents of electronic communications as well as source and destination  information associated with communications, such as email transaction  logs and local and long distance telephone connection records, stored or  transmitted by a third-party communication service provider with which  the member of the news media has a contractual relationship.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em>, (D), (E), and (F).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A ``communication service provider'' is a provider of an  electronic communication service or remote computing service as defined,  respectively, in 18 U.S.C. 2510(15) and 18 U.S.C. 2711(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> ``Business records'' include work product and other  documentary materials, and records of the activities, including the  financial transactions, of a member of the news media related to the  coverage, investigation, or reporting of news.

This exception applies, but is not limited, to both  published and unpublished materials and aired and unaired recordings.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case of an authorization under paragraph (c)(3)(i)(A) of  this section, the United States Attorney or Assistant Attorney General  responsible for the matter shall provide notice to the Director of the  Criminal Division's Office of Enforcement Operations within 10 business  days of the authorization of the issuance of the subpoena.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In light of the intent of this policy to protect freedom of the  press, newsgathering activities, and confidential news media sources,  authorization of the Attorney General will not be required of members of  the Department in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> To issue subpoenas to news media entities for purely commercial,  financial, administrative, technical, or other information unrelated to  newsgathering activities; or for information or records relating to  personnel not involved in newsgathering activities.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> To issue subpoenas to members of the news media for information  related to public comments, messages, or postings by readers, viewers,  customers, or subscribers, over which the member of the news media does  not exercise editorial control prior to publication.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> To use subpoenas to obtain information from, or to use  subpoenas, 2703(d) orders, or 3123 orders to obtain communications  records or business records of, members of the news media who may be  perpetrators or victims of, or witnesses to, crimes or other events,  when such status (as a perpetrator, victim, or witness) is not based on,  or within the scope of, newsgathering activities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the circumstances identified in paragraphs (c)(3)(ii)(A)  through (C) of this section, the United States Attorney or Assistant  Attorney General responsible for the matter must--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Authorize the use of the subpoena or court order;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Consult with the Criminal Division regarding appropriate review  and safeguarding protocols; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Provide a copy of the subpoena or court order to the Director of  the Office of Public Affairs and to the Director of the Criminal  Division's Office of Enforcement Operations within 10 business days of  the authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Considerations for the Attorney General in determining whether  to authorize the issuance of a subpoena to a member of the news media.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In matters in which   a member of the Department determines that a member of the news media is  a subject or target of an investigation relating to an offense committed  in the course of, or arising out of, newsgathering activities, the  member of the Department requesting Attorney General authorization to  issue a subpoena to a member of the news media shall provide all facts  necessary for determinations by the Attorney General regarding both  whether the member of the news media is a subject or target of the  investigation and whether to authorize the issuance of such subpoena. If  the Attorney General determines that the member of the news media is a  subject or target of an investigation relating to an offense committed  in the course of, or arising out of, newsgathering activities, the  Attorney General's determination regarding the issuance of the proposed  subpoena should take into account the principles reflected in paragraph  (a) of this section, but need not take into account the considerations  identified in paragraphs (c)(4)(ii) through (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In criminal matters, there should be reasonable grounds to  believe, based on public information, or information from non-media  sources, that a crime has occurred, and that the information sought is  essential to a successful investigation or prosecution.

The  subpoena should not be used to obtain peripheral, nonessential,  cumulative, or speculative information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The government should have made all reasonable attempts to  obtain the information from alternative, non-media sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The government should have pursued negotiations with the  affected member of the news media, unless the Attorney General  determines that, for compelling reasons, such negotiations would pose a  clear and substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation, risk  grave harm to national security, or present an imminent risk of death or  serious bodily harm. Where the nature of the investigation permits, the  government should have explained to the member of the news media the  government's needs in a particular investigation or prosecution, as well  as its willingness to address the concerns of the member of the news  media.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The obligation to pursue negotiations with the affected member  of the news media, unless excused by the Attorney General, is not  intended to conflict with the requirement that members of the Department  secure authorization from the Attorney General to question a member of  the news media as required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.  Accordingly, members of the Department do not need to secure  authorization from the Attorney General to pursue negotiations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The proposed subpoena generally should be limited to the  verification of published information and to such surrounding  circumstances as relate to the accuracy of the published information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In investigations or prosecutions of unauthorized disclosures  of national defense information or of classified information, where the  Director of National Intelligence, after consultation with the relevant  Department or agency head(s), certifies to the Attorney General the  significance of the harm raised by the unauthorized disclosure and that  the information disclosed was properly classified and reaffirms the  intelligence community's continued support for the investigation or  prosecution, the Attorney General may authorize members of the  Department, in such investigations, to issue subpoenas to members of the  news media. The certification, which the Attorney General should take  into account along with other considerations identified in paragraphs  (c)(4)(ii) through (viii) of this section, will be sought not more than  30 days prior to the submission of the approval request to the Attorney  General.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Requests should be treated with care to avoid interference  with   newsgathering activities and to avoid claims of harassment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The proposed subpoena should be narrowly drawn.

If the Attorney General determines that the member of  the news media is a subject or target of an investigation relating to an  offense committed in the course of, or arising out of, newsgathering  activities, the Attorney General's determination regarding the use of  the proposed subpoena or order should take into account the principles  reflected in paragraph (a) of this section, but need not take into  account the considerations identified in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) through  (viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In criminal matters, there should be reasonable grounds to  believe, based on public information, or information from non-media  sources, that a crime has been committed, and that the information  sought is essential to the successful investigation or prosecution of  that crime.

The certification, which the  Attorney General should take into account along with the other  considerations identified in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, will be  sought not more than 30 days prior to the submission of the approval  request to the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Requests should be treated with care to avoid interference with  newsgathering activities and to avoid claims of harassment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The proposed subpoena or court order should be narrowly drawn.

Any information or records obtained from members  of the   news media or from third parties pursuant to this policy shall be  closely held so as to prevent disclosure of the information to  unauthorized persons or for improper purposes.
