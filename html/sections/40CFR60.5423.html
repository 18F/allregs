                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must retain records of the calculations and measurements required in Sec. 60.5405(a) and (b) and Sec. 60.5407(a) through (g) for at least 2 years following the date of the measurements. This requirement is included under Sec. 60.7(d) of the General Provisions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must submit a report of excess emissions to the Administrator in your annual report if you had excess emissions during the reporting period. For the purpose of these reports, excess emissions are defined as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any 24-hour period (at consistent intervals) during which the average sulfur emission reduction efficiency (R) is less than the minimum required efficiency (Z).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For any affected facility electing to comply with the provisions of Sec. 60.5407(b)(2), any 24-hour period during which the average temperature of the gases leaving the combustion zone of an incinerator is less than the appropriate operating temperature as determined during the most recent performance test in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 60.5407(b)(2). Each 24-hour period must consist of at least 96 temperature measurements equally spaced over the 24 hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To certify that a facility is exempt from the control requirements of these standards, for each facility with a design capacity less that 2 LT/D of H2S in the acid gas (expressed as sulfur) you must keep, for the life of the facility, an analysis demonstrating that the facility's design capacity is less than 2 LT/D of H2S expressed as sulfur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you elect to comply with Sec. 60.5407(e) you must keep, for the life of the facility, a record demonstrating that the facility's design capacity is less than 150 LT/D of H2S expressed as sulfur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The requirements of paragraph (b) of this section remain in force until and unless the EPA, in delegating enforcement authority to a state under section 111(c) of the Act, approves reporting requirements or an alternative means of compliance surveillance adopted by such state. In that event, affected sources within the state will be relieved of obligation to comply with paragraph (b) of this section, provided that they comply with the requirements established by the state.</p>
