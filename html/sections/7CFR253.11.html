                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allocation of administrative funds to FNS Regional Offices. Each  fiscal year, after enactment of a program appropriation for the full  fiscal year and apportionment of funds by the Office of Management and  Budget, administrative funds will be allocated to each FNS Regional  Office for further allocation to State agencies. To the extent  practicable, administrative funds will be allocated to FNS Regional  Offices in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 65 percent of all administrative funds available nationally will  be allocated to each FNS Regional Office in proportion to its share of  the total number of participants nationally, averaged over the three  previous fiscal years; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 35 percent of all administrative funds available nationally will  be allocated to each FNS Regional Office in proportion to its share of  the total current number of State agencies administering the program  nationally.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of administrative funds to State agencies. Prior to  receiving administrative funds, State agencies must submit a proposed  budget reflecting planned administrative costs to the appropriate FNS  Regional Office for approval. Planned administrative costs must be  allowable under part 277 of this chapter. To the extent that funding  levels permit, the FNS Regional Office allocates to each State agency  administrative funds necessary to cover 75 percent of approved  administrative costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State agency matching requirement. State agencies must match  administrative funds allocated to them as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless Federal administrative funding is approved at a rate  higher than 75 percent of approved administrative costs, in accordance  with paragraph (c)(2) of this section, each State agency must contribute  25 percent of its total approved administrative costs. Cash or non-cash  contributions, including third party in-kind contributions, and the  value of services rendered by volunteers, may be used to meet the State  agency matching requirement. In accordance with part 277 of this  chapter, such contributions must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Be verifiable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Not be contributed for another federally-assisted program,  unless authorized by Federal legislation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Be necessary and reasonable to accomplish program objectives;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Be allowable under Part 277 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Not be paid by the Federal Government under another assistance  agreement unless authorized under the other agreement and its subject  laws and regulations; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Be included in the approved budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency may request a waiver to reduce its matching  requirement below 25 percent of approved administrative costs. In its  proposed budget, the State agency must submit compelling justification  to the appropriate FNS Regional Office that it is unable to meet the 25  percent matching requirement and that additional administrative funds  are necessary for the effective operation of the program. The FNS  Regional Office may, at its discretion, approve a reduction of the  matching requirement and provide additional administrative funds to  cover more than 75 percent of approved administrative costs to a State  agency that provides compelling justification. In its compelling  justification submission, the State agency must include a summary  statement and recent financial documents, in accordance with FNS  instructions. Compelling justification may include but is not limited  to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The need for additional administrative funding for startup costs  during the first year of program operation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The need to prevent a reduction in the level of necessary and  reasonable program services provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of funds by State agencies. Any funds received under this  section shall be used only for costs that are allowable under part 277  of this chapter, and that are incurred in operating the food  distribution program. Such funds may not be used to pay costs that are,  or may be, paid with funds provided from other Federal sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application for funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any State agency administering a Food  Distribution Program that desires to receive administrative funds under  this section shall submit form SF-424, ``Application for Federal  Assistance,'' to the appropriate FNS Regional Office at least three  months prior to the beginning of a Federal fiscal year. The application  shall include budget information, reflecting by category of expenditure  the State agency's best estimate of the total amount to be expended in  the administration of the program during the fiscal year. FNS may  require that detailed information be submitted by the State agency to  support or explain the total estimated amounts shown for each budget  cost category. As required by 7 CFR part 3015, Subpart V, agencies of  State government shall submit the application for Federal assistance to  the State clearinghouse before submitting it to the FNSRO. ITOs shall  not be subject to this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approval of the application by FNS shall be a prerequisite to  the payment of any funds to State agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Availability of funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS shall review and evaluate the  budget information submitted by the State agency in relationship to the  State agency's plan of operation and any other factors which may be  relevant to FNS' determination as to whether the estimated expenditures  itemized by budget category are reasonable and justified. FNS shall give  written notification to the State agency of (i) its approval or  disapproval of any or all of the itemized expenditures, (ii) the amount  of funds which will be made available, and (iii) the period for which  funds are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> FNS shall review and evaluate applications submitted by State  agencies for administrative funds available under this section in the  following order of priority and shall give preference in making payments  of funds under this section in the same order of priority:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applications from State agencies which desire to continue a Food  Distribution Program now in operation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applications from State agencies, in the order received, which  FNS determines are immediately capable of effectively and efficiently  administering the Program, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Applications from other States agencies, in the order  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Method of payment to State agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payments are made to  State agencies through a Letter of Credit or an advance by Treasury  check. The Letter of Credit funding method shall   be used by FNS except when the advances to be made within a 12 month  period are estimated to be less than $120,000. However, FNS may, at its  option, reimburse a State agency by Treasury check regardless of the  amount in response to a valid claim submitted by the State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Letter of Credit funding method shall be done in conjunction  with Treasury Department procedures, Treasury Circular No. 1075 and  through an appropriate Treasury Regional Disbursing Office (RDO). The  Standard Form 183, ``Request for Payment on Letter of Credit and Status  of Funds Report,'' shall be correctly prepared and certified by a duly  appointed official of the State for requesting payment from an RDO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The advance by Treasury check method shall be done by use of the  Standard Form 270, ``Request for Advance or Reimbursement,'' and  procedures associated with its use. State agencies receiving payments  under this method may request payments before cash outlays are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any State agency receiving payment under the Letter of Credit  method or the advance by Treasury check method shall have in place and  in operation, a financial management system which meets the standards  for fund control and accountability prescribed in part 277 of this  chapter, as amended. The State agency shall demonstrate on a continuing  basis its willingness and ability to have and to function within  procedures that will minimize the time lapse between the transfer of  funds and its disbursement to meet obligations. For any State agency  which does not meet the requirement of this paragraph, the reimbursement  by Treasury check method shall be the preferred method for FNS to make  payments to that State agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Accounting for funds. Each State agency which receives  administrative funds under this section shall establish and maintain an  effective system of fiscal control and accounting procedures.  Expenditures and accountability of such funds shall be in accordance  with the appropriate provisions of part 277. The accounting procedures  maintained by the State agency shall be such as to accurately reflect  the receipt, expenditure and current balance of funds provided by FNS  and to facilitate the prompt preparation of reports required by FNS. The  accounting procedures shall also provide for segregation of costs  specifically identifiable to the Food Distribution Program from any  other costs incurred by the State agency. Any budget revisions by a  State agency which require the transfer of funds from an approved cost  category to another shall be in accordance with the budget revision  procedures set forth in OMB Circular No. A-102, Attachment K, and shall  be approved by FNS prior to any transfer of funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Return, reduction, and reallocation of funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> FNS may  require State agencies to return prior to the end of the fiscal year any  or all unobligated funds received under this section, and may reduce the  amount it has apportioned or agreed to pay to any State agency if FNS  determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State agency is not administering the Food Distribution  Program in accordance with its plan of operation approved by FNS and the  provisions of this part, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of funds which the State agency requested from FNS  is in excess of actual need, based on reports of expenditures and  current projections of Program needs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Circumstances or conditions justify the return reallocation or  transfer of funds to accomplish the purpose of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall return to FNS within 90 days following  the close of each Federal fiscal year any funds received under this  section which are unobligated at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Records, reports, audits. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Keep such accounts and records as may be necessary to enable FNS  to determine whether there has been compliance with this section, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adhere to the retention and custodial requirements for records  set forth in Sec. 277.4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency receiving funds either through a Treasury RDO  Letter of Credit system or Treasury check shall submit quarterly reports  to FNS on Form SF-269, ``Financial Status Report,'' by the 30th day  after close of the reporting quarter and shall submit   such other reports as may be required by FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appropriate provisions of part 277 are adaptable to this  section for additional guidance.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0584-0071)  (44 U.S.C. 3506)  [44 FR 35928, June 19, 1979, as amended at 47 FR 746, Jan. 7, 1982.
