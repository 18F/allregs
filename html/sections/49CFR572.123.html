                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The neck assembly for the purposes of this test consists of the assembly of components shown in drawing 127-1015.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the head-neck assembly consisting of the head (drawing 127-1000), neck (drawing 127-1015), pivot pin (drawing 78051-339), bib simulator (drawing TE127-1025, neck bracket assembly (drawing 127-8221), six-axis neck transducer (drawing SA572-S11), neck mounting adaptor (drawing TE-2208-001), and three accelerometers (drawing SA572-S4) installed in the head assembly as specified in Sec. 572.122, is tested according to the test procedure in paragraph (c) of this section, it shall have the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Flexion. (i) Plane D, referenced in Figure N2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 74 degrees and 92 degrees. Within this specified rotation corridor, the peak moment about the occipital condyles shall be not less than 27 N-m (19.9 ft-lbf) and not more than 33 N-m (24.3 ft-lbf).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Plane D, referenced in Figure N2, shall rotate in the direction of preimpact flight with respect to the pendulum's longitudinal centerline between 74 degrees and 92 degrees.

All data channels should be at the zero level at this time.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Stop the pendulum from the initial velocity with an acceleration vs. time pulse which meets the velocity change as specified below. Integrate the pendulum acceleration data channel to obtain the velocity vs. time curve:</p><p class="depth4">Table B----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Time                                                Pendulum pulse----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Flexion                  Extension</p><p class="depth4">ms                              ---------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">m/s          ft/s         m/s          ft/s----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------10..........................................................      1.2-1.6      3.9-5.3      1.0-1.4      3.3-4.620..........................................................      2.4-3.4     7.9-11.2      2.2-3.0      7.2-9.830..........................................................      3.8-5.0    12.5-16.4      3.2-4.2    10.5-13.8----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
