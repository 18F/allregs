                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The procedures set forth below are intended as a  statement of policy of the Department of Justice and will be applied by  the Department in exercising its responsibilities under Federal law  relating to the destruction of seized contraband drugs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose.

As used in this subpart, the following terms shall  have the meanings specified:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term Contraband drugs are those controlled substances listed  in Schedules I and II of the Controlled Substances Act seized for  violation of that Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term Marijuana is as defined in 21 U.S.C. 801(15) but does  not include, for the purposes of this regulation, the derivatives  hashish or hashish oil for purposes of destruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term Representative sample means the exemplar for testing  and a sample aggregate portion of the whole amount seized sufficient for  current criminal evidentiary practice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term Threshold amount means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Two kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable  amount of heroin;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ten kilograms of a mixture or substance containing a detectable  amount of--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Coca leaves, except coca leaves and extracts of coca leaves from  which cocaine, ecgonine, and derivatives of ecognine or their salts have  been removed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of  isomers;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Ecgonine, its derivatives, their salts, isomers, and salts of  isomers; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any  quantity of any of the substances referred to in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii)  (A) through (C) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ten kilograms of a mixture or substance described in paragraph  (d)(4)(ii)(B) of this section which contains cocaine base;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Two hundred grams of powdered phencyclidine (PCP) or two  kilograms of a powdered mixture or substance containing a detectable  amount of phencyclidine (PCP) or 28.35 grams of a liquid containing a  detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Twenty grams of a mixture or substance containing a detectable  amount of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Eight hundred grams of a mixture or substance containing a  detectable amount of N-phenyl-N[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidiny]  propanamide (commonly known as fentanyl) or two hundred grams of a  mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of any analogue of  N-phenyl-N-[1-(2-phenylethyl)-4-piperidinyl propanamide; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Twenty kilograms of hashish or two kilograms of hashish oil  (21 U.S.C. 841(b)(1)(D), 960(b)(4)).

Responsibilities of the Federal Bureau of  Investigation and Drug Enforcement Administration.  When contraband drug substances in excess of the threshold amount or in  the case of marijuana a quantity in excess of the representative sample  are seized pursuant to a criminal investigation and retained in the  custody of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or Drug Enforcement  Administration, the Agency having custody shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately notify the appropriate U.S. Attorney, Assistant U.S.  Attorney, or the responsible state/local prosecutor that the amount of  seized contraband drug exceeding the threshold amount and its packaging,  will be destroyed after sixty days from the date notice is provided of  the seizures, unless the agency providing notice is requested in writing  by the authority receiving notice not to destroy the excess contraband  drug; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assure that appropriate tests of samples of the drug are  conducted to determined the chemical nature of the contraband substance  and its weight sufficient to serve as evidence before the trial courts  of that jurisdiction; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Photographically depict, and if requested by the appropriate  prosecutorial authority, videotape, the contraband drugs as originally  packaged or an appropriate display of the seized contraband drugs so as  to create evidentiary exhibits for use at trial; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Isolate and retain the appropriate threshold amounts of  contraband drug evidence when an amount greater than the appropriate  threshold amount has been seized, or when less than the appropriate  threshold amounts of contraband drugs have been seized, the entire  amount of the seizure, with the exception of marijuana, for which a  representative sample shall be retained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Maintain the retained portions of the contraband drugs until the  evidence is no longer required for legal proceedings, at which time it  may be destroyed, first having obtained consent of the U.S. Attorney, an  Assistant U.S. Attorney, or the responsible state/local prosecutor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notify the appropriate U.S. Attorney, Assistant U.S. Attorney,  or the responsible state/local prosecutor to obtain consent to destroy  the retained amount or representative sample whenever the related  suspect(s) has been a fugitive from justice for a period of five years.  An exemplar sufficient for testing will be retained consistent with this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Procedures.
