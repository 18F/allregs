                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except for telephone sales for which payment is made by credit  card as described in paragraph (b) of this section, the charter operator  shall not accept payment from or on behalf of a prospective participant  unless the participant has agreed to the conditions of the charter by  signing an operator-participant contract as described in Sec. 380.32.  If a member of a group that will travel together pays for the group,  that member may sign the contract on behalf of the group.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For telephone sales only, the charter operator may accept  payment by credit card without the participant having first signed an  operator-participant contract provided that the charter operator first  advises the customer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That he or she has the right to receive the operator-participant  contract before making a booking;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the operator-participant contract will be mailed to the  participant within 24 hours of accepting payment by credit card; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the operator-participant contract must be signed, and the  signed portion returned to the operator, before travel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A full refund must be made of any amounts charged to a credit  card for any participant who cancels before the operator-participant  contract is signed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contract form may include a space that participants may  check to authorize the charter operator to retain their money while  attempting to make other arrangements for them if there is no space  available on the flight or on specific alternative flights they have  requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If there is no space available on the flight or specific  alternative flights   requested by the participant the operator shall return all the  participant's money within 7 days after receiving it unless the  participant, in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section, has  authorized the operator to retain the payments while the operator  attempts to make other arrangements for the participant. If the operator  retains the payments while attempting to make other arrangements for the  participant, it shall notify the participant of the fact within 7 days  after receiving the payments, but in no event later than the departure.  For the purpose of the time periods in this paragraph, receipt of money  by a travel agent on behalf of a charter operator will not be considered  as receipt by the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as set forth in Sec. 380.33a for operator's option plan  contracts, the operator-participant contract shall not specify  alternative dates for the outbound or return flights, or alternative  origin or destination cities for any flight leg.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em>, (h), (l), (r), (s), and  (x) of Sec. 380.32 shall be printed so as to contrast with the rest of  the contract by the use of bold-faced type, capital letters, or a type  size that is at least 50 percent larger than that used for the rest of  the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The contract form shall include a space that participants may  check to indicate that they wish to be furnished details of trip  cancellation, health, and accident insurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The contract form shall be designed so as to enable participants  to retain a copy of the general terms and conditions after signing it.  The specific information supplied by participants (such as choices of  dates, cities, or other options) need not be retainable.</p>
