The procedure used to demonstrate filter efficiency must be consistent with the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Method 52.1, ``Gravimetric and Dust-Spot Procedures for Testing Air-Cleaning Devices Used in General Ventilation for Removing Particulate Matter, June 4, 1992.'' The test coating for measuring filter efficiency shall be a high solids bake enamel delivered at a rate of at least 135 grams per minute from a conventional (non-HVLP) air-atomized spray gun operating at 40 pounds per square inch (psi) air pressure; the air flow rate across the filter shall be 150 feet per minute. Owners and operators may use published filter efficiency data provided by filter vendors to demonstrate compliance with this requirement and are not required to perform this measurement. The requirements of this paragraph do not apply to water wash spray booths that are operated and maintained according to the manufacturer's specifications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Spray booths and preparation stations used to refinish complete motor vehicles or mobile equipment must be fully enclosed with a full roof and four complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated at negative pressure so that air is drawn into any openings in the booth walls or preparation station curtains. However, if a spray booth is fully enclosed and has seals on all doors and other openings and has an automatic pressure balancing system, it may be operated at up to, but not more than, 0.05 inches water gauge positive pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Spray booths and preparation stations that are used to coat miscellaneous parts and products or vehicle subassemblies must have a full roof, at least three complete walls or complete side curtains, and must be ventilated so that air is drawn into the booth.

An equivalent spray technology may be used if it that has been demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve a transfer efficiency comparable to that of an HVLP spray gun

and for which the spray gun manufacturer has obtained written approval from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The requirements of this condition do not apply to spray guns with a cup capacity less than 3.0 fluid ounces (89 cc).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> In serious, severe, and extreme ozone nonattainment areas, all spray-applied coating operations must be applied with an HVLP spray gun, low volume low pressure (LVLP) spray gun, or air brush spray operation. An equivalent spray technology may be used if it has been demonstrated by the spray gun manufacturer to achieve a transfer efficiency comparable to that of an HVLP spray gun and for which the spray gun manufacturer has obtained written approval from the EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> All paint spray gun cleaning must be done so that an atomized mist or spray of gun cleaning solvent and paint residue is not created outside of a container that collects used gun cleaning solvent. Spray gun cleaning may be done with, for example, hand cleaning of parts of the disassembled gun in a container of solvent, by flushing solvent through the gun without atomizing the solvent and paint residue, or by using a fully enclosed spray gun washer. A combination of non-atomizing methods may also be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> All VOC-containing material (e.g., coatings, thinners, and clean-up solvents) shall be stored in closed containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> All waste materials containing VOC (e.g., soiled rags) shall be stored in sealed containers until properly disposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> Each permitted source located in a serious, severe, or extreme ozone nonattainment area, shall not apply a coating that has VOC content in excess of the limits listed in the Table 1 below.
