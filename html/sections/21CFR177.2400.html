No. 116-14-3), perfluoromethyl vinyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 1187-93- 5), and perfluoro-2-phenoxypropyl vinyl ether (CAS Reg. No. 24520-19-2)  and subsequent curing of the terpolymer (CAS Reg. No. 26658-70-8) using  the crosslinking agent, phenol, 4,4'-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1- (trifluoromethyl) ethylidene] bis-,dipotassium salt (CAS Reg. No. 25088- 69-1) and accelerator, 1,4,7,10,13,16-hexaoxacyclooctadecane (CAS Reg.  No. 17455-13-9).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The perfluorocarbon base polymer shall contain no less than 40  weight-percent of polymer units derived from tetrafluoroethylene, no  less than 40 weight-percent of polymer units derived from  perfluoromethyl vinyl ether and no more than 5 weight-percent polymer  units derived from perfluoro-2-phenoxy-propyl vinyl ether.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The composition limitations of the cured elastomer, calculated  as parts per 100 parts of terpolymer, are as follows:  Phenol, 4,4'-[2,2,2-trifluoro-1-(trifluoromethyl)-ethylidene] bis- ,dipotassium salt--not to exceed 5 parts. 1,4,7,10,13,16-Hexaoxacyclo-octadecane--not to exceed 5 parts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Optional adjuvant substances. The perfluorocarbon cured  elastomer identified in paragraph (a) of this section may contain the  following optional adjuvant substances, subject to any limitations cited  on their use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Substances generally recognized as safe (GRAS) in food or food  packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substances used in accordance with a prior sanction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substances authorized under applicable regulations in this part  and in parts 175 and 178 of this chapter and   subject to any limitations prescribed therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> subject to such  limitations as are provided:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Substances                           Limitations ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Carbon black (channel process of furnace    Not to exceed 15 parts per</p><p class="depth3">combustion process) (CAS Reg.

Perfluorocarbon  cured elastomers may be identified by the characteristic infrared  spectra of the pyrolysate breakdown product that is obtained by heating  and decomposing the elastomer using the method entitled ``Qualitative  Identification of Kalrez [supreg] by Infrared Examination of  Pyrolysate.'' This method is incorporated by reference. Copies of the  method are available from the Center for Food Safety and Applied  Nutrition (HFS-200), Food and Drug Administration, 5100 Paint Branch  Pkwy., College Park, MD 20740, or available for inspection at the  National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on  the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to:  http://www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Thermogravimetry. Perfluorocarbon cured elastomers have a major  decomposition peak occurring at 490 [15 C (914 F). Less than 1.5  percent of the elastomers will volatilize below 400 C (752 F) when run  under nitrogen at a 10 C or 18 F per minute heating rate using a Du  Pont Thermal Analyzer Model 1099 with Model 951 TGA unit or the  equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extractive limitations. Articles fabricated from perfluorocarbon  cured elastomers having a thickness of at least 1.0 millimeter (0.039  inch) when extracted at reflux temperatures for 2 hours separately with  distilled water, 50 percent ethanol, and n-heptane, shall meet the  following extractability limits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Total extractives not to exceed 3.1 milligrams per square  decimeter (0.2 milligrams per square inch).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fluoride extractives calculated as fluorine not to exceed 0.47  milligram per square decimeter (0.03 milligram per square inch).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conditions of use. In accordance with current good manufacturing  practice, finished food contact articles containing the perfluorocarbon  cured elastomers shall be thoroughly cleaned prior to their first use in  contact with food.
