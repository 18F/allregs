If you are seeking access in person, the system manager will permit you to examine the original record, will provide you with a copy of the records, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When obtaining access to the records in person at a NARA facility, you must provide proof of identification either by producing at least one piece of identification bearing a name or signature and either a photograph or physical description (e.g., a driver's license or employee identification card) or by signing the Certification of Identity form described in Sec. 1204.40 (b)(5). NARA reserves the right to ask you to produce additional pieces of identification to assure NARA of your identity. You will also be asked to sign an acknowledgement that you have been given access.</p>
