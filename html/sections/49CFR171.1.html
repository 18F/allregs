                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Federal hazardous materials transportation law (49 U.S.C. 5101 et  seq.) directs the Secretary of Transportation to establish regulations  for the safe and secure transportation of hazardous materials in  commerce, as the Secretary considers appropriate. The Secretary is  authorized to apply these regulations to persons who transport hazardous  materials in commerce. In addition, the law authorizes the Secretary to  apply these regulations to persons who cause hazardous materials to be  transported in commerce. The law also authorizes the Secretary to apply  these regulations to persons who manufacture or maintain a packaging or  a component of a packaging that is represented, marked, certified, or  sold as qualified for use in the transportation of a hazardous material  in commerce. Federal hazardous material transportation law also applies  to anyone who indicates by marking or other means that a hazardous  material being transported in commerce is present in a package or  transport conveyance when it is not, and to anyone who tampers with a  package or transport conveyance used to transport hazardous materials in  commerce or a required marking, label, placard, or shipping description.  Regulations prescribed in accordance with Federal hazardous materials  transportation law shall govern safety aspects, including security, of  the transportation of hazardous materials   that the Secretary considers appropriate. In 49 CFR 1.53, the Secretary  delegated authority to issue regulations for the safe and secure  transportation of hazardous materials in commerce to the Pipeline and  Hazardous Materials Safety Administrator. The Administrator issues the  Hazardous Materials Regulations (HMR; 49 CFR parts 171 through 180)  under that delegated authority. This section addresses the applicability  of the HMR to packagings represented as qualified for use in the  transportation of hazardous materials in commerce and to pre- transportation and transportation functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Packagings. Requirements in the HMR apply to each person who  manufactures, fabricates, marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or  tests a packaging or a component of a packaging that is represented,  marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of  a hazardous material in commerce, including each person under contract  with any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive,  legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal government who  manufactures, fabricates, marks, maintains, reconditions, repairs, or  tests a packaging or a component of a packaging that is represented,  marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in the transportation of  a hazardous material in commerce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pre-transportation functions. Requirements in the HMR apply to  each person who offers a hazardous material for transportation in  commerce, causes a hazardous material to be transported in commerce, or  transports a hazardous material in commerce and who performs or is  responsible for performing a pre-transportation function, including each  person performing pre-transportation functions under contract with any  department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or  judicial branch of the Federal government. Pre-transportation functions  include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining the hazard class of a hazardous material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Selecting a hazardous materials packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filling a hazardous materials packaging, including a bulk  packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Securing a closure on a filled or partially filled hazardous  materials package or container or on a package or container containing a  residue of a hazardous material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Marking a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous  material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Labeling a package to indicate that it contains a hazardous  material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Preparing a shipping paper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Providing and maintaining emergency response information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Reviewing a shipping paper to verify compliance with the HMR or  international equivalents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> For each person importing a hazardous material into the United  States, providing the shipper with timely and complete information as to  the HMR requirements that will apply to the transportation of the  material within the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Certifying that a hazardous material is in proper condition for  transportation in conformance with the requirements of the HMR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Loading, blocking, and bracing a hazardous materials package in  a freight container or transport vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Segregating a hazardous materials package in a freight  container or transport vehicle from incompatible cargo.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Selecting, providing, or affixing placards for a freight  container or transport vehicle to indicate that it contains a hazardous  material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transportation functions. Requirements in the HMR apply to  transportation of a hazardous material in commerce and to each person  who transports a hazardous material in commerce, including each person  under contract with any department, agency, or instrumentality of the  executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal government who  transports a hazardous material in commerce. Transportation of a  hazardous material in commerce begins when a carrier takes physical  possession of the hazardous material for the purpose of transporting it  and continues until the package containing the hazardous material is  delivered to the destination indicated on a shipping document, package  marking, or other medium, or,   in the case of a rail car, until the car is delivered to a private track  or siding. For a private motor carrier, transportation of a hazardous  material in commerce begins when a motor vehicle driver takes possession  of a hazardous material for the purpose of transporting it and continues  until the driver relinquishes possession of the package containing the  hazardous material at its destination and is no longer responsible for  performing functions subject to the HMR with respect to that particular  package. Transportation of a hazardous material in commerce includes the  following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Movement. Movement of a hazardous material by rail car,  aircraft, motor vehicle, or vessel (except as delegated by Department of  Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170 at 2(103)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Loading incidental to movement of a hazardous material. Loading  of packaged or containerized hazardous material onto a transport  vehicle, aircraft, or vessel for the purpose of transporting it,  including blocking and bracing a hazardous materials package in a  freight container or transport vehicle, and segregating a hazardous  materials package in a freight container or transport vehicle from  incompatible cargo, when performed by carrier personnel or in the  presence of carrier personnel. For a bulk packaging, loading incidental  to movement is filling the packaging with a hazardous material for the  purpose of transporting it when performed by carrier personnel or in the  presence of carrier personnel (except as delegated by Department of  Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170 at 2(103)), including  transloading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unloading incidental to movement of a hazardous material.  Removing a package or containerized hazardous material from a transport  vehicle, aircraft, or vessel; or for a bulk packaging, emptying a  hazardous material from the bulk packaging after the hazardous material  has been delivered to the consignee when performed by carrier personnel  or in the presence of carrier personnel or, in the case of a private  motor carrier, while the driver of the motor vehicle from which the  hazardous material is being unloaded immediately after movement is  completed is present during the unloading operation. (Emptying a  hazardous material from a bulk packaging while the packaging is on board  a vessel is subject to separate regulations as delegated by Department  of Homeland Security Delegation No. 0170 at 2(103).) Unloading  incidental to movement includes transloading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Storage incidental to movement of a hazardous material. Storage  of a transport vehicle, freight container, or package containing a  hazardous material by any person between the time that a carrier takes  physical possession of the hazardous material for the purpose of  transporting it until the package containing the hazardous material has  been delivered to the destination indicated on a shipping document,  package marking, or other medium, or, in the case of a private motor  carrier, between the time that a motor vehicle driver takes physical  possession of the hazardous material for the purpose of transporting it  until the driver relinquishes possession of the package at its  destination and is no longer responsible for performing functions  subject to the HMR with respect to that particular package.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Storage incidental to movement includes--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Storage at the destination shown on a shipping document,  including storage at a transloading facility, provided the original  shipping documentation identifies the shipment as a through-shipment and  identifies the final destination or destinations of the hazardous  material; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A rail car containing a hazardous material that is stored on  track that does not meet the definition of ``private track or siding''  in Sec. 171.8, even if the car has been delivered to the destination  shown on the shipping document.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Storage incidental to movement does not include storage of a  hazardous material at its final destination as shown on a shipping  document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Functions not subject to the requirements of the HMR. The  following are examples of activities to which the HMR do not apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Storage of a freight container, transport vehicle, or package  containing a hazardous material at an offeror facility prior to a  carrier taking   possession of the hazardous material for movement in transportation in  commerce or, for a private motor carrier, prior to a motor vehicle  driver taking physical possession of the hazardous material for movement  in transportation in commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unloading of a hazardous material from a transport vehicle or a  bulk packaging performed by a person employed by or working under  contract to the consignee following delivery of the hazardous material  by the carrier to its destination and departure from the consignee's  premises of the carrier's personnel or, in the case of a private  carrier, departure of the driver from the unloading area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Storage of a freight container, transport vehicle, or package  containing a hazardous material after its delivery by a carrier to the  destination indicated on a shipping document, package marking, or other  medium, or, in the case of a rail car, storage of a rail car on private  track.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rail and motor vehicle movements of a hazardous material  exclusively within a contiguous facility boundary where public access is  restricted, except to the extent that the movement is on or crosses a  public road or is on track that is part of the general railroad system  of transportation, unless access to the public road is restricted by  signals, lights, gates, or similar controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Transportation of a hazardous material in a motor vehicle,  aircraft, or vessel operated by a Federal, state, or local government  employee solely for noncommercial Federal, state, or local government  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Transportation of a hazardous material by an individual for non- commercial purposes in a private motor vehicle, including a leased or  rented motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any matter subject to the postal laws and regulations of the  United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Requirements of other Federal agencies. Each facility at which  pre-transportation or transportation functions are performed in  accordance with the HMR may be subject to applicable standards and  regulations of other Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Requirements of state and local government agencies. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under  49 U.S.C. 5125, a requirement of a state, political subdivision of a  state, or an Indian tribe is preempted, unless otherwise authorized by  another Federal statute or DOT issues a waiver of preemption, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Complying with both the non-Federal requirement and Federal  hazardous materials transportation law, the regulations issued under  Federal hazardous material transportation law or a hazardous material  transportation security regulation or directive issued by the Secretary  of Homeland Security is not possible;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The non-Federal requirement, as applied or enforced, is an  obstacle to accomplishing and carrying out Federal hazardous materials  transportation law, the regulations issued under Federal hazardous  material transportation law, or a hazardous material transportation  security regulation or directive issued by the Secretary of Homeland  Security;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The non-Federal requirement is not substantively the same as a  provision of Federal hazardous materials transportation law, the  regulations issued under Federal hazardous material transportation law,  or a hazardous material transportation security regulation or directive  issued by the Secretary of Homeland Security with respect to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The designation, description, and classification of hazardous  material;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The packing, repacking, handling, labeling, marking, and  placarding of hazardous material;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The preparation, execution, and use of shipping documents  related to hazardous material and requirements related to the number,  contents, and placement of those documents;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The written notification, recording, and reporting of the  unintentional release of hazardous material; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> The design, manufacturing, fabricating, marking, maintenance,  reconditioning, repairing, or testing of a package or container  represented, marked, certified, or sold as qualified for use in  transporting hazardous material.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A non-Federal designation, limitation or requirement on highway   routes over which hazardous material may or may not be transported does  not comply with the regulations in subparts C and D of part 397 of this  title; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A fee related to the transportation of a hazardous material is  not fair or is used for a purpose that is not related to transporting  hazardous material, including enforcement and planning, developing, and  maintaining a capability for emergency response.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to the limitations in paragraph (f)(1) of this section,  each facility at which functions regulated under the HMR are performed  may be subject to applicable laws and regulations of state and local  governments and Indian tribes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The procedures for DOT to make administrative determinations of  preemption are set forth in subpart E of part 397 of this title with  respect to non-Federal requirements on highway routing (paragraph  (f)(1)(iv) of this section) and in subpart C of part 107 of this chapter  with respect to all other non-Federal requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Penalties for noncompliance.
