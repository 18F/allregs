Sec. 3004.470-1  Scope.</p><p class="depth0">This section implements DHS's policies for assuring the security of unclassified facilities, Information Technology (IT) resources, and sensitive information during the acquisition process and contract performance.


Sec. 3004.470-2  Policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> DHS's policies and procedures on contractor personnel security requirements are set forth in various management directives (MDs), Directives, and Instructions. MD 11042.1, Safeguarding Sensitive But Unclassified (For Official Use Only) Information describes how contractors must handle sensitive but unclassified information. The DHS Sensitive Systems Policy Directive 4300A and the DHS 4300A Sensitive Systems Handbook, provide the policies and procedures on security for Information Technology resources. Compliance with these policies and procedures, as amended, is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The contractor must not use or redistribute any DHS information processed, stored, or transmitted by the contractor except as specified in the contract.

Sec. 3004.470-3  Contract clauses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Contracting officers shall insert a clause substantially the same as the clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR 3052.204-70, Security Requirements for Unclassified Information Technology Resources, in solicitations and contracts that require submission of an IT Security Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contracting officers shall insert the basic clause at (HSAR) 48 CFR

3052.204-71, Contractor Employee Access, in solicitations and contracts when contractor employees require recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information. Contracting officers shall insert the basic clause with its Alternate I for acquisitions requiring contractor access to IT resources. For acquisitions in which the contractor will not have access to IT resources, but the Department has determined contractor employee access to sensitive information or Government facilities must be limited to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, the contracting officer shall insert the clause with its Alternate II. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates shall be used unless contractor employees will require recurring access to Government facilities or access to sensitive information. Neither the basic clause nor its alternates should ordinarily be used in contracts with educational institutions.
