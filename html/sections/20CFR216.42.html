                                Sec. 216.42  How a private railroad pension affects a supplemental
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What is a private railroad pension. The Board determines whether a pension established by a railroad employer is a private pension that will cause a reduction in the employee's supplemental annuity. A private pension for purposes of this subpart is a plan that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is a written plan or arrangement which is communicated to the employees to whom it applies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is established and maintained by an employer for a defined group of employees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement or disability. Such a plan is sometimes referred to as a defined benefit plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Defined contribution plan. A plan under which the employer is obligated to make fixed contributions to the plan regardless of profits (sometimes known as a money purchase plan) is a private pension plan. A plan under which the employer's contributions are discretionary is not a private pension plan under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other than retirement benefits. A plan which provides benefits not customarily considered retirement benefits (such as unemployment benefits, sickness or hospitalization benefits) is not a private pension plan under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date of private railroad pension for supplemental annuity purposes. A private pension reduces a supplemental annuity payment effective on the first day of the month after the month the Board determines that it is a private pension as defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of private railroad pension. A supplemental annuity is reduced by the amount of any private pension the employee is receiving which is attributable to an employer's contributions, less any amount by which the private pension is reduced because of the supplemental annuity. The supplemental annuity is not reduced for the amount of a private pension attributable to the employee's contributions. The Board will determine the amount of a private pension for any month which is attributable to the employee's contributions.</p>
