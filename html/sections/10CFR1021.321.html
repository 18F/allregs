A DOE EA shall serve the purposes identified in 40 CFR 1508.9(a), which include providing sufficient evidence and analysis for determining whether to prepare an EIS or to issue a FONSI. If appropriate, a DOE EA shall also include any floodplain/wetlands assessment prepared under 10 CFR part 1022 and may include analyses needed for other environmental determinations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Content. A DOE EA shall comply with the requirements found at 40 CFR 1508.9.
