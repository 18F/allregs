                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, or Sec.  512.29, Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess interest,  penalties, and administrative costs on debts owed to the United States  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717. Before assessing these charges, Broadcasting  Board of Governors will mail or hand deliver a written notice to the  debtor. This notice will include a statement of the Board's requirements  concerning Sec. Sec. 512.9 and 512.21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interest shall accrue from the date on which notice of the debt  is first mailed or hand-delivered to the debtor, using the most current  address available to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rate of interest assessed shall be the rate of the current  value of funds to the United States Treasury (i.e., the Treasury Tax and  Loan account rate), as prescribed and published by the Secretary of the  Treasury in the Federal Register and the Treasury Fiscal Requirements  Manual Bulletins annually or quarterly, in accordance with 31 U.S.C.  3717. The rate of interest as initially assessed shall remain fixed for  the duration of the indebtedness. However, in cases where the debtor has  defaulted on a repayment agreement and seeks a new agreement,  Broadcasting Board of Governors may set a new rate which reflects the  current value of funds to the Treasury at the time the agreement is  executed. Interest will not be assessed on interest, penalties, or  administrative costs required by this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess charges to cover  administrative costs incurred as a result of a delinquent debt.  Calculation of administrative costs shall be based upon actual costs  incurred. Administrative costs include costs incurred to obtain credit  reports in the case of employee debt or in using a private debt  collector in the case of non-employee debt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Broadcasting Board of Governors shall assess a penalty charge  not to exceed 6% per year on any portion of a debt that is delinquent  for more than 90 days. This charge need not be calculated until the 91st  day of delinquency, but shall accrue from the date that the debt became  delinquent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a debt is paid in partial or installment payments, amounts  received shall be applied first to the outstanding penalty and  administrative cost charges, second to accrued interest and third to  outstanding principal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Broadcasting Board of Governors will waive the collection of  interest on the debt or any portion of the debt that is paid within 30  days after the date on which interest began to accrue. Broadcasting  Board of Governors may extend this 30-day period, on a case-by-case  basis, if it reasonably determines such action is appropriate.  Broadcasting Board of Governors may also waive in whole or in part the  collection of interest, penalties, and administrative costs   assessed under this section per the criteria specified in part 103 of  the Federal Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 103) relating to the  compromise of claims or if the Board determines that collection of these  charges is not in the best interest of the United States. Waiver under  the first sentence of this paragraph is mandatory. Under the second and  third sentences, it may be exercised under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Waiver of interest pending consideration of a request for  reconsideration, administrative review, or waiver of the underlying debt  under a permissive statute, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waiver of interest where Broadcasting Board of Governors has  accepted an installment plan under Sec. 512.12, there is no indication  of fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor and the amount  of the interest is large enough, in relation to the size of the  installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay, that the debt  will never be repaid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and  related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which  collection must be suspended under Sec. 104.2(c)(1) of the Federal  Claims Collection Standards (4 CFR part 104).</p>
