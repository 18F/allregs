                            <p class="depth0">The importer of merchandise entered for warehouse is liable for the  payment of all unpaid duties not only as principal on the bond filed on  Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec.  113.62 of this chapter, but also by reason of his personal liability as  consignee. Under the conditions of the bond, the sureties on the bond  shall be held liable for the payment of duties and Customs charges not  paid by the principal on the bond, whether such duties and charges are  finally ascertained before the merchandise is withdrawn from Customs  custody or thereafter. Liability may be transferred in part along with  the right to withdraw the merchandise, in accordance with Subpart C of  this part.
