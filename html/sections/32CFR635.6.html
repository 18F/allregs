                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sex Offenders on US Army Installations. Garrison Commander's  responsibilities: Garrison Commanders will ensure that sex offenders, as  defined in paragraph (b) of this section that reside or are employed on  an Army Installation register with the installation PM/DES. This  includes service members, civilian employees, accompanying dependent  family members, and contractors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sex offender is defined as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person, including but not limited to a Service member,  Service member's family member, Civilian employee, Civilian employee's  family member, or contractor, who either is registered or required to  register as a sex offender by any law, regulation or policy of the  United States, the Department of Defense, the Army, a State, the  District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, America  Samoa, The Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands,  or a Federally recognized Indian tribe. This definition is not limited  to   persons convicted for felony sex offenses but includes all persons who  are registered or required to register as a sex offender regardless of  the classification of their offenses, including felonies, misdemeanors,  and offenses not classified as a felony or misdemeanor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The persons who are sex offenders as defined in paragraph (b)(1)  include those convicted by a foreign government of an offense equivalent  or closely analogous to a covered offense under the Uniform Code of  Military Justice as provided in AR 27-10, Military Justice (available at  http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r27--10.pdf), Chapter 24.'' See 42  U.S.C. 16911(5)(B) and U.S. Department of Justice, Office of the  Attorney General, The National Guidelines for Sex Offender Registration  and Notification, Final Guidelines, 73 FR 38030, 38050-1 (July 2, 2008)  for guidelines and standards. Contact the servicing Office of the Staff  Judge Advocate for assistance in interpreting or applying this  provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sex Offender Registration Requirements. Sex offenders, as  defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section must register with the  installation PMO/DES within three working days of first arriving on an  installation. Sex offenders must provide the installation PMO/DES with  evidence of the qualifying conviction. The PMO/DES will enter the  registering sex offender's conviction information on a Department of the  Army Form 3975 as an information entry into the Army's Centralized  Operations Police Suite (COPS) with the state the sex offender was  convicted, date of conviction, and results of conviction, to include  length of time required to register and any specific court ordered  restrictions. Registration with the PMO/DES does not relieve sex  offenders of their legal obligation to comply with applicable state and  local registration requirements for the state in which they reside,  work, or attend school (see, AR 190-47 (available at http:// www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r190--47.pdf), chapter 14 and AR 27-10  (available at http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/r27--10.pdf), chapter  24). Registration with the state is also required under the Sex Offender  Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), 42 U.S.C. 16901 et seq., and  implemented by AR 27-10 (Available at http://www.apd.army.mil/pdffiles/ r27--10.pdf), Military Justice, and DoDI 1325.7 (Available at http:// www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/132507p.pdf). In addition, upon  assignment, reassignment, or change of address, sex offenders will  inform the installation PM/DES within three working days. Failure to  comply with registration requirements is punishable under Federal or  State law and/or under the UCMJ. ``State'' in this paragraph includes  any jurisdiction listed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in which a  sex offender is required to register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Installation PMOs and DESs will maintain and update a monthly  roster of current sex offenders names and provide it to the Sexual  Assault Review Board; the Army Command PM and DES and the garrison  commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installation PMs and DESs will complete the following procedures  for all other sex offenders required to register on the installation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complete a DA Form 3975 as an information entry into COPS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complete ``Section III--Subject (1a-7)'' on the DA Form 3975 to  identify the sex offender. Ensure the sex offender produces either  evidence of the qualifying conviction or the sex offender registration  paperwork in order to complete ``Section VII--Narrative'' with the state  in which the sex offender was convicted, date of conviction, and results  of conviction, to include length of time required to register and any  specific court ordered restrictions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> DoD civilians, contractors, and family members that fail to  register at the installation PMO/DES are subject to a range of  administrative sanctions, including but not limited to a complete or  limited bar to the installation and removal from military housing.</p>
