                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> TSA authorization required. No foreign air carrier may use any  X-ray system within the United States to screen accessible property or  checked baggage, unless specifically authorized under its security  program. No foreign air carrier may use such a system in a manner  contrary to its security program. TSA authorizes foreign air carriers to  use X-ray systems for inspecting accessible property or checked baggage  under a security program if the foreign air carrier shows that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The system meets the standards for cabinet X-ray systems  primarily for the inspection of baggage issued by the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) and published in 21 CFR 1020.40;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A program for initial and recurrent training of operators of the  system is established, which includes training in radiation safety, the  efficient use of X-ray systems, and the identification of weapons,  explosives, and incendiaries; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The system meets the imaging requirements set forth in its  security program using the step wedge specified in American Society for  Testing Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993). This  standard is incorporated by reference in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annual radiation survey. No foreign air carrier may use any X- ray system unless, within the preceding 12 calendar months, a radiation  survey is conducted that shows that the system meets the applicable  performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Radiation survey after installation or moving. No foreign air  carrier may use any X-ray system after the system has been installed at  a screening point or after the system has been moved unless a radiation  survey is conducted which shows that the system meets the applicable  performance standards in 21 CFR 1020.40. A radiation survey is not  required for an X-ray system that is designed and constructed as a  mobile unit and the foreign air carrier shows that it can be moved  without altering its performance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Defect notice or modification order. No foreign air carrier may  use any X-ray system that is not in full compliance with any defect  notice or modification order issued for that system by the FDA, unless  the FDA has advised TSA that the defect or failure to comply does not  create a significant risk of injury, including genetic injury, to any  person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Signs and inspection of photographic equipment and film. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At  locations at which a foreign air carrier uses an X-ray system to inspect  accessible property the foreign air carrier must ensure that a sign is  posted in a conspicuous place at the screening checkpoint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At locations at which a foreign air carrier or TSA uses an X-ray  system to inspect checked baggage the foreign air carrier must ensure  that a sign is posted in a conspicuous place where the foreign air  carrier accepts checked baggage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The signs required under this paragraph must notify individuals  that such items are being inspected by an X-ray and advise them to  remove all X-ray, scientific, and high-speed film from accessible  property and checked baggage before inspection. This sign must also  advise individuals that they may request that an inspection be made of  their photographic equipment and film packages without exposure to an X- ray system. If the X-ray system exposes any accessible property or  checked baggage to more than one milliroentgen during the inspection,  the sign must advise individuals to remove film of all kinds from their  articles before inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If requested by individuals, their photographic equipment and  film packages must be inspected without exposure to an X-ray system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Radiation survey verification after installation or moving. Each  foreign air carrier must maintain at least one copy of the results of  the most recent radiation survey conducted under paragraph (b) or (c) of  this section and must make it available for inspection upon request by  TSA at each of the following locations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The foreign air carrier's principal business office; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The place where the X-ray system is in operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Incorporation by reference. The American Society for Testing and  Materials (ASTM) Standard F792-88 (Reapproved 1993), ``Standard Practice  for Design and Use of Ionizing Radiation Equipment for the Detection of  Items Prohibited in Controlled Access Areas,'' is approved for  incorporation by reference by the Director of the Federal Register  pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a) and 1 CFR part 51. ASTM Standard F792-88 may  be examined at the Department of Transportation (DOT) Docket, 400  Seventh Street SW, Room Plaza 401, Washington, DC 20590, or on DOT's  Docket Management System (DMS) web page at http://dms.dot.gov/search  (under docket number FAA-2001-8725).
