                            <p class="depth0">Applications for relief which, pursuant to this part, may be granted  by staff members under assigned authority, and proceedings on such  requests shall be governed by applicable rules in the same manner as if  no assignment had been made (see Sec. 385.5). In such proceedings, each  staff member may determine any procedural matters which may arise,  including, inter alia, service of documents on additional persons;  filing of otherwise unauthorized documents; waivers of procedural  requirements; requests for hearing; requests for additional information;  dismissal of applications upon the applicant's request, moot  applications, or incomplete or otherwise defective applications; and  extensions of time. Such determinations, except those which would  terminate the matter, shall be subject to review only in connection with  review of the staff member's decision on the merits. The dismissal of  incomplete or otherwise defective applications under authority set forth  in this part shall be without prejudice except where under otherwise  applicable law the time for making application has run out or where the  defect is not corrected within a reasonable time fixed by the staff  member. Under the authority assigned to the staff as set forth in this  part to approve, disapprove, grant, or deny, relief may be granted or  denied in part and grants may be made subject to lawful and reasonable  conditions. Moreover, where applicable, the authority to grant relief  also includes authority to renew or extend an existing authorization.  [Doc. T-1, 49 FR 50985, Dec. 31, 1984; Amdt. 1, 50 FR 7170, Feb. 21,  1985]</p>
