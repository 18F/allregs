                                Sec. 86.157-98  Refueling test procedures for liquefied petroleum
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Equipment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sampling and analytical system shall meet the  specifications in Sec. 86.107-98(a) through (i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The refueling equipment nozzle specifications shall meet the  requirements described in Sec. 80.32.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The refueling test procedure for  light-duty liquefied petroleum gas-fueled vehicles and trucks starts  with the preconditioning of the vehicle followed by a refueling  emissions measurement. The test is conducted by following paragraphs (c)  through (f) of this section in order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ambient temperature levels encountered by the test vehicle  throughout the test sequence shall not be less than 68 F (20 C) nor  more than 86 F (30 C).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The vehicle shall be approximately level during all phases of  the test sequence to prevent abnormal fuel distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vehicle preconditioning. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The vehicle fuel tanks are to be  filled with fuel that meets the specifications in Sec. 86.113. Fuel  tanks shall be filled to 10 percent of nominal fuel tank capacity,  determined to the nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section for  a minimum of one hour and a maximum of six hours.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Measurement procedure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The steps prior to the actual  refueling event described in Sec. 86.154-98(b) through (e)(5) shall be  performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.  The dispensing rate must be typical of in-use dispensing rates for  liquefied petroleum gas into light-duty vehicles and trucks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fuel flow shall continue until the amount of fuel dispensed  is at least 85 percent of nominal fuel tank capacity, determined to the  nearest one-tenth of a U.S. gallon (0.38 liter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Following the fuel shut-off the fixed liquid level gauge or  other gauges or valves, if open, shall be closed and the nozzle  disconnected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The final reading of the evaporative enclosure FID (or HFID)  analyzer shall be taken 60 [5 seconds following the disconnect of the  refueling nozzle. This is the final hydrocarbon concentration,  CHCf, required in Sec. 86.143. The elapsed time, in minutes,  between the initial and final FID (or HFID) readings shall be recorded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For vehicles equipped with more than one fuel tank, the  procedures described in this section shall be performed for each fuel  tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Records required. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test: test number, system or device tested  (brief description), date and time of day, instrument operated,  operator, enclosure barometric pressure and temperature, recorder charts  (identify zero, span, and enclosure gas traces), fuel dispensing rate(s)  and dispensed fuel volume.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vehicle: ID number, manufacturer, model year, engine family,  evaporative/refueling emission family, fuel tank(s) capacity, basic fuel  system description and odometer reading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All pertinent instrument information including nozzle and fuel  delivery system description. As an alternative, a reference to a vehicle  test cell number may be used, with advance approval of the  Administrator, provided test cell calibration records show the pertinent  instrument information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All additional information necessary for the calculations  specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The calculation of the net hydrocarbon mass  change in the enclosure is used to determine refueling mass emissions.  The mass is calculated from initial and final hydrocarbon concentrations  in ppm carbon, initial and final enclosure ambient temperatures, initial  and final barometric pressures and net volume using the equations of  Sec. 86.143. For vehicles with multiple tanks, the results for each tank  shall be calculated and then summed to determine overall refueling  emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The final results for comparison with the refueling control  emission standard shall be computed by dividing the total refueling mass  emissions by the total gallons of fuel dispensed in the refueling test  (see paragraph (d)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The results of all emission tests shall be rounded, in  accordance with ASTM E 29-67 to the number of decimal places contained  in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional  significant figure. This procedure has been incorporated by reference  (see Sec. 86.1).  [59 FR 48511, Sept. 21, 1994]</p>
