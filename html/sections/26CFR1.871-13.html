                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States at the beginning of the taxable year but a nonresident alien at the end of the taxable year, or a nonresident alien at the beginning of the taxable year but a citizen or resident of the United States at the end of the taxable year, is taxable for such year as though his taxable year were comprised of two separate periods, one consisting of the time during which he is a citizen or resident of the United States and the other consisting of the time during which he is not a citizen or resident of the United States. Thus, for example, the income tax liability of an alien individual under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which he changes his residence will be computed under two different sets of rules, one relating to resident aliens for the period of residence and the other relating to nonresident aliens for the period of nonresidence. However, in determining the taxable income for such year which is subject to the graduated rate of tax imposed by section 1 or 1201 of the Code, all income for the period of U.S. citizenship or residence must be aggregated with the income for the period of nonresidence which is effectively connected for such year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. This section does not apply to alien individuals treated as residents for the entire taxable year under section 6013 (g) or (h). These individuals are taxed under the rules in Sec. 1.1-1(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States at the beginning of the taxable year but a nonresident alien at the end of the taxable year, or a nonresident alien at the beginning of the taxable year but a citizen or resident of the United States at the end of the taxable year, is taxable for such year as though his taxable year were comprised of two separate periods, one consisting of the time during which he is a citizen or resident of the United States and the other consisting of the time during which he is not a citizen or resident of the United States. Thus, for example, the income tax liability of an alien individual under chapter 1 of the Code for the taxable year in which he changes his residence will be computed under two different sets of rules, one relating to resident aliens for the period of residence and the other relating to nonresident aliens for the period of nonresidence.

This section does not apply to alien individuals treated as residents for the entire taxable year under section 6013 (g) or (h). These individuals are taxed under the rules in Sec. 1.1-1(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of this section, an individual is deemed to be a citizen or resident of the United States for the day on which he becomes a citizen or resident of the United States, a nonresident of the United States for the day on which he abandons his U.S. residence, and an alien for the day on which he gives up his U.S. citizenship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acquisition of U.S. citizenship or residence. Income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is not taxable if received by an alien individual while he is not a resident of the United States even though he becomes a citizen or resident of the United States after its receipt and before the close of the taxable year. However, income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is taxable if received by an individual while he is a citizen or resident of the United States, even though he earns the income earlier in the taxable year while he is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Abandonment of U.S. citizenship or residence. Income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is not taxable if received by an alien individual while he is not a resident of the United States, even though he earns the income earlier in the taxable year while he is a citizen or resident of the United States. However, income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct by the taxpayer of a trade or business in the United States is taxable if received by an individual while he is a citizen or resident of the United States, even though he abandons his U.S. citizenship or residence after its receipt and before the close of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules--(1) Method of accounting. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may not apply to an individual who for the taxable year uses an accrual method of accounting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method of accounting. Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section may not apply to an individual who for the taxable year uses an accrual method of accounting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Deductions for personal exemptions. An alien individual to whom this section applies is entitled to deduct one personal exemption for the taxable year under section 151. In addition, he is entitled to such additional exemptions as are allowed as a deduction under section 151 but only to the extent the amount of such additional exemptions do not exceed his taxable income (determined without regard to any deduction for personal exemptions) for the period in the taxable year during

which he is a citizen or resident of the United States. This subparagraph does not apply to the extent it is inconsistent with section 873, and the regulations thereunder, or with the provisions of an income tax convention to which the United States is a party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion of dividends received. In determining the $100 exclusion for the taxable year provided by section 116 in respect of certain dividends, only those dividends for the period during which the individual is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States may be taken into account as are effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. See Sec. 1.116-1(e)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Illustrations. The application of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. A, a married alien individual who uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, becomes a resident of the United States on June 1, 1971. During the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1971, inclusive, A receives $15,000 income from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. During the period of residence from June 1, 1971, to December 31, 1971, A receives wages of $10,000, dividends of $200 from a foreign corporation, and dividends of $75 from a domestic corporation qualifying under section 116(a). Of the amount of wages so received, $2,000 is for services performed by A outside the United States during the period of nonresidence. Total allowable deductions (other than for personal exemptions) amount to $700, none of which are deductible under section 62 in computing adjusted gross income. For 1971 A's spouse has no gross income and is not the dependent of another taxpayer. For 1971, A's taxable income is $8,200, all of which is subject to tax under section 1, as follows:
Wages.........................................................   $10,000Dividends from foreign corporation............................       200Dividends from domestic corporation ($75 less $75 exclusion)..         0</p><p class="depth2">----------Adjusted gross income.........................................    10,200Less deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Personal exemptions (2x$650).......................   $1,300</p><p class="depth2">Other allowable deductions.........................      700     2,000</p><p class="depth2">------------------Taxable income.......................................  .......     8,200</p><p class="depth2">=========</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that during the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to May 31, 1971, A receives from sources within the United States income of $1,850 which is effectively connected with the conduct by A of a business in the United States and $350 in dividends from domestic corporations qualifying under section 116(a). Only $50 of these dividends are effectively connected with the conduct by A of a business in the United States. The assumption is made that there are no allowable deductions connected with such effectively connected income. For 1971, A has taxable income of $10,075 subject to tax under section 1 and $300 income subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(A), as follows:
Wages.........................................................   $10,000Business income...............................................     1,850Dividends from foreign corporation............................       200Dividends from domestic corporation ($125 less $100 exclusion)        25</p><p class="depth2">----------Adjusted gross income.........................................    12,075Less deductions:</p><p class="depth2">Personal exemptions (2x$650).......................   $1,300</p><p class="depth2">Other allowable deductions.........................      700     2,000</p><p class="depth2">------------------Taxable income subject to tax under section 1.................    10,075</p><p class="depth2">==========Income subject to tax under section 871(a)(1)(A)..............       300</p><p class="depth2">==========</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. A, a married alien individual with three children, uses the calendar year as the taxable year and the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting. On October 1, 1971, A and his family become residents of the United States. During the period of nonresidence from January 1, 1971, to September 30, 1971, A receives income of $18,000 from sources without the United States which is not effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States and of $2,500 from sources within the United States which is effectively connected with the conduct of a business in the United States. It is assumed there are no allowable deductions connected with such effectively connected income. During the period of residence from October 1, 1971, to December 31, 1971, A receives wages of $2,000, of which $400 is for services performed outside the United States during the period of nonresidence. Total allowable deductions (other than for personal exemptions) amount to $250, none of which are deductible under section 62 in computing adjusted gross income. Neither the spouse nor any of the children has any gross income for 1971, and the spouse is not the dependent of another taxpayer for such year. For 1971, A's taxable income is $1,850, all of which is subject to tax under section 1, as follows:
Wages (residence period).............................   $2,000Less: Allowable deductions...........................      250</p><p class="depth2">---------Taxable income (without deduction for personal exemptions)        $1,750</p><p class="depth2">(residence period)...........................................Business income (nonresidence period).........................     2,500</p><p class="depth2">----------Total taxable income (without deduction for personal               4,250</p><p class="depth2">exemptions)..................................................</p><p class="depth2">Less deduction for personal exemptions:</p><p class="depth2">Taxpayer...........................................      650</p><p class="depth2">Wife and 3 children (4x$650, but not to exceed         1,750     2,400</p><p class="depth2">$1,750)...........................................</p><p class="depth2">------------------Taxable income.......................................  .......     1,850</p><p class="depth2">=========</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1966. There are no corresponding rules in this part for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967.
