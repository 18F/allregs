Exploration operations include, but are not limited to, geophysical  operations, drilling temperature gradient wells, drilling holes used for  explosive charges for seismic exploration, core drilling or any other  drilling method, provided the well is not used for geothermal resource  production. It also includes related construction of roads and trails,  and cross-country transit by vehicles over public land. Exploration  operations do not include the direct testing of geothermal resources or  the production or utilization of geothermal resources.</p><p class="depth0">Facility construction permit means BLM permission to build and test  a utilization facility.</p><p class="depth0">Facility operator means the person receiving BLM authorization to  site, construct, test, and/or operate a utilization facility.
