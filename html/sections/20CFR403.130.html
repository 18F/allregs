The considerations include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk of law violation or compromise of Government privilege. (1) Would providing the testimony violate a statute (such as 26 U.S.C. 6103 or section 1106 of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. 1306), Executive Order, or regulation (such as 20 CFR part 401)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Would providing the testimony put confidential, sensitive, or privileged information at risk?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Burden on SSA. (1) Would granting the application unduly expend for private purposes the resources of the United States (including the time of SSA employees needed for official duties)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Would the testimony be available in a less burdensome form or from another source?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Would the testimony be limited to the purpose of the request?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Did you previously request the same testimony in the same or a related proceeding?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interests served by allowing testimony. (1) Would providing the testimony serve SSA's interest?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Would providing the testimony maintain SSA's policy of impartiality among private litigants?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is another government agency involved in the proceeding?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Do you need the testimony to prevent fraud or similar misconduct?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Would providing the testimony be necessary to prevent a miscarriage of justice or to preserve the rights of an accused individual to due process in a criminal proceeding?</p>
