If a claimant approved for accelerated payment of drawback as of April 6, 1998 applies for accelerated payment under this section within such 1-year period, the claimant may continue to operate under its existing approval of accelerated payment until Customs approves or denies the application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limited successorship for approval of accelerated payment.

The approval of accelerated payment of drawback shall terminate at the end of such 1-year period unless the successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section. If such successor applies for accelerated payment of drawback under this section within such 1-year period, the successor may continue to operate under the predecessor's approval of accelerated payment until Customs approves or denies the successor's application for accelerated payment under this section, subject to the provisions in this section (see, in particular, paragraph (f) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for approval; contents.
