                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who has an interest in any property specified in  Sec. 356.1 and valued at $10,000 or less, or any person who has  incurred or is alleged to have incurred a forfeiture of any such  property, may file with the Deputy Administrator a petition for  remission or mitigation of forfeiture while the property is in the  custody of the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A petition filed with the Deputy Administrator need not be in  any particular form, but must contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the property:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The time, date, and place of seizure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Evidence of the petitioner's interest in the property such as  contracts, bills of sale, invoices, security interests, certificates of  title; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement of all facts and circumstances relied upon by the  petitioners to justify remission or mitigation of the forfeiture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The petition shall be signed by the petitioner or the  petitioner's attorney at law. If the petitioner is a business, the  petition must be signed by a partner, officer, or petitioner's attorney  at law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon receiving the petition, the Deputy Administrator shall  decide whether or not to grant relief. In making a decision, the Deputy  Administrator shall consider the information submitted by the  petitioner, as well as any other available information relating to the  matter, and may require that testimony be taken concerning the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Deputy Administrator finds that the forfeiture was  incurred without willful negligence or without any intention on the part  of the petitioner to violate the law or finds the existence of such  mitigating circumstances as to justify remission or mitigation of the  forfeiture or alleged forfeiture, the Deputy Administrator may remit or  mitigate the same upon terms and conditions as he deems reasonable and  just. However, remission or mitigation will not be made if such action  would frustrate the purposes of the Act or Convention. As an example,  this section does not allow remission or mitigation with respect to  terrestrial plants that are without documentation required under 50 CFR  chapter I.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner in writing  concerning whether the petition was granted or denied, and shall state  the   reasons therefor. If the petition is denied fully or in part, the  petitioner may then file a supplemental petition, but no supplemental  petition shall be considered unless it is received within 60 days from  the date of the Deputy Administrator's notification concerning the  original petition. The Deputy Administrator shall notify the petitioner  in writing concerning the action taken in response to the supplemental  petition, and shall state the reasons therefor.
