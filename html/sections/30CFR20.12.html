A lamp  will be approved under this part only when the testing engineers judge  that the lamp has met the requirements of this part and after MSHA's  records concerning the lamp are complete, including manufacturer's  drawings that show the lamp as it is to be made commercially. No verbal  reports of MSHA's decision concerning the investigation will be given,  and no informal approvals will be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As soon as the manufacturer has received the formal approval he  shall be free to advertise his lamp as permissible.
