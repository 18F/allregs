The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in Sec. 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in Sec. 178.345-3(c). Such restraining devices must be readily accessible for inspection and maintenance, except that insulation and jacketing are permitted to cover the restraining devices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A cargo tank designed and constructed so that it constitutes, in whole or in part, the structural member used in lieu of a frame must be supported in such a manner that the resulting stress levels in the cargo tank do not exceed those specified in Sec. 178.345-3(a). The design calculations of the support elements must include the stresses indicated in Sec. 178.345-3(b) and as generated by the loads described in Sec. 178.345-3(c).
