The permit granted by NSF shall constitute a joint CEMP/ACA Protected Site permit and any person holding such a permit must comply with the appropriate CEMP Protected Site Management Plan. In all other cases, an applicant seeking a permit to enter a CEMP Protected Site must apply to the Assistant Administrator for a CEMP permit in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility of CEMP permit holders and persons designated as agents under a CEMP permit.

The Seal Islands CEMP Protected Site includes the entire Seal Islands group, which is defined as Seal Island plus any land or rocks exposed at mean low tide within a distance of 5.5 km of the point of highest elevation on Seal Island. Seal Island is situated at 605914" S. lat., 552304" W. long.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cape Shirreff and the San Telmo Islands. This designation takes effect on May 1, 1995.

San Telmo Island is the largest of a small group of ice-free rock islets, approximately 2 km west of Cape Shirreff. The boundaries of the Cape Shirreff CEMP Protected Site are identical to the boundaries of the Site of Special Scientific Interest No. 32, as specified by ATCM Recommendation XV-7. No manmade boundary markers indicate the limits of the SSSI or protected site. The boundaries are defined by natural features and include the entire area of the Cape Shirreff peninsula north of the glacier ice tongue margin, and most of the San Telmo Island group. For the purposes of the protected site, the entire area of Cape Shirreff and the San Telmo Island group is defined as any land or rocks exposed at mean low tide within the area delimited by the map of SSSI No. 32 and available from the Assistant Administrator.
