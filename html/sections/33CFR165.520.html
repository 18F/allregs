                                Sec. 165.520  Regulated Navigation Area; Herbert C. Bonner Bridge,
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regulated area. The following area is a Regulated Navigation  Area (RNA): All navigable waters of Oregon Inlet, North Carolina within  100 yards under or surrounding any portion of the Herbert C. Bonner  Bridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Captain of the Port means the Captain of the Port (COTP) North  Carolina.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Captain of the Port Representative means any Coast Guard  commissioned, warrant, or petty officer who has been authorized by the  Captain of the Port North Carolina to act as a designated representative  of the COTP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Official patrol vessel means any Coast Guard, Coast Guard  Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessel(s) assigned and  authorized by COTP North Carolina.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Regulations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The general regulations governing Regulated  Navigation Areas found in 33 CFR 165.10, 165.11, and 165.13, including  the Regulated Navigation Area described in paragraph (a) of this section  and the following regulations, apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of vessels of certain characteristics in this RNA will  be prohibited by the Captain of the Port (COTP) or designated  representative in order to safeguard people and vessels from the hazards  associated with shoaling and the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge from the  potential catastrophic structural damage that could occur from a vessel  bridge strike. The COTP or designated representative will evaluate local  marine environmental conditions prior to issuing restrictions regarding  vessel navigation. Factors that will be considered include, but are not  limited to: Hydrographic survey data, vessel characteristics such as  displacement, tonnage, length and draft, current weather conditions  including visibility, wind, sea state, and tidal currents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Coast Guard will notify the public of restrictions via Local  Notice to Mariners, Broadcast Notice to Mariners, and via other methods  described in 33 CFR 165.7. Additionally, Coast Guard personnel may be  on-scene to advise the public of enforcement of any restrictions on  vessel navigation within the RNA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In accordance with the general regulations, entry into,  anchoring, or movement within the RNA, during periods of enforcement, is  prohibited unless authorized by the Captain of the Port (COTP) or the  COTP's on-scene designated representative. The ``on-scene designated  representative'' of the COTP is any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or  petty officer who has been designated by the COTP to act on the COTP's  behalf. The on-scene representative may be on a Coast Guard vessel;  State agency vessel, or other designated craft; or may be on shore and  will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM marine band radio or  loudhailer. Members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary may be present to  assist COTP representatives with notification of vessel operators  regarding the contents of this regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any deviation from paragraph (c)(4) of this section due to  extreme circumstances must be authorized by the Coast Guard District  Commander, the Captain of the Port (COTP) or the   COTP's designated representative. Vessels granted permission to transit  the RNA must do so in accordance with the directions provided by the  COTP or COTP representative to that vessel. To request permission to  transit the regulated navigation area, the COTP or COTP representative  can be contacted at Coast Guard Sector North Carolina, telephone number  (910) 343-3880, or on VHF-FM marine band radio channel 13 (165.65MHz) or  channel 16 (156.8 MHz). During periods of enforcement, all persons and  vessels given permission to enter or transit within the RNA must comply  with the instructions of the COTP or designated representative. Upon  being hailed by an official patrol vessel by siren, radio, flashing- light, or other means, the operator of a vessel must proceed as  directed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement. The Coast Guard may be assisted in the patrol and  enforcement of the Regulated Navigation Area by other Federal, State,  and local agencies. The COTP may impose additional requirements within  the RNA due to unforeseen changes to shoaling of Oregon Inlet or  structural integrity of the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notification. The Coast Guard will rely on the methods described  in 33 CFR 165.7 to notify the public of the date, time and duration of  any closure of the RNA. Violations of this RNA may be reported to the  COTP at (910) 343-3880 or on VHF-FM channel 16.  [USCG-2014-0987, 79 FR 75054, Dec. 17, 2014]</p>
