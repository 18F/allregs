                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> System License. Applicants authorized to construct and launch a system of technically identical non-geostationary satellite orbit satellites will be awarded a single ``blanket'' license covering a specified number of space stations to operate in a specified number of orbital planes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In addition to providing the information specified in Sec. 25.114, each non-geostationary satellite orbit applicant shall demonstrate the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the proposed system is capable of providing Fixed-Satellite Service to all locations as far north as 70[deg] North Latitude and as far south as 55[deg] South Latitude for at least 75% of every 24-hour period; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the proposed system is capable of providing Fixed-Satellite Service on a continuous basis throughout the fifty states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Prohibition of certain agreements. No license shall be granted to any applicant for a space station in the Fixed-Satellite Service operating in the 20/30 GHz band if that applicant, or any persons or companies controlling or controlled by the applicant, shall acquire or enjoy any right, for the purpose of handling traffic to or from the United States, its territories or possession, to construct or operate space segment or earth stations, or to interchange traffic, which is denied to any other United States company by reason of any concession, contract, understanding, or working arrangement to which the Licensee or any persons or companies controlling or controlled by the Licensee are parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Licensees shall submit to the Commission a yearly report indicating the number of earth stations actually brought into service under its blanket licensing authority. The annual report is due to the Commission no later than the first day of April of each year and shall indicate the deployment figures for the preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Protection from interference from terrestrial operation in the 18.3 to 19.3 GHz band. Fixed-Satellite Service operators are entitled to protection from harmful interference from terrestrial stations operating in this frequency band. See Sec. Sec. 21.901(e), 74.502(c), 74.602(g), 78.18(a)(4), and 101.147(r) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Replacement of Space Stations within the System License Term. Licensees of NGSO FSS systems in the 18.8-19.3 GHz and 28.6-29.1 GHz frequency bands authorized through a blanket license pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section need not file separate applications to launch and operate technically identical replacement satellites within the term of the system authorization. However, the licensee shall certify to the Commission, at least thirty days prior to launch of such replacement(s) that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The licensee intends to launch a space station into the previously-authorized orbit that is technically identical to those authorized in its system authorization and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Launch of this space station will not cause the license to exceed the total number of operating space stations authorized by the Commission.
