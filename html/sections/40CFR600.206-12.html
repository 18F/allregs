                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">configurations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> and (b) and as approved in Sec. 600.008 (c), are used to determine  FTP-based city, HFET-based highway, and combined FTP/Highway-based fuel  economy, CO2 emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission  values for each vehicle configuration for which data are available. Note  that fuel economy for some alternative fuel vehicles may mean miles per  gasoline gallon equivalent and/or miles per unit of fuel consumed. For  example, electric vehicles will determine miles per kilowatt-hour in  addition to miles per gasoline gallon equivalent, and fuel cell vehicles  will determine miles per kilogram of hydrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If only one set of FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel  economy values is accepted for a vehicle configuration, these values,  rounded to the nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, comprise the city and  highway fuel economy values for that configuration. If only one set of  FTP-based city and HFET-based highway CO2 emissions and  carbon-related exhaust emission values is accepted for a vehicle  configuration, these values, rounded to the nearest gram per mile,  comprise the city and highway CO2 emissions and carbon- related exhaust emission values for that configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If more than one set of FTP-based city and HFET-based highway  fuel economy and/or carbon-related exhaust emission values are accepted  for a vehicle configuration:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All data shall be grouped according to the subconfiguration for  which the data were generated using sales projections supplied in  accordance with Sec. 600.208-12(a)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Within each group of data, all fuel economy values are  harmonically averaged and rounded to the nearest 0.0001 of a mile per  gallon and all CO2 emissions and carbon-related exhaust  emission values are arithmetically averaged and rounded to the nearest  tenth of a gram per mile in order to determine FTP-based city and HFET- based highway fuel economy, CO2 emissions, and carbon-related  exhaust emission values for each subconfiguration at which the vehicle  configuration was tested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All FTP-based city fuel economy, CO2 emissions, and  carbon-related exhaust emission values and all HFET-based highway fuel  economy and carbon-related exhaust emission values calculated in  paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section are (separately for city and  highway) averaged in proportion to the sales fraction (rounded to the  nearest 0.0001) within the vehicle configuration (as provided to the  Administrator by the manufacturer) of vehicles of each tested  subconfiguration. Fuel economy values shall be harmonically averaged,  and CO2 emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values  shall be arithmetically averaged. The resultant   fuel economy values, rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon, are  the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway fuel economy values for the  vehicle configuration. The resultant CO2 emissions and  carbon-related exhaust emission values, rounded to the nearest tenth of  a gram per mile, are the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway  CO2 emissions and carbon-related exhaust emission values for  the vehicle configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the purpose of determining average fuel economy under  Sec. 600.510, the combined fuel economy value for a vehicle  configuration is calculated by harmonically averaging the FTP-based city  and HFET-based highway fuel economy values, as determined in paragraph  (a)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and  rounded to the nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon. A sample of this  calculation appears in Appendix II of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of determining average carbon-related exhaust  emissions under Sec. 600.510, the combined carbon-related exhaust  emission value for a vehicle configuration is calculated by  arithmetically averaging the FTP-based city and HFET-based highway  carbon-related exhaust emission values, as determined in paragraph  (a)(1) or (2) of this section, weighted 0.55 and 0.45 respectively, and  rounded to the nearest tenth of gram per mile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For alcohol dual fuel automobiles and natural gas dual fuel  automobiles the procedures of paragraphs (a)(1) or (2) of this section,  as applicable, shall be used to calculate two separate sets of FTP-based  city, HFET-based highway, and combined values for fuel economy,  CO2 emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emissions for each  configuration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy,  CO2 emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values  from the tests performed using gasoline or diesel test fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Calculate the city, highway, and combined fuel economy,  CO2 emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values  from the tests performed using alcohol or natural gas test fuel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If only one equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value exists  for an electric vehicle configuration, that value, rounded to the  nearest tenth of a mile per gallon, will comprise the petroleum-based  fuel economy for that configuration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If more than one equivalent petroleum-based fuel economy value  exists for an electric vehicle configuration, all values for that  vehicle configuration are harmonically averaged and rounded to the  nearest 0.0001 mile per gallon for that configuration.
