                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For releases of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or  contaminant, the following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During all phases of response, the lead agency shall complete  and maintain documentation to support all actions taken under the NCP  and to form the basis for cost recovery. In general, documentation shall  be sufficient to provide the source and circumstances of the release,  the identity of responsible parties, the response action taken, accurate  accounting of federal, state, or private party costs incurred for  response actions, and impacts and potential impacts to the public health  and welfare and the environment. Where applicable, documentation shall  state when the NRC received notification of a release of a reportable  quantity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information and reports obtained by the lead agency for  Fund-financed response actions shall, as appropriate, be transmitted to  the chair of the RRT. Copies can then be forwarded to the NRT, members  of the RRT, and others as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The lead agency shall make available to the trustees of affected  natural resources information and documentation that can assist the  trustees in the determination of actual or potential natural resource  injuries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For discharges of oil, documentation and cost recovery  provisions are described in Sec. 300.315.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Response actions undertaken by the participating agencies shall  be carried out under existing programs and authorities when available.  Federal agencies are to make resources available, expend funds, or  participate in response to discharges and releases under their existing  authority. Interagency agreements may be signed when necessary to ensure  that the federal resources will be available for a timely response to a  discharge or release. The ultimate decision as to the appropriateness of  expending funds rests with the agency that is held accountable for such  expenditures. Further funding provisions for discharges of oil are  described in Sec. 300.335.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator of EPA and the Administrator of the Agency for  Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) shall assure that the  costs of health assessment or health effect studies conducted under the  authority of CERCLA section 104(i) are documented in accordance with  standard EPA procedures for cost recovery. Documentation shall include  information on the nature of the hazardous substances addressed by the  research, information concerning the locations where these substances  have been found, and any available information on response actions taken  concerning these substances at the location.</p>
