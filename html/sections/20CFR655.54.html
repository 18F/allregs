                            <p class="depth0">The CO may issue a partial certification, reducing either the period of need or the number of H-2B workers or both for certification, based upon information the CO receives during the course of processing the Application for Temporary Employment Certification. The number of workers certified will be reduced by one for each referred U.S. worker who is qualified and who will be available at the time and place needed to perform the services or labor and who has not been rejected for lawful job-related reasons. If a partial labor certification is issued, the CO will amend the Application for Temporary Employment Certification and then return it to the employer with a Final Determination letter, with a copy to the employer's attorney or agent, if applicable. The Final Determination letter will:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State the reason(s) why either the period of need and/or the number of H-2B workers requested has been reduced, citing the relevant regulatory standards and/or special procedures;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If applicable, address the availability of U.S. workers in the occupation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offer the employer an opportunity to request administrative review of the partial certification under Sec. 655.61; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State that if the employer does not request administrative review in accordance with Sec. 655.61, the partial certification is final and the Department will not accept any appeal on that Application for Temporary Employment Certification.
