                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must establish control device parameters that indicate proper operation of the control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must install, operate, and maintain a continuous parameter monitoring system as specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The continuous parameter monitoring system must complete a minimum of one cycle of operation for each successive 15-minute period. You must have a minimum of four successive cycles of operation to have a valid hour of data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must have valid data from at least 90 percent of the hours during which the process operated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must determine the average of all recorded readings for each successive 3-hour period of the emission capture system and add-on control device operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must maintain the continuous parameter monitoring system at all times and have available necessary parts for routine repairs of the monitoring equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must operate the continuous parameter monitoring system and collect emission capture system and add-on control device parameter data at all times that a controlled open molding operation is being performed, except during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, and required quality assurance or control activities (including, if applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must not use emission capture system or add-on control device parameter data recorded during monitoring malfunctions, associated repairs, out-of-control periods, or required quality assurance or control activities when calculating data averages. You must use all the data collected during all other periods in calculating the data averages for determining compliance with the emission capture system and add-on control device operating limits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> You must record the results of each inspection, calibration, and validation check.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any period for which the monitoring system is out-of-control, as defined in Sec. 63.7(d)(7), or malfunctioning, and data are not available for required calculations is a deviation from the monitoring requirements. A monitoring malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the continuous parameter monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Enclosure bypass line. You must meet the requirements of paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section for each emission capture system enclosure that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism controlling the bypass line in a nondiverting position in such a way that the valve or closure mechanism cannot be opened without creating a record that the valve was opened. The method used to monitor or secure the valve or closure mechanism must meet one of the requirements specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Flow control position indicator. Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications a flow control position indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes and provides a record indicating whether the emissions are directed to the add-on control device or diverted from the add-on control device. The time of occurrence and flow control position must be recorded, as

well as every time the flow direction is changed. The flow control position indicator must be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert the emissions away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Car-seal or lock-and-key valve closures. Secure any bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. You must visually inspect the seal or closure mechanism at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position, and the emissions are not diverted away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Valve closure continuous monitoring. Ensure that any bypass line valve is in the closed (non-diverting) position through monitoring of valve position at least once every 15 minutes. You must inspect the monitoring system at least once every month to verify that the monitor will indicate valve position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Automatic shutdown system. Use an automatic shutdown system in which the open molding operation is stopped when flow is diverted by the bypass line away from the add-on control device to the atmosphere when the open molding operation is running. You must inspect the automatic shutdown system at least once every month to verify that it will detect diversions of flow and shut down the open molding operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any bypass line is opened, you must include a description of why the bypass line was opened and the length of time it remained open in the semiannual compliance reports required in Sec. 63.5764(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Thermal oxidizers. If you are using a thermal oxidizer or incinerator as an add-on control device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (d)(1) through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install a combustion temperature monitoring device in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or incinerator, or in the duct immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs. You must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (d)(1)(i) through (vii) of this section for each temperature monitoring device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the temperature sensor in a position that provides a representative temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use a temperature sensor with a minimum tolerance of 2.2 [deg]C or 0.75 percent of the temperature value, whichever is larger.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Shield the temperature sensor system from electromagnetic interference and chemical contaminants.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a chart recorder is used, it must have a sensitivity in the minor division of at least 10 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Perform an electronic calibration at least semiannually according to the procedures in the manufacturer's owners manual. Following the electronic calibration, you must conduct a temperature sensor validation check in which a second or redundant temperature sensor placed nearby the process temperature sensor must yield a reading within 16.7 [deg]C of the process temperature sensor's reading.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct calibration and validation checks any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating temperature range or install a new temperature sensor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity and all electrical connections for continuity, oxidation, and galvanic corrosion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before or during the performance test, you must conduct a performance evaluation of the combustion temperature monitoring system according to Sec. 63.8(e). Section 63.8(e) specifies the general requirements for continuous monitoring systems and requirements for notifications, the site-specific performance evaluation plan, conduct of the performance evaluation, and reporting of performance evaluation results.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the performance test required by Sec. 63.5716, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature and determine the average combustion temperature for the three 1-hour test runs. This average temperature is the minimum operating limit for the thermal oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Following the performance test, you must continuously monitor the combustion temperature and record the average combustion temperature no less frequently than every 15 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You must operate the incinerator or thermal oxidizer so that the average combustion temperature in any 3-hour period does not fall below the average combustion temperature recorded during the performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the average combustion temperature in any 3-hour period falls below the average combustion temperature recorded during the performance test, or if you fail to collect the minimum data specified in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, it is a deviation for the operating limit in Sec. 63.5715.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other control devices. If you are using a control device other a thermal oxidizer, then you must comply with alternative monitoring requirements and operating limits approved by the Administrator under Sec. 63.8(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emission capture system. For each enclosure in the emission capture system, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (f)(1) through (5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must install a device to measure and record either the flow rate or the static pressure in the duct from each enclosure to the add-on control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must install a device to measure and record the pressure drop across at least one opening in each enclosure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each flow measurement device must meet the requirements in paragraphs (b) and (f)(3)(i) through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate the flow sensor in a position that provides a representative flow measurement in the duct between each enclosure in the emission capture system and the add-on control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reduce swirling flow or abnormal velocity distributions due to upstream and downstream disturbances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct a flow sensor calibration check at least semiannually.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each pressure measurement device, you must comply with the requirements in paragraphs (a) and (f)(4)(i) through (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate each pressure drop sensor in or as close to a position that provides a representative measurement of the pressure drop across each enclosure opening you are monitoring.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Locate each duct static pressure sensor in a position that provides a representative measurement of the static pressure in the duct between the enclosure and control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Minimize or eliminate pulsating pressure, vibration, and internal and external corrosion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Check the pressure tap for plugging daily.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Use an inclined manometer with a measurement sensitivity of 0.0004 millimeters mercury (mmHg) to check gauge calibration quarterly and transducer calibration monthly.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct calibration checks any time the sensor exceeds the manufacturer's specified maximum operating pressure range or install a new pressure sensor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> At least monthly, inspect all components for integrity, all electrical connections for continuity, and all mechanical connections for leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For each capture device that is not part of a permanent total enclosure as defined in Method 204 in appendix M to 40 CFR part 51, you must establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (f)(5)(i) and (ii) of this section. You must also establish an operating limit for pressure drop across at least one opening in each enclosure according to paragraphs (f)(5)(iii) and (iv) of this section. The operating limits for a permanent total enclosure are specified in Table 4 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the emission test required by Sec. 63.5716 and described in Sec. 63.5719, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate enclosure in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the enclosure and the add-on control device inlet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Following the emission test, calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each enclosure. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific enclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> During the emission test required by Sec. 63.5716 and described in Sec. 63.5719, you must monitor and record the pressure drop across the opening of each enclosure in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Following the emission test, calculate and record the average pressure drop for the three test runs for each enclosure. This average pressure drop is the minimum operating limit for that specific enclosure.</p><p class="depth4">Standards for Closed Molding Resin Operations</p>
