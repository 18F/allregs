                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> United States (U.S.) means the states, territories and possessions of the United States; the District of Columbia, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Residing in the U.S. means that an individual's principal, actual dwelling place is in the U.S. and that the individual meets the residency requirements of paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Citizen of the U.S. means any individual who acquires U.S. citizenship through birth in the territorial U.S., birth abroad as provided under title 8, United States Code, or through naturalization, and has not renounced his or her U.S. citizenship, or had such citizenship cancelled, revoked, or otherwise terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Lawfully admitted for permanent residence means that an individual has been lawfully accorded the privilege of residing permanently in the U.S. as an immigrant by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services under title 8, United States Code, and still has this status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility requirements. Compensation and dependency and indemnity compensation is payable at the full-dollar rate, based on service described in Sec.  3.40(b), (c), or (d), to a veteran or a veteran's survivor who is residing in the U.S. and is either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A citizen of the U.S., or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Evidence of eligibility. (1) A valid original or copy of one of the following documents is required to prove that the veteran or the veteran's survivor is a natural born citizen of the U.S.:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A valid U.S. passport;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A birth certificate showing that he or she was born in the U.S.; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A Report of Birth Abroad of a Citizen of the U.S. issued by a U.S. consulate abroad.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is a naturalized citizen of the U.S., or a valid U.S. passport, will be sufficient proof of such status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Only verification by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services to VA that a veteran or a veteran's survivor is an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the U.S. will be sufficient proof of such status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> VA will not pay benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section unless the evidence establishes that the veteran or survivor is lawfully residing in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such evidence should identify the veteran's or survivor's name and relevant dates, and may include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A valid driver's license issued by the state of residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employment records, which may consist of pay stubs, W-2 forms, and certification of the filing of Federal, State, or local income tax returns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Residential leases, rent receipts, utility bills and receipts, or other relevant documents showing dates of utility service at a leased residence;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Hospital or medical records showing medical treatment or hospitalization, and showing the name of the medical facility or treating physician;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Property tax bills and receipts; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> School records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Post Office box mailing address in the veteran's name or the name of

the veteran's survivor does not constitute evidence showing that the veteran or veteran's survivor is lawfully residing in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Continued eligibility. (1) In order to continue receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section, a veteran or a veteran's survivor must be physically present in the U.S. for at least 183 days of each calendar year in which he or she receives payments at the full-dollar rate, and may not be absent from the U.S. for more than 60 consecutive days at a time unless good cause is shown. However, if a veteran or a veteran's survivor becomes eligible for full-dollar rate benefits for the first time on or after July 1 of any calendar year, the 183-day rule will not apply during that calendar year. VA will not consider a veteran or a veteran's survivor to have been absent from the U.S. if he or she left and returned to the U.S. on the same date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A veteran or a veteran's survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must notify VA within 30 days of leaving the U.S., or within 30 days of losing either his or her U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status. When a veteran or a veteran's survivor no longer meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, VA will reduce his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under the law, effective on the date determined under Sec.  3.505. If such veteran or survivor regains his or her U.S. citizenship or lawful permanent resident alien status, VA will restore full-dollar rate benefits, effective the date the veteran or survivor meets the eligibility requirements in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When requested to do so by VA, a veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must verify that he or she continues to meet the residency and citizenship or permanent resident alien status requirements of paragraph (b) of this section. VA will advise the veteran or survivor at the time of the request that the verification must be furnished within 60 days and that failure to do so will result in the reduction of benefits. If the veteran or survivor fails to furnish the evidence within 60 days, VA will reduce his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized, as provided in Sec.  3.652.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate under this section must promptly notify VA of any change in his or her address. If mail from VA to the veteran or survivor is returned to VA by the U.S. Postal Service, VA will make reasonable efforts to determine the correct mailing address. If VA is unable to determine the correct mailing address through reasonable efforts, VA will reduce benefit payments to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under law, effective on the date determined under Sec.  3.505.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date for restored eligibility. In the case of a veteran or survivor receiving benefits at the full-dollar rate, if VA reduces his or her payment to the rate of $0.50 for each dollar authorized under the law, VA will resume payments at the full-dollar rate, if otherwise in order, effective the first day of the month following the date on which he or she again meets the requirements. However, such increased payments will be retroactive no more than one year prior to the date on which VA receives evidence that he or she again meets the requirements.
