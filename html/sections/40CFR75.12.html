                                Sec. 75.12  Specific provisions for monitoring NOX emission rate.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coal-fired units, gas-fired nonpeaking units or oil-fired nonpeaking units. The owner or operator shall meet the general operating requirements in Sec. 75.10 of this part for a NOX continuous emission monitoring system (CEMS) for each affected coal-fired unit, gas-fired nonpeaking unit, or oil-fired nonpeaking unit, except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, Sec. 75.17, and subpart E of this part. The diluent gas monitor in the NOX-diluent CEMS may measure either O2 or CO2 concentration in the flue gases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Moisture correction. If a correction for the stack gas moisture content is needed to properly calculate the NOX emission rate in lb/mmBtu, e.g., if the NOX pollutant concentration monitor measures on a different moisture basis from the diluent monitor, the owner or operator shall either report a fuel-specific default moisture value for each unit operating hour, as provided in Sec. 75.11(b)(1), or shall install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous moisture monitoring system, as defined in Sec. 75.11(b)(2). Notwithstanding this requirement, if Equation 19-3, 19-4 or 19-8 in Method 19 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is used to measure NOX emission rate, the following

fuel-specific default moisture percentages shall be used in lieu of the default values specified in Sec. 75.11(b)(1): 5.0%, for anthracite coal; 8.0% for bituminous coal; 12.0% for sub-bituminous coal; 13.0% for lignite coal; 15.0% for wood and 18.0% for natural gas (boilers, only).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of NOX emission rate. The owner or operator shall calculate hourly, quarterly, and annual NOX emission rates (in lb/mmBtu) by combining the NOX concentration (in ppm), diluent concentration (in percent O2 or CO2), and percent moisture (if applicable) measurements according to the procedures in appendix F to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gas-fired peaking units or oil-fired peaking units. The owner or operator of an affected unit that qualifies as a gas-fired peaking unit or oil-fired peaking unit, as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter, based on information submitted by the designated representative in the monitoring plan shall comply with one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the general operating requirements in Sec. 75.10 for a NOX continuous emission monitoring system; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide information satisfactory to the Administrator using the procedure specified in appendix E of this part for estimating hourly NOX emission rate. However, if in the years after certification of an excepted monitoring system under appendix E of this part, a unit's operations exceed a capacity factor of 20 percent in any calendar year or exceed a capacity factor of 10.0 percent averaged over three years, the owner or operator shall install, certify, and operate a NOX-diluent continuous emission monitoring system no later than December 31 of the following calendar year. If the required CEMS has not been installed and certified by that date, the owner or operator shall report the maximum potential NOX emission rate (MER) (as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter) for each unit operating hour, starting with the first unit operating hour after the deadline and continuing until the CEMS has been provisionally certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Low mass emissions units. Notwithstanding the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (d) of this section, the owner or operator of an affected unit that qualifies as a low mass emissions unit under Sec. 75.19(a) and (b) shall comply with one of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the general operating requirements in Sec. 75.10 for a NOX continuous emission monitoring system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet the requirements specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section for using the excepted monitoring procedures in appendix E to this part, if applicable; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use the low mass emissions excepted methodology in Sec. 75.19(c) for estimating hourly NOX emission rate and hourly NOX mass emissions, if applicable under Sec. 75.19(a) and (b). If this option is selected for NOX, the LME methodology must also be used for SO2 and CO2 when these parameters are required to be monitored by applicable program(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other units. The owner or operator of an affected unit that combusts wood, refuse, or other material in addition to oil or gas shall comply with the monitoring provisions specified in paragraph (a) of this section.
