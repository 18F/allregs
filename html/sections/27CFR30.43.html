                            <p class="depth0">When the quantity of spirits (including denatured spirits when gauged by weight) in packages, such as barrels, drums, and similar portable containers, is to be determined by gauge of the individual packages, such quantity shall, except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, be determined by weighing each package on an accurate weighing beam or platform scale having a beam or dial showing weight in pounds and half pounds, where packages having a capacity in excess of 10 wine gallons are to be gauged, or in pounds and ounces, or pounds and hundredths of a pound, where packages designed to hold 10 wine gallons or less are to be gauged. In either case the tare must be determined and subtracted from the gross weight to obtain the net weight. From the proof and weight ascertained, the quantity of the spirits in proof gallons shall be determined by reference to Table 2, 3, or 4. However, if the spirits contain solids in excess of 600 milligrams per 100 milliliters, the proof gallons shall be determined as prescribed

for such spirits in Sec. 30.41. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section or of Sec. 30.44, (a) gross weights and tares of packages being filled need not be taken in any case where the gauge of the spirits is not derived from such weights under the gauging procedure being utilized, and (b) meters, other devices, or other methods may be used for determining the quantity of spirits in individual packages, when such meter is used as provided in 27 CFR Part 19, or, when such other device or method has been approved by the appropriate TTB officer.
