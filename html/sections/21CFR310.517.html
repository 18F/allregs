                                Sec. 310.517  Labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The University Group Diabetes Program clinical trial has  reported an association between the administration of tolbutamide and  increased cardiovascular mortality. The Food and Drug Administration has  concluded that this reported association provides adequate basis for a  warning in the labeling. In view of the similarities in chemical  structure and mode of action, the Food and Drug Administration also  believes it is prudent from a safety standpoint to consider that the  possible increased risk of cardiovascular mortality from tolbutamide  applies to all other sulfonylurea drugs as well. Therefore, the labeling  for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class shall include a  warning concerning the possible increased risk of cardiovascular  mortality associated with such use, as set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Labeling for oral hypoglycemic drugs of the sulfonylurea class  shall include in boldface type at the beginning of the ``Warnings''  section of the labeling the following statement:</p><p class="depth2">Special Warning on Increased Risk of Cardiovascular Mortality</p><p class="depth2">The administration of oral hypoglycemic drugs has been reported to  be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality as compared to  treatment with diet alone or diet plus insulin. This warning is based on  the study conducted by the University Group Diabetes Program (UGDP), a  long-term prospective clinical trial designed to evaluate the  effectiveness of glucose-lowering drugs in preventing or delaying  vascular complications in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes.  The study involved 823 patients who were randomly assigned to one of  four treatment groups (Diabetes, 19 (supp. 2): 747-830, 1970).</p><p class="depth2">UGDP reported that patients treated for 5 to 8 years with diet plus  a fixed dose of tolbutamide (1.5 grams per day) had a rate of  cardiovascular mortality approximately 2\1/2\ times that of patients  treated with diet alone. A significant increase in total mortality was  not observed, but the use of tolbutamide was discontinued based on the  increase in cardiovascular mortality, thus limiting the opportunity for  the study to show an increase in overall mortality. Despite controversy  regarding the interpretation of these results, the findings of the UGDP  study provide an adequate basis for this warning. The patient should be  informed of the potential risks and advantages of (name of drug) and of  alternative modes of therapy.</p><p class="depth2">Although only one drug in the sulfonylurea class (tolbutamide) was  included in this study, it is prudent from a safety standpoint to  consider that this warning may also apply to other oral hypoglycemic  drugs in this class, in view of their close similarities in mode of  action and chemical structure.
