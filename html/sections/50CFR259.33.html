                                Sec. 259.33  Constructive deposits and withdrawals; ratification of consent; first tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Periods controlling permissibility. For the purpose of this  Sec. 259.33, the period between the beginning and the end of a party's  tax year is designated ``Period (aa)''; the period between the end of a  party's tax year and the party's tax due date for that tax year is  designated ``Period (bb)''; the period between the party's tax due date  and the date on which ends the party's last extension (if any) of that  tax due date is designated ``Period (cc)''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Constructive deposits and withdrawals (before Interim CCF  Agreement effectiveness date). Constructive deposits and withdrawals  shall be permissible only during the Period (aa) during which a written  application for an interim CCF Agreement is submitted to the Secretary  and so much of the next succeeding Period (aa), if any, which occurs  before the Secretary executes the Interim CCF Agreement previously  applied for. All otherwise qualified expenditures of eligible ceilings  during Period (aa) may be consented to by the Secretary as constructive  deposits and withdrawals: Provided, The applicant's application for an  Interim CCF Agreement and for consent to constructive deposit and  withdrawal qualification (together with sufficient supporting data to  enable the Secretary's execution or issuance of consent) is submitted to  the Secretary either before the end of Period (bb) or, if extension was  requested and received, before the end of Period (cc). If, however, the  Secretary receives the completed application in proper form so close to  the latest permissible period that the Interim CCF Agreement cannot be  executed and/or the consent given before the end of Period (bb) or  Period (cc), whichever applies, then the burden is entirely upon the  applicant to negotiate with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for such  relief as may be available (e.g.,   filing an amended tax return, if appropriate). The Secretary will  nevertheless execute the Interim CCF Agreement and issue his consent  however long past the applicant's Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever  applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. Should IRS  relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall regard the  same as merely due to the applicant's having failed to apply in a more  timely fashion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Constructive deposits (after Interim CCF Agreement effectiveness  date). The Secretary shall not permit constructive deposits or  withdrawals after the effective date of an Interim CCF Agreement.  Eligible ceilings must, after the effective date of an interim CCF  Agreement, be physically deposited in money or kind in scheduled  depositories before the last date eligible ceilings for any Period (aa)  of any party become ineligible for deposit (the last date being Period  (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Ratification of withdrawals (as qualified) made without first  having obtained Secretary's consent. The Secretary may ratify as  qualified any withdrawal made without first having obtained the  Secretary's consent therefor, provided the withdrawal was such as would  have resulted in the Secretary's consent had it been requested before  withdrawal, and provided further that the party's request for consent  (together with sufficient supporting data to enable issuance of the  Secretary's consent) is submitted to the Secretary either before the end  of Period (bb) or, if extension was requested and received, before the  end of Period (cc).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, however, the Secretary receives the request in proper form  so close to the latest permissible period that the consent cannot be  given before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever  applies, then the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with  IRS for such relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax  return, if appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless issue his  consent however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc),  whichever applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires.  Should IRS relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall  regard the same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a  more timely fashion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their  best interest to request the Secretary's consent 45 days in advance of  the expected date of withdrawal. Withdrawals made without the  Secretary's consent, in reliance on obtaining the Secretary's consent,  are made purely at a party's own risk. Should any withdrawal made  without the Secretary's consent prove, for any reason, to be one to  which the Secretary will not or cannot consent by ratification, then the  result will be either, or both, at the Secretary's discretion, an  unqualified withdrawal or an involuntary termination of the Interim CCF  Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Should the withdrawal made without having first obtained the  Secretary's consent be made in pursuance of a project not then an  eligible Schedule B objective, then the Secretary may entertain an  application to amend the Interim CCF Agreement's Schedule B objectives  as the prerequisite to consenting by ratification to the withdrawal, all  under the same time constraints and conditions as otherwise specified  herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any withdrawals made, after the effective date of an Interim CCF  Agreement, without the Secretary's consent are automatically non- qualified withdrawals unless the Secretary subsequently consents to them  by ratification as otherwise specified herein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Redeposit of that portion of the ceiling withdrawn without the  Secretary's consent, and for which such consent is not subsequently  given (either by ratification or otherwise), shall not be permitted. If  such a non-qualified withdrawal adversely affects the Interim CCF  Agreement's general status in any wise deemed by the Secretary, at his  discretion, to be significant and material, the Secretary may  involuntarily terminate the Interim CCF Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> First tax year for which Interim CCF Agreement is effective. An  Agreement, to be effective for any party's Period (aa), must be executed  and entered into by the party, and submitted to the Secretary, before  the end of Period (bb) or   Period (cc), whichever applies, for such Period (aa). If executed and  entered into by the party, and/or received by the Secretary, after the  end of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, then the Agreement  will be first effective for the next succeeding Period (aa).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, however, the Secretary receives an Agreement executed and  entered into by the party in proper form so close to the latest  permissible period that the Secretary cannot execute the Agreement  before expiration of Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever applies, then  the burden is entirely upon the party to negotiate with IRS for such  relief as may be available (e.g., filing an amended tax return, if  appropriate). The Secretary will nevertheless execute the Agreement  however long past the party's Period (bb) or Period (cc), whichever  applies, the Secretary's administrative workload requires. Should IRS  relief be, for any reason, unavailable, the Secretary shall regard the  same as merely due to the party's having failed to apply in a more  timely manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All parties shall be counseled that it is manifestly in their  best interest to enter into and execute an Agreement, and submit the  same to the Secretary, at least 45 days in advance of the Period (bb) or  Period (cc), whichever applies, for the Period (aa) for which the  Agreement is first intended to be effective.</p>
