                            <p class="depth0">The following conditions apply to all NPDES permits. Additional  conditions applicable to NPDES permits are in Sec. 122.42. All  conditions applicable to NPDES permits shall be incorporated into the  permits either expressly or by reference. If incorporated by reference,  a specific citation to these regulations (or the corresponding approved  State regulations) must be given in the permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duty to comply. The permittee must comply with all conditions of  this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the  Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit  termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a  permit renewal application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The permittee shall comply with effluent standards or  prohibitions established under section 307(a) of the Clean Water Act for  toxic pollutants   and with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under  section 405(d) of the CWA within the time provided in the regulations  that establish these standards or prohibitions or standards for sewage  sludge use or disposal, even if the permit has not yet been modified to  incorporate the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Clean Water Act provides that any person who violates  section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit  condition or limitation implementing any such sections in a permit  issued under section 402, or any requirement imposed in a pretreatment  program approved under sections 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8) of the Act, is  subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000 per day for each  violation. The Clean Water Act provides that any person who negligently  violates sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of the Act, or  any condition or limitation implementing any of such sections in a  permit issued under section 402 of the Act, or any requirement imposed  in a pretreatment program approved under section 402(a)(3) or 402(b)(8)  of the Act, is subject to criminal penalties of $2,500 to $25,000 per  day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 1 year, or both. In  the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a negligent violation,  a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more than $50,000  per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 2 years, or  both. Any person who knowingly violates such sections, or such  conditions or limitations is subject to criminal penalties of $5,000 to  $50,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment for not more than 3 years,  or both. In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing  violation, a person shall be subject to criminal penalties of not more  than $100,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment of not more than 6  years, or both. Any person who knowingly violates section 301, 302, 303,  306, 307, 308, 318 or 405 of the Act, or any permit condition or  limitation implementing any of such sections in a permit issued under  section 402 of the Act, and who knows at that time that he thereby  places another person in imminent danger of death or serious bodily  injury, shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not more than  $250,000 or imprisonment of not more than 15 years, or both. In the case  of a second or subsequent conviction for a knowing endangerment  violation, a person shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500,000  or by imprisonment of not more than 30 years, or both. An organization,  as defined in section 309(c)(3)(B)(iii) of the CWA, shall, upon  conviction of violating the imminent danger provision, be subject to a  fine of not more than $1,000,000 and can be fined up to $2,000,000 for  second or subsequent convictions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any person may be assessed an administrative penalty by the  Administrator for violating section 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318 or 405  of this Act, or any permit condition or limitation implementing any of  such sections in a permit issued under section 402 of this Act.  Administrative penalties for Class I violations are not to exceed  $10,000 per violation, with the maximum amount of any Class I penalty  assessed not to exceed $25,000. Penalties for Class II violations are  not to exceed $10,000 per day for each day during which the violation  continues, with the maximum amount of any Class II penalty not to exceed  $125,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duty to reapply. If the permittee wishes to continue an activity  regulated by this permit after the expiration date of this permit, the  permittee must apply for and obtain a new permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a  defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been  necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain  compliance with the conditions of this permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duty to mitigate. The permittee shall take all reasonable steps  to minimize or prevent any discharge or sludge use or disposal in  violation of this permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely  affecting human health or the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Proper operation and maintenance. The permittee shall at all  times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of  treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or  used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions   of this permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate  laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This  provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or  similar systems which are installed by a permittee only when the  operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the  permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Permit actions. This permit may be modified, revoked and  reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the  permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or  termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated  noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Property rights. This permit does not convey any property rights  of any sort, or any exclusive privilege.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Duty to provide information. The permittee shall furnish to the  Director, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director  may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking  and reissuing, or terminating this permit or to determine compliance  with this permit. The permittee shall also furnish to the Director upon  request, copies of records required to be kept by this permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Inspection and entry. The permittee shall allow the Director, or  an authorized representative (including an authorized contractor acting  as a representative of the Administrator), upon presentation of  credentials and other documents as may be required by law, to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility  or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under  the conditions of this permit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that  must be kept under the conditions of this permit;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment (including  monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations regulated or  required under this permit; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of  assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water  Act, any substances or parameters at any location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Monitoring and records. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Samples and measurements taken for  the purpose of monitoring shall be representative of the monitored  activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for records of monitoring information required by this  permit related to the permittee's sewage sludge use and disposal  activities, which shall be retained for a period of at least five years  (or longer as required by 40 CFR part 503), the permittee shall retain  records of all monitoring information, including all calibration and  maintenance records and all original strip chart recordings for  continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required by  this permit, and records of all data used to complete the application  for this permit, for a period of at least 3 years from the date of the  sample, measurement, report or application. This period may be extended  by request of the Director at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records of monitoring information shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date(s) analyses were performed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The individual(s) who performed the analyses;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The analytical techniques or methods used; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The results of such analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures  approved under 40 CFR Part 136 unless another method is required under  40 CFR subchapters N or O.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Clean Water Act provides that any person who falsifies,  tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or  method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon  conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000, or by  imprisonment for not more than 2 years, or both. If a conviction of a  person is for a violation committed after a first conviction of such  person under this paragraph, punishment is a fine of not more than  $20,000 per day of violation, or by imprisonment of not more than 4  years, or both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Signatory requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All applications, reports, or  information submitted to the Director shall be signed and certified.  (See Sec. 122.22)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CWA provides that any person who knowingly makes any false  statement, representation, or certification in any record or other  document submitted or required to be maintained under this permit,  including monitoring reports or reports of compliance or non-compliance  shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $10,000  per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 6 months per  violation, or by both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Reporting requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Planned changes. The permittee shall  give notice to the Director as soon as possible of any planned physical  alterations or additions to the permitted facility. Notice is required  only when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alteration or addition to a permitted facility may meet one  of the criteria for determining whether a facility is a new source in  Sec. 122.29(b); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alteration or addition could significantly change the  nature or increase the quantity of pollutants discharged. This  notification applies to pollutants which are subject neither to effluent  limitations in the permit, nor to notification requirements under Sec.  122.42(a)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The alteration or addition results in a significant change in  the permittee's sludge use or disposal practices, and such alteration,  addition, or change may justify the application of permit conditions  that are different from or absent in the existing permit, including  notification of additional use or disposal sites not reported during the  permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved land  application plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give advance  notice to the Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility  or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfers. This permit is not transferable to any person except  after notice to the Director. The Director may require modification or  revocation and reissuance of the permit to change the name of the  permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary  under the Clean Water Act. (See Sec. 122.61; in some cases,  modification or revocation and reissuance is mandatory.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring reports. Monitoring results shall be reported at the  intervals specified elsewhere in this permit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitoring results must be reported on a Discharge Monitoring  Report (DMR) or forms provided or specified by the Director for  reporting results of monitoring of sludge use or disposal practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the permittee monitors any pollutant more frequently than  required by the permit using test procedures approved under 40 CFR Part  136, or another method required for an industry-specific waste stream  under 40 CFR subchapters N or O, the results of such monitoring shall be  included in the calculation and reporting of the data submitted in the  DMR or sludge reporting form specified by the Director.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Calculations for all limitations which require averaging of  measurements shall utilize an arithmetic mean unless otherwise specified  by the Director in the permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Compliance schedules. Reports of compliance or noncompliance  with, or any progress reports on, interim and final requirements  contained in any compliance schedule of this permit shall be submitted  no later than 14 days following each schedule date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Twenty-four hour reporting. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The permittee shall report any  noncompliance which may endanger health or the environment. Any  information shall be provided orally within 24 hours from the time the  permittee becomes aware of the circumstances. A written submission shall  also be provided within 5 days of the time the permittee becomes aware  of the circumstances. The written submission shall contain a description  of the noncompliance and its cause; the period of noncompliance,  including exact dates and times, and if the noncompliance has not been  corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps  taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following shall be included as information which must be  reported within 24 hours under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any unanticipated bypass which exceeds any effluent limitation  in the permit. (See Sec. 122.41(g).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any upset which exceeds any effluent limitation in the permit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Violation of a maximum daily discharge limitation for any of the  pollutants listed by the Director in the permit to be reported within 24  hours. (See Sec. 122.44(g).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case  basis for reports under paragraph (l)(6)(ii) of this section if the oral  report has been received within 24 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other noncompliance. The permittee shall report all instances of  noncompliance not reported under paragraphs (l) (4), (5), and (6) of  this section, at the time monitoring reports are submitted. The reports  shall contain the information listed in paragraph (l)(6) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Other information. Where the permittee becomes aware that it  failed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or  submitted incorrect information in a permit application or in any report  to the Director, it shall promptly submit such facts or information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Bypass--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bypass means the intentional  diversion of waste streams from any portion of a treatment facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Severe property damage means substantial physical damage to  property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become  inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which  can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe  property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in  production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bypass not exceeding limitations. The permittee may allow any  bypass to occur which does not cause effluent limitations to be  exceeded, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure  efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provisions of  paragraphs (m)(3) and (m)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Anticipated bypass. If the permittee knows in  advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice, if  possible at least ten days before the date of the bypass.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unanticipated bypass. The permittee shall submit notice of an  unanticipated bypass as required in paragraph (l)(6) of this section  (24-hour notice).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prohibition of bypass. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Bypass is prohibited, and the  Director may take enforcement action against a permittee for bypass,  unless:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,  or severe property damage;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the  use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or  maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition  is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been  installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent  a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or  preventive maintenance; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The permittee submitted notices as required under paragraph  (m)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after  considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will  meet the three conditions listed above in paragraph (m)(4)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Upset--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. Upset means an exceptional incident in  which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with technology  based permit effluent limitations because of factors beyond the  reasonable control of the permittee. An upset does not include  noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly  designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of  preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effect of an upset. An upset constitutes an affirmative defense  to an action brought for noncompliance with such technology based permit  effluent limitations if the requirements of paragraph (n)(3) of this  section are met. No determination made during administrative review of  claims that noncompliance was caused by upset, and   before an action for noncompliance, is final administrative action  subject to judicial review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conditions necessary for a demonstration of upset. A permittee  who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall  demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or  other relevant evidence that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An upset occurred and that the permittee can identify the  cause(s) of the upset;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The permitted facility was at the time being properly operated;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The permittee submitted notice of the upset as required in  paragraph (1)(6)(ii)(B) of this section (24 hour notice).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The permittee complied with any remedial measures required  under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding the permittee  seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset has the burden of proof.
