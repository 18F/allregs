                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aggravating factors. OPM may debar a provider for longer than  the 3-year minimum period for mandatory debarments if aggravating  factors are associated with the basis for the debarment. The factors OPM  considers to be aggravating are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the FEHBP incurred a financial loss as the result of the  acts underlying the conviction, or similar acts that were not  adjudicated, and the level of such loss. In determining the amount of  financial loss, OPM shall not consider any amounts of restitution that a  provider may have paid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the sentence imposed by the court included  incarceration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the underlying offense(s), or similar acts not  adjudicated, occurred repeatedly over a period of time, and whether  there is evidence that the offense(s) was planned in advance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the provider has a prior record of criminal, civil, or  administrative adjudication of related offenses or similar acts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the actions underlying the conviction, or similar acts  that were not adjudicated, adversely affected the physical, mental, or  financial well-being of one or more covered individuals or other  persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mitigating factors. If the aggravating factors justify a  debarment longer than the 3 year minimum period for mandatory  debarments, OPM shall also consider whether mitigating factors may  justify reducing the debarment period to not less than 3 years. The  factors that OPM considers to be mitigating are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the conviction(s) on which the debarment is based  consist entirely or primarily of misdemeanor offenses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether court records, including associated sentencing reports,  contain an official determination that the provider had a physical,  mental, or emotional condition before or during the commission of the  offenses underlying the conviction that reduced his level of  culpability; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the provider's cooperation with Federal and/or State  investigative officials resulted in criminal convictions, civil  recoveries, or administrative actions against other individuals, or  served as the basis for identifying program weaknesses. Restitution made  by the provider for funds wrongfully, improperly, or illegally received  from Federal or State programs may also be considered as a mitigating  circumstance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Maximum period of debarment. There is no limit on the maximum  period of a mandatory debarment based on a conviction.</p>
