A reasonable request for material not in  existence may be honored at Ex-Im Bank's discretion when tabulation or  compilation will not significantly burden Ex-Im Bank, its programs or  its activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(5)</em> may be made available when disclosure would not  adversely affect legitimate public or private interests, violate law or  impose an unreasonable burden on Ex-Im Bank.
