                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Drawings. There are two acceptable categories for presenting  drawings in utility and design patent applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Black ink. Black and white drawings are normally required. India  ink, or its equivalent that secures solid black lines, must be used for  drawings; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section. On rare  occasions, color drawings may be necessary as the only practical medium  by which to disclose the subject matter sought to be patented in a  utility patent application. The color drawings must be of sufficient  quality such that all details in the drawings are reproducible in black  and white in the printed patent. Color drawings are not permitted in  international applications (see PCT Rule 11.13). The Office will accept  color drawings in utility patent applications only after granting a  petition filed under this paragraph explaining why the color drawings  are necessary. Any such petition must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The fee set forth in Sec.  1.17(h);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One (1) set of color drawings if submitted via the Office  electronic filing system or three (3) sets of color drawings if not  submitted via the Office electronic filing system; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An amendment to the specification to insert (unless the  specification contains or has been previously amended to contain) the  following language as the first paragraph of the brief description of  the drawings:  The patent or application file contains at least one drawing executed in  color. Copies of this patent or patent application publication with  color drawing(s) will be provided by the Office upon request and payment  of the necessary fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Photographs--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Black and white. Photographs, including  photocopies of photographs, are not ordinarily permitted in utility and  design patent applications. The Office will accept photographs in  utility and design patent applications, however, if photographs are the  only practicable medium for illustrating the claimed invention. For  example, photographs or photomicrographs of: electrophoresis gels, blots  (e.g., immunological, western, Southern, and northern), autoradiographs,  cell cultures (stained and unstained), histological tissue cross  sections (stained and unstained), animals, plants, in vivo imaging, thin   layer chromatography plates, crystalline structures, and, in a design  patent application, ornamental effects, are acceptable. If the subject  matter of the application admits of illustration by a drawing, the  examiner may require a drawing in place of the photograph. The  photographs must be of sufficient quality so that all details in the  photographs are reproducible in the printed patent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification of drawings. Identifying indicia should be  provided, and if provided, should include the title of the invention,  inventor's name, and application number, or docket number (if any) if an  application number has not been assigned to the application. If this  information is provided, it must be placed on the front of each sheet  within the top margin. Each drawing sheet submitted after the filing  date of an application must be identified as either ``Replacement  Sheet'' or ``New Sheet'' pursuant to Sec.  1.121(d). If a marked-up copy  of any amended drawing figure including annotations indicating the  changes made is filed, such marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as  ``Annotated Sheet'' pursuant to Sec.  1.121(d)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Graphic forms in drawings. Chemical or mathematical formulae,  tables, and waveforms may be submitted as drawings, and are subject to  the same requirements as drawings. Each chemical or mathematical formula  must be labeled as a separate figure, using brackets when necessary, to  show that information is properly integrated. Each group of waveforms  must be presented as a single figure, using a common vertical axis with  time extending along the horizontal axis. Each individual waveform  discussed in the specification must be identified with a separate letter  designation adjacent to the vertical axis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Type of paper. Drawings submitted to the Office must be made on  paper which is flexible, strong, white, smooth, non-shiny, and durable.  All sheets must be reasonably free from cracks, creases, and folds. Only  one side of the sheet may be used for the drawing. Each sheet must be  reasonably free from erasures and must be free from alterations,  overwritings, and interlineations. Photographs must be developed on  paper meeting the sheet-size requirements of paragraph (f) of this  section and the margin requirements of paragraph (g) of this section.  See paragraph (b) of this section for other requirements for  photographs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Size of paper. All drawing sheets in an application must be the  same size. One of the shorter sides of the sheet is regarded as its top.  The size of the sheets on which drawings are made must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 21.0 cm. by 29.7 cm. (DIN size A4), or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8\1/2\ by 11 inches).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Margins. The sheets must not contain frames around the sight  (i.e., the usable surface), but should have scan target points (i.e.,  cross-hairs) printed on two catercorner margin corners. Each sheet must  include a top margin of at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a left side margin of  at least 2.5 cm. (1 inch), a right side margin of at least 1.5 cm. (\5/ 8\ inch), and a bottom margin of at least 1.0 cm. (\3/8\ inch), thereby  leaving a sight no greater than 17.0 cm. by 26.2 cm. on 21.0 cm. by 29.7  cm. (DIN size A4) drawing sheets, and a sight no greater than 17.6 cm.  by 24.4 cm. (6\15/16\ by 9\5/8\ inches) on 21.6 cm. by 27.9 cm. (8\1/2\  by 11 inch) drawing sheets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Views. The drawing must contain as many views as necessary to  show the invention. The views may be plan, elevation, section, or  perspective views. Detail views of portions of elements, on a larger  scale if necessary, may also be used. All views of the drawing must be  grouped together and arranged on the sheet(s) without wasting space,  preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another,  and must not be included in the sheets containing the specifications,  claims, or abstract. Views must not be connected by projection lines and  must not contain center lines. Waveforms of electrical signals may be  connected by dashed lines to show the relative timing of the waveforms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exploded views. Exploded views, with the separated parts  embraced by a bracket, to show the relationship or order of assembly of  various parts are permissible. When an exploded view is shown in a  figure which is on the same sheet as another figure, the exploded view  should be placed in brackets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Partial views. When necessary, a view of a large machine or  device in its entirety may be broken into partial views on a single  sheet, or extended over several sheets if there is no loss in facility  of understanding the view. Partial views drawn on separate sheets must  always be capable of being linked edge to edge so that no partial view  contains parts of another partial view. A smaller scale view should be  included showing the whole formed by the partial views and indicating  the positions of the parts shown. When a portion of a view is enlarged  for magnification purposes, the view and the enlarged view must each be  labeled as separate views.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where views on two or more sheets form, in effect, a single  complete view, the views on the several sheets must be so arranged that  the complete figure can be assembled without concealing any part of any  of the views appearing on the various sheets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A very long view may be divided into several parts placed one  above the other on a single sheet. However, the relationship between the  different parts must be clear and unambiguous.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sectional views. The plane upon which a sectional view is taken  should be indicated on the view from which the section is cut by a  broken line. The ends of the broken line should be designated by Arabic  or Roman numerals corresponding to the view number of the sectional  view, and should have arrows to indicate the direction of sight.  Hatching must be used to indicate section portions of an object, and  must be made by regularly spaced oblique parallel lines spaced  sufficiently apart to enable the lines to be distinguished without  difficulty. Hatching should not impede the clear reading of the  reference characters and lead lines. If it is not possible to place  reference characters outside the hatched area, the hatching may be  broken off wherever reference characters are inserted. Hatching must be  at a substantial angle to the surrounding axes or principal lines,  preferably 45[deg]. A cross section must be set out and drawn to show  all of the materials as they are shown in the view from which the cross  section was taken. The parts in cross section must show proper  material(s) by hatching with regularly spaced parallel oblique strokes,  the space between strokes being chosen on the basis of the total area to  be hatched. The various parts of a cross section of the same item should  be hatched in the same manner and should accurately and graphically  indicate the nature of the material(s) that is illustrated in cross  section. The hatching of juxtaposed different elements must be angled in  a different way. In the case of large areas, hatching may be confined to  an edging drawn around the entire inside of the outline of the area to  be hatched. Different types of hatching should have different  conventional meanings as regards the nature of a material seen in cross  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Alternate position. A moved position may be shown by a broken  line superimposed upon a suitable view if this can be done without  crowding; otherwise, a separate view must be used for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Modified forms. Modified forms of construction must be shown in  separate views.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arrangement of views. One view must not be placed upon another  or within the outline of another. All views on the same sheet should  stand in the same direction and, if possible, stand so that they can be  read with the sheet held in an upright position. If views wider than the  width of the sheet are necessary for the clearest illustration of the  invention, the sheet may be turned on its side so that the top of the  sheet, with the appropriate top margin to be used as the heading space,  is on the right-hand side. Words must appear in a horizontal, left-to- right fashion when the page is either upright or turned so that the top  becomes the right side, except for graphs utilizing standard scientific  convention to denote the axis of abscissas (of X) and the axis of  ordinates (of Y).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Front page view. The drawing must contain as many views as  necessary to show the invention. One of the views   should be suitable for inclusion on the front page of the patent  application publication and patent as the illustration of the invention.  Views must not be connected by projection lines and must not contain  center lines. Applicant may suggest a single view (by figure number) for  inclusion on the front page of the patent application publication and  patent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Scale. The scale to which a drawing is made must be large enough  to show the mechanism without crowding when the drawing is reduced in  size to two-thirds in reproduction. Indications such as ``actual size''  or ``scale \1/2\'' on the drawings are not permitted since these lose  their meaning with reproduction in a different format.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Character of lines, numbers, and letters. All drawings must be  made by a process which will give them satisfactory reproduction  characteristics. Every line, number, and letter must be durable, clean,  black (except for color drawings), sufficiently dense and dark, and  uniformly thick and well-defined. The weight of all lines and letters  must be heavy enough to permit adequate reproduction. This requirement  applies to all lines however fine, to shading, and to lines representing  cut surfaces in sectional views. Lines and strokes of different  thicknesses may be used in the same drawing where different thicknesses  have a different meaning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Shading. The use of shading in views is encouraged if it aids in  understanding the invention and if it does not reduce legibility.  Shading is used to indicate the surface or shape of spherical,  cylindrical, and conical elements of an object. Flat parts may also be  lightly shaded. Such shading is preferred in the case of parts shown in  perspective, but not for cross sections. See paragraph (h)(3) of this  section. Spaced lines for shading are preferred. These lines must be  thin, as few in number as practicable, and they must contrast with the  rest of the drawings. As a substitute for shading, heavy lines on the  shade side of objects can be used except where they superimpose on each  other or obscure reference characters. Light should come from the upper  left corner at an angle of 45[deg]. Surface delineations should  preferably be shown by proper shading. Solid black shading areas are not  permitted, except when used to represent bar graphs or color.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Symbols. Graphical drawing symbols may be used for conventional  elements when appropriate. The elements for which such symbols and  labeled representations are used must be adequately identified in the  specification. Known devices should be illustrated by symbols which have  a universally recognized conventional meaning and are generally accepted  in the art. Other symbols which are not universally recognized may be  used, subject to approval by the Office, if they are not likely to be  confused with existing conventional symbols, and if they are readily  identifiable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Legends. Suitable descriptive legends may be used subject to  approval by the Office, or may be required by the examiner where  necessary for understanding of the drawing. They should contain as few  words as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Numbers, letters, and reference characters. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reference  characters (numerals are preferred), sheet numbers, and view numbers  must be plain and legible, and must not be used in association with  brackets or inverted commas, or enclosed within outlines, e.g.,  encircled. They must be oriented in the same direction as the view so as  to avoid having to rotate the sheet. Reference characters should be  arranged to follow the profile of the object depicted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The English alphabet must be used for letters, except where  another alphabet is customarily used, such as the Greek alphabet to  indicate angles, wavelengths, and mathematical formulas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Numbers, letters, and reference characters must measure at least  .32 cm. (\1/8\ inch) in height. They should not be placed in the drawing  so as to interfere with its comprehension. Therefore, they should not  cross or mingle with the lines. They should not be placed upon hatched  or shaded surfaces. When necessary, such as indicating a surface or  cross section, a reference character may be underlined and a blank space  may be left in the hatching or shading where the character occurs so  that it appears distinct.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The same part of an invention appearing in more than one view of  the drawing must always be designated by the same reference character,  and the same reference character must never be used to designate  different parts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reference characters not mentioned in the description shall not  appear in the drawings. Reference characters mentioned in the  description must appear in the drawings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Lead lines. Lead lines are those lines between the reference  characters and the details referred to. Such lines may be straight or  curved and should be as short as possible. They must originate in the  immediate proximity of the reference character and extend to the feature  indicated. Lead lines must not cross each other. Lead lines are required  for each reference character except for those which indicate the surface  or cross section on which they are placed. Such a reference character  must be underlined to make it clear that a lead line has not been left  out by mistake. Lead lines must be executed in the same way as lines in  the drawing. See paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Arrows. Arrows may be used at the ends of the lines, provided  that their meaning is clear, as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On a lead line, a freestanding arrow to indicate the entire  section towards which it points;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On a lead line, an arrow touching a line to indicate the surface  shown by the line looking along the direction of the arrow; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To show the direction of movement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Copyright or Mask Work Notice. A copyright or mask work notice  may appear in the drawing, but must be placed within the sight of the  drawing immediately below the figure representing the copyright or mask  work material and be limited to letters having a print size of .32 cm.  to .64 cm. (\1/8\ to \1/4\ inches) high. The content of the notice must  be limited to only those elements provided for by law. For example,  ``(copyright) 1983 John Doe'' (17 U.S.C. 401) and ``*M* John  Doe'' (17 U.S.C. 909) would be properly limited and, under current  statutes, legally sufficient notices of copyright and mask work,  respectively. Inclusion of a copyright or mask work notice will be  permitted only if the authorization language set forth in Sec.  1.71(e)  is included at the beginning (preferably as the first paragraph) of the  specification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Numbering of sheets of drawings. The sheets of drawings should  be numbered in consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, within the  sight as defined in paragraph (g) of this section. These numbers, if  present, must be placed in the middle of the top of the sheet, but not  in the margin. The numbers can be placed on the right-hand side if the  drawing extends too close to the middle of the top edge of the usable  surface. The drawing sheet numbering must be clear and larger than the  numbers used as reference characters to avoid confusion. The number of  each sheet should be shown by two Arabic numerals placed on either side  of an oblique line, with the first being the sheet number, and the  second being the total number of sheets of drawings, with no other  marking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Numbering of views. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The different views must be numbered in  consecutive Arabic numerals, starting with 1, independent of the  numbering of the sheets and, if possible, in the order in which they  appear on the drawing sheet(s). Partial views intended to form one  complete view, on one or several sheets, must be identified by the same  number followed by a capital letter. View numbers must be preceded by  the abbreviation ``FIG.'' Where only a single view is used in an  application to illustrate the claimed invention, it must not be numbered  and the abbreviation ``FIG.'' must not appear.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Numbers and letters identifying the views must be simple and  clear and must not be used in association with brackets, circles, or  inverted commas. The view numbers must be larger than the numbers used  for reference characters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Security markings. Authorized security markings may be placed on  the drawings provided they are outside the sight, preferably centered in  the top margin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Corrections. Any corrections on drawings submitted to the Office  must be durable and permanent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Holes. No holes should be made by applicant in the drawing  sheets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Types of drawings. See Sec.  1.152 for design drawings, Sec.   1.1026 for international design reproductions, Sec.  1.165 for plant  drawings, and Sec.  1.173(a)(2) for reissue drawings.
