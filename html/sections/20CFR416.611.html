                                Sec. 416.611  What happens to your monthly benefits while we are
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We may pay you directly. We will pay current monthly benefits  directly to you while finding a suitable representative payee unless we  determine that paying you directly would cause substantial harm to you.  We determine substantial harm as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are receiving disability payments and we have determined  that you have a drug addiction or alcoholism condition, or you are  legally incompetent, or you are under age 15, we will presume that  substantial harm exists. However, we will allow you to rebut this  presumption by presenting evidence that direct payment would not cause  you substantial harm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you do not fit any of these categories, we make findings of  substantial harm on a case-by-case basis. We consider all matters that  may affect your ability to manage your benefits in your own best  interest. We decide that substantial harm exists if both of the  following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directly receiving benefits can be expected to cause you serious  physical or mental injury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The possible effect of the injury would outweigh the effect of  having no income to meet your basic needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(3)</em> for our policy on  suspending the benefits if you are currently receiving benefits  directly.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1: Substantial Harm Exists. We are unable to find a  representative payee for Mr. X, a 67 year old claimant receiving title  XVI benefits based on age who is an alcoholic. Based on contacts with  the doctor and beneficiary, we determine that Mr. X was hospitalized  recently for his drinking. Paying him directly will cause serious  injury, so we may delay payment for as long as one month based on  substantial harm while we locate a suitable representative payee.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2: Substantial Harm Does Not Exist. We approve a claim for  Mr. Y, a title XVI claimant who suffers from a combination of mental  impairments but who is not legally incompetent. We determine that Mr. Y  needs assistance in managing benefits, but we have not found a  representative payee. Although we believe that Mr. Y may not use the  money wisely, there is no indication that receiving funds directly would  cause him substantial harm (i.e., serious physical or mental injury). We  must pay current benefits directly to Mr. Y while we locate a suitable  representative payee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> How we pay delayed or suspended benefits. Payment of benefits,  which were delayed or suspended pending appointment of a representative  payee, can be made to you or your representative payee as a single sum  or in installments when we determine that installments are in your best  interest.
