                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Approval tests. The approval tests are those tests prescribed  for the preproduction sample in MIL-S-18655. The approval tests must be  conducted by an independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under  Sec. 159.010 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Production inspections and tests. Production inspections and  tests of each lot of signals produced must be conducted under the  procedures in Sec. 159.007 of this chapter. Signals from a rejected lot  must not be represented as meeting this subpart or as being approved by  the Coast Guard. If the manufacturer identifies the cause of the  rejection of a lot of signals, the signals in the lot may be reworked by  the manufacturer to correct the problem. Samples from the rejected lot  must be retested in order to be accepted. Records shall be kept of the  reasons for rejection, the reworking performed on the rejected lot, and  the results of the second test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inspections and tests by the manufacturer. The manufacturer's  quality control procedures must include inspection of materials entering  into construction of the signals and inspection of the finished signals,  to determine that signals are being produced in   accordance with the approved plans. The manufacturer must select samples  from each lot and test them as specified in the production lot  procedures in MIL-S-18655.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspections and tests by an independent laboratory. An  independent laboratory accepted by the Commandant under Sec. 159.010 of  this chapter must perform or supervise the inspections and tests under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section at least 4 times a year, unless the  number of lots is less than four. The inspections and tests must occur  at least once during each quarterly period, unless no lots are produced  during this period. If less than four lots are produced, the laboratory  must perform or supervise the inspection and testing of each lot. If a  lot of signals tested by the independent laboratory is rejected, the  laboratory must perform or supervise the inspections and tests of the  reworked lot and the next lot of signals produced. The tests of each  reworked lot and the next lot produced must not be counted for the  purpose of meeting the requirement for the annual number of inspections  and tests performed or supervised by the independent laboratory.</p>
