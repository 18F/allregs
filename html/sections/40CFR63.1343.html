                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The provisions in this section apply to each kiln and any alkali bypass associated with that kiln, clinker cooler, raw material dryer, and open clinker storage pile. All D/F, HCl, and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions limit are on a dry basis. The D/F, HCl, and THC limits for kilns are corrected to 7 percent oxygen. All THC emissions limits are measured as propane. Standards for mercury and THC are based on a rolling 30-day average. If using a CEMS to determine compliance with the HCl standard, this standard is based on a rolling 30-day average. You must ensure appropriate corrections for moisture are made when measuring flow rates used to calculate mercury emissions. The 30-day period means 30 consecutive kiln operating days excluding periods of startup and shutdown. All emissions limits for kilns, clinker coolers, and raw material dryers currently in effect that are superseded by the limits below continue to apply until the compliance date of the limits below, or until the source certifies compliance with the limits below, whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Kilns, clinker coolers, raw material dryers, raw mills, and finish mills. (1) The emissions limits for these sources are shown in Table 1 below. PM limits for existing kilns also apply to kilns that have undergone a modification as defined in subpart A of part 60 of title 40.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Emissions Limits for Kilns, Clinker Coolers, Raw Material Dryers, Raw and Finish Mills--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">And the units of       The oxygen</p><p class="depth0">If your source is   And the operating   And if is located    Your emissions       the emissions     correction factor</p><p class="depth0">a (an):            mode is:              at a:            limits are:         limit are:              is:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1...............................
