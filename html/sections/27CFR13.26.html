                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decision. After considering any written arguments or evidence  presented by the applicant, the appropriate TTB officer must issue a  written decision to the applicant. If the decision is that the qualified  approval or denial should stand, a copy of the application, marked  ``appeal denied,'' must be returned to the applicant with   an explanation of the decision and the specific laws or regulations  relied upon in qualifying or denying the application. If the decision is  that the certificate of label approval, certificate of exemption from  label approval, or distinctive liquor bottle application should be  approved without qualification, the applicant should resubmit TTB Form  5100.31 and the certificate will be issued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time limits for decision. Within 90 days of receipt of an  appeal, the appropriate TTB officer must notify the appellant whether  the appeal has been granted or denied. If an applicant requests an  informal conference as part of an appeal, as authorized in Sec. 13.71,  the 90-day period will begin 10 days after the date of the conference to  allow for consideration of any written arguments, facts or evidence  submitted after the conference. The appropriate TTB officer may extend  this period of time once by an additional 90 days if he or she finds  that unusual circumstances require additional time to consider the  issues presented by an appeal. If the appropriate TTB officer extends  the period, he or she must notify the applicant by letter, briefly  explaining the issues presented by the label. If the appellant receives  no decision from the appropriate TTB officer within the time periods set  forth in this paragraph, the appellant may appeal as provided in Sec.  13.27.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Judicial review. Prior to applying to the Federal courts for  review, an applicant must first exhaust his or her administrative  remedies, including the appeal rights set forth in this section and  Sec. 13.27.</p>
