                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The HOME program has income targeting requirements for the HOME  program and for HOME projects. Therefore, the participating jurisdiction  must determine each family is income eligible by determining the  family's annual income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section. For subsequent income  determinations during the period of affordability, the participating  jurisdiction may use any one of the following methods in accordance with  Sec. 92.252(h):</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Examine at least 2 months of source documents evidencing annual  income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement, unemployment  compensation statement) for the family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obtain from the family a written statement of the amount of the  family's annual income and family size, along with a certification that  the information is complete and accurate. The certification must state  that the family will provide source documents upon request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Obtain a written statement from the administrator of a  government program under which the family receives benefits and which  examines each year the annual income of the family. The statement must  indicate the tenant's family size and state the amount of the family's  annual income; or alternatively, the statement must indicate the current  dollar limit for very low- or low-income families for the family size of  the tenant and state that the tenant's annual income does not exceed  this limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other families (i.e., homeowners receiving  rehabilitation assistance, homebuyers, and recipients of HOME tenant- based rental assistance), the participating jurisdiction must determine  annual income by examining at least 2 months of source documents  evidencing annual income (e.g., wage statement, interest statement,  unemployment compensation statement) for the family.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When determining whether a family is income eligible, the  participating jurisdiction must use one of the following two definitions  of ``annual income'':</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual income as defined at 24 CFR 5.609 (except when  determining the income of a homeowner for an owner-occupied  rehabilitation project, the value of the homeowner's principal residence  may be excluded from the calculation of Net Family Assets, as defined in  24 CFR 5.603); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjusted gross income as defined for purposes of reporting under  Internal Revenue Service Form 1040 series for individual Federal annual  income tax purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Although the participating jurisdiction may use either of the  definitions of ``annual income'' permitted in paragraph (b) of this  section to calculate adjusted income, it must apply exclusions from  income established at 24 CFR 5.611. The HOME rents for very low-income  families established under Sec. 92.252(b)(2) are based on adjusted  income. In addition, the participating jurisdiction may base the amount  of tenant-based rental assistance on the adjusted income of the family.  The participating jurisdiction may use only one definition for each  HOME-assisted program (e.g., downpayment assistance program) that it  administers and for each rental housing project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The participating jurisdiction must calculate the annual  income of the family by projecting the prevailing rate of income of the  family at the time the participating jurisdiction determines that the  family is income eligible. Annual income shall include income from all  persons in the household. Income or asset enhancement derived from the  HOME-assisted project shall not be considered in calculating annual  income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The participating jurisdiction is not required to re-examine the  family's income at the time the HOME assistance is provided, unless more  than six months has elapsed since the participating jurisdiction  determined that the family qualified as income eligible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The participating jurisdiction must follow the requirements in  Sec. 5.617 when making subsequent income determinations of persons with  disabilities who are tenants in HOME-assisted rental housing or who  receive tenant-based rental assistance.
