                            <p class="depth0">The Coast Guard is establishing safety zones for the events listed  in Table 1 of this section. These regulations in this section will be  enforced for the duration of each event, on or about the dates indicated  in Table 1 of this section. Annual notice of the exact dates and times  of the effective period of the regulations in this section with respect  to each event, the geographical description of each regulated area, and  details concerning the nature of the event and the number of  participants and type(s) of vessels involved will be made to the local  maritime community through the Local Notice to Mariners and/or Broadcast  Notice to Mariners well in advance of the events. If the event does not  have a date listed, then   the exact dates and times of the enforcement will be announced through a  Notice of Enforcement in the Federal Register. Mariners should consult  the Federal Register or their LNM to remain apprised of minor schedule  or event changes. First Coast Guard District LNM can be found at: http:/ /www.navcen.uscg.gov/. The Sector Boston Marine Events schedule can also  be viewed electronically at: http://www.homeport.uscg.mil. Although  listed in the Code of Federal Regulations, sponsors of events listed in  Table 1 of this section are still required to submit a marine event  permit application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Coast Guard may patrol each event area under the direction  of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may  be contacted on Channel 16 VHF-FM (156.8 MHz) by the call sign  ``PATCOM.'' Official patrol vessels may consist of any Coast Guard,  Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels assigned  or approved by the Captain of the Port, Sector Boston.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without Patrol  Commander approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no  wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other  crafts in the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or  impede the movement of event participants or official patrol vessels in  the regulated areas during the effective dates and times, or dates and  times as modified through the LNM, unless authorized by an official  patrol vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The Patrol Commander may control the movement of all vessels in  the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol  vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the  lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may  result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or  both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The Patrol Commander may delay or terminate any marine event in  this subpart at any time it is deemed necessary to ensure the safety of  life or property. Such action may be justified as a result of weather,  traffic density, spectator operation or participant behavior.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For all fireworks displays listed below, the regulated area is  that area of navigable waters within a 350-yard radius of the launch  platform or launch site for each fireworks display, unless modified in  the LNM at: http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> For all swimming events listed, vessels not associated with the  event shall maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from the  participants.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6.0                                                    June ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 6.1 Sand and Sea Festival Fireworks....   Event Type: Fireworks</p><p class="depth0">Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Sponsor: Salisbury Beach</p><p class="depth0">Partnership, Inc.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: A one-night event on</p><p class="depth0">Saturday during the last</p><p class="depth0">weekend of June, as specified</p><p class="depth0">in the USCG District 1 Local</p><p class="depth0">Notice to Mariners.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: 10:00 p.m. to 10:30</p><p class="depth0">p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: All waters of the</p><p class="depth0">Atlantic Ocean near Salisbury</p><p class="depth0">Beach within a 350-yard radius</p><p class="depth0">of the fireworks launch site</p><p class="depth0">located at position 4250.6 N,</p><p class="depth0">7048.4 W (NAD 83). 6.2 St. Peter's Fiesta Fireworks.......   Event Type: Fireworks</p><p class="depth0">Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Sponsor: St. Peters Fiesta.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: A one-night event on</p><p class="depth0">Saturday during the last</p><p class="depth0">weekend of June, as specified</p><p class="depth0">in the USCG District 1 Local</p><p class="depth0">Notice to Mariners.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: All waters of</p><p class="depth0">Gloucester Harbor, Stage Fort</p><p class="depth0">Park, within a 350-yard radius</p><p class="depth0">of the fireworks launch site</p><p class="depth0">on the beach located at</p><p class="depth0">position 4236.3 N, 07040.5 W</p><p class="depth0">(NAD 83). 6.3 Surfside Fireworks.................   Event Type: Fireworks</p><p class="depth0">Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Sponsor: Salisbury Beach</p><p class="depth0">Partnership and Chamber of</p><p class="depth0">Commerce.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: Every Saturday from</p><p class="depth0">June through September, as</p><p class="depth0">specified in the USCG District</p><p class="depth0">1 Local Notice to Mariners.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: 9:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: All waters of the</p><p class="depth0">Atlantic Ocean near Salisbury</p><p class="depth0">Beach, MA, within a 350-yard</p><p class="depth0">radius of the fireworks barge</p><p class="depth0">located at position 4250.6 N,</p><p class="depth0">07048.4 W (NAD 83). 6.4 Cohasset Triathlon.................   Event Type: Swim.</p><p class="depth0"> Sponsor: Bill Burnett.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: A one-day event on</p><p class="depth0">Sunday during the last weekend</p><p class="depth0">of June, as specified in the</p><p class="depth0">USCG District 1 Local Notice</p><p class="depth0">to Mariners.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: 08:30 a.m. to 10:00</p><p class="depth0">a.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: All waters in the</p><p class="depth0">vicinity of Cohasset Harbor</p><p class="depth0">around Sandy Beach, within the</p><p class="depth0">following points (NAD 83):</p><p class="depth0">4215.6 N, 07048.1 W.</p><p class="depth0">4215.5 N, 07048.1 W.</p><p class="depth0">4215.4 N, 07047.9 W.</p><p class="depth0">4215.4 N, 07047.8 W. 6.5 Hull Youth Football Carnival          Event Type: Fireworks</p><p class="depth0">Fireworks.
