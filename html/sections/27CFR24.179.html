                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. In producing natural wine, sugar, juice or concentrated  fruit juice of the same kind of fruit may be added after fermentation to  sweeten wine. When juice or concentrated fruit juice is added, the  solids content of the finished wine may not exceed 21 percent by weight.  When liquid sugar or   invert sugar syrup is used, the resulting volume may not exceed the  volume which would result from the maximum use of pure dry sugar only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grape wine. Any natural grape wine of a winemaker's own  production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation  provided the finished wine does not exceed 17 percent total solids by  weight if the alcohol content is more than 14 percent by volume or 21  percent total solids by weight if the alcohol content is not more than  14 percent by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fruit wine. Any natural fruit wine of a winemaker's own  production may have sugar added after amelioration and fermentation  provided the finished wine does not exceed 21 percent total solids by  weight and the alcohol content is not more than 14 percent by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specially sweetened natural wine. Specially sweetened natural  wine is produced by adding to natural wine of the winemaker's own  production sufficient pure dry sugar, juice or concentrated fruit juice  of the same kind of fruit, separately or in combination, so that the  finished product has a total solids content between 17 percent and 35  percent by weight, and an alcohol content of not more than 14 percent by  volume. Natural wine containing added wine spirits may be used in the  production of specially sweetened natural wine; however, wine spirits  may not be added to specially sweetened natural wine. Specially  sweetened natural wines may be blended with each other, or with natural  wine or heavy bodied blending wine (including juice or concentrated  fruit juice to which wine spirits have been added), in the further  production of specially sweetened natural wine only if the wines (or  juice) so blended are made from the same kind of fruit.
