                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This competitive grant program will provide funding directly to  fire departments of a State for the purpose of enhancing departments  abilities to protect the health and safety of the public, as well as  that of firefighting personnel, facing fire and fire-related hazards.  Eligible applicants can submit only one application per application  period. Departments that submit multiple applications in one application  period will have each of their applications deemed ineligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible applicants are fire departments or fire departments of  a State which is defined as an agency or organization that has a  ``formally recognized arrangement'' with a State, local or tribal  authority (city, county, parish, fire district, township, town, or other  non-Federal governing body) to provide fire suppression services within  a fixed geographical area. A fire department can apply for assistance  for its emergency medical services unit provided the unit falls  organizationally under the auspices of the fire department. A  municipality or fire district may submit an application on behalf of a  fire department when the fire department lacks the legal status to do  so, e.g., where the fire department falls   within the auspices of the municipality. When a municipality or fire  district submits an application on behalf of a fire department, the fire  department is precluded from submitting an additional application. Non- Federal airport and/or port authority fire departments are eligible, but  only if they have a formally recognized arrangement with the local  jurisdiction to provide fire suppression, on a first-due basis, outside  the confines of the airport or port facilities. Airport or port  authority fire departments whose sole responsibility is suppression of  fires on the airport grounds or port facilities are not eligible for  this grant program. Fire departments that are Federal or contracted by  the Federal government and whose sole responsibility is suppression of  fires on Federal installations are not eligible for this grant program.  Fire stations that are not independent but are part of, or controlled by  a larger fire department or agency, are typically not eligible. Fire  departments that are for-profit departments (i.e., do not have specific  non-profit status or are not municipally based) are not eligible to  apply for assistance under this program. Also not eligible for this  program are ambulance services, rescue squads, auxiliaries, dive teams,  urban search and rescue teams, fire service organizations or  associations, and State/local agencies such as a forest service, fire  marshal, hospitals, and training offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Congress included in the legislation a list of fourteen  activities eligible for funding under this program. Those activities are  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To hire additional firefighting personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To train firefighting personnel in firefighting, emergency  response (including response to a terrorism incident or use of a weapon  of mass destruction), arson prevention and detection, or the handling of  hazardous materials, or to train firefighting personnel to provide any  of the training in this paragraph (c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To fund the creation of rapid intervention teams to protect  firefighting personnel at scenes of fires and other emergencies;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To certify fire inspectors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To establish wellness and fitness programs for firefighting  personnel to ensure that the firefighting personnel can carry out their  duties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> To fund emergency medical services provided by fire departments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> To acquire additional firefighting vehicles, including fire  trucks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> To acquire additional firefighting equipment, including  equipment for communications, monitoring, and response to a terrorism  incident or use of a weapon of mass destruction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> To acquire personal protective equipment required for  firefighting personnel by the Occupational Safety and Health  Administration, and other personal protective equipment for firefighting  personnel, including protective equipment to respond to a terrorism  incident or the use of a weapon of mass destruction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> To modify fire stations, fire training facilities, and other  facilities to protect the health and safety of firefighting personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> To enforce fire codes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> To fund fire prevention programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> To educate the public about arson prevention and detection; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> To provide incentives for the recruitment and retention of  volunteer firefighting personnel for volunteer firefighting departments  and other firefighting departments that utilize volunteers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The specific activities that will be eligible for funding will  be announced in the Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) that we will  publish pursuant to the program's annual appropriation.</p>
