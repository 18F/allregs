                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Valley fills and head-of-hollow fills shall meet the requirements of  Sec. 817.71 and the additional requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Drainage control. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The top surface of the completed fill  shall be graded such that the final slope after settlement will be  toward properly designed drainage channels. Uncontrolled surface  drainage may not be directed over the outslope of the fill.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Runoff from areas above the fill and runoff from the surface of  the fill shall be diverted into stabilized diversion channels designed  to meet the requirements of Sec. 817.43 and to safely pass the runoff  from a 100-year, 6-hour precipitation event.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Rock-core chimney drains. A rock-core chimney drain may be used  in a head-of-hollow fill, instead of the underdrain and surface  diversion system normally required, as long as the fill is not located  in an area containing intermittent or perennial streams. A rock-core  chimney drain may be used in a valley fill if the fill does not exceed  250,000 cubic yards of material and upstream drainage is diverted around  the fill. The alternative rock-core chimney drain system shall be  incorporated into the design and construction of the fill as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fill shall have, along the vertical projection of the main  buried stream channel or rill, a vertical core of durable rock at least  16 feet thick which shall extend from the toe of the fill to the head of  the fill, and from the base of the fill to the surface of the fill. A  system of lateral rock underdrains shall connect this rock core to each  area of potential drainage or seepage in the disposal area. The  underdrain system and rock core shall be designed to carry the  anticipated seepage of water due to rainfall away from the excess spoil  fill and from seeps and springs in the foundation of the disposal area.  Rocks used in the rock core and underdrains shall meet the requirements  of Sec. 817.71(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A filter system to ensure the proper long-term functioning of  the rock core shall be designed and constructed using current, prudent  engineering practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Grading may drain surface water away from the outslope of the  fill and toward the rock core. In no case, however, may intermittent or  perennial streams be diverted into the rock core. The maximum slope of  the top of the fill shall be 33h:lv (3 percent). A drainage pocket may  be maintained at the head of the fill during and after construction, to  intercept surface runoff and discharge the runoff through or over the  rock drain, if stability of the fill is not impaired. In no case shall  this pocket or sump have a potential capacity for impounding more than  10,000 cubic feet of water. Terraces on the fill shall be graded with a  3 to 5 percent grade toward the fill and a 1 percent slope toward the  rock core.  [48 FR 32928, July 19, 1983]</p>
