                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The  following definitions also apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Averaging for nonroad engines means the exchange of emission credits  among engine families within a given manufacturer's product line.</p><p class="depth0">Banking means the retention of nonroad engine emission credits by  the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model  year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Emission credits represent the amount of emission reduction or  exceedance, by a nonroad engine family, below or above the emission  standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard are  considered as ``positive credits,'' while emission exceedances above the  standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition,  ``projected credits'' refer to emission credits based on the projected  applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. ``Reserved  credits'' are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to  be reported to EPA at the end of the model year. ``Actual credits''  refer to emission credits based on actual applicable production/sales  volume as contained in the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or  all of these credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year  reports or any subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.</p><p class="depth0">Trading means the exchange of nonroad engine emission credits  between manufacturers.
