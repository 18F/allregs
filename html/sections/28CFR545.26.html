                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Warden shall ensure that all institution work assignments have standardized work descriptions. Each inmate work position is assigned one of four pay grade levels. Factors to consider in assigning a grade level to the specific work position include the position's educational and vocational requirements, physical demands, working conditions (exposed to dusts, odors, etc.), and the degree of responsibility held by the inmate worker. The inmate assigned to a specific work position shall sign, and, if requested, receive a copy of, that position description.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In recognition of budgetary constraints and for the effective management of the overall performance pay program, the percentage of inmates assigned to each grade level is approximately as follows (Grade 1 is highest pay):</p><p class="depth0">Grade 1--5% of the institution's allotted inmate work assignments;</p><p class="depth0">Grade 2--15% of the institution's allotted inmate work assignments;</p><p class="depth0">Grade 3--25% of the institution's allotted inmate work assignments;</p><p class="depth0">Grade 4--55% of the institution's allotted inmate work assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An inmate may receive performance pay only for that portion of the month that the inmate was working. Performance pay may not be awarded retroactively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An inmate is eligible to receive performance pay only for those hours during which the inmate is actually performing satisfactory work or actively participating in an education or vocational training program. Absences from an inmate's scheduled assignment for such reasons as call-outs, visits, sick call, interviews, or making telephone calls shall be deducted from the monthly number of hours worked and will accordingly reduce the amount of

pay received by the inmate. Any exception to such reduction in pay must be approved by the Assistant Director, Correctional Programs Division, Central Office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Work evaluation. (1) At the end of each month the work detail/program supervisor shall compute the hours worked by the inmate and the pay to be awarded for that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An inmate shall receive performance pay only for those hours during which the inmate is actively participating in a work assignment or an education/vocational program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The work detail/program supervisor shall rate the inmate's performance in each of several categories on a monthly basis when the inmate's work performance is average or below average or on a quarterly basis when the inmate's work performance is above average. For example, an inmate may be rated in such categories as quality of work, quantity of work, initiative, ability to learn, dependability, response to supervision and instruction, safety and care of equipment, ability to work with others, and overall job proficiency. Any exception to the work performance evaluation procedures cited in this paragraph requires approval of the Assistant Director, Correctional Programs Division, Central Office. The work detail/program supervisor shall review the evaluation with the inmate. The supervisor shall request that the inmate sign the evaluation form. If the inmate refuses to sign the form, the supervisor shall note this refusal on the evaluation and, if known, the reasons for refusal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Bonus pay. When the supervisor of an inmate worker or program participant believes the inmate has made exceptional accomplishments or appreciably contributed to the work assignment, the supervisor may recommend that the inmate receive a bonus. For example, an inmate who works in excess of the scheduled work day can qualify for bonus pay. Written justification for the bonus request must be forwarded to the Department Head for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special bonus pay. An inmate may receive special bonus pay based on the inmate's exceptional work in a temporary job assignment, provided this assignment has been previously identified by the Warden, and approved by the Regional Director, as critical to the institution. When the supervisor of an inmate worker assigned to this temporary job assignment believes the inmate has performed exceptionally well, the supervisor may recommend that the inmate received a special bonus. Written justification for the special bonus request must be forwarded to the Department Head for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> An inmate's performance pay, once earned, becomes vested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each inmate in performance pay status shall be notified of monthly earnings.
