The OPO determines medical suitability for organ donation and, in the absence of alternative arrangements by the CAH, the OPO determines medical suitability for tissue and eye donation, using the definition of potential tissue and eye donor and the notification protocol developed in consultation with the tissue and eye banks identified by the CAH for this purpose;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Incorporate an agreement with at least one tissue bank and at least one eye bank to cooperate in the retrieval, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and eyes, as may be appropriate to assure that all usable

tissues and eyes are obtained from potential donors, insofar as such an agreement does not interfere with organ procurement;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ensure, in collaboration with the designated OPO, that the family of each potential donor is informed of its option to either donate or not donate organs, tissues, or eyes. The individual designated by the CAH to initiate the request to the family must be a designated requestor. A designated requestor is an individual who has completed a course offered or approved by the OPO and designed in conjunction with the tissue and eye bank community in the methodology for approaching potential donor families and requesting organ or tissue donation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Encourage discretion and sensitivity with respect to the circumstances, views, and beliefs of the families of potential donors;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ensure that the CAH works cooperatively with the designated OPO, tissue bank and eye bank in educating staff on donation issues, reviewing death records to improve identification of potential donors, and maintaining potential donors while necessary testing and placement of potential donated organs, tissues, and eyes take place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For purposes of these standards, the term ``organ'' means a human kidney, liver, heart, lung, pancreas, or intestines (or multivisceral organs).
