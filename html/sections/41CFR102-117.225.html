                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under a contract or a rate tender, the agency prepares the bill of lading and books the shipment. The agency is the shipper and pays the TSP the applicable charges. If loss or damage occurs, the agency may either file a claim on behalf of the employee directly with the TSP, or help the employee in filing a claim against the TSP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the commuted rate system an employee arranges for shipping HHG and is reimbursed by the agency for the resulting costs. Use this method only within the continental United States (not Hawaii or Alaska).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rate table information and the commuted rate schedule can be found at www.gsa.gov/relocationpolicy or the appropriate office designated in your agency.
