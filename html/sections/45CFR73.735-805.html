                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an employee has a question about the appropriate course of conduct to be followed in a matter that may involve an actual or apparent conflict of interest, he or she should immediately consult with his or her supervisor or a deputy ethics counselor, or both. If a supervisor who is consulted determines that the matter warrants further consideration, he or she may, in conjunction with the employee, submit the details of the matter, in writing, to the appropriate deputy ethics counselor. These details should include a description of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The activity, relationship, or interest giving rise to the question posed by the employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The duties or official responsibilities of the employee(s) involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The nature of the actual or apparent conflict of interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any other information that may be helpful in reviewing the problem.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving the submission of an employee or a supervisor, the deputy ethics counselor will develop any additional information about the matter as necessary, and will confer with the Department Ethics Counselor as appropriate. The Department Ethics Counselor and the head of the principal operating component or his or her designee will be informed of any serious violation of the standards of this subpart or any other conflict of interest law. Questions of first impression or other unusual matters shall be brought to the attention of the Department Ethics Counselor and the head of the principal operating component or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On the basis of all information gathered including, where appropriate, the advice of the Department Ethics Counselor, the deputy ethics counselor will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Decide that there is no violation or potential violation of the standards of this subpart or any other law and so notify the employee and his or her supervisor in writing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Decide that a violation or potential violation of the standards of this subpart or other law has occurred or may occur, and that the employee involved shall take one or more of the steps set forth in Sec. 731.735-904 to resolve the problem and notify the employee and his or her supervisor in writing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decide that, although no violation of this subpart or other law has occurred, the nature of the matter is such that the employee should periodically report any additional information that would require reconsideration of the initial submission.</p>
