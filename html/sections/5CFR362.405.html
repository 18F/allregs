                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Individual Development Plans. An agency must approve, within 45 days, an Individual Development Plan (IDP) for each of its Fellows that sets forth the specific developmental activities that are mutually agreed upon by each Fellow and his or her supervisor. The IDP must be developed in consultation with the Agency PMF Coordinator and/or the mentor assigned to the Fellow under paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Required developmental activities. (1) OPM will provide an orientation program for each class or cohort of Fellows and will provide information on available training opportunities known to it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The agency must provide each Fellow a minimum of 80 hours of formal interactive training per year that addresses the competencies outlined in the IDP. Mandatory annual training, such as information security and ethics training, does not count towards the 80-hour requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Within the first 90 days of a Fellow's appointment, the agency must assign the Fellow a mentor, who is a managerial employee outside the Fellow's chain of command.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The agency must provide each Fellow with at least one rotational or developmental assignment with full-time management and/or technical responsibilities consistent with the Fellow's IDP. With respect to this requirement:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Each Fellow must receive at least one developmental assignment of 4 to 6 months in duration, with management and/or technical responsibilities consistent with the Fellow's IDP. As an alternative, a Fellow may choose to participate in an agency-wide initiative or other Presidential or Administration initiative that will provide the Fellow with the experience he or she would have gained through the 4-to-6-month developmental assignment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The developmental assignment may be within the Fellow's organization, in another component of the agency, or in another Federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Fellow may receive other short-term rotational assignments of 1 to 6 months in duration, at the agency's discretion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Upon the request of OPM, the appointing agency must make Fellows available to assist in the assessment process for subsequent PMF classes. Any interactive training provided to a Fellow in connection with assisting OPM in the assessment process may be counted toward the minimum 80-hour training requirement in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Promotion. An agency may promote any Fellow who meets the qualification requirements for the position.

This provision does not confer entitlement to promotion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Certification of completion. (1) Upon completion of the Program, the agency's ERB must evaluate each Fellow and determine whether it can certify in writing that the Fellow met all of the requirements of the Program, including the performance and developmental expectations set forth in the individual's performance plan and IDP. The ERB may consult the Fellow's mentor in reaching its determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ERB must notify the Fellow of its decision regarding certification of successful completion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> ERB certifications must be forwarded to OPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> If the ERB decides not to certify a Fellow, the Fellow may request reconsideration of that determination by the Director. Such reconsideration must be requested in writing, with appropriate documentation and justification, within 15 calendar days of the date of the agency's decision. The Director's decision on reconsideration is not subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the ERB decides not to certify a Fellow, the Fellow may request reconsideration of that determination by the Director. Such reconsideration must be requested in writing, with appropriate documentation and justification, within 15 calendar days of the date of the agency's decision. The Director's decision on reconsideration is not subject to appeal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Fellow may continue in the Program pending the outcome of his or her request for reconsideration. The agency must continue to provide appropriate developmental activities during this period.</p>
