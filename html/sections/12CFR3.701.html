Appendix A to Part 3--Risk-Based Capital Guidelines</p><p class="depth0">Section 1. Purpose, Applicability of Guidelines, and Definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. (1) An important function of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is to evaluate the adequacy of capital maintained by each national bank. Such an evaluation involves the consideration of numerous factors, including the riskiness of a bank's assets and off-balance sheet items. This appendix A implements the OCC's risk-based capital guidelines. The risk-based capital ratio derived from those guidelines is more systematically sensitive to the credit risk associated with various bank activities than is a capital ratio based strictly on a bank's total balance sheet assets. A bank's risk-based capital ratio is obtained by dividing its capital base (as defined in section 2 of this appendix A) by its risk-weighted assets (as calculated pursuant to section 3 of this appendix A). These guidelines were created within the framework established by the report issued by the Committee on Banking Regulations and Supervisory Practices in July 1988. The OCC believes that the risk-based capital ratio is a useful tool in evaluating the capital adequacy of all national banks, not just those that are active in the international banking system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An important function of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) is to evaluate the adequacy of capital maintained by each national bank.

The OCC believes that the risk-based capital ratio is a useful tool in evaluating the capital adequacy of all national banks, not just those that are active in the international banking system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The purpose of this appendix A is to explain precisely (i) how a national bank's risk-based capital ratio is determined and (ii) how these risk-based capital guidelines are applied to national banks. The OCC will review these guidelines periodically for possible adjustments commensurate with its experience with the risk-based capital ratio and with changes in the economy, financial markets and domestic and international banking practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. (1) The risk-based capital ratio derived from these guidelines is an important factor in the OCC's evaluation of a bank's capital adequacy. However, since this measure addresses only credit risk, the 8% minimum ratio should not be viewed as the level to be targeted, but rather as a floor. The final supervisory judgment on a bank's capital adequacy is based on an individualized assessment of numerous factors, including those listed in 12 CFR 3.10. With respect to the consideration of these factors, the OCC will give particular attention to any bank with significant exposure to declines in the economic value of its capital due to changes in interest rates. As a result, it may differ from the conclusion drawn from an isolated comparison of a bank's risk-based capital ration to the 8% minimum specified in these guidelines. In addition to the standards established by these risk-based capital guidelines, all national banks must maintain a minimum capital-to-total assets ratio in accordance with the provisions of 12 CFR part 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The risk-based capital ratio derived from these guidelines is an important factor in the OCC's evaluation of a bank's capital adequacy.

In the interim, banks must maintain minimum capital-to-total assets ratios as required by 12 CFR part 3, and should begin preparing for the implementation of these risk-based capital guidelines. In this regard, each national bank that does not currently meet the final minimum ratio established in section 4(b)(1) of this appendix A should begin planning for achieving that standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> These risk-based capital guidelines will not be applied to federal branches and agencies of foreign banks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this appendix A, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adjusted carrying value means, for purposes of section 2(c)(5) of this appendix A, the aggregate value that investments are carried on the balance sheet of the bank reduced by any unrealized gains on the investments that are reflected in such carrying value but excluded from the bank's Tier 1 capital and reduced by any associated deferred tax liabilities. For example, for investments held as available-for-sale (AFS), the adjusted carrying value of the investments would be the aggregate carrying value of the investments (as reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the bank) less any unrealized gains on those investments that are included in other comprehensive income and that are not reflected in Tier 1 capital, and less any associated deferred tax liabilities. Unrealized losses on AFS nonfinancial equity investments must be deducted from Tier 1 capital in accordance with section 1(c)(10) of this appendix A. The treatment of small business investment companies that are consolidated for accounting purposes under generally accepted accounting principles is discussed in section 2(c)(5)(ii) of this appendix A. For investments in a nonfinancial company that is consolidated for accounting purposes, the bank's adjusted carrying value of the investment is determined under the equity method of accounting (net of any intangibles associated with the investment that are deducted from the bank's Tier 1 capital in accordance with section 2(c)(2) of this appendix A). Even though the assets of the nonfinancial company are consolidated for accounting purposes, these assets (as well as the credit equivalent amounts of the company's off-balance sheet items) are excluded from the bank's risk-weighted assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allowances for loan and lease losses means the balance of the valuation reserve on December 31, 1968, plus additions to the reserve charged to operations since that date, less losses charged against the allowance net of recoveries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Asset-backed commercial paper program means a program that primarily issues externally rated commercial paper backed by assets or other exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote, special-purpose entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Asset-backed commercial paper sponsor means a bank that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Establishes an asset-backed commercial paper program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Approves the sellers permitted to participate in an asset-backed commercial paper program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Approves the asset pools to be purchased by an asset-backed commercial paper program; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Administers the asset-backed commercial paper program by monitoring the assets, arranging for debt placement, compiling monthly reports, or ensuring compliance with the program documents and with the program's credit and investment policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Associated company means any corporation, partnership, business trust, joint venture, association or similar organization in which a national bank directly or indirectly holds a 20 to 50 percent ownership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Banking and finance subsidiary means any subsidiary of a national bank that engages in banking- and finance-related activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Cash items in the process of collection means checks or drafts in the process of collection that are drawn on another depository institution, including a central bank, and that are payable immediately upon presentation in the country in which the reporting bank's office that is clearing or collecting the check or draft is located; U.S. Government checks that are drawn on the United States Treasury or any other U.S. Government or Government-sponsored agency and that are payable immediately upon presentation; broker's security drafts and commodity or bill-of-lading drafts payable immediately upon presentation in the United

States or the country in which the reporting bank's office that is handling the drafts is located; and unposted debits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Central government means the national governing authority of a country; it includes the departments, ministries and agencies of the central government and the central bank. The U.S. Central Bank includes the 12 Federal Reserve Banks. The definition of central government does not include the following: State, provincial, or local governments; commercial enterprises owned by the central government, which are entities engaged in activities involving trade, commerce, or profit that are generally conducted or performed in the private sector of the United States economy; and non-central government entities whose obligations are guaranteed by the central government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Commitment means any arrangement that obligates a national bank to: (i) Purchase loans or securities; or (ii) extend credit in the form of loans or leases, participations in loans or leases, overdraft facilities, revolving credit facilities, home equity lines of credit, liquidity facilities, or similar transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Common stockholders' equity means common stock, common stock surplus, undivided profits, capital reserves, and adjustments for the cumulative effect of foreign currency translation, less net unrealized holding losses on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Conditional guarantee means a contingent obligation of the United States Government or its agencies, or the central government of an OECD country, the validity of which to the beneficiary is dependent upon some affirmative action--e.g., servicing requirements--on the part of the beneficiary of the guarantee or a third party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Deferred tax assets means the tax consequences attributable to tax carryforwards and deductible temporary differences. Tax carryforwards are deductions or credits that cannot be used for tax purposes during the current period, but can be carried forward to reduce taxable income or taxes payable in a future period or periods. Temporary differences are financial events or transactions that are recognized in one period for financial statement purposes, but are recognized in another period or periods for income tax purposes. Deductible temporary differences are temporary differences that result in a reduction of taxable income in a future period or periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Derivative contract means generally a financial contract whose value is derived from the values of one or more underlying assets, reference rates or indexes of asset values. Derivative contracts include interest rate, foreign exchange rate, equity, precious metals and commodity contracts, or any other instrument that poses similar credit risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Depository institution means a financial institution that engages in the business of banking; that is recognized as a bank by the bank supervisory or monetary authorities of the country of its incorporation and the country of its principal banking operations; that receives deposits to a substantial extent in the regular course of business; and that has the power to accept demand deposits. In the U.S., this definition encompasses all federally insured offices of commercial banks, mutual and stock savings banks, savings or building and loan associations (stock and mutual), cooperative banks, credit unions, and international banking facilities of domestic depository institution. Bank holding companies are excluded from this definition. For the purposes of assigning risk weights, the differentiation between OECD depository institutions and non-OECD depository institutions is based on the country of incorporation. Claims on branches and agencies of foreign banks located in the United States are to be categorized on the basis of the parent bank's country of incorporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Equity investment means, for purposes of section 1(c)(19) and section 2(c)(5) of this appendix A, any equity instrument including warrants and call options that give the holder the right to purchase an equity instrument, any equity feature of a debt instrument (such as a warrant or call option), and any debt instrument that is convertible into equity. An investment in any other instrument, including subordinated debt or other types of debt instruments, may be treated as an equity investment if the OCC determines that the instrument is the functional equivalent of equity or exposes the bank to essentially the same risks as an equity instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Exchange rate contracts include: Cross-currency interest rate swaps; forward foreign exchange rate contracts; currency options purchased; and any similar instrument that, in the opinion of the OCC, gives rise to similar risks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> Goodwill is an intangible asset that represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Intangible assets include mortgage and non-mortgage servicing assets (but exclude any interest only (IO) strips receivable related to these mortgage and nonmortgage servicing assets), purchased credit card relationships, goodwill, favorable leaseholds, and core deposit value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Interest rate contracts include: Single currency interest rate swaps; basis swaps; forward rate agreements; interest rate options purchased; forward forward deposits accepted; and any similar instrument that, in

the opinion of the OCC, gives rise to similar risks, including when-issued securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(20)</em> Liquidity facility means a legally binding commitment to provide liquidity to various types of transactions, structures or programs. A liquidity facility that supports asset-backed commercial paper, in any amount, by lending to, or purchasing assets from any structure, program, or conduit constitutes an asset-backed commercial paper liquidity facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(21)</em> Multifamily residential property means any residential property consisting of five or more dwelling units including apartment buildings, condominiums, cooperatives, and other similar structures primarily for residential use, but not including hospitals, nursing homes, or other similar facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(22)</em> Nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) means an entity recognized by the Division of Market Regulation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (or any successor Division) (Commission or SEC) as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization for various purposes, including the Commission's uniform net capital requirements for brokers and dealers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(23)</em> Nonfinancial equity investment means any equity investment held by a bank in a nonfinancial company through a small business investment company (SBIC) under section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 (15 U.S.C. 682(b)) or under the portfolio investment provisions of Regulation K (12 CFR 211.8(c)(3)). An equity investment made under section 302(b) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 in a SBIC that is not consolidated with the bank is treated as a nonfinancial equity investment in the manner provided in section 2(c)(5)(ii)(C) of this appendix A. A nonfinancial company is an entity that engages in any activity that has not been determined to be permissible for a bank to conduct directly or to be financial in nature or incidental to financial activities under section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act (12 U.S.C. 1843(k)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(24)</em> The OECD-based group of countries comprises all full members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) regardless of entry date, as well as countries that have concluded special lending arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow, \1\ but excludes any country that has rescheduled its external sovereign debt within the previous five years. These countries are hereinafter referred to as OECD countries. A rescheduling of external sovereign debt generally would include any renegotiation of terms arising from a country's inability or unwillingness to meet its external debt service obligations, but generally would not include renegotiations of debt in the normal course of business, such as a renegotiation to allow the borrower to take advantage of a decline in interest rates or other change in market conditions.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ As of November 1995, the OECD included the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States; and Saudi Arabia had concluded special lending arrangements with the IMF associated with the IMF's General Arrangements to Borrow.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(25)</em> Original maturity means, with respect to a commitment, the earliest possible date after a commitment is made on which the commitment is scheduled to expire (i.e., it will reach its stated maturity and cease to be binding on either party), provided that either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The commitment is not subject to extension or renewal and will actually expire on its stated expiration date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the commitment is subject to extension or renewal beyond its stated expiration date, the stated expiration date will be deemed the original maturity only if the extension or renewal must be based upon terms and conditions independently negotiated in good faith with the customer at the time of the extension or renewal and upon a new, bona fide credit analysis utilizing current information on financial condition and trends.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(26)</em> Preferred stock includes the following instruments: (i) Convertible preferred stock, which means preferred stock that is mandatorily convertible into either common or perpetual preferred stock; (ii) Intermediate-term preferred stock, which means preferred stock with an original maturity of at least five years, but less than 20 years; (iii) Long-term preferred stock, which means preferred stock with an original maturity of 20 years or more; and (iv) Perpetual preferred stock, which means preferred stock without a fixed maturity date that cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder, and that has no other provisions that will require future redemption of the issue. For purposes of these instruments, preferred stock that can be redeemed at the option of the holder is deemed to have an original maturity of the earliest possible date on which it may be so redeemed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(27)</em> Public-sector entities include states, local authorities and governmental subdivisions below the central government level in an OECD country. In the United States, this definition encompasses a state, county, city, town, or other municipal corporation, a public authority, and generally any publicly-owned entity that is an instrumentality of a

state or municipal corporation. This definition does not include commercial companies owned by the public sector. \1a\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1a\ See Definition (5), Central government, for further explanation of commercial companies owned by the public sector.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(28)</em> Reciprocal holdings of bank capital instruments means cross-holdings or other formal or informal arrangements in which two or more banking organizations swap, exchange, or otherwise agree to hold each other's capital instruments. This definition does not include holdings of capital instruments issued by other banking organizations that were taken in satisfaction of debts previously contracted, provided that the reporting national bank has not held such instruments for more than five years or a longer period approved by the OCC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(29)</em> Replacement cost means, with respect to interest rate and exchange rate contracts, the loss that would be incurred in the event of a counterparty default, as measured by the net cost of replacing the contract at the current market value. If default would result in a theoretical profit, the replacement value is considered to be zero. The mark-to-market process should incorporate changes in both interest rates and counterparty credit quality.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(30)</em> Residential properties means houses, condominiums, cooperative units, and manufactured homes. This definition does not include boats or motor homes, even if used as a primary residence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(31)</em> Risk-weighted assets means the sum of total risk-weighted balance sheet assets and the total of risk-weighted off-balance sheet credit equivalent amounts. Risk-weighted balance sheet and off-balance sheet assets are calculated in accordance with section 3 of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(32)</em> State means any one of the several states of the United States of America, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the territories and possessions of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(33)</em> Subsidiary means any corporation, partnership, business trust, joint venture, association or similar organization in which a national bank directly or indirectly holds more than a 50% ownership interest.

In those situations, the bank may assign the asset to the risk category applicable to the highest risk-weighted asset that pool is permitted to hold pursuant to its stated investment objectives in the fund's prospectus. Alternatively, the bank may assign the asset on a pro rata basis to different risk categories according to the investment limits in the fund's prospectus. In either case, the minimum risk weight that may be assigned to such a pool is 20%. If a bank assigns the asset on a pro rata basis, and the sum of the investment limits in the fund's prospectus exceeds 100%, the bank must assign the highest pro rata amounts of its total investment to the higher risk category. If, in order to maintain a necessary degree of liquidity, the fund is permitted to hold an insignificant amount of its assets in short-term, highly-liquid securities of superior credit quality (that do not qualify for a preferential risk weight), such securities generally will not be taken into account in determining the risk category into which the bank's holding in the overall pool should be assigned. The prudent use of hedging instruments by a fund to reduce the risk of its assets will not increase the risk weighting of the investment in that fund above the 20% category. However, if a fund engages in any activities that are deemed to be speculative in nature or has any other characteristics that are inconsistent with the preferential risk weighting assigned to the fund's assets, the bank's investment in the fund will be assigned to the 100% risk category.

The net current credit exposure is the net sum of all positive and negative mark-to-market values of the individual derivative contracts subject to a qualifying bilateral netting contract.

The pro rata share of the credit equivalent amount that has not been participated out is assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a direct credit substitute in which the bank has acquired a risk participation, the acquiring bank's pro rata share of the direct credit substitute is multiplied by the full amount of the assets that are supported by the direct credit substitute and converted using a 100% credit conversion factor. The resulting credit equivalent amount is then assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor in the underlying transaction, after considering any associated guarantees or collateral.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a direct credit substitute that takes the form of a syndication where each bank or participating entity is obligated only for its pro rata share of the risk and there is no recourse to the originating entity, each bank's credit equivalent amount will be calculated by multiplying only its pro rata share of the assets supported by the direct credit substitute by a 100% conversion factor.

Adequate internal credit risk rating systems usually contain the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The internal credit risk system is an integral part of the bank's risk management system that explicitly incorporates the full range of risks arising from a bank's participation in securitization activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Internal credit ratings are linked to measurable outcomes, such as the probability that the position will experience any loss, the position's expected loss given default, and the degree of variance in losses given default on that position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The bank's internal credit risk system must separately consider the risk associated with the underlying loans or borrowers, and the risk associated with the structure of a particular securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The bank's internal credit risk system must identify gradations of risk among ``pass'' assets and other risk positions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The bank must have clear, explicit criteria that are used to classify assets into each internal risk grade, including subjective factors;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The bank must have independent credit risk management or loan review personnel assigning or reviewing the credit risk ratings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An internal audit procedure should periodically verify that internal risk ratings are assigned in accordance with the bank's established criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The bank must monitor the performance of the internal credit risk ratings assigned to nonrated, nontraded direct credit substitutes over time to determine the appropriateness of the initial credit risk rating assignment and adjust individual credit risk ratings, or the overall internal credit risk ratings system, as needed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The internal credit risk system must make credit risk rating assumptions that are consistent with, or more conservative than, the credit risk rating assumptions and methodologies of NRSROs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Program Ratings. A direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not a residual interest) is assumed or retained by a bank in connection with a structured finance program and a NRSRO has reviewed the terms of the program and stated a rating for positions associated with the program. If the program has options for different combinations of assets, standards, internal credit enhancements and other relevant factors, and the NRSRO specifies ranges of rating categories to them, the bank may apply the rating category applicable to the option that corresponds to the bank's position. In order to rely on a program rating, the bank must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the credit risk rating assigned to the program meets the same standards generally used by NRSROs for rating traded positions. The bank must also demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that the criteria underlying the NRSRO's assignment of ratings for the program are satisfied for the particular position. If a bank participates in a securitization sponsored by another party, the OCC may authorize the bank to use this approach based on a program rating obtained by the sponsor of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Computer Program. The bank is using an acceptable credit assessment computer program to determine the rating of a direct credit substitute or recourse obligation (but not a residual interest) extended in connection with a structured finance program. A NRSRO must have developed the computer program and the bank must demonstrate to the OCC's satisfaction that ratings under the program correspond credibly and reliably with the rating of traded positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Limitations on risk-based capital requirements--(1) Low-level exposure rule.

A bank that measures the specific risk of a portfolio of debt positions under section 7(b) of this appendix using internal models must calculate at least weekly an incremental risk measure for that portfolio according to the requirements in this section. The incremental risk measure is the bank's measure of potential losses due to incremental risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions. With the prior approval of the OCC, a bank may choose to include portfolios of equity positions in its incremental risk model, provided that it consistently includes such equity positions in a manner that is consistent with how the bank internally measures and manages the incremental risk of such positions at the portfolio level. If equity positions are included in the model, for modeling purposes default is considered to have occurred upon the default of any debt of the issuer of the equity position.

The liquidity horizon of a position or set of positions is the time required for a bank to reduce its exposure to, or hedge all of its material risks of, the position(s) in a stressed market. The liquidity horizon for a position or set of positions may not be less than the shorter of three months or the contractual maturity of the position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A constant position assumption means that the bank maintains the same set of positions throughout the one-year horizon.

Simplified Supervisory Formula Approach</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. To use the SSFA to determine the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position, a bank must have data that enables it to assign accurately the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section. Data used to assign the parameters described in paragraph (b) of this section must be the most currently available data and no more than 91 calendar days old. A bank that does not have the appropriate data to assign the parameters described and defined, for purposes of this section, in paragraph (b) of this section must assign a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent to the position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> SSFA parameters. To calculate the specific risk-weighting factor for a securitization position using the SSFA, a bank must have accurate information on the five inputs to the SSFA calculation described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(5) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> KG is the weighted-average (with unpaid principal used as the weight for each exposure) total capital requirement of the underlying exposures calculated using appendix A to this part. KG is expressed as a decimal value between zero and 1 (that is, an average risk weight of 100 percent represents a value of KG equal to .08).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parameter W is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one. Parameter W is the ratio of the sum of the dollar amounts of any underlying exposures within the securitized pool that meet any of the criteria as set forth in paragraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph (b)(2) to the ending balance, measured in dollars, of underlying exposures:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ninety days or more past due;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subject to a bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the process of foreclosure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Held as real estate owned;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Has contractually deferred interest payments for 90 days or more; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Is in default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Parameter A is the attachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses will first be allocated to the position. Parameter A equals the ratio of the current dollar amount of underlying exposures that are subordinated to the position of the bank to the current dollar amount of underlying exposures. Any reserve account funded by the accumulated cash flows from the underlying exposures that is subordinated to the position that contains the bank's securitization exposure may be included in the calculation of parameter A to the extent that cash is present in the account. Parameter A is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Parameter D is the detachment point for the position, which represents the threshold at which credit losses of principal allocated to the position would result in a total loss of principal. Parameter D equals parameter A plus the ratio of the current dollar amount of the securitization positions that are pari passu with the position (that is, have equal seniority with respect to credit risk) to the current dollar amount of the underlying exposures. Parameter D is expressed as a decimal value between zero and one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A supervisory calibration parameter, p, is equal to 0.5 for securitization positions that are not resecuritization positions and equal to 1.5 for resecuritization positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Mechanics of the SSFA. KG and W are used to calculate KA, the augmented value of KG, which reflects the observed credit quality of the underlying pool of exposures. KA is defined in paragraph (d) of this section. The values of parameters A and D, relative to KA determine the specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a position as described in this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section. The specific risk-weighting factor assigned to a securitization position, or portion of a position, as appropriate, is the larger of the specific risk-weighting factor determined in accordance with this paragraph and paragraph (d) of this section and a specific risk-weighting factor of 1.6 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the detachment point, parameter D, for a securitization position is less than or equal to KA, the position must be assigned a specific risk-weighting factor of 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the attachment point, parameter A, for a securitization position is greater than or equal to KA, the bank must calculate the specific risk-weighting factor in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When A is less than KA and D is greater than KA, the specific risk-weighting factor is a weighted-average of 1.00 and KSSFA calculated in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section, but with the parameter A revised to be set equal to KA. For the purpose of this weighted-average calculation:
