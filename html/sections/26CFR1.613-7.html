                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Election of taxpayer. In the case of any taxable year ending after December 31, 1953, to which the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 is applicable, the taxpayer may elect in accordance with section 613(d) and this section to apply the appropriate percentage depletion rate specified in section 613 in respect of any mineral property (within the meaning of the 1939 Code). In the case of mines, wells, or other natural deposits listed in section 613(b), the election

may be made by the taxpayer irrespective of whether his depletion allowance with respect to the property for the taxable year was computed upon the basis of cost, discovery value, or upon a percentage of gross income from the property. Once made, the election shall be irrevocable with respect to the property for which it is exercised. The election may be made for any mineral property of the taxpayer and need not be made for all such properties. Gross income from the property and net income from the property shall have the same meaning as those terms are used in 26 CFR (1939) 39.23(m)-1 (Regulations 118).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Computation of depletion allowance. The depletion allowance for any taxable year with respect to any property for which the taxpayer makes the election under section 613(d) shall be an amount equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> That portion of a tentative allowance, computed under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 (without regard to paragraph (1) of section 613(d)), which the number of days in the taxable year prior to January 1, 1954, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year; plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That portion of a tentative allowance, computed by using the appropriate percentage depletion rate specified in section 613(b) (but otherwise computed under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939), which the number of days in the taxable year after December 31, 1953, bears to the total number of days in such taxable year

In the case of any taxable year beginning after December 31, 1953, and ending before August 17, 1954, the depletion allowance with respect to any property for which the taxpayer makes the election under section 613(d) shall be computed under the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939, except that the appropriate percentage depletion rate specified in section 613(b) shall be used. In making such computation, gross income from the property and net income from the property shall be determined in the same manner as specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A is a taxpayer who reports income on the basis of a taxable year ending June 30. For the taxable year ended June 30, 1954, A had gross income from a uranium property in the amount of $100,000 and his depletion allowance was computed with reference to percentage depletion. His net income from this property, for purposes of limiting the depletion allowance, was $40,000. The 15-percent rate of depletion provided for in the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 for metal mines resulted in a depletion allowance for the taxable year of $15,000. Percentage depletion computed with reference to the 23-percent rate provided for uranium under section 613(b) is $23,000 ($100,000 times 23 percent). However, the allowance computed on this basis is limited to $20,000 (50 percent of A's net income from the property). If A exercises the election provided for in section 613(d) his depletion allowance for the taxable year is the aggregate of $7,561.64 (184/365 times $15,000) plus $9,917.80 (181/365 times $20,000) or $17,479.44</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example 1 except that A's depletion allowance was computed on the basis of cost and amounted to $17,500. If the election is made, A's allowance for the taxable year is the aggregate of $8,821.92 (184/365 times $17,500) plus $9,917.80 (181/365 times $20,000) or $18,739.72.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Requirement for making election. (1) The election under section 613(d) shall be made by filing a statement with the district director with whom the income tax return was filed for the taxable year to which the election is applicable. Such statement shall indicate that an election is being made under section 613(d), shall contain a recomputation of the depletion allowance and the tax liability for all taxable years affected by the exercise of the election, and shall be accompanied either by a claim for refund or credit or by an amended return or returns, whichever is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The election under section 613(d) shall be made by filing a statement with the district director with whom the income tax return was filed for the taxable year to which the election is applicable.

If refund or credit of any overpayment resulting from the application of the amendment made by subsection (a) of this section is prevented on the date of the enactment of this Act, or within 6 months from such date, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to closing agreements, and other than section 3761 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to compromises), refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed within 6 months from such date. No interest shall be paid on any overpayment resulting from the application of the amendment made by subsection (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If refund or credit of any overpayment resulting from the application of section 613(d) is prevented on September 2, 1958, or on or before March 2, 1959, by the operation of any law or rule of law (other than section 3760 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7121 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to closing agreements, and other than section 3761 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 or section 7122 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, relating to compromises), refund or credit of such overpayment may, nevertheless, be made or allowed if claim therefor is filed on or before March 2, 1959. If such refund or credit is not prevented on or before March 2, 1959, the time for filing claim therefor shall be governed by the rules of law generally applicable to credits and refunds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount of any refund or credit which is allowable by reason of section 613(d) shall not exceed the decrease in income tax liability resulting solely from the application of the percentage rates specified in section 613(b). No interest shall be allowed or paid on any overpayment resulting from the application of section 613(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this section the decrease in income tax liability shall be the amount by which the tax previously determined (as defined in section 3801(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939) exceeds the tax as recomputed under section 613(d) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Adjustment to basis. Proper adjustment shall be made to the basis of any property as required by section 113(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 and 26 CFR (1939) 39.113(b)(1)-1(c) (Regulations 118) to reflect any change in the depletion allowance resulting from the application of section 613(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

In the case of a taxable year beginning before January 1, 1975, and ending after that date, the percentage depletion allowance (but not the cost depletion allowance) with respect to oil and gas wells for such taxable year shall be determined by treating the portion thereof in 1974 as if it were a short taxable year for purposes of section 613 and the portion thereof in 1975 as if it were a short taxable year for purposes of section 613A.

Under section 613A(c)(4), the oil equivalent of 1,200,000,000 cubic feet of gas is 200,000 barrels, bringing A's total production of oil and gas to which income was attributable for 1975 to the equivalent of 300,000 barrels of oil. A's average daily production was 821.92 barrels (300,000 barrels/ 365 days) which is less than the depletable oil quantity (2,000 barrels) before reduuction for any election by A under section 613A(c)(4). Accordingly, A may make an election with respect to A's entire gas production and thereby be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to A's entire 1975 income from production of oil and gas. A's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) and A's oil and gas properties would be the amount determined under section 613(a) computed at the 22 percent rate specified in section 613A(c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act 1990, for 1975.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a calendar year taxpayer, owns oil producing properties with 365,000 barrels of production to which income was attributable for 1975. B was a retailer of oil and gas for only the last 3 months of 1975. B's average daily production for 1975 was 1,000 barrels (365,000 barrels/365 days).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C, a calendar year taxpayer, owns property X with 500,000 barrels of primary production to which income was attributable for 1975 and property Y with 200,000 barrels of primary production to which income was attributable for 1975. Property Y had been transferred to C on January 1, 1975, on which date it was a proven property. Therefore, the exemption under section 613A(c)(1) does not apply to C with respect to production from property Y. In determining C's depletable oil quantity for the year, the production from property Y is not taken into account. Thus, C's average daily prduction for 1975 was 1,369.86 barrels (500,000 barrels/365).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. D owns an oil property with producing wells X and Y on it. In 1975 D converts well X into an injection well. Prior to the application of the secondary process, it is estimated that without the application of the process the annual production from well X would have been 50x barrels of oil and from well Y would have been 100x barrels of oil. For the taxable year in which injection is commenced production from well X is 10x barrels and from well Y is 180x barrels. Fortyx barrels of oil [190x barrels of oil (actual production from the property)--150x barrels (estimate of primary production from the property)] qualify as secondary production.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. E, a calendar year taxpayer, owns a domestic oil well which produced 100,000 barrels of oil in 1980. The proceeds from the sale of 15,000 barrels of that production are not includible in E's income until 1981. The 15,000 barrels produced in 1980 are included in E's average daily production for 1981 and excluded from such production for 1980.

See Sec. 1.705-1(a)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon the disposition of an oil or gas property by the partnership, each partner must subtract the partner's adjusted basis in the property from his or her allocable portion of the amount realized from the sale of the property to determine gain or loss. The partner's allocable portion of amount realized must, except to the extent governed by section 704(c) (or related principles under Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4)(i)), be determined in accordance with Sec. 1.704-1(b)(4)(v). Except as otherwise provided (e.g., section 751), the sale of a partnership interest is not treated as a sale of an oil and gas property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a transfer of an interest in a partnership, the transferor partner's adjusted basis in each partnership oil or gas property carries over to the transferee partner. If an election under section 754 (relating to optional adjustment to the basis of partnership property) is in effect, such basis is adjusted in accordance with section 743.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of section 732 (relating to basis of distributed property other than money) and section 734(b) (relating to optional adjustment to basis of partnership property), the partnership's adjusted basis in oil and gas property is an amount equal to the aggregate of its partners' adjusted bases in the property as determined under the rules provided in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A, B, and C have equal interests in capital in Partnership ABC. On January 1, 1992, the partnership acquired a producing domestic oil property. The partnership's basis in the property was $90x. The partnership allocated the adjusted basis of the property to each partner in proportion to the partner's interest in partnership capital. Accordingly, each partner was allocated an adjusted basis of $30x. Each partner must separately compute his or her depletion allowance. The amount of percentage depletion allowable for each partner for 1992 was $10x. On January 1, 1993, each partner's adjusted basis in the property was $20x ($30x minus $10x). On January 1, 1993, the oil property was sold for $150x. Each partner's gain was $30x ($50x allocable share of amount realized minus the partner's adjusted basis of $20x). Each partner must adjust the partner's adjusted basis in his or her partnership interest to reflect the gain.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that on January 1, 1993, the property was not sold but transferred by the partnership to partner A. A's basis in the property was $60x (the sum of A's, B's, and C's adjusted bases in the property).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 1 with the exception that in 1992 C was a retailer of oil and gas and was only entitled to a cost depletion deduction of $5x. C's gain from the sale of the mineral property on January 1, 1993, was $25x ($50x allocable share of amount realized minus C's adjusted basis of $25x ($30x minus $5x)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. D, a calendar year taxpayer, is a partner in Partnership DEF which owns a domestic producing oil property. On January 1, 1993, the partnership's adjusted basis in the property was $900x. On January 1, 1993, D's adjusted basis in D's partnership interest was $300x and D's adjusted basis in the partnership's oil property was $300x. D's allowable percentage depletion for 1993 with respect to production from the oil property was $50x. On January 1, 1994, D's adjusted basis in D's partnership interest was $250x and D's adjusted basis in the partnership's oil property was $250x ($300x minus $50x).</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On January 1, 1990, G has an adjusted basis of $5x in partnership GH's proven domestic oil property, which is the sole asset of the partnership. On January 1, 1990 G sells G's partnership interest to I for $100x when the election under section 754 is in effect. I has a special basis adjustment for the oil property of $95x (the difference between I's basis, $100x, and I's share of the basis of the partnership property, $5x). I is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to I's distributive share of the oil property income because I is a transferee of an interest

in a proven oil property. However, I is entitled to cost depletion and for this purpose I's interest in the oil property has an adjusted basis to I of $100x ($5x, plus I's special basis adjustment of $95x).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On January 1, 1960, Partnership JK acquired a domestic producing oil property. On January 1, 1990, the partnership's adjusted basis in the property was zero. On January 1, 1990, L is admitted as a partner to the partnership. Since the partnership's adjusted basis in the oil property is zero, L's proportionate share of the basis in the property is also zero. L is not entitled to percentage depletion because L is a transferee of a proven oil property (see paragraph (g) of this section). Since the property's basis is zero, L is also not entitled to any cost depletion with respect to production from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> O and P have equal interests in capital in Partnership OP. On January 1, 1991, the partnership acquired an unproven domestic oil property X the basis of which is $200x to the partnership. The partnership allocates $100x of the basis of the property to each partner in accordance with each partner's proportionate interest in partnership capital. For the 1991 taxable year, O has a $10x cost depletion allowance and P has a $25x percentage depletion allowance. Accordingly, at the end of the 1991 taxable year, O's adjusted basis in the property is $90x, and P's adjusted basis in the property is $75x. On January 1, 1992, Q is admitted as an equal partner. The partnership does not use written data from the partners and must therefore assume that each partner was entitled to $25x depletion based on the assumptions provided in Sec. 1.613A-3(e)(3)(iii). This would result in a $50x combined depletion allowance for the partners and an aggregate adjusted basis in the oil property of $150x. Accordingly, the partnership allocates $50x of the basis of the property to Q, one-third of the aggregate adjusted basis determined by the partnership. O and P must each reduce their basis in the property by one-third. Accordingly, after the admission of Q, O's adjusted basis in the property is $60x ($90x minus $30x), and P's adjusted basis in the property is $50x ($75x minus $25x).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume the same facts as in paragraph (i) of this Example 7 except that O informs the partnership that its adjusted basis in the property is $90x (determined without regard to section 613A(d)(1)). The partnership uses the written data provided by O and determines the aggregate adjusted basis in the property to be $165x ($90x+$75x). Accordingly, the partnership allocates $55x (\1/3\ of $165x) of the basis of the property to Q, and O and P must each reduce their adjusted basis in the property by one-third, as in paragraph (i) of this Example 7. Thus, after the admission of Q, O's adjusted basis in the property is $60x and P's adjusted basis in the property is $50x.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> S corporations. For purposes of section 613A(c)(13), adjustments to shareholders' adjusted bases in any domestic oil or gas property to reflect capital expenditures by S corporations, the addition of a new shareholder or an increase in a shareholder's interest by reason of a contribution to the S corporation, the redemption of a shareholder's interest, or other appropriate transaction shall be made in accordance with principles similar to the principles under Sec. 1.613A-3(e) applicable to the entry or withdrawal of a partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Trusts and estates. (1) In the case of production from domestic oil and gas properties held by a trust or estate, the depletion allowance under section 611 shall be computed initially by the trust or estate. The determination of whether cost or percentage depletion is applicable shall be made at the trust or estate level, but such determination shall not result in the disallowance of cost depletion to a beneficiary of a trust or estate for whom cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion. The limitations contained in section 613A (c) and (d), other than section 613A(d)(1), shall be applied at the trust or estate level in its computation of percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A and shall also be applied by a beneficiary with respect to any percentage depletion apportioned to the beneficiary by the trust or estate. The limitation of section 613A(d)(1) shall be applied by each taxpayer (i.e., trust, estate or beneficiary) only with respect to its allocable share of percentage depletion under section 611(b) (3) or (4). For purposes of adjustments to the basis of oil or gas properties held by a trust or estate, in the absence of clear and convincing evidence to the contrary, it shall be presumed that no beneficiary is affected by any section 613A (d) limitations or by the rules contained in section 613A(c)(8) and (9) (relating to businesses under common control and members of the same family and to transfers, respectively), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990, or has any oil or gas production from sources other than the trust or estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of production from domestic oil and gas properties held by a trust or estate, the depletion allowance under section 611 shall be computed initially by the trust or estate.

A is the income beneficiary of a trust the only asset of which is a domestic producing oil property. The trust instrument requires that an amount which equals 10 percent of the gross income from the property be set aside annually as a reserve for depletion. In 1975 the property a had production of 1,095,000 barrels of oil. The trust's gross income from the property in 1975 was $30,000x. In that year, after setting aside $3,000x of income for the reserve for depletion, the trustee distributed the remaining income to A which represented 80 percent of the trust's net income. The percentage depletion computed by the trust with respect to the production (computed as if section 613 applied to all of the production at the rate specified in section 613A(c)(5), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) for 1975 was $6,600x. The trust's average daily production for 1975 was 3,000 barrels (1,095,000 / 365 days). The trust's allowable depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) with respect to the production was $4,400x:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08OC91.007

Pursuant to Sec. 1.611-1(c)(4)(ii), the percentage depletion of $4,400x was apportioned between the trustee and A so that the trustee received $3,000x (an amount equal to the amount of income set aside for the reserve for depletion) and A received $1,400x of the depletion deduction. The $1,400x depletion received by A is attributable to 80 percent of the trust's depletable oil quantity, i.e., 1,600 barrels per day.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a retailer of oil and gas, is the income beneficiary of a trust the only asset of which is a domestic producing oil property. In 1975 the trustee distributed one-half of the trust's net income and accumulated the other one-half for the benefit of the remainderman. One-half of the percentage depletion computed by the trust with respect to the production from the property was apportioned to B. Since B is a retailer of oil and gas, B is not entitled to deduct any of the percentage depletion apportioned to B. However, B is entitled to take cost depletion with respect to one-half of the production from the oil property, notwithstanding the fact that depletion was computed at the trust level on the basis of percentage depletion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Businesses under common control; members of the same family--(1) Component members of a controlled group.

Accordingly, the group shares the depletable oil (or natural gas) quantity prescribed for a taxpayer for the taxable year and the secondary production (to which gross income from the property is attributable before January 1, 1984) of a member of the group will reduce the other members' share of the group's depletable quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Component members of a controlled group.

Corporations O and P are members of a controlled group and are treated as one taxpayer as provided in paragraph (h)(1) of this section. Corporation O owns oil properties A and B. Property A had primary production for 1975 of 800,000 barrels of oil. Property B had secondary production for 1975 of 365,000 barrels of oil. Corporation P owns oil property C which had primary production of 660,000 barrels for 1975. The allowable percentage depletion with respect to property B's secondary production was $360x.

On January 1, 1975, Individual A transfers proven oil properties to Corporation M in an exchange to which section 351 applies for shares of its stock. Since there is no allocation requirement pursuant to section 613A(c)(8) between A (the transferor) and Corporation M (the transferee), the transfer of the proven properties by A is a transfer for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) and percentage depletion is not allowable to Corporation M with respect to such properties.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1975, Corporation N sells proven oil property to Corporation O, its wholly-owned subsidiary. Because the transfer was made between corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations, Corporation O is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the property so long as the tentative oil quantity is allocated between the two corporations. If Corporation N were a retailer, the tentative oil quantity would not be required to be allocated between the two corporations (see example 2 of Sec. 1.613A-3(h)(5)), and Corporation O would not be entitled to percentage depletion on the production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. B, owner of a proven oil property, died on January 1, 1975. Pursuant to the provisions of B's will, B's estate transferred the oil property on April 1, 1975, into a trust. On July 1, 1976, pursuant to a requirement in B's will, the trustee distributed the oil property to C. The transfer of the oil property by the estate to the trust and the later distribution of the property by the trust to C are transfers at death. Therefore, the trust was entitled to compute percentage depletion with respect to the production from the oil property when the property was owned by the trust and C is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the oil property after the trust distributes the property to C.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On January 1, 1975, property which produces oil resulting from secondary processes was transferred to D. The exemption under section 613A(c) applies to D because section 613A(c)(9) (relating to transfers of oil or gas property), as in effect in 1975, does not apply with respect to secondary production. In addition, even if at the time of the transfer the production from the property was primary and D applied secondary processes to the property transferred and obtained secondary production, D would be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the secondary production.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On July 1, 1975, E and F entered into a contract whereby F is given the privilege of drilling a well on E's unproven property, and if F does so F is to own the entire working interest in the property until F has recoverd all the costs of drilling, equipping, and operating the well. Thereafter, 50 percent of the working interest would revert to E. In accordance with the contract, 50 percent of the working interest reverted to E on July 1, 1976. F is entitled to percentage depletion because the transfer of the working interest to F occurred when the property was unproven on July 1, 1975, which is the date of the contract establishing F's right to the working interest. E is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to this working interest since the reversion of such interest with respect to which E was eligible for percentage depletion is not a transfer. However, if on the date of the contract E's property was proven (although not proven when E acquired the property), F would not be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to any of the working interest income. Nonetheless, E would still be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to E's working interest since the reversion of the interest is not a transfer.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6.

July 1, 1976, G exercised G's option. G is entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to G's working interest since the conversion of the royalty interest which is eligible for percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) into an interest which constituted part of an interest previously owned by G is not a transfer pursuant to Sec. 1.613A-7(n)(8).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7.

On January 1, 1977, the trustee distributed the property to I and J as equal tenants in common. Since I, J, and their father are members of the same family within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C), the transfer of the property to the trust by the father, the shifting of income between I and J, and the distribution of the oil property by the trust to I and J are not transfers for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990). However, the distribution of the oil property will constitute a transfer to each distributee on the date on which the distributee reaches majority under state law.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. In 1975, K transferred a proven oil property productive at 5,000 feet to L. Subsequent to the transfer, L drilled new wells on the property finding another reservoir at 10,000 feet. The two zones were combined under section 614 as a single property. L is not entitled to percentage depletion on the gross income attributable to the production from the productive zone at 5,000 feet, but is entitled to percentage depletion on the gross income attributable to the production from the productive zone at 10,000 feet because that zone was not part of the proven property until the date of development expenses by L, which is after the date of the transfer. Accordingly, L's maximum allowable percentage depletion deduction for 1975 would be zero percent of gross income from the property with respect to the production from 5,000 feet, plus 22 percent of gross income from the property with respect to the production from 10,000 feet. This maximum deduction would be subject to the limitation provided for in section 613(a), i.e.,50 percent of ``taxable income from the property (computed without allowance for depletion),'' such taxable income being the overall taxable income resulting from the sale of production from both zones, and would also be subject to the limitations provided in section 613A. The production from the productive zone at 5,000 feet is not taken into account in determining K's depletable oil quantity for the year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. On July 1, 1975, M transferred an oil property with a fair market value of $100x to N. On February 1, 1976, N commenced production of oil from the property. The fair market value of the property on February 1, 1976, as reduced by actual costs incurred by N for equipment and intangible drilling and development costs, was $300x. Because the value of the property on transfer was not 50 percent or more of the value on February 1, 1976, the property transferred to N was not a proven property (see Sec. 1.613A-7(p)). However, if there had been only marginal production from the property so that the fair market value of the property on February 1, 1976, was $40x rather than $300x, the property transferred to N would have been a proven property provided the other requirements of a proven property were met.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10.

The reversion of the remainder interest to O is not a transfer (see Sec. 1.613A-7(n)(7)). Accordingly, the transfer of the interest in oil and gas property to O is deemed to have occurred on January 1, 1970, the date O's interest was created.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. On January 1, 1976, P, Q, and R entered into a partnership for the acquisition of oil and gas leases. It was agreed that the sharing of income will be divided equally among P, Q, and R. However, it was further agreed that with respect to the first production obtained from each property acquired P will receive 80 percent thereof and Q and R each will receive 10 percent thereof until $100x has been received by P. Assume these allocations have substantial economic effect under section 704 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. On February 1, 1976, Partnership PQR acquired an unproven property and production therefrom was shared pursuant to the partnership agreement. P is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the production allocated to him since the transfer of right to the production is deemed to have been made on the date the partnership agreement became applicable to the specific property, at which time the property was unproven. See Sec. 1.613A-7(n) for rules relating to the definition of transfer. Similarly, when $100x has been obtained and Q and R each commence receiving 33\1/3\ percent of the revenue, Q and R are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to their entire interests. However, if the property had been proven when acquired by the partnership, P, Q, and R would not be entitled to claim any percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 12. On December 30, 1960, S placed producing oil property in trust for the benefit of S's nephew, T, and executed a trust

agreement which required the trustee of the trust to transfer the oil property to T on January 1, 1975. The trustee's transfer of the oil property to T on January 1, 1975, is deemed to have occurred on December 30, 1960 (see Sec. 1.613A-7(n)). Since the transfer is deemed to have occurred before January 1, 1975, section 613A(c) applies with respect to the production from the oil property. Moreover, if the trustee was not required to transfer the oil property on a specific date but was given discretion to select the date of transfer, the transfer of such property would still be deemed to have occurred on December 30, 1960. However, the result would be different if the trust agreement had provided that the trustee, at the trustee's discretion, may transfer the oil property to T on January 1, 1975, but is not under any obligation to transfer the property to T on January 1, 1975, or on any other date. Since the transfer was discretionary, the date of the actual transfer governs.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13. On January 1, 1974, U acquired an oil property. On February 1, 1974, U granted V an option to purchase the oil property. V exercised V's option on March 2, 1975, and subsequently the oil property was conveyed to V. The date of the transfer was March 2, 1975, the day V exercised V's option (on which date both parties were bound).</p><p class="depth0">Example 14. On July 1, 1974, W executed a deed conveying oil and gas property to X. W delivered the deed to X on January 1, 1975. Under state law, the mere execution of the deed without delivery did not give X any rights in the property. Title to the oil property passed to X on the date of delivery. Therefore, the date of transfer was January 1, 1975.</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Y, owner of a proven oil property, transferred Y's interest therein on July 25, 1975, to a revocable trust of which Y is treated as the owner under section 676. Y is not deemed a transferee and section 613A(c) applies to Y because immediately preceding the transfer Y was entitled to percentage depletion on the production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 16. On January 1, 1975, a proven oil property was transferred to Z; therefore, section 613A(c)(1) did not apply with respect to the production from such property. After Z's death, neither Z's estate nor its beneficiaries are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the decedent's oil property since Z was a transferee of proven property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 17. Partnership ABC, owner of proven oil and gas properties, admitted D as a partner in 1975 in consideration of cash. The shares of Partners A, B, and C of the partnership income were proportionately reduced so that D had a 25 percent interest in the income. D is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to D's share of partnership oil and gas income because D is a transferee for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990). See Sec. 1.613A-7(n).</p><p class="depth0">Example 18. On January 1, 1975, E and F formed Partnership EF to which E contributed proven oil property. For 1975, pursuant to the partnership agreement 70 percent of the mineral income from the property was allocated to E and 30 percent of the mineral income from the property was allocated F. F is not entitled to percentage depletion with respect to production from the property because F is a transferee of an interest in proven property. However, E is not a transferee of an interest in proven property because E was entitled to percentage depletion on the oil produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. Therefore, E is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the income allocated to E. However, if in 1976 the partnership agreement were revised so that E's interest in the income was increased by 10 percent, E would not be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the additional 10 percent interest because E is a transferee with respect thereto.</p><p class="depth0">Example 19. G is the owner of a \1/3\ interest in a partnership owning a proven oil property, and as such is entitled to \1/3\ of the income from the property. G received a distribution on July 1, 1975, from the partnership of a \1/3\ interest in the proven oil property. Although the transfer of such interest is a transfer for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), G is still entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the \1/3\ interest in the oil production from the property since G was entitled to percentage depletion on such production with respect to such property immediately before the transfer. If the entire property were distributed to G, G's percentage depletion allowance would still be based on only \1/3\ of the oil produced.</p><p class="depth0">Example 20. H and I contributed property X and property Y respectively to Partnership HI. The partnership agreement provides that all the gross income from property X is to be allocated to H and all the gross income from property Y is to be allocated to I. Assume these allocations have substantial economic effect under section 704 of the Code and the regulations thereunder. For 1975 H and I each received $100x gross income. Although the contributions of the properties by H and I are transfers for purposes of section 613A(c)(9) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990), both H and I are entitled to percentage depletion with respect to the $100x income received since each was entitled to a percentage depletion allowance with respect to the property contributed immediately before the transfer. However, if no special allocation of income were made but H and I are to share equally in the income from both properties, each would be entitled to a depletion allowance based on only one-half of the production with respect to the

property he had contributed. If property X produces $100x of gross income from the property and property Y produces $200x of gross income from the property, H would be entitled to percentage depletion but only with respect to $50x (50 percent of $100x) of gross income from the property and I would be entitled to percentage depletion with respect to $100x (50 percent of $200x) of gross income from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transfers after October 11, 1990--(i) General rule. Section 613A(c) (9) and (10), as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990 (relating to prohibition of percentage depletion on transferred proven properties) has been repealed effective for transfers after October 11, 1990. Accordingly, a transferee of a proven oil or gas property transferred after October 11, 1990 is permitted to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. For purposes of transfers of property occurring before October 12, 1990 under section 613A(c)(10), prior to its repeal, the disposition of stock after October 11, 1990 by a transferor will not result in a reduction in the depletable quantity of the transferee corporation under section 613A(c)(10)(F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.

A person shall not be treated as a transferee with respect to a transferred property to the extent that such person held an interest in the property but was not entitled to a percentage depletion allowance on mineral produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. Thus, for example, if a taxpayer who is not entitled to claim percentage depletion on a proven property transfers the property to a partnership for an interest in the partnership, the taxpayer is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effective date. The provisions of paragraph (i)(2) of Sec. 1.613A-3 are effective for transfers occurring after May 13, 1991.

The examples below illustrate the provisions of this subparagraph. The examples ignore the application of any restriction on percentage depletion other than the proven property transfer rule.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 31, 1991, A transfers a proven oil property to B. B may claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property regardless of whether production from the property was eligible for percentage depletion in A's hands (even if A were a retailer or refiner of oil or gas).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On October 10, 1990, A transfers a proven oil property to B. B may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On January 1, 1990, C purchases a proven oil property. Because C is a transferee of a proven property, production from the property is not eligible for percentage depletion in C's hands. On December 31, 1991, C contributes the property to Corporation M, an S corporation in which C owns 100 percent of the stock. The contribution of the property is a transfer, but C is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the corporation. Accordingly, C may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. However, if prior to the contribution C had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, C would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property after the contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On December 31, 1991, C contributes a proven oil property (with respect to which C is not entitled to claim percentage depletion) to Corporation N, an S corporation in which C owns 30 percent and D owns 70 percent of the stock. The contribution of the property is a transfer, but C is not a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of the corporation. Accordingly, C may not claim percentage depletion with respect to C's share of the production from the property. D is a transferee with respect to the property in the hands of Corporation N, and may claim percentage depletion with respect to D's share of production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On December 31, 1991, D transfers a proven oil property (with respect to which D is not entitled to claim percentage depletion) to DE, an equal partnership between D and E. E is a transferee with respect to the property and may claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property allocated to E under the DE partnership agreement. D is not a transferee with respect to the property, and may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property allocated to D under the DE partnership agreement. However, if D had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, then D would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect

to production from the property in the hands of DE.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On January 1, 1990, Corporation P contributes a proven property to Corporation O, its wholly owned subsidiary. Under Sec. 1.613A-7(n)(4), the contribution is not treated as a transfer, but only for so long as the tentative quantity is required under section 613A(c)(8) to be allocated between P and O. On December 31, 1991, P sells 90% of the O stock to an unrelated person; accordingly, the tentative quantity is no longer required under section 613A(c)(8) to be allocated between P and O. After the sale of O stock, production from the property in O's hands is eligible for percentage depletion because a transfer of a proven property is deemed to occur upon the transfer of the stock.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. On October 10, 1990, G transfers a proven oil property to his minor son, H. G had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. Under Sec. 1.613A-7(n)(5), H is permitted to claim percentage depletion for so long as G and H are related persons under section 613A(c)(8)(C). On December 31, 1991, H reaches majority and is no longer related to G under section 613A(c)(8)(C). H is entitled to continue to claim percentage depletion on production from the property because the property is treated as being transferred to H on December 31, 1991.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. On December 31, 1991, I sells a proven property to J, her husband. I had not been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

Accordingly, J may not claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property. If, however, I had been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property, J would be entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. On December 31, 1991, L inherits a proven property from K. K had not been entitled to claim percentage depletion with respect to production from the property.

The amount disallowed (as defined in paragraph (q) of Sec. 1.613A-7) shall be carried over to the succeeding year and treated as an amount allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) for such succeeding year, subject to the 65-percent limitation of section 613A(d)(1). For rules relating to corporations filing a consolidated return, see the regulations under section 1502. With respect to fiscal year taxpayers, except as provided in Sec. 1.613A-1 for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1975, and ending after that date, the limitation shall be calculated on the entire fiscal year and not applied with respect to each short period included in a fiscal year. For purposes of basis adjustments and determining whether cost depletion exceeds percentage depletion with respect to the production from a property, any amount disallowed as a deduction after the application of this paragraph shall be allocated to the respective properties from which the oil or gas was produced in proportion to the percentage depletion otherwise allowable to such properties pursuant to section 613A(c). Accordingly, the maximum amount which may be allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) after application of this paragraph (65 percent x adjusted taxable income) shall be allocated to properties for which percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would be allowed in the absence of the limitation contained in section 613A(d)(1) by application of the same proportion.

See example 1 of paragraph (a)(2) of this section. If the taxpayer becomes entitled to the deduction in a later year (i.e., because the disallowed depletion does not exceed 65 percent of the taxpayer's taxable income for that year after taking account of any percentage depletion deduction otherwise allowable for that year), then the basis of the taxpayer's properties must be adjusted downward (but not below zero) by the amount of the deduction in proportion to the portion of the amount disallowed to the respective properties in the year of the disallowance. However, if the property in question was disposed of by the taxpayer prior to the beginning of such later year, the

amount of the deduction in such later year shall be reduced by the difference between the taxpayer's adjusted basis in the property at the time it is disposed of and the adjusted basis which the taxpayer would have had in the property in the absence of the 65-percent limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The application of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1.

With respect to property N, the depletion allowable pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $90x (cost depletion would have been zero). With respect to property O, the depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $50x (cost depletion would have been $10X). A's taxable income (as adjusted under Sec. 1.613A-4(a)(1)) for 1975 was $100x; accordingly, A's percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) for 1975 must be reduced from $200x to $65x (65 percent x $100 x taxable income).

Therefore, the $65x ceiling applies to the percentage depletion allowable on properties N and O. Of that amount, $41.79x:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08OC91.015
is allocated to property N, and $23.21x:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC08OC91.016

is allocated to property O.</p><p class="depth0">Accordingly, A is allowed a total depletion deduction of $105x ($40x cost depletion on property M + $41.79x percentage depletion on property N + $23.21x percentage depletion on property O). The amount disallowed to A under section 613A(d)(1) is $95x ($200x aggregate depletion allowable before application of section 613A(d)(1) - $105x [$40x cost depletion allowable on property M + $41.79x percentage depletion allowable on property N after application of section 613A(d)(1) + $23.21x depletion allowable on property O after application of section 613A(d)(1)]). For purposes of basis adjustments, $20x ($60x percentage depletion before limitation - $40x cost depletion allowed) of the amount disallowed is allocated to property M.

B may carry forward the $125x as a deduction to 1977 and subsequent years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. C is a fiscal year taxpayer whose fiscal year ended on May 31, 1975. For purposes of applying the 65 percent of taxable income limitation, the period beginning January 1, 1975, and ending May 31, 1975, is treated as a short taxable year. The depletion allowable pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) for such short taxable year was $80x and A's taxable income (as adjusted under Sec. 1.613A-4(a)(1)) during such short taxable year was $100x. Only $65x (65 percent x $100x adjusted taxable income) of the deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) was deductible for such portion of 1975, in addition to any percentage depletion allowable for June 1, 1974, through December 31, 1974. With respect to the taxable year commencing June 1, 1975, and ending May 31, 1976, the 65 percent limitation is applied to the taxable income for the entire taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Under the trust law of State X, a trustee is required to allocate 22 percent of gross mineral income to the principal of a trust for purposes of maintaining a reserve for depletion and the depletion deduction is entirely allocated to the trustee. In 1975 the gross income of a trust in State X the only assets of which were oil properties was $1,000. The trust's allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $220. The trust incurred expenses of $150 for the taxable year and made distributions to beneficiaries (who are not described in the exception for family members set forth in paragraph (a)(1)(iv) of this section) of $630 ($1,000 gross income -$220 allocated to principal -$150 expenses). The trust's deduction for personal exemption under section 642(b) is $300. For purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation, the trust's taxable income was $550 ($1,000 gross income -$150 expenses -$300 exemption). The limitation under section 613A(d)(1) was $357.50 (65%x$550 taxable income). Accordingly, the trust's percentage depletion allowance was unaffected by the 65 percent limitation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. In 1980 the gross income of the estate of D was $1,000. The only assets of the estate were oil properties. The estate's adjusted basis in the oil properties was $0. The estate's allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to section 613A(d)(1) was $220. The estate incurred expenses of $150 for the taxable year and made distributions to beneficiaries of $425. The distributions thus equaled one half of the net income of the estate (ignoring depletion). Under section 611(b)(4), the percentage depletion is apportioned equally between the estate and its beneficiary. The distribution amount of $425 is deductible under section 661(a) in computing the taxable income of the estate. For purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation to the percentage depletion apportioned to the estate, the estate's taxable income was $0 ($1,000 gross income -$150 expenses -$425 distribution -$600 exemption). The limitation under section 613A(d)(1) was therefore also $0 (65%x$0 taxable income). Accordingly, the $110 amount is disallowed to the estate for the taxable year but may be carried forward by the estate as a deduction to 1981 and subsequent years. The beneficiaries shall apply the 65 percent limitation to the $110 percentage depletion apportioned to them based on their respective taxable incomes.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. In 1975 E sold an oil property for which E's adjusted basis was $20x. The amount disallowed for 1975 to E under section 613A(d) was $10x. The amount of the carryover under that section to 1976 was $0 ($10x disallowed amount -$10x [$20x adjusted basis of property on sale -$10x adjusted basis which taxpayer would have had in the property in the absence of the 65-percent limitation]). However, if the adjusted basis of the property on disposition had been $0, the amount of the carryover to 1976 would have been $10x ($10x disallowed amount -$0 adjusted basis of property on sale).</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. In 1975 F owned producing properties M, N, O, P, Q, and R. With respect to property M, the allowable cost depletion was $100x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) without regard to the depletable quantity and taxable income limitations contained in section 613A(c)(1), (6) and (d)(1) would have been $90x). With respect to property N, the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) before applying section 613A(d)(1) was $80x (cost depletion would have been $0). With respect to property O, the allowable cost depletion was $60x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would have been $70x, except that the application of section 613A(d)(1) reduced allowable percentage depletion to less than $60x). With respect to property P, the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(b) was $55x (cost depletion would have been $40x). With respect to property Q, which produces both gas subject to section 613A(b)(1)(B) and oil subject to section 613A(c), the allowable percentage depletion was $45x (cost depletion would have been $40x). With respect to property R, the allowable cost depletion was $40x (the allowable percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c) would have been $50x, except that the application of section 613A(c)(7)(A) reduced allowable percentage depletion to less than $40x). Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, for purposes of applying the 65 percent limitation under section 613A(d)(1), F's taxable income must be reduced by the allowable depletion with respect to property M (for which cost depletion exceeded percentage depletion even in the absence of section 613A(c)(1), (6), and (d)) and property P (for which all depletion is determined pursuant to section 613A(b)), but shall not be reduced by the allowable depletion with respect to properties N, O, Q, and R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Retailers excluded.

A, owner of producing oil and gas properties, also owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation M, a retailer of

oil and gas. None of A's production is sold through Corporation M. Since A may benefit from Corporation M's sales of oil and gas through A's ownership interest in Corporation M, A is considered to be selling oil or natural gas through Corporation M, a related person. Accordingly, the exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to A, even though none of A's production is sold through Corporation M.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that A has gross receipts of $2 million from sales of oil for the taxable year from A's retail outlets and Corporation M has gross receipts of $4 million from sales of oil for the taxable year from its retail outlets. For purposes of the $5 million gross receipts requirement of section 613A(d)(2), A is treated as having gross receipts of $6 million.

Corporation P, a producer of oil, owns 70 percent in value of the stock of Corporation Q. Corporation Q owns 30 percent in value of the stock of Corporation R. Corporation R owns 30 percent in value of the stock of Corporation S, a retailer of oil and gas. P indirectly owns 6.3 percent (70 percent x 30 percent x 30 percent) in value of the stock of Corporation S. Since P may benefit from Corporation S's sales of oil and gas through P's indirect ownership interest in Corporation S, P is not entitled to percentage depletion.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. B is the owner of certain oil and gas properties in Texas and is also the owner of a service station in Washington, DC, which B leases to Corporation T. None of B's production is sold to Corporation T. The exemption under section 613A(c) applies to B. However, if sales of B's production were made to Corporation T and the gross receipts from such sales of B's production to Corporation T exceed 5 million dollars, the exemption under section 613A(c) would not apply to B because B is selling oil or natural gas to a person given authority to occupy a retail outlet leased by the taxpayer, B.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. C has a \1/8\ royalty interest and Corporation U has a \7/8\ working interest in an oil property. Corporation V, a retailer of oil, owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation U. C has no interest in either corporation. All of the production from the property is sold through Corporation V, C receiving from Corporation U \1/8\ of its receipts therefrom. The exemption under section 613A(c) does not apply to Corporation U because Corporation U is selling oil of natural gas through Corporation V, a related person that is a retailer. However, the exemption applies to C because C, as owner of a nonoperating mineral interest, is not treated as an operator of a retail outlet merely because C's oil and gas is sold on C's behalf through a retail outlet operated by an unrelated person.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. D owns and operates retail grocery stores where refined oil may be purchased. D also owns oil and gas producing properties. If the sales of refined oil at each store location constitute less than 5 percent of the gross receipts from all sales made at that store, D is not considered a retailer by reason of such sales.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8.

L, a calendar year taxpayer, is the owner of a producing oil property. On September 1, 1976, L purchased a chain of

L's gross income from the oil property for the taxable year was $150x and L's taxable income from the property was $30x. L is treated as a retailer with respect to $50x of gross income from the property ($150xx122/366) and $10x of taxable income from the property ($30xx122/366). Therefore, L is entitled to percentage depletion with respect to $100x of gross income from the property ($150x minus $50x). However, the allowable percentage depletion is limited by the 50 percent of taxable income from the property limitation to $10x (50 percent times $20x taxable income ($30x minus $10x)).</p><p class="depth0">Example 15. Corporation M is a partner in Partnership MNO which is the owner of an operating interest in a producing oil property. Corporation P, a retailer of oil and gas, owns 5 percent in value of the stock of Corporation M. Partnership MNO sells its production to Corporation P. Corporation M is retailing oil through Corporation P, a related person, because its share of the oil is being sold on its behalf by the partnership through a retail outlet operated by a person related to Corporation M.

Sec. 1.613A-7  Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of section 613A and the regulations thereunder--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Domestic. The term domestic, as applied to oil and gas wells (or to production from such wells), refers to wells located in the United States or in a possession of the United States, as defined in section 638 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Natural gas. The term natural gas means any product (other than crude oil as defined in paragraph (g) of this section) of an oil or gas well if a deduction for depletion is allowable under section 611 with respect to such product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Regulated natural gas. Natural gas is considered to be ``regulated'' only if all of the following requirements are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The gas must be domestic gas produced and sold by the producer (whether for himself or on behalf of another person) before July 1, 1976,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The price for which the gas is sold by the producer must not be adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in liability of the seller for tax under chapter 1 of the Code by reason of the repeal of percentage depletion for gas,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sale of the gas must have been subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Power Commission for regulatory purposes,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An order or certificate of the Federal Power Commission must be in effect (or a proceeding to obtain such an order or certificate must have been instituted), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The price at which the gas is sold must be taken into account, directly or indirectly, in the issuance of the order or certificate by the Federal Power Commission. Price increases after February 1, 1975, are presumed to take increases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates to the contrary by clear and convincing evidence that the increases are wholly attributable to a purpose or purposes unrelated to the repeal of percentage depletion for gas (e.g., where the record of the Federal Power Commission clearly establishes that the Commission did not take the repeal into account). Increases to reflect additional State and local real property or severance taxes, increases for additional operating costs (such as costs of secondary or tertiary processes), adjustments for inflation, increases for additional drilling and related costs, or increases to reflect changes in the quality of gas sold, are some examples of increases that are not attributable to the repeal of percentage depletion for gas. In the absence of a statement in writing by the Federal Power Commission that the price of the gas in question was not in fact regulated, the requirement of paragraph (c)(5) of this section is deemed to have been met in any case in which the Federal Power Commission issued an order or certificate approving the sale to an interstate pipeline company or, in a case in which it is established by the taxpayer that the Federal Power Commission has influenced the price of such gas, an order or certificate permitting the interstate transportation of such gas. In addition, an ``emergency'' sale of natural gas to an interstate pipeline, which, pursuant to the authority contained in 18 CFR 2.68, 2.70, 157.22, and 157.29, may be

made without prior order approving the sale, is deemed to have met the requirements of paragraph (c) (3), (4), and (5) of this section. For purposes of meeting the requirements under this paragraph, it is not necessary that the total gas production from a property qualify as ``regulated natural gas.'' The determination of whether mineral production is ``regulated natural gas'' shall be made with respect to each sale of the mineral or minerals produced.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Natural gas sold under a fixed contract. The term natural gas sold under a fixed contract means domestic natural gas sold by the producer (whether for himself or on behalf of another person) under a contract, in effect on February 1, 1975, and at all times thereafter before such sale, under which the price for the gas during such period cannot be adjusted to reflect to any extent the increase in liabilities of the seller for tax under chapter 1 of the Code by reason of the repeal of percentage depletion for gas. The term may include gas sold under a fixed contract even though production sold under the contract had previously been treated as regulated natural gas. Price increases after February 1, 1975, are presumed to take increases in tax liabilities into account unless the taxpayer demonstrates to the contrary by clear and convincing evidence. Paragraph (c) of this section provides examples of increases which do not take increases in tax liabilities into account. However, if an adjustment provided for in the contract permits the possible increase in federal income tax liability of the seller to be taken into account to any extent, the gas sold under the contract after such an increase becomes permissible is not gas sold under a fixed contract. If the adjustment provided for in the contract provides for an increase in the price of the contract to the highest price paid to a producer for natural gas in the area, or if the price may be renegotiated, then gas sold under the contract after such an increase becomes permissible is presumed not to be sold under a fixed contract unless the taxpayer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that the price increase in no event takes increases in tax liabilities into account. For purposes of meeting the requirements of this paragraph, it is not necessary that the total gas production from a property qualify as ``natural gas sold under a fixed contract,'' for the determination of ``natural gas sold under a fixed contract'' is to be made with respect to each sale of each type of natural gas sold pursuant to each contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Qualified natural gas from geopressured brine. The term ``qualified natural gas from geopressured brine'' means any natural gas which is determined in accordance with section 503 of the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 to be produced from geopressured brine and which is produced from any well the drilling of which began after September 30, 1978, and before January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Average daily production. (1) The term average daily production means the taxpayer's aggregate production of domestic crude oil or natural gas, as the case may be, which is extracted after December 31, 1974, and to which gross income from the property is attributable during the taxable year divided by the number of days in such year. As used in the preceding sentence the term taxpayer includes a small business corporation as defined in section 1371 (as in effect prior to the enactment of the subchapter S Revision Act of 1982) and the regulations thereunder. Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 1.612-3 and except as provided in Sec. 1.613A-3(j)(2), in computing the average daily production for a taxable year only oil or gas which has been actually produced by the close of such taxable year is taken into account.

taxpayer's production shall be considered to be that amount of such production determined by multiplying the total production (which is produced after December 31, 1974, and to which gross income from the property is attributable during the taxable year) of the property by the taxpayer's percentage participation in the gross revenues from the property during the year. However, the portion of trust (or estate) production allocable to a beneficiary shall not exceed that amount of the trust's (or estate's) depletable oil quantity determined by multiplying such quantity by the beneficiary's percentage interest in the trust's (or estate's) gross income from the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Crude oil. For purposes of section 613A and the regulations thereunder, the term crude oil means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A mixture of hydrocarbons which existed in the liquid phase in natural underground reservoirs and which remains liquid at atmospheric pressure after passing through surface separating facilities,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hydrocarbons which existed in the gaseous phase in natural underground reservoirs but which are liquid at atmospheric pressure after being recovered from oil well (casinghead) gas in lease separators, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Natural gas liquid recovered from gas well effluent in lease separators or field facilities before any conversion process has been applied to such production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Depletable oil quantity. The taxpayer's depletable oil quantity, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(1)(A), shall be equal to the tentative quantity determined under the table contained in section 613A(c)(3)(B) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.613A-3 (except that, in the case of determinations with respect to days prior to January 1, 1984, such quantity shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the taxpayer's average daily secondary or tertiary production for the taxable year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Depletable natural gas quantity. The taxpayer's depletable natural gas quantity, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(1)(B), shall be equal to 6,000 cubic feet multiplied by the number of barrels of the taxpayer's depletable oil quantity to which the taxpayer elects to have section 613A(c)(4) apply. The taxpayer's depletable oil quantity for any taxable year shall be reduced (in addition to any reduction required to be made under paragraph (h) of this section) by the number of barrels with respect to which an election under section 613A(c)(4) for natural gas has been made. See Sec. 1.613A-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Barrel. The term barrel means 42 United States gallons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Secondary or tertiary production. For purposes of section 613A the term secondary or tertiary production means the increased production of domestic crude oil or natural gas from a property at any time after the application of a secondary or tertiary process. The increased production is the excess of actual production over the maximum primary production which would have resulted during the taxable year if the secondary or tertiary process had not been applied. The increased production may be due to an increase in either the rate or the duration of recovery. A secondary or tertiary process is a process applied for the recovery of hydrocarbons in which liquids, gases, or other matter is injected into the reservoir to supplement or augment the natural forces required to move the hydrocarbons through the reservoir. However, no process which must be introduced early in the productive life of the mineral property in order to be reasonably effective (such as cycling of gas in the case of a gas-condensate reservoir) is a secondary or tertiary process. A process (such as fire flooding or miscible fluid injection) introduced early in the productive life of the mineral property will not be disqualified as a secondary or tertiary process if a later introduction of the process in the property would still have been reasonably effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Controlled group of corporations. The term controlled group of corporations has the meaning given to such term by section 1563(a), except that section 1563(b)(2) shall not apply and except that ``more than 50 percent'' shall be substituted for `` at least 80 percent'' each place it appears in section 1563(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Related person. (1) A person is a related person to another person, within the meaning of section 613A(d) (2) and (4), paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1.613A-4,

and paragraphs (r) and (s) of this section, if either a significant ownership interest in such person is held by the other, or a third person has a significant ownership interest in both such persons. For purposes of determining a significant ownership interest, an interest owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate shall be considered as owned directly both by itself and proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries, as the case may be. The term significant ownership means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person is a related person to another person, within the meaning of section 613A(d) (2) and (4), paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1.613A-4,

and paragraphs (r) and (s) of this section, if either a significant ownership interest in such person is held by the other, or a third person has a significant ownership interest in both such persons. For purposes of determining a significant ownership interest, an interest owned by or for a corporation, partnership, trust, or estate shall be considered as owned directly both by itself and proportionately by its shareholders, partners, or beneficiaries, as the case may be. The term significant ownership means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> With respect to any corporation, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more in value of the outstanding stock of such corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to a partnership, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more interest in the profits or capital of such partnership, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to an estate or trust, direct or indirect ownership of 5 percent or more of the beneficial interests in such estate or trust. The relative percentage ownership of beneficiaries of an estate or trust in the beneficial interests therein shall be determined under actuarial principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person is a ``related person'' to another person, within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(B) and paragraph (h)(2) of Sec. 1.613A-3, if such persons are members of the same controlled group of corporations or if the relationship between such persons would result in a disallowance of losses under section 267 or 707(b), except that for this purpose the family of an individual includes only the individual's spouse and minor children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Transfer. The term transfer means any change in ownership for federal tax purposes after December 31, 1974, by sale, exchange, gift, lease, sublease, assignment, contract, or other disposition (including any contribution to or any distribution by a corporation, partnership, or trust), any change in the membership of a partnership or the beneficiaries of a trust, or any other change by which a taxpayer's proportionate share of the income subject to depletion of an oil or gas property is increased. For taxable years beginning after 1982, the term ``transfer'' includes an election by a C corporation to be an S corporation (properties deemed transferred by the C corporation on the day the election first becomes effective) and a termination of an S election (each shareholder's pro rata share of assets of S corporation deemed transferred to C corporation on the day that the termination first becomes effective). However, the term does not include--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A transfer of property at death (including a distribution by an estate, whether or not a pro rata distribution),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An exchange to which section 351 applies,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A change of beneficiaries of a trust by reason of the death, birth, or adoption of any vested beneficiary if the transferee was a beneficiary of the trust or is a lineal descendant of the settlor or any other vested beneficiary of the trust, except in the case of any trust where any beneficiary of the trust is a member of the family (as defined in section 267(c)(4)) of a settlor who created inter vivos and testamentary trusts for members of the family and the settlor died within the last six days of the fifth month in 1970, and the law in the jurisdiction in which the trust was created requires all or a portion of the gross or net proceeds of any royalty or other interest in oil, gas, or other mineral representing any percentage depletion allowance to be allocated to the principal of the trust,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A transfer of property between corporations which are members of the same controlled group of corporations (as defined in section 613A(c)(8)(D)(i)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A transfer of property between business entities which are under common control (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(B)) or between related persons in the same family (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C)),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A transfer of property between a trust and members of the same family (within the meaning of section 613A(c)(8)(C)) to the extent that both (i) the beneficiaries of the trust are and continue to be members of the family that transferred the property, and (ii) the tentative oil quantity is allocated among the members of such family,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A reversion of all or part of an interest with respect to which the taxpayer was eligible for percentage depletion pursuant to section 613A(c), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A conversion of a retained interest which is eligible for such depletion into an interest which constituted all or part of an interest previously owned by the taxpayer also eligible for such depletion.
However, paragraph (n) (2), (4), and (5) of this section shall apply only so long as the tentative quantity determined under the table contained in section 613A(c)(3)(B) (as in effect prior to the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1990) is required to be allocated under section 613A(c)(8) between the transferor and transferee, or among members of a controlled group of corporations. In the case of an individual transferor, the allocation test of the preceding sentence shall not be failed merely because of the death of the transferor. For purposes of paragraph (n) (3) and (6), an individual adopted by a beneficiary is a lineal descendant of that beneficiary. For purposes of paragraph (n) (7) and (8), a taxpayer previously ineligible for percentage depletion solely by reason of section 613A(d) (2) or (4) will be considered to have been eligible for such depletion. A transfer is deemed to occur on the day on which a contract or other commitment to transfer the property becomes binding upon both the transferor and transferee, or, if no such contract or commitment is made, on the day on which ownership of the interest in oil or gas property passes to the transferee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Transferee. The term ``transferee'', as used in section 613A(c)(9), paragraph (i)(1) of Sec. 1.613A-3, and this section includes the original transferee of proven property and his or her successors in interest (excluding successors in interest of proven property transferred after October 11, 1990). A person shall not be treated as a transferee of an interest in a proven oil or gas property to the extent that such person was entitled to a percentage depletion allowance on mineral produced with respect to the property immediately before the transfer. However, a person shall be treated as a transferee of an interest in a proven property to the extent that the interest such person receives is greater than the interest in the property the person held immediately before the transfer. For example, where the owner of a proven oil property transfers his or her entire interest therein to a partnership of which he or she is a member and, as a consequence, becomes entitled to a depletion allowance based on only one-third of the oil produced with respect to that property, the owner (the transferor) is not denied percentage depletion with respect to the one-third interest in oil production which the owner still possesses. If the partnership agreement had made an effective allocation (under section 704 and Sec. 1.704.1) of all the income in respect of such property to the transferor partner, that partner would be entitled to percentage depletion on the entire oil production from that property. For this purpose, a person who has transferred oil or gas property pursuant to a unitization or pooling agreement shall be treated as having been entitled to a depletion allowance immediately before the transfer to that person of the interest in the unit or pool with respect to all of the mineral in respect of which the person receives gross income from the property pursuant to the unitization or pooling agreement, except to the extent such income is attributable to consideration paid by that person for such interest in addition to that person's contribution of the oil or gas property and equipment affixed thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(p)</em> Interest in proven oil or gas property. The term interest in an oil or gas property means an economic interest in oil or gas property. An economic interest includes working or operating interests, royalties, overriding royalties, net profits interests, and, to the extent not treated as loans under section 636, production payments from oil or gas properties. The term also includes an interest in a partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust holding an economic interest in oil or gas property but does not include shares of stock in a corporation (other than an S corporation and small business corporation) owning such an interest. An oil or gas property is ``proven'' if its principal value has been demonstrated by prospecting, exploration, or discovery work. The principal value of the property has been demonstrated by prospecting, exploration, or discovery work only if at the time of the transfer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any oil or gas has been produced from a deposit, whether or not produced by the taxpayer or from the property transferred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prospecting, exploration, or discovery work indicate that it is probable that the property will have gross income from oil or gas from the deposit sufficient to justify development of the property; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The fair market value of the property is 50 percent or more of the fair market value of the property, minus actual expenses of the transferee for equipment and intangible drilling and development costs, at the time of the first production from the property subsequent to the transfer and before the tansferee transfers his or her interest.
For purposes of this paragraph, the property is to be determined by applying section 614 and the regulations thereunder to the transferee at the time of the transfer. If the transfer is of an interest in a partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust, the determination shall be made with respect to each property owned by the partnership, S corporation, small business corporation, or trust. The term prospecting, exploration, or discovery work includes activities which produce information relating to the existence, location, extent, or quality of any deposit of oil or gas, such as seismograph surveys and drilling activities (whether for exploration or for the production of oil or gas).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(q)</em> Amount disallowed. The amount disallowed, within the meaning of section 613A(d)(1) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.613A-4, is the excess of the amount of the aggregate of the taxpayer's allowable depletion deductions (whether based upon cost or percentage depletion) computed without regard to section 613A(d)(1) over the amount of the aggregate of such deductions computed with regard to such section. The disallowed amount shall be carried over to the succeeding year and treated as an amount allowable as a deduction pursuant to section 613A(c) for the succeeding year, subject to the 65-percent limitation of section 613A(d)(1) and the rules contained in Sec. 1.613A-4(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(r)</em> Retailer. (1) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(2) of this section, the term retailer means any taxpayer who directly, or through a related person (as defined in paragraph (m)(1) of this section), sells oil or natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (r)(2) of this section, the term retailer means any taxpayer who directly, or through a related person (as defined in paragraph (m)(1) of this section), sells oil or natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Through any retail outlet operated by the taxpayer or a related person, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To any person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Obligated under an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person to use a trademark, trade name, or service mark or name owned by such taxpayer or a related person, in marketing or distributing oil or natural gas or any product derived from oil or natural gas, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Given authority, pursuant to an agreement or contract with the taxpayer or a related person, to occupy any retail outlet owned, leased, or in any way controlled by the taxpayer or a related person.
For purposes of the preceding sentence, bulk sales (i.e., sales in very large quantities) of oil or natural gas (but not bulk sales of any product derived from oil or natural gas) to commercial or industrial users shall be disregarded. Bulk sales made after September 18, 1982, of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense shall be also disregarded. In addition, sales of oil or natural gas (whether or not produced by the taxpayer), or of any product derived from oil or natural gas, which are made outside the United States shall be disregarded if no domestic production of oil, natural gas (or products derived therefrom) of the taxpayer or a related person is exported during the taxable year or the immediately preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (r)(1) of this section, the taxpayer shall not be considered a retailer in any case where, during the taxable year of the taxpayer, the combined gross receipts from sales (excluding sales for resale) of oil or natural gas, or products derived therefrom, of all retail outlets taken into account under paragraph (r)(1) of this section (including sales through a retail outlet of oil, natural gas, or a product derived from oil or natural gas which had previously been the subject of a sale described in paragraph (r)(1)(ii) of this section) do not exceed $5 million. If the taxpayer's

combined gross receipts for the taxable year exceed $5 million, the taxpayer will be treated as a retailer as of the first day in which a retail sale was made. For purposes of paragraph (r)(1) of this section, a taxpayer shall be deemed to be selling oil or natural gas (or a product derived therefrom) through a related person in any case in which any sale of oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) by the related person produces gross income from which the taxpayer may benefit by reason of the taxpayer's direct or indirect ownership interest in the related person. In such cases (and in any other case in which the taxpayer is selling through a retail outlet referred to in section 613A(d)(2)(A) or is selling such items to a person described in section 613A(d)(2)(B)), it is immaterial whether the oil or natural gas which is sold, or from which is derived a product which is sold, was produced by the taxpayer. A taxpayer shall be deemed to be selling oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) through a retail outlet operated by a related person in any case in which a related person who operates a retail outlet acquires for resale oil or natural gas (or a derivative product) which the taxpayer produced or caused to be made available for acquisition by the related person pursuant to an arrangement whereby some or all of the taxpayer's production is marketed. An owner of a nonoperating mineral interest (such as a royalty) shall not be treated as an operator of a retail outlet merely because the owner's oil or gas is sold on the owner's behalf through a retail outlet operated by an unrelated person. In addition, the mere fact that a member of a partnership is a retailer shall not result in characterization of the remaining partners as retailers. However, any partner of a partnership who has a 5 percent or more interest in any entity actually engaging in retail activities (including the partnership or another entity to which the partnership is related) is treated as a retailer. See paragraph (m)(1) of this section for rules on the ownership interest by partners in an entity related to a partnership. Similarly, if a trust or estate is a retailer, only its beneficiaries having a 5 percent or more current income interest from the trust or estate are treated as retailers. A person who is a retailer during a portion of the taxable year shall be treated as a retailer with respect to a fraction of that person's gross and taxable income from oil or gas properties for the taxable year, the numerator of which is the number of days during the taxable year in which the taxpayer is a retailer and the denominator of which is the total number of days during the taxable year; except that a person who ceases to be a retailer during the taxable year before the first production of oil or gas during such year shall not be treated as a retailer for any portion of such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (r), the term any product derived from oil or natural gas means gasoline, kerosene, Number 2 fuel oil, refined lubricating oils, diesel fuel, butane, propane, and similar products which are recovered from petroleum refineries or extracted from natural gas in field facilities or natural gas processing plants. The term retail outlet means any place where sales of oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of such items to commercial or industrial users), or a product of oil or natural gas (excluding bulk sales of aviation fuels to the Department of Defense), accounting for more than 5 percent of the gross receipts from all sales made at such place during the taxpayer's taxable year, are systematically made for any purpose other than for resale. For this purpose, sales of oil or natural gas, or any product derived from oil or natural gas, to a person for refining are considered as sales made for resale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(s)</em> Refiner. A person is a refiner if such person or a related person (as defined in paragraph (m)(1) of this section) engages in the refining of crude oil (whether or not owned by such person or related person) and if the total refinery runs of such person and any related persons exceed 50,000 barrels on any day during the taxable year. A refinery run is the volume of inputs of crude oil (excluding any product derived from oil) into the refining stream. For purposes of this paragraph, crude oil refined outside the United States shall be taken into account. Refining is any operation by which the physical or chemical characteristics of crude oil are changed, exclusive of such

operations as passing crude oil through separators to remove gas, placing crude oil in settling tanks to recover basic sediment and water, dehydrating crude oil, and blending of crude oil products.
