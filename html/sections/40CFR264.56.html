                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or his designee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify appropriate State or local agencies with designated response roles if their help is needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever there is a release, fire, or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the character, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. He may do this by observation or review of facility records or manifests, and, if necessary, by chemical analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Concurrently, the emergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result from the release, fire, or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire, or explosion (e.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating, or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water run-off from water or chemical agents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire, or explosion which could threaten human health, or the environment, outside the facility, he must report his findings as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If his assessment indicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, he must immediately notify appropriate local authorities. He must be available to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> He must immediately notify either the government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that geographical area, or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll free number 800/424-8802). The report must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and telephone number of reporter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Time and type of incident (e.g., release, fire);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved, to the extent known;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The extent of injuries, if any; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The possible hazards to human health, or the environment, outside the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> During an emergency, the emergency coordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions, and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste at the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping processes and operations, collecting and containing release waste, and removing or isolating containers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the facility stops operations in response to a fire, explosion, or release, the emergency coordinator must monitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation, or ruptures in valves, pipes, or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Immediately after an emergency, the emergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing, or disposing of recovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that results from a release, fire, or explosion at the facility.
[Comment: Unless the owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with Sec. 261.3(c) or (d) of this chapter, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of parts 262, 263, and 264 of this chapter.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The emergency coordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No waste that may be incompatible with the released material is treated, stored, or disposed of until cleanup procedures are completed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for its intended use before operations are resumed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator must note in the operating record the time, date, and details of any incident that requires implementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, he must submit a written report on the incident to the Regional Administrator. The report must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the owner or operator;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, address, and telephone number of the facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date, time, and type of incident (e.g., fire, explosion);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name and quantity of material(s) involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The extent of injuries, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An assessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Estimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the incident.
