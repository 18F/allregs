                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for admission. The Borrower must accept applications  for admission to the project in the form prescribed by HUD. Applicant  families applying for assisted units (or residential spaces in a group  home) must complete a certification of eligibility as part of the  application for admission. Applicant families must meet the disclosure  and verification requirements for Social Security Numbers, and sign and  submit consent forms for the obtaining of wage and claim information  from State Wage Information Collection Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR  part 5, subpart B. Both the Borrower and the applicant family must  complete and sign the application for admission. On request, the  Borrower must furnish copies of all applications for admission to HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of eligibility and selection of tenants. The  Borrower is responsible for determining whether applicants are eligible  for admission and for the selection of families. To be eligible for  admission, an applicant family must be a handicapped family (as defined  in Sec. 891.505); meet any project occupancy requirements approved by  HUD; meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social  Security Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B; and be a low- income family, as defined in Sec. 813.102 of this chapter (as modified  by Sec. 891.505). Under certain circumstances, HUD may permit the  leasing of units (or residential space in a group home) to ineligible  families under Sec. 891.720.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Local residency requirements are prohibited. Local residency  preferences may be applied in selecting tenants only to the extent that  they are not inconsistent with affirmative fair housing marketing  objectives and the Borrower's HUD-approved affirmative fair housing  marketing plan. Preferences may not be based on the length of time the  applicant has resided in the jurisdiction. With respect to any residency  preference, persons expected to reside   in the community as a result of current or planned employment will be  treated as residents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Borrower determines that the family is eligible and is  otherwise acceptable and units (or residential spaces in a group home)  are available, the Borrower will assign the family a unit or residential  space in a group home. If the family will occupy an assisted unit the  Borrower will assign the family a unit of the appropriate size in  accordance with HUD standards. If no suitable unit (or residential space  in a group home) is available, the Borrower will place the family on a  waiting list for the project and notify the family when a suitable unit  or residential space may become available. If the waiting list is so  long that the applicant would not be likely to be admitted within the  next 12 months, the Borrower may advise the applicant that no additional  applications for admission are being considered for that reason.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Borrower determines that an applicant is ineligible for  admission or the Borrower is not selecting the applicant for other  reasons, the Borrower will promptly notify the applicant in writing of  the determination, the reasons for the determination, and that the  applicant has a right to request a meeting to review the rejection, in  accordance with HUD requirements. The review, if requested, may not be  conducted by the member of the Borrower's staff who made the initial  decision to reject the applicant. The applicant may also exercise other  rights if the applicant believes the applicant is being discriminated  against on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, sex, handicap, or  national origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records on applicants and approved eligible families, which  provide racial, ethnic, gender and place of previous residency data  required by HUD, must be maintained and retained for three years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reexamination of family income and composition--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regular  reexaminations. If the family occupies an assisted unit (or residential  space in a group home), the Borrower must reexamine the income and  composition of the family at least every 12 months. Upon verification of  the information, the Borrower shall make appropriate adjustments in the  total tenant payment in accordance with part 813 of this chapter, as  modified by Sec. 891.505, and determine whether the family's unit size  is still appropriate. The Borrower must adjust tenant rent and the  project assistance payment and must carry out any unit transfer in  accordance with HUD standards. At the time of the annual reexamination  of family income and composition, the Borrower must require the family  to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security  Numbers, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interim reexamination. If the family occupies an assisted unit  (or residential space in a group home) the family must comply with  provisions in the lease regarding interim reporting of changes in  income. If the Borrower receives information concerning a change in the  family's income or other circumstances between regularly scheduled  reexaminations, the Borrower must consult with the family and make any  adjustments determined to be appropriate. Any change in the family's  income or other circumstances that results in an adjustment in the total  tenant payment, tenant rent, and project assistance payment must be  verified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Continuation of project assistance payment. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A family  occupying an assisted unit (or residential space in a group home) shall  remain eligible for project assistance payment until the total tenant  payment equals or exceeds the gross rent (or a pro rata share of the  gross rent in a group home). The termination of subsidy eligibility will  not affect the family's other rights under its lease. Project assistance  payment may be resumed if, as a result of changes in income, rent, or  other relevant circumstances during the term of the PAC, the family  meets the income eligibility requirements of part 813 of this chapter  (as modified in Sec. 891.505) and project assistance is available for  the unit or residential space under the terms of the PAC. The family  will not be required to establish its eligibility for admission to the  project under the remaining requirements of paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A family's eligibility for project assistance payment may also  be terminated in accordance with HUD requirements for such reasons as  failure to submit requested verification information, including failure  to meet the disclosure and verification requirements for Social Security  Numbers, or failure to sign and submit consent forms for the obtaining  of wage and claim information from State Wage Information Collection  Agencies, as provided by 24 CFR part 5, subpart B.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2502-0204 and 2505-0267)</p>
