                            <p class="depth0">You must meet the work practice requirements specified in paragraphs  (a) through (f) of this section. As an alternative to the requirements  specified in paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, you may choose  to comply with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must meet the work practice standards in Tables 1 through 4  to this subpart, except as specified in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, with  the date and time of the deviation, cause of the deviation, a  description of the conditions, and time actual compliance was achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As provided in Sec. 63.6(g), you may request to use an  alternative to the work practice standards in Tables 1 through 4 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> through (4) of this section. As specified in Sec.  63.8252(e)(1)(i) to implement this program, you must prepare and submit  to the Administrator a floor-level mercury vapor measurement plan which  must contain the elements listed in Table 5 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must utilize a mercury measurement device described in of  Table 6 to this subpart to measure the level of mercury vapor in the  cell room at floor-level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must conduct at least one floor-level mercury vapor  measurement evaluation each half day. This evaluation must include three  measurements of the mercury concentration at locations representative of  the entire cell room floor area. The average of these measurements must  be recorded as specified in Sec. 63.8156(c)(1). At a minimum, you must  measure the level of mercury vapor above mercury-containing cell room  equipment, as well as areas around the cells, decomposers, or other  mercury-containing equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must establish a floor-level mercury concentration action  level that is no higher than 0.05 milligrams per cubic meter (mg/m\3\).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> or (ii) of  this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A description of the maintenance activity resulting in elevated  mercury concentration;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The time the maintenance activity was initiated and completed;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A detailed explanation how all the applicable requirements of  Table 1 to this subpart were met during the maintenance activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B) of this section until the floor-level  mercury concentration falls below the floor-level mercury concentration  action level. You must also keep all the associated records for these  procedures as specified in Table 9 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Within 1 hour of the time the floor-level mercury concentration  action level was exceeded, you must conduct each inspection specified in  Table 2 to this subpart in the area where the concentration higher than  the floor-level mercury concentration action level was measured, with  the exception of the cell room floor and the pillars and beam  inspections. (B) You must also inspect all decomposers, hydrogen system  piping up to the hydrogen header, and other potential locations of  mercury vapor leaks in the area using a technique specified in Table 6  to this subpart. You must correct any problem identified during these  inspections according to the requirements in Tables 2 and 3 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must prepare, submit, and operate according to a written  washdown plan designed to minimize fugitive mercury emissions through  routine washing of surfaces where liquid mercury could accumulate. The  written plan must address the elements contained in Table 7 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must keep records of the mass of all virgin mercury added to  cells on an annual basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must utilize mercury monitoring systems that meet the  requirements of Table 8 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Beginning on the compliance date specified for your affected  source in Sec. 63.8186, measure and record the mercury concentration  for at least 30 days using a system that meets the requirements of  paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Using the monitoring data collected according to paragraph  (g)(1)(i) of this section, establish your action level at the 75th  percentile of the data set.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit your action level as part of your Notification of  Compliance Status report according to Sec. 63.8252(e)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Beginning on the compliance date specified for your affected  source in Sec. 63.8186, you must continuously monitor the mercury  concentration in the cell room. Failure to monitor and record the data  according to Sec. 63.8256(c) (4)(ii) for 75 percent of the time in any  6-month period constitutes a deviation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> through (C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A description of the maintenance activity resulting in elevated  mercury concentration;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The time the maintenance activity was initiated and completed;  and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A detailed explanation how all the applicable requirements of  Table 1 to this subpart were met during the maintenance activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B) of this section until the mercury  concentration falls below the action level.

You must correct any problem identified during these  inspections in accordance with the requirements in Table 2 and 3 to this  subpart.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the Table 2 inspections and subsequent corrective actions do  not reduce the mercury concentration below the action level, you must  inspect all decomposers, hydrogen system piping up to the hydrogen  header, and other potential locations of mercury vapor leaks using a  technique specified in Table 6 to this subpart. If a mercury vapor leak  is identified, you must take the appropriate action specified in Table 3  to this subpart.</p><p class="depth5">Operation and Maintenance Requirements</p>
