                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. If you use an analyzer that measures only  NO to determine NOX, you must use an NO2-to-NO  converter upstream of the analyzer. Perform this verification after  installing the converter, after major maintenance and within 35 days  before an emission test. This verification must be repeated at this  frequency to verify that the catalytic activity of the NO2- to-NO converter has not deteriorated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measurement principles. An NO2-to-NO converter allows  an analyzer that measures only NO to determine total NOX by  converting the NO2 in exhaust to NO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System requirements. An NO2-to-NO converter must  allow for measuring at least 95% of the total NO2 at the  maximum expected concentration of NO2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure. Use the following procedure to verify the performance  of a NO2-to-NO converter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instrument setup. Follow the analyzer and NO2-to-NO  converter manufacturers' start-up and operating instructions. Adjust the  analyzer and converter as needed to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equipment setup. Connect an ozonator's inlet to a zero-air or  oxygen source and connect its outlet to one port of a three-way tee  fitting. Connect an NO span gas to another port, and connect the  NO2-to-NO converter inlet to the last port.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adjustments and data collection. Perform this check as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Set ozonator air off, turn ozonator power off, and set the  analyzer to NO mode. Allow for stabilization, accounting only for  transport delays and instrument response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use an NO concentration that is representative of the peak  total NOX concentration expected during testing. The  NO2 content of the gas mixture shall be less than 5% of the  NO concentration. Record the concentration of NO by calculating the mean  of 30 seconds of sampled data from the analyzer and record this value as  xNOref.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Turn on the ozonator O2 supply and adjust the  O2 flow rate so the NO indicated by the analyzer is about 10  percent less than xNOref. Record the concentration of NO by  calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data from the analyzer and  record this value as xNO+O2mix.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Switch the ozonator on and adjust the ozone generation rate so  the NO measured by the analyzer is 20 percent of xNOref or a  value which would simulate the maximum concentration of NO2  expected during testing, while maintaining at least 10 percent unreacted  NO. This ensures that the ozonator is generating NO2 at the  maximum concentration expected during testing. Record the concentration  of NO by calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data from the  analyzer and record this value as xNOmeas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Switch the NOX analyzer to NOX mode and  measure total NOX. Record the concentration of NOX  by calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data from the analyzer  and record this value as xNOxmeas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Switch off the ozonator but maintain gas flow through the  system. The NOX analyzer will indicate the NOX in  the NO + O2 mixture. Record the concentration of  NOX by calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data  from the analyzer and record this value as xNOx+O2mix.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Turn off the ozonator O2 supply. The NOX  analyzer will indicate the NOX in the original NO-in- N2 mixture. Record the concentration of NOX by  calculating the mean of 30 seconds of sampled data from the analyzer and  record this value as xNOxref. This value should be no more  than 5 percent above the xNOref value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Performance evaluation. Calculate the efficiency of the  NOX converter by substituting the concentrations obtained  into the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08OC08.097</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the result is less than 95%, repair or replace the  NO2-to-NO converter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions. The following exceptions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may omit this verification if you can show by engineering  analysis that for your NOX sampling system and your emission  calculations procedures, the converter always affects your brake- specific NOX emission results by less than 0.5% of the  applicable NOX standard.
