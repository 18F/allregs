                                Sec. 10000.8  Timeframe for Council's response to a FOIA request
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The Council ordinarily shall respond to requests according to their order of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multi-track processing. (1) The Council may use two or more processing tracks by distinguishing between simple and more complex requests based on the amount of work and/or time needed to process the request, including through limits based on the number of pages involved. If the Council does so, it shall advise requesters in its slower track(s) of the limits of its faster track(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Using multitrack processing, the Council may provide requesters in its slower track(s) with an opportunity to limit the scope of their requests in order to qualify for faster processing within the specified limits of the Council's faster track(s). In doing so, the Council will contact the requester by telephone, letter, or email, whichever is more efficient in each case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initial decisions. The Council shall determine whether to comply with a FOIA request within 20 working days after our receipt of the request, unless the time frame for response is extended due to unusual circumstances as further described in paragraph (f) of this section. A request is received by the Council, for purposes of commencing the 20-day timeframe for its response, on the day it is properly received by the FOIA Officer. The request must meet all requirements described by these regulations and the FOIA before the 20-day timeframe commences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Administrative appeals. The Executive Director shall determine whether to affirm or overturn a decision subject to administrative appeal within 20 working days after receipt of the appeal, unless the time frame for response is extended in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Tolling timelines. We may toll the 20-day timeframe set forth in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> One time to await information that we reasonably requested from you, as permitted by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(A)(iii)(I);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As necessary to clarify with you any fee-related issue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If we toll the time frame for response under paragraphs (e)(1) or (2) of this section, the tolling period ends upon our receipt of your response.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Unusual circumstances. In the event of unusual circumstances, we may extend the time frame for response provided in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section by providing you with written notice of the unusual circumstances and the date on which a determination is expected to be made. Where the extension is for more than ten working days, we will provide you with an opportunity either to modify your request so that it may be processed within the statutorily-prescribed time limits or to arrange an alternative time period for processing your request or modified request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Aggregating requests. When we reasonably believe that multiple requests submitted by a requester, or by a group of requesters acting in concert, involving clearly related matters, can be viewed as a single request that involves unusual circumstances, we may aggregate the requests for the purposes of fees and processing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Expedited processing. You may request that the Council expedite processing of your FOIA request. To receive expedited processing, you must demonstrate a compelling need for such processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For requests for expedited processing, a ``compelling need'' involves:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, with a time urgency to inform the public of actual or alleged federal government activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Your request for expedited processing must be in writing and may be made at the time of the initial FOIA request or at any later time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Your request for expedited processing must include a statement, certified to be true and correct to the best of your knowledge and belief, explaining in detail the basis for requesting expedited processing. If you are a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, you must establish a particular urgency to inform the public about the federal government activity involved in the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The FOIA Officer will decide whether to grant or deny your request for expedited processing and notify the requester within ten calendar days of receipt. You will be notified in writing of the determination. Appeals of adverse decisions regarding expedited processing shall be processed expeditiously.</p>
