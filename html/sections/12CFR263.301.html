                            <p class="depth0">Section 39 of the FDI Act requires the Board to establish safety and  soundness standards. Pursuant to section 39, a bank may be required to  submit a compliance plan if it is not in compliance with a safety and  soundness standard established by guideline under section 39(a) or (b).  An enforceable order under section 8 may be issued if, after being  notified that it is in violation of a safety and soundness standard  established under section 39, the bank fails to submit an acceptable  compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an  accepted plan. This subpart establishes procedures for requiring  submission of a compliance plan and issuing an enforceable order  pursuant to section 39.</p>
