                            <p class="depth0">In accordance with the provisions of section 2016, the executor (or  any other person) receiving a refund of any State death taxes or foreign  death taxes claimed as a credit under section 2011 or section 2014 shall  notify the district director of the refund within 30 days of its  receipt. The notice shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The name of the decedent;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The date of the decedent's death;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The property with respect to which the refund was made;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amount of the refund, exclusive of interest;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The date of the refund; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The name and address of the person receiving the refund.  If the refund was in connection with foreign death taxes claimed as a  credit under section 2014, the notice shall also contain a statement  showing the amount of interest, if any, paid by the foreign country on  the refund. Finally, the person filing the notice shall furnish the  district director such additional information as he may request. Any  Federal estate tax found to be due by reason of the refund is payable by  the person or persons receiving it, upon notice and demand, even though  the refund is received after the expiration of the period of limitations  set forth in section 6501 (see section 6501(c)(5)). If the tax found to  be due results from a   refund of foreign death tax claimed as a credit under section 2014, such  tax shall not bear interest for any period before the receipt of the  refund, except to the extent that interest was paid by the foreign  country on the refund.</p><p class="depth2">Gross Estate</p>
