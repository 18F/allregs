                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following  definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2">Beneficial interest means debt or equity (or mixed) interests or  obligations of any type issued by a special purpose entity that entitle  their holders to receive payments that depend primarily   on the cash flow from financial assets owned by the special purpose  entity.</p><p class="depth2">Financial asset means cash or a contract or instrument that conveys  to one entity a contractual right to receive cash or another financial  instrument from another entity.</p><p class="depth2">Participation means the transfer or assignment of an undivided  interest in all or part of a loan or a lease from a seller, known as the  ``lead'', to a buyer, known as the ``participant'', without recourse to  the lead, pursuant to an agreement between the lead and the participant.  Without recourse means that the participation is not subject to any  agreement that requires the lead to repurchase the participant's  interest or to otherwise compensate the participant due to a default on  the underlying obligation.</p><p class="depth2">Securitization means the issuance by a special purpose entity of  beneficial interests:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> The most senior class of which at the time of issuance is rated  in one of the four highest categories assigned to long-term debt or in  an equivalent short-term category (within either of which there may be  sub-categories or gradations indicating relative standing) by one or  more nationally recognized statistical rating organizations, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> Which are sold in transactions by an issuer not involving any  public offering for purposes of section 4 of the Securities Act of 1933  (15 U.S.C. 77d), as amended, or in transactions exempt from registration  under such Act pursuant to Regulation S thereunder (or any successor  regulation).</p><p class="depth4">Special purpose entity means a trust, corporation, or other entity  demonstrably distinct from the Farm Credit institution that is primarily  engaged in acquiring and holding (or transferring to another special  purpose entity) financial assets, and in activities related or  incidental thereto, in connection with the issuance by such special  purpose entity (or by another special purpose entity that acquires  financial assets directly or indirectly from such special purpose  entity) of beneficial interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(14)</em>, reclaim,  recover, or recharacterize as property of the institution or the  receivership any financial assets transferred by a Farm Credit  institution in connection with a securitization or participation,  provided that such transfer meets all conditions for sale accounting  treatment under generally accepted accounting principles, other than the  ``legal isolation'' condition as it applies to institutions for which  the FCSIC may be appointed as receiver which is addressed by this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section shall not apply unless the Farm  Credit institution received adequate consideration for the transfer of  financial assets at the time of the transfer, and the documentation  effecting the transfer of financial assets reflects the intent of the  parties to treat the transaction as a sale, and not as a secured  borrowing, for accounting purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving,  limiting, or otherwise affecting the power of the receiver to disaffirm  or repudiate any agreement imposing continuing obligations or duties  upon the institution in receivership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Paragraph (b) of this section shall not be construed as waiving,  limiting or otherwise affecting the rights or powers of the receiver to  take any action or to exercise any power not specifically limited by  this section, including, but not limited to, any rights, powers or  remedies of the receiver regarding transfers taken in contemplation of  the institution's insolvency or with the intent to hinder, delay, or  defraud the institution or the creditors of such institution, or that is  a fraudulent transfer under applicable law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The receiver shall not seek to avoid an otherwise legally  enforceable securitization agreement or participation agreement executed  by a Farm Credit institution solely because such agreement does not meet  the ``contemporaneous'' requirement of section 5.61(d) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> This section may be repealed or amended by the Farm Credit  Administration, but any such repeal or amendment shall not apply to any  transfers of financial assets made in connection with a securitization  or participation   that was in effect before such repeal or modification.
