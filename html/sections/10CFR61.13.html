The analyses must clearly identify and differentiate between  the roles performed by the natural disposal site characteristics and  design features in isolating and segregating the wastes. The analyses  must clearly demonstrate that there is reasonable assurance that the  exposure to humans from the release of radioactivity will not exceed the  limits set forth in Sec. 61.41.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Analyses of the protection of individuals from inadvertent  intrusion must include demonstration that there is reasonable assurance  the waste classification and segregation requirements will be met and  that adequate barriers to inadvertent intrusion will be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analyses of the protection of individuals during operations must  include assessments of expected exposures due to routine operations and  likely accidents during handling, storage, and disposal of waste. The  analyses must provide reasonable assurance that exposures will be  controlled to meet the requirements of part 20 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Analyses of the long-term stability of the disposal site and the  need for ongoing active maintenance after closure must be based upon  analyses of active natural processes such as erosion, mass wasting,  slope failure, settlement of wastes and backfill, infiltration through  covers over disposal areas and adjacent soils, and surface drainage of  the disposal site. The analyses must provide reasonable assurance that  there will not be a need for ongoing active maintenance of the disposal  site following closure.</p>
