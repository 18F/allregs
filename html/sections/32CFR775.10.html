                            <p class="depth0">Close and harmonious planning relations with local and regional agencies and planning commissions of adjacent cities, counties, and states, for cooperation and resolution of mutual land use and environment-related problems should be established. Additional coordination may be obtained from state and area-wide planning and development ``clearinghouses''. These are agencies which have been established pursuant to Executive Order 12372 of July 14, 1982 (3 CFR, 1982 Comp., p. 197). The clearinghouses serve a review and coordination function for Federal activities and the proponent may gain insights on other agencies' approaches to environmental assessments, surveys, and studies in relation to any current proposal. The clearinghouses would also be able to assist in identifying possible participants in scoping procedures for projects requiring an EIS.</p>
