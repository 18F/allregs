The Administrator may shorten or eliminate the comment period if he determines that the time available for a decision on the application requires it and shall state reasons for such action in a notice in the Federal Register. The Administrator may extend the comment period if additional time for comment is requested and such an extension would not interfere with a timely decision on the application.
