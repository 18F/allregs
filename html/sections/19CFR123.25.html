When the carrier is to execute the certificate, and the merchandise will be forwarded without being under Customs seals, the agent of the carrier shall carefully examine the packages covered by the manifests to satisfy himself that the merchandise agrees with the manifest as to quantity and description.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disposition of manifest. The original manifest, after certification, shall accompany the merchandise. Additional copies required when the merchandise is to be transshipped in Canada or Mexico under Customs supervision shall be given to the person in charge of the conveyance for delivery to the Customs officers who will supervise transshipment.</p>
