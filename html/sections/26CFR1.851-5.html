                            <p class="depth0">The provisions of section 851 may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Investment Company W at the close of its first quarter of  the taxable year has its assets invested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Percent</p><p class="depth0">Cash.........................................................          5 Government securities........................................         10 Securities of regulated investment companies.................         20 Securities of Corporation A..................................         10 Securities of Corporation B..................................         15</p><p class="depth0">Securities of Corporation C..................................         20 Securities of various corporations (not exceeding 5 percent           20</p><p class="depth0">of its assets in any one company)...........................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total.......................................................        100</p><p class="depth0">Investment Company W owns all of the voting stock of Corporations A and  B, 15 percent of the voting stock of Corporation C, and less than 10  percent of the voting stock of the other corporations. None of the  corporations is a member of a controlled group. Investment Company W  meets the requirements under section 851(b)(4) at the end of its first  quarter. It complies with subparagraph (A) of section 851(b)(4) since it  has 55 percent of its assets invested as provided in such subparagraph.  It complies with subparagraph (B) of section 851(b)(4) since it does not  have more than 25 percent of its assets invested in the securities of  any one issuer, or of two or more issuers which it controls.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Investment Company V at the close of a particular quarter  of the taxable year has its assets invested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Percent</p><p class="depth0">Cash.........................................................         10 Government securities........................................         35 Securities of Corporation A..................................          7 Securities of Corporation B..................................         12 Securities of Corporation C..................................         15 Securities of Corporation D..................................         21</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total.......................................................        100</p><p class="depth0">Investment Company V fails to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A)  of section 851(b)(4) since its assets invested in Corporations A, B, C,  and D exceed in each case 5 percent of the value of the total assets of  the company at the close of the particular quarter.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Investment Company X at the close of the particular  quarter of the taxable year has its assets invested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Percent</p><p class="depth0">Cash and Government securities...............................         20 Securities of Corporation A..................................          5 Securities of Corporation B..................................         10 Securities of Corporation C..................................         25 Securities of various corporations (not exceeding 5 percent           40</p><p class="depth0">of its assets in any one company)...........................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total.......................................................        100</p><p class="depth0">Investment Company X owns more than 20 percent of the voting power of  Corporations B and C and less than 10 percent of the voting power of all  of the other corporations. Corporation B manufactures radios and  Corporation C acts as its distributor and also distributes radios for  other companies. Investment Company X fails to meet the requirements of  subparagraph (B) of section 851(b)(4) since it has 35 percent of its  assets invested in the securities of two issuers which it controls and  which are engaged in related trades or businesses.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Investment Company Y at the close of a particular quarter  of the taxable year has its assets invested as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Percent</p><p class="depth0">Cash and Government securities...............................         15 Securities of Corporation K (a regulated investment company).         30 Securities of Corporation A..................................         10 Securities of Corporation B..................................         20 Securities of various corporations (not exceeding 5 percent           25</p><p class="depth0">of its assets in any one company)...........................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total.......................................................        100</p><p class="depth0">Corporation K has 20 percent of its assets invested in Corporation L and  Corporation L has 40 percent of its assets invested in Corporation B.  Corporation A also has 30 percent of its assets invested in Corporation  B, and owns more than 20 percent of the voting power in Corporation B.  Investment Company Y owns more than 20 percent of the voting power of  Corporations A and K. Corporation K owns more than 20 percent of the  voting power of Corporation L, and Corporation L owns more than 20  percent of the voting power of Corporation L. Investment Company Y is  disqualified under subparagraph (B) of section 851(b)(4) since more than  25 percent of its assets are considered invested in Corporation B as  shown by the following calculation:</p><p class="depth0">Percent</p><p class="depth0">Percentage of assets invested directly in Corporation B......       20.0 Percentage invested through the controlled group, Y-K-L-B (40        2.4</p><p class="depth0">percent of 20 percent of 30 percent)........................ Percentage invested in the controlled group, Y-A-B (30               3.0</p><p class="depth0">percent of 10 percent)......................................</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">Total percentage of assets of investment Company Y              25.4</p><p class="depth0">invested in Corporation B...............................</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Investment Company Z, which keeps its books and makes its  returns on the basis of the calendar year, at the close of the first  quarter of 1955 meets the requirements of section 851(b)(4) and has 20  percent of its assets invested in Corporation A. Later during the  taxable year it makes distributions to its shareholders and because of  such distributions it finds at the close of the taxable year that it has  more than 25 percent of its remaining assets invested in Corporation A.  Investment Company Z does not lose its status as a regulated investment  company for the taxable year 1955 because of such distributions, nor  will it lose its status as a regulated investment company for 1956 or  any subsequent year solely as a result of such distributions.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Investment Company Q, which keeps its books and makes its  returns on the basis of a calendar year, at the close of the   first quarter of 1955, meets the requirements of section 851(b)(4) and  has 20 percent of its assets invested in Corporation P. At the close of  the taxable year 1955, it finds that it has more than 25 percent of its  assets invested in Corporation P. This situation results entirely from  fluctuations in the market values of the securities in Investment  Company Q's portfolio and is not due in whole or in part to the  acquisition of any security or other property. Corporation Q does not  lose its status as a regulated investment company for the taxable year  1955 because of such fluctuations in the market values of the securities  in its portfolio, nor will it lose its status as a regulated investment  company for 1956 or any subsequent year solely as a result of such  market value fluctuations.</p>
