An agency may delay the return of an employee until the medical certification is provided. The same conditions for verifying the adequacy of a medical certification in Sec. 630.1208(c) apply to the medical certification to return to work. No second or third opinion on the medical certification to return to work may be required. An agency may not require a medical certification to return to work during the period the employee takes leave intermittently or under a reduced leave schedule under Sec. 630.1205.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> If an agency requires an employee to obtain written medical certification under paragraph (h) of this section before he or she returns to work, the agency shall notify the employee of this requirement before leave commences, or to the extent practicable in emergency medical situations, and pay the expenses for obtaining the written medical certification. An employee's refusal or failure to provide written medical certification under paragraph (h) of this section may be grounds for appropriate disciplinary or adverse action, as provided in part 752 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An agency may require an employee to report periodically to the agency on his or her status and intention to return to work. An agency's policy requiring such reports must take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances of the employee's situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> An employee's decision to invoke FMLA leave under Sec. 630.1203(a) does not prohibit an agency from proceeding with appropriate actions under part 432 or part 752 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> An employee who does not comply with the notification requirements in Sec. 630.1207 and does not provide medical certification signed by the health care provider that includes all of the information required in Sec. 630.1208(b) is not entitled to family and medical leave.
