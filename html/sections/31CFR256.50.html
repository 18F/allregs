                                Sec. 256.50  How does Fiscal Service process back pay awards?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The submitting agency may request one of two methods to process back  pay awards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> One method has three parts. The first part is a payment of net  back pay (and interest if authorized), which is sent to the plaintiff or  to the plaintiff's attorney, as directed by the submitting agency. The  second part is a payment to the agency of deductions from the net back  pay. The third part is a payment of attorney fees, which is sent  directly to the attorney.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the second method, Fiscal Service pays the entire back pay  award to the agency out of whose actions the claim arose. The agency  then issues amounts representing back pay (and interest if authorized)  to the plaintiff and retains amounts representing deductions. Fiscal  Service pays the attorney fees directly to the attorney.  [71 FR 60849, Oct. 17, 2006; 71 FR 62050, Oct. 20, 2006]</p>
