                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Timely and adequate notice. (1) A written notice must be sent or provided to a recipient at least 10 days before the date upon which refugee cash assistance will be reduced, suspended, or terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the written notice must clearly state the action that will be taken, the reasons for the action, and the right to request a hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In providing notice to an applicant or recipient to indicate that assistance has been authorized, denied, reduced, suspended, or terminated, the State or its designee agency(s) must specify the program(s) to which the notice applies, clearly distinguishing between RCA and other assistance programs. For example, in the case of a publicly-administered program, if a refugee applies for assistance and is determined ineligible for TANF but eligible for refugee cash assistance, the notice to the applicant must specify clearly the determinations with respect both to TANF and to refugee cash assistance. When a recipient of refugee cash assistance is notified of termination because of reaching the time limit on such assistance, the State or its designee must review the case file to determine possible eligibility for TANF or GA due to changed circumstances and the notice to the recipient must indicate the result of that determination as well as the termination of RCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hearings. All applicants for and recipients of refugee cash assistance must be provided an opportunity for a

hearing to contest adverse determinations. States must ensure that hearings meet the due process standards in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Public/private RCA programs. The State must specify in the public/private RCA plan the hearing procedures to be used in the RCA program. The plan may specify that the local resettlement agency(s) will refer all hearing requests to a State-administered hearing process. If the plan does not specify the use of a State-administered hearing process, then the procedures to be followed must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State or local resettlement agency(s) responsible for the provision of RCA must provide an applicant for or recipient of refugee cash assistance an opportunity for an oral hearing to contest adverse determinations. Hearings must be conducted by an impartial official or designee of the State or local resettlement agency who has not been involved directly in the initial determination of the action in question.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State must ensure that procedures are established to provide refugees a right of final appeal for an in-person hearing provided by an impartial, independent entity outside of the local resettlement agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Final administrative action must be taken within 60 days from the date of a request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Publicly-administered RCA programs. The State must specify in the State Plan referenced in Sec. 400.4 the public agency hearing procedures it intends to use in the RCA program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, the written notice of any hearing determination must adequately explain the basis for the decision and the refugee's right to request any further administrative or judicial review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a refugee's benefits may not be terminated prior to completion of final administrative action, but are subject to recovery by the agency if the action is sustained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when Federal law requires automatic grant adjustments for classes of recipients unless the reason for an individual appeal is an incorrect grant computation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In both a public/private RCA program and a publicly-administered RCA program, a hearing need not be granted when assistance is terminated because the eligibility time period imposed by law has been reached, unless there is a disputed issue of fact that is unresolved by the process in Sec. 400.23.</p>
