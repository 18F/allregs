                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Depositions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For reasons of unavailability or for other good  cause shown, the testimony of any witness may be taken by deposition.  Depositions may be taken orally or upon written interrogatories before  any person designated by the presiding hearing examiner and having power  to administer oaths.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application. Any party desiring to take the deposition of a  witness may make application in writing to the presiding hearing  examiner, setting forth:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The reasons why such deposition should be taken;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The time when, the place where, and the name and post office  address of   the person before whom the deposition is to be taken;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The name and address of each witness; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The subject matter concerning which each witness is expected to  testify.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notice. Such notice as the presiding hearings examiner may order  shall be given by the party taking the deposition to every other party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Taking and receiving in evidence. Each witness testifying upon  deposition shall be sworn, and the parties not calling him shall have  the right to cross-examine him. The questions propounded and the answers  thereto, together with all objections made, shall be reduced to writing,  read to the witness, subscribed by him, and certified by the officer  before whom the deposition is taken. Thereafter, the officer shall seal  the deposition, with two copies thereof, in an envelope and mail the  same by registered mail to the presiding hearing examiner. Subject to  such objections to the questions and answers as were noted at the time  of taking the deposition and would be valid were the witness personally  present and testifying, such deposition may be read and offered in  evidence by the party taking it as against any party who was present,  represented at the taking of the deposition, or who had due notice  thereof. No part of a deposition shall be admitted in evidence unless  there is a showing that the reasons for the taking of the deposition in  the first instance exist at the time of hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Other discovery. Whenever appropriate to a just disposition of  any issue in a hearing, the presiding hearing examiner may allow  discovery by any other appropriate procedure, such as by written  interrogatories upon a party, production of documents by a party, or by  entry for inspection of the employment or place of employment involved.</p>
