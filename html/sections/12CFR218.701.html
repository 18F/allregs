The bank provides the high net worth customer or institutional customer the information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclosures. The bank provides the high net worth customer or institutional customer the information set forth in paragraph (b) of this section</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In writing prior to or at the time of the referral; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Orally prior to or at the time of the referral and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The bank provides such information to the customer in writing within 3 business days of the date on which the bank employee refers the customer to the broker or dealer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The written agreement between the bank and the broker or dealer provides for the broker or dealer to provide such information to the customer in writing in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Customer qualification.

A bank that acts in good faith and that has reasonable policies and procedures in place to comply with the requirements of this section shall not be considered a ``broker'' under section 3(a)(4) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)) solely because the bank fails to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (a)(2) with respect to a particular customer if the bank:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Takes reasonable and prompt steps to remedy the error (such as, for example, by promptly making the required determination or promptly providing the broker or dealer the required information); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Makes reasonable efforts to reclaim the portion of the referral fee paid to the bank employee for the referral that does not, following any required remedial action, meet the requirements of this section and that exceeds the amount otherwise permitted under section 3(a)(4)(B)(i)(VI) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)(B)(i)(VI)) and Sec. 218.700.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provisions of written agreement.

The broker or dealer inform the customer if the broker or dealer determines that the customer or the securities transaction(s) to be conducted by the customer does not meet the applicable standard set forth in paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Notice to the bank. The broker or dealer promptly inform the bank if the broker or dealer determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The customer is not a high net worth customer or institutional customer, as applicable; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The bank employee is subject to statutory disqualification, as that term is defined in section 3(a)(39) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(39)), except subparagraph (E) of that section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Required disclosures. The disclosures provided to the high net worth customer or institutional customer pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) of this section shall clearly and conspicuously disclose:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name of the broker or dealer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That the bank employee participates in an incentive compensation program under which the bank employee may receive a fee of more than a nominal amount for referring the customer to the broker or dealer and payment of this fee may be contingent on whether the referral results in a transaction with the broker or dealer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Receipt of other compensation.
