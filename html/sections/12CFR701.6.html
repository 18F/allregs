                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis for assessment. Each calendar year or as otherwise directed by the Board, each Federal credit union shall pay to the Administration for the current National Credit Union Administration fiscal year (January 1 to December 31) an operating fee in accordance with a schedule as fixed from time to time by the National Credit Union Administration Board based on the total assets of each Federal credit union as of December 31 of the preceding year or as otherwise determined pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section. The operating fee is determined based on total assets less the assets created on the books of a natural person Federal credit union by investments made in a corporate credit union under the Credit Union System Investment Program or the Credit Union Homeowners Affordability Relief Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Coverage. The operating fee shall be paid by each Federal credit union engaged in operations as of January 1 of each calendar year, except as otherwise provided by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New charters. A newly chartered Federal credit union will not pay an operating fee until the year following the first full calendar year after the date chartered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conversions. A state chartered credit union that converts to Federal charter will pay an operating fee in the year following the conversion. Federal credit unions converting to state charter will not receive a refund of the operating fee paid to the Administration in the year in which the conversion takes place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mergers. A continuing Federal credit union that has merged with another credit union will pay an operating fee in the following year based on the combined total assets of the merged credit union and the continuing Federal credit union as of December 31 of the year in which the merger took place. For purposes of this requirement, a purchase and assumption transaction wherein the continuing Federal credit union purchases all or essentially all of the assets of another credit union shall be deemed a merger. Federal credit unions merging with other Federal or state credit unions will not receive a refund of the operating fee paid to the Administration in the year in which the merger took place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Liquidations. A Federal credit union placed in liquidation will not pay any operating fee after the date of liquidation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notification. Each Federal credit union shall be notified at least 30 days in advance of the schedule of fees to be paid. A Federal credit union may submit written comments to the Board for consideration regarding the existing fee schedule. Any subsequent revision to the schedule shall be provided to each Federal credit union at least 15 days before payment is due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assessment of Administrative Fee and Interest for Delinquent Payment. Each Federal credit union shall pay to the Administration an administrative fee, the costs of collection, and interest on any delinquent payment of its operating fee. A payment will be considered delinquent if it is postmarked later than the date stated in the notice to the credit union provided under Sec. 701.6(c). The National Credit Union Administration may waive or abate charges or collection of interest if circumstances warrant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The administrative fee for a delinquent payment shall be an amount fixed from time to time by the National Credit Union Administration Board and based upon the administrative costs of such delinquent payments to the Administration in the preceding year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs of collection shall be the actual hours expended by Administration personnel multiplied by the average hourly salary and benefits costs of such personnel as determined by the National Credit Union Administration Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The interest rate charged on any delinquent payment shall be the U.S. Department of the Treasury Tax and Loan Rate in effect on the date when the payment is due as provided in 31 U.S.C. 3717.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a credit union makes a combined payment of its operating fee and its share insurance deposit as provided in Sec. 741.4 of this chapter and such payment is delinquent, only one administrative fee will be charged and interest will be charged on the total combined payment.
