When program levels are sufficient for a nationwide program, funds are allocated based upon the following criteria and weights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amount available for allocations. See Sec. 1940.552(a) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basic formula criteria, data source and weight. See Sec. 1940.552(b) of this subpart .</p><p class="depth2">Each factor will receive a weight respectively of 40%, 40% and 20%. The criteria used in the basic formula are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> State's percentage of National rural population,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(2)</em> State's percentage of the National number of rural households between 50 and 115 percent of the area median income, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(3)</em> State's percentage of National average cost per unit. Data source for the first two of these criterion are based on the latest census data available. The third criterion is based on the cost per unit data using the applicable maximum per unit dollar amount limitations under section 207(c) of the National Housing Act, which can be obtained from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The percentage representing each criterion is multiplied by the weight assigned and totaled to arrive at a State factor.
