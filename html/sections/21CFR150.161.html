The quantity of the fruit ingredient  amounts to not less than 55 percent by weight of the finished food. The  article is sealed in containers and so processed by heat, either before  or after sealing, as to prevent spoilage. Such food may also contain one  or more of the following optional ingredients:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Spice, spice oil, spice extract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A vinegar, lemon juice, lime juice, citric acid, lactic acid,  malic acid, tartaric acid, fumaric acid, or any combination of two or  more of these, in a quantity which reasonably compensates for  deficiency, if any, of the natural acidity of the fruit ingredient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sodium citrate, sodium acetate, sodium tartrate, monosodium  phosphate, disodium phosphate, trisodium phosphate, sodium potassium  tartrate, potassium citrate, potassium acid tartrate, or any combination  thereof, in an amount not exceeding 2 ounces avoirdupois per 100 pounds  of the finished food.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sodium hexametaphosphate in an amount not exceeding 8 ounces  avoirdupois per 100 pounds of the finished food.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Purified calcium chloride, calcium citrate, calcium gluconate,  calcium lactate, calcium sulfate, monocalcium phosphate, potassium  chloride, or any combination of two or more of these salts, in a  quantity reasonably necessary to enable the jelling ingredients to  produce a jelled finished product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Ascorbic acid, sorbic acid, sodium sorbate, potassium sorbate,  sodium propionate, calcium propionate, sodium benzoate, benzoic acid,  methylparaben (methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate), propylparaben (propyl-p-  hydroxybenzoate), or any combination of two or more of these, in a  quantity reasonably necessary as a preservative but not to exceed 0.1  percent by weight of the finished food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and (c). Except as paragraph (d) of this section permits the use of  pectin, carrageenan, or salts of carrageenan standardized with nutritive  sweetener, no nutritive sweetening ingredient is added, either directly  or indirectly, to the fruit ingredient used to make artificially  sweetened fruit preserves or artificially sweetened fruit jam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The artificial sweetening ingredients referred to in paragraph  (a) of this section are saccharin, sodium saccharin, calcium saccharin,  or any combination of two or more of these.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The jelling ingredients referred to in paragraph (a) of this  section are pectin, agar-agar, carob bean gum (also called locust bean  gum), guar gum, gum karaya, gum tragacanth, algin (sodium alginate),  sodium carboxymethylcellulose (cellulose gum), methylcellulose (meeting  U.S.P. requirements and with methoxy content not less than 27.5 percent  and not more than 31.5 percent on a dry-weight basis), carrageenan or  salts of carrageenan complying with the requirements of Sec. 172.620 or  Sec. 172.626 of this chapter, or any combination of two or more of  these. Pectin may be standardized with a nutritive sweetening  ingredient, but such sweetening ingredient shall not amount to more than  44 percent by weight of the standardized pectin and the quantity of such  standardized pectin used shall not exceed 3 percent by weight of the  finished food. Carrageenan or salts of carrageenan may be standardized  with a nutritive sweetening ingredient, but such sweetening ingredient  shall not amount to more than 25 percent by weight of the standardized  carrageenan or salts of carrageenan and the quantity of such  standardized carrageenan or salts of carrageenan used shall not exceed 2  percent by weight of the finished food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> for the fruit preserves or jams which correspond  in fruit ingredient to the artificially sweetened article. The words  ``artificially sweetened'' shall be prominently and conspicuously  displayed in letters not smaller than the largest letter used in any  other word in the name of the food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The jelling ingredient used shall be named on the label by a  statement ``------ added'' or ``with added ------'', the blank being  filled in with the common name of the jelling ingredient used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When one of the optional ingredients specified in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section is used, the label shall bear the statement, ``-- ---- added'' or ``with added ------'', the blank being filled in with  the words ``spice'', ``spice oil'', or ``spice extract'' as appropriate,  but in lieu of the word ``spice'' in such statement the common name of  the spice may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the optional ingredient specified in paragraph (a)(4) of  this section is used, the label shall bear the words ``sodium  hexametaphosphate added'' or ``with added sodium hexametaphosphate''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When any optional ingredient listed in paragraph (a)(6) of this  section is used, the label shall bear the statement ``------ added as a  preservative'', the blank being filled in with the common name by which  the preservative ingredient used is designated in paragraph (a)(6) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Wherever the name of the food appears on the label of the  artificially sweetened fruit preserve or artificially sweetened fruit  jam so conspicuously as to be easily seen under customary conditions of  purchase, the words and statements specified in this section, showing  the optional ingredients used, shall immediately and conspicuously  precede or follow such name without intervening written, printed, or  graphic matter, except that the varietal name of the fruit used in  preparing such preserve or jam may so intervene.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Label declaration. Each of the ingredients used in the food  shall be declared on the label as required by the applicable sections of  parts 101 and 130 of this chapter.
