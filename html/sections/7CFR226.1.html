Section 17 of the National School Lunch Act, as amended, authorizes assistance to States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, and expand nonprofit food service programs for children or adult participants in nonresidential institutions which provide care. The Program is intended to enable such institutions to integrate a nutritious food service with organized care services for enrolled participants. Payments will be made to State agencies or FNS Regional Offices to enable them to reimburse institutions for food service to enrolled participants.
