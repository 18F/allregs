Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Department may consider such an application if the issuance of the final class exemption may not be imminent, and the Department determines that time constraints necessitate consideration of the transaction on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The administrative record of an exemption application includes the initial exemption application and any supporting information provided by the applicant (as well as any comments and testimony received by the Department in connection with an application). If an applicant designates as confidential any information required by these regulations or requested by the Department, the Department will determine whether the information is material to the exemption determination. If it determines the information to be material, the Department will not process the application unless the applicant withdraws the claim of confidentiality.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If for any reason the Department decides not to consider an exemption application, it will inform the applicant in writing of that decision and of the reasons therefore.</p>
