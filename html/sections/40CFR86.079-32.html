                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a manufacturer proposes to add to his product line a vehicle  (or engine) of the same engine-system combination as vehicles (or  engines) previously certified but which was not described in the  application for certification when the test vehicle(s) (or test  engine(s)) representing other vehicles (or engines) of that combination  was certified, he shall notify the Administrator. Such notification  shall be in advance of the addition unless the manufacturer elects to  follow the procedure described in Sec. 86.079-34. This notification  shall include a full description of the vehicle (or engine) to be added.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may require the manufacturer to perform such  tests on the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) representing the  vehicle (or engine) to be added which would have been required if the  vehicle (or engine) had been included in the original application for  certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, after a review of the test reports and data submitted by the  manufacturer, and data derived from any testing conducted under  Sec. 86.079-29, the Administrator determines that the test vehicle(s) or  test engine(s) meets all applicable standards, the appropriate  certificate will be amended accordingly. If the Administrator determines  that the test vehicle(s) (or test engine(s)) does not meet applicable  standards, he will proceed under Sec. 86.079-30(b).  [42 FR 45149, Sept. 8, 1977]</p>
