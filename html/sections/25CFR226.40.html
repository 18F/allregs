Commencement money will be credited toward the settlement of the total damages occasioned by the drilling and completion of the well for which it was paid. Such damages must be paid to the owner of the surface and by him apportioned among the parties interested in the surface, whether as owner, surface lessee, or otherwise, as the parties may mutually agree or as their interests may appear. If the lessee or its authorized representative and surface owner are unable to agree concerning damages, the same will be determined by arbitration as provided by Sec. 226.41.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Surface owners must notify their lessees or tenants of the regulations in this part and of the necessary procedure to follow in all cases of alleged damages. If so authorized in writing, surface lessees or tenants may represent the surface owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In settlement of damages on restricted land, all sums due and payable must be paid to the Superintendent for credit to the account of the Indian entitled thereto. The Superintendent will make the apportionment between the Indian landowner or owners and surface lessee of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person claiming damages to an interest in any leased tract, must furnish to the Superintendent a statement in writing showing its claimed interest. Failure to furnish such statement will constitute a waiver of notice and estop said person from claiming any part of such damages after the same has been disbursed.</p>
