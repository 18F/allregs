                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section contains rules relating to tax-exempt bonds  under section 1394 (enterprise zone facility bonds) to provide  enterprise zone facilities in both empowerment zones and enterprise  communities (zones). See sections 1394, 1397B, and 1397C for other rules  and definitions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Period of compliance--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraphs (b)(2) and (c) of this section, the requirements under  sections 1394 (a) and (b) applicable to enterprise zone facility bonds  must be complied with throughout the greater of the following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The remainder of the period during which the zone designation is  in effect under section 1391 (zone designation period); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period that ends on the weighted average maturity date of  the enterprise zone facility bonds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance after an issue is retired. Except as provided in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the requirements applicable to  enterprise zone facility bonds do not apply to an issue after the date  on which no enterprise zone facility bonds of the issue are outstanding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deemed compliance--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. An issue is deemed to  comply with the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b) if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The issuer and the principal user in good faith attempt to meet  the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b) throughout the period of  compliance required under this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any failure to meet these requirements is corrected within a  one-year period after the failure is first discovered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exception. The provisions of paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section do not apply to the requirements of section 1397B(d)(5)(A)  (relating to certain prohibited business activities).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Good faith. In order to satisfy the good faith requirement of  paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, the principal user must at least  annually demonstrate to the issuer the principal user's monitoring of  compliance with the requirements of sections 1394 (a) and (b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special rules for requirements of sections 1397B and 1397C--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Start of compliance period. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of  this section, the requirements of sections 1397B (relating to  qualification as an enterprise zone business) and 1397C (relating to  satisfaction of the rules for qualified zone property) do not apply  prior to the initial testing date (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of  this section) if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The issuer and the principal user reasonably expect on the issue  date of the enterprise zone facility bonds that those requirements will  be met by the principal user on or before the initial testing date; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The issuer and the principal user exercise due diligence to  meet those requirements prior to the initial testing date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compliance period for certain prohibited activities. The  requirements of section 1397B(d)(5)(A) (relating to certain prohibited  business activities) must be complied with throughout the term of the  enterprise zone facility bonds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Minimum compliance period. The requirements of sections 1397B  (b) or (c) and 1397C must be satisfied for a continuous period of at  least three years after the initial testing date, notwithstanding that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The period of compliance required under paragraph (b)(1) of this  section expires before the end of the three-year period; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The enterprise zone facility bonds are retired before the end  of the three-year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Initial testing date--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the initial testing  date is the date that is 18 months after the later of the issue date of  the enterprise zone facility bonds or the date on which the financed  property is placed in service; provided, however, it is not later than--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Three years after the issue date; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Five years after the issue date, if the issue finances a  construction project for which both the issuer and a licensed architect  or engineer certify on or before the issue date of the enterprise zone  facility bonds that more than three years after the issue date is  necessary to complete construction of the project.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Alternative initial testing date. If the issuer identifies as  the initial testing date a date after the issue date of the enterprise  zone facility bonds and prior to the initial testing date that would  have been determined under paragraph (c)(4)(i) of this section, that  earlier date is treated as the initial testing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Testing on an average basis. Compliance with each of the  requirements of section 1397B (b) or (c) is tested each taxable year.  Compliance with any of the requirements may be tested on an average  basis, taking into account up to four immediately preceding taxable  years plus the current taxable year. The earliest taxable year that may  be taken into account for purposes of the preceding sentence is the  taxable year that includes the initial testing date. A taxable year is  disregarded if the part of the taxable year that falls in a required  compliance period does not exceed 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Resident employee requirements--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of employee  status. For purposes of the requirement of section 1397B (b)(6) or  (c)(5) that at least 35 percent of the employees are residents of the  zone, the issuer and the principal user may rely on a certification,  signed under penalties of perjury by the employee, provided--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The certification provides to the principal user the address of  the employee's principal residence;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee is required by the certification to notify the  principal user of a change of the employee's principal residence; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Neither the issuer nor the principal user has actual knowledge  that the principal residence set forth in the certification is not the  employee's principal residence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employee treated as zone resident. If an issue fails to comply  with the requirement of section 1397B (b)(6) or (c)(5) because an  employee who initially resided in the zone moves out of the zone, that  employee is treated as still residing in the zone if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That employee was a bona fide resident of the zone at the time  of the certification described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That employee continues to perform services for the principal  user in an enterprise zone business and substantially all of those  services are performed in the zone; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A resident of the zone meeting the requirements of section  1397B (b)(5) or (c)(4) is hired by the principal user for the next  available comparable (or lesser) position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> (i) and (ii) of this section apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term employee includes a self-employed individual within the  meaning of section 401(c)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this  section) are both reasonable methods.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The term per-employee fraction means the fraction, the numerator  of which is, during the taxable year, the number of employees who work  at least 15 hours a week for the principal user, who reside in the zone,  and who are   employed for at least 90 days, and the denominator of which is, during  the same taxable year, the aggregate number of all employees who work at  least 15 hours a week for the principal user and who are employed for at  least 90 days.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The term employee actual work hour fraction means the fraction,  the numerator of which is the aggregate total actual hours of work for  the principal user of employees who reside in the zone during a taxable  year, and the denominator of which is the aggregate total actual hours  of work for the principal user of all employees during the same taxable  year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Application to pooled financing bond and loan recycling  programs. In the case of a pooled financing bond program described in  paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling program described  in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, the requirements of paragraphs  (b) through (e) of this section apply on a loan-by-loan basis. See also  paragraphs (g)(2) (relating to limitation on amount of bonds), (m)(2)  (relating to maturity limitations), (m)(3) (relating to volume cap), and  (m)(4) (relating to remedial actions) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Limitation on amount of bonds--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination of outstanding  amount. Whether an issue satisfies the requirements of section 1394(c)  (relating to the $3 million and $20 million aggregate limitations on the  amount of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds) is determined as  of the issue date of that issue, based on the issue price of that issue  and the adjusted issue price of outstanding enterprise zone facility  bonds. Amounts of outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds allocable  to any entity are determined under rules contained in section  144(a)(10)(C) and the underlying regulations. Thus, the definition of  principal user for purposes of section 1394(c) is different from the  definition of principal user for purposes of paragraph (j) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pooled financing bond programs--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. The limitations  of section 1394(c) for an issue for a pooled financing bond program are  determined with regard to the amount of the actual loans to enterprise  zone businesses rather than the amount lent to intermediary lenders as  defined in paragraph (g)(2)(ii) of this section. This paragraph (g)(2)  applies only to the extent the proceeds of those enterprise zone  facility bonds are loaned to one or more enterprise zone businesses  within 42 months of the issue date of the enterprise zone facility bonds  or are used to redeem enterprise zone facility bonds of the issue within  that 42-month period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pooled financing bond program defined. For purposes of this  section, a pooled financing bond program is a program in which the  issuer of enterprise zone facility bonds, in order to provide loans to  enterprise zone businesses, lends the proceeds of the enterprise zone  facility bonds to a bank or similar intermediary (intermediary lender)  which must then relend the proceeds to two or more enterprise zone  businesses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Original use requirement for purposes of qualified zone  property. In general, for purposes of section 1397C(a)(1)(B), the term  original use means the first use to which the property is put within the  zone. For purposes of section 1394, if property is vacant for at least a  one-year period including the date of zone designation, use prior to  that period is disregarded for purposes of determining original use. For  this purpose, de minimis incidental uses of property, such as renting  the side of a building for a billboard, are disregarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Land. The determination of whether land is functionally related  and subordinate to qualified zone property is made in a manner  consistent with the rules for exempt facilities under section 142.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Principal user--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (j)(2) of this section, the term principal user means the owner of  financed property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rental of real property--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A lessee as the principal user. If  an owner of real property financed with enterprise zone facility bonds  is not an enterprise zone business within the meaning of section 1397B,  but the rental of the property is a qualified business within the  meaning of section 1397B(d)(2), the term principal user for purposes of  sections 1394 (b) and (e) means the lessee or lessees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allocation of enterprise zone facility bonds. If a lessee is  the principal user of real property under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of this  section, then proceeds of enterprise zone facility bonds may be  allocated to expenditures for real property only to the extent of the  property allocable to the lessee's leased space, including expenditures  for common areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Pooled financing bond program. An intermediary lender in a  pooled financing bond program described in paragraph (g)(2) of this  section is not treated as the principal user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Treatment as separately incorporated business. For purposes of  section 1394(b)(3)(B), a trade or business may be treated as separately  incorporated if allocations of income and activities attributable to the  business conducted within the zone are made using a reasonable  allocation method and if that trade or business has evidence of those  allocations sufficient to establish compliance with the requirements of  paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. Whether an allocation method  is reasonable will depend upon the facts and circumstances. An  allocation method will not be considered to be reasonable unless the  allocation method is applied consistently by the trade or business and  is consistent with the purposes of section 1394.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Substantially all. For purposes of sections 1397B and 1397C(a),  the term substantially all means 85 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em>, enterprise zone facility bonds  are treated as exempt facility bonds that are described in section  142(a), and all regulations generally applicable to exempt facility  bonds apply to enterprise zone facility bonds. For this purpose,  enterprise zone businesses are treated as meeting the public use  requirement. Sections 147(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(A)</em> (relating to limitations on financing  the acquisition of land), 147(d) (relating to financing the acquisition  of existing property), and 142(b)(2) (relating to limitations on  financing office space) do not apply to enterprise zone facility bonds.  See also paragraph (n)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maturity limitation--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requirements. An issue of enterprise  zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are to be used as part of a  loan recycling program, satisfies the requirements of section 147(b)  if--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each loan satisfies the requirements of section 147(b)  (determined by treating each separate loan as a separate issue); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The term of the issue does not exceed 30 years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Loan recycling program defined. A loan recycling program is a  program in which--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The issuer reasonably expects as of the issue date of the  enterprise zone facility bonds that loan repayments from principal users  will be used to make additional loans during the zone designation  period;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments)  received during the zone designation period are used within six months  of the date of receipt either to make new loans to enterprise zone  businesses or to redeem enterprise zone facility bonds that are part of  the issue; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Repayments of principal on loans (including prepayments)  received after the zone designation period are used to redeem enterprise  zone facility bonds that are part of the issue within six months of the  date of receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Volume cap. For purposes of applying section 146(f)(5)(A)  (relating to elective carryforward of unused volume limitation), issuing  enterprise zone facility bonds is a carryforward purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remedial actions. In the case of a pooled financing bond program  described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling  program described in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, if a loan  fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this  section, within six months of noncompliance (after taking into account  the deemed compliance provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if  applicable), an amount equal to the outstanding loan principal must be  prepaid and the issuer must--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reloan the amount of the prepayment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use the prepayment to redeem an amount of outstanding  enterprise zone facility bonds equal to the outstanding principal amount  of the loan that no longer meets those requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Continuing compliance and change of use penalties--(1) In  general. The penalty provisions of section 1394(e) apply throughout the  period of compliance required under paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> does not apply during any period during which the issue is  deemed to comply with the requirements of section 1394 under the deemed  compliance provisions of paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application to pooled financing bond and loan recycling  programs. In the case of a pooled financing bond program described in  paragraph (g)(2) of this section or a loan recycling program described  in paragraph (m)(2)(ii) of this section, section 1394(e) applies on a  loan-by-loan basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> does not apply  to enterprise zone facility bonds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Refunding bonds--(1) In general. An issue of bonds issued after  the zone designation period to refund enterprise zone facility bonds  (other than in an advance refunding) are treated as enterprise zone  facility bonds if the refunding issue and the prior issue, if treated as  a single combined issue, would meet all of the requirements for  enterprise zone facility bonds, except the requirements in section  1394(c). For example, the compliance period described in paragraph  (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section is calculated taking into account any extension  of the weighted average maturity of the refunding issue compared to the  remaining weighted average maturity of the prior issue. The proceeds of  the refunding issue are allocated to the same expenditures and purpose  investments as the prior issue.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maturity limitation. The maturity limitation of section 147(b)  is applied to a refunding issue by taking into account the issuer's  reasonable expectations about the economic life of the financed property  as of the issue date of the prior issue and the actual weighted average  maturity of the combined refunding issue and prior issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate paragraphs (a)  through (o) of this section:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Averaging of enterprise zone business requirements. City  C issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are  loaned by C to Corporation B to finance the acquisition of equipment for  its existing business located in a zone. On the issue date of the  enterprise zone facility bonds, B meets all of the requirements of  section 1397B(b), except that only 25% of B's employees reside in the  zone. C and B reasonably expect on the issue date to meet all  requirements of section 1397B(b) by the date that is 18 months after the  equipment is placed in service (the initial testing date). In each of  the first, second, and third taxable years after the initial testing  date, 35%, 40% and 45%, respectively, of B's employees are zone  residents. In the fourth year after the testing date, only 25% of B's  employees are zone residents. B continues to meet the 35% resident  employee requirement, because the average of zone resident employees for  those four taxable years is approximately 36%. The percentage of zone  residents employed by B before the initial testing date is not included  in determining whether B continues to comply with the 35% resident  employee requirement.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Measurement of resident employee percentage. Authority D  issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned  to Sole Proprietor F to establish an accounting business in a zone. In  the first year after the initial testing date, the staff working for F  includes F, who works 40 hours per week and does not live in the zone,  one employee who resides in the zone and works 40 hours per week, one  employee who does not reside in the zone and works 20 hours per week,  and one employee who does not reside in the zone and works 10 hours per  week. F meets the 35% resident employee test by calculating the  percentage on the basis of employee actual work hours as described in  paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. If F uses the per-employee  basis as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section to  determine if the resident employee test is met, the percentage of  employees who are zone residents on a per-employee basis is only 33%  because F must exclude from the numerator and the denominator the  employee who works only 10 hours per week. If F calculates the resident  employee test as a percentage of employee actual work hours as described  in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section in the first year, F must  calculate the resident employee test as a percentage of employee actual  work hours each year.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Active conduct of business within the zone. State G  issues enterprise zone facility bonds and loans the proceeds to  Corporation H to finance the acquisition of equipment for H's mail order  clothing business, which is located in a zone. H purchases the supplies  for its clothing business from suppliers located both within and outside  of the zone and expects that orders will be received both from customers  who will reside or work   within the zone and from others outside the zone. All orders are  received and filled at, and are shipped from, H's clothing business  located in the zone. H meets the requirement that at least 80% of its  gross income is derived from the active conduct of business within the  zone.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Enterprise zone business definition. City J issues  enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which are loaned to  Partnership K to finance the acquisition of equipment for its printing  operation located in the zone. All orders are taken and completed, and  all billing and accounting activities are performed, at the print shop  located in the zone. K, on occasion, uses its equipment (including its  trucks) and employees to deliver large print jobs to customers who  reside outside of the zone. So long as K is able to establish that its  trucks are used in the zone at least 85% of the time and its employees  perform at least 85% of services for K in the zone, K meets the  requirements of sections 1397B(b) (3) and (5).</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. Treatment as a separately incorporated business. The  facts are the same as in Example 4 except that six years after the issue  date of the enterprise zone facility bonds, K determines to expand its  operations to a second location outside of the boundaries of the zone.  Although the expansion would result in the failure of K to meet the  tests of 1397B(b), K, using a reasonable allocation method, allocates  income and activities to its operations within the zone and has evidence  of these allocations sufficient to establish compliance with the  requirements of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section. The bonds  will not fail to be enterprise zone facility bonds merely because of the  expansion.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Treatment of pooled financing bond programs. Authority L  issues bonds in the aggregate principal amount of $5,000,000 and loans  the proceeds to Bank M pursuant to a loans-to-lenders program. M does  not meet the definition of enterprise zone business contained in section  1397B. Prior to the issue date of the bonds, L held a public hearing  regarding issuance of the bonds for the loans-to-lenders program,  describing the projects of identified borrowers to be financed initially  with $4,000,000 of the proceeds of the bonds. The applicable elected  representative of L approved issuance of the bonds subsequent to the  public hearing. The loan agreement between L and M provides that the  other proceeds of the bonds will be held by M and loaned to borrowers  that qualify as enterprise zone businesses, following a public hearing  and approval by the applicable elected representative of L of each loan  by M to an enterprise zone business. None of the loans will be in  principal amounts in excess of $3,000,000. The loans by M will otherwise  meet the requirements of section 1394. The bonds will be enterprise zone  facility bonds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. Original use requirement for purposes of qualified zone  property. City N issues enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of  which are loaned to Corporation P to finance the acquisition of  equipment. P uses the proceeds after the zone designation date to  purchase used equipment located outside of the zone and places the  equipment in service at its location in the zone. Substantially all of  the use of the equipment is in the zone and is in the active conduct of  a qualified business by P. The equipment is treated as qualified  enterprise zone property under section 1397C because P makes the first  use of the property within the zone after the zone designation date.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. Principal user. State R issues enterprise zone facility  bonds and loans the proceeds to Partnership S to finance the  construction of a small shopping center to be located in a zone. S is in  the business of commercial real estate. S is not an enterprise zone  business, but has secured one anchor lessee, Corporation T, for the  shopping center. T would qualify as an enterprise zone business. S will  derive 60% of its gross rental income of the shopping center from T. S  does not anticipate that the remaining rental income will come from  enterprise zone businesses. T will occupy 60% of the total rentable  space in the shopping center. S can use enterprise zone facility bond  proceeds to finance the portion of the costs of the shopping center  allocable to T (60%) because T is treated as the principal user of the  enterprise zone facility bond proceeds.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. Remedial actions. State W issues pooled financing  enterprise zone facility bonds, the proceeds of which will be loaned to  several enterprise zone businesses in the two enterprise communities and  one empowerment zone in W. Proceeds of the pooled financing bonds are  loaned to Corporation X, an enterprise zone business, for a term of 10  years. Six years after the date of the loan, X expands its operations  beyond the empowerment zone and is no longer able to meet the  requirements of section 1394. X does not reasonably expect to be able to  cure the noncompliance. The loan documents provide that X must prepay  its loan in the event of noncompliance. W does not expect to be able to  reloan the prepayment by X within six months of noncompliance. X's  noncompliance will not affect the qualification of the pooled financing  bonds as enterprise zone facility bonds if W uses the proceeds from the  loan prepayment to redeem outstanding enterprise zone facility bonds  within six months of noncompliance in an amount comparable to the  outstanding amount of the loan immediately prior to prepayment. X will  be denied an interest expense deduction for the interest accruing from  the first day   of the taxable year in which the noncompliance began.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Effective dates--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in  this section, the provisions of this section apply to all issues issued  after July 30, 1996, and subject to section 1394.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Elective retroactive application in whole. An issuer may apply  the provisions of this section in whole, but not in part, to any issue  that is outstanding on July 30, 1996, and is subject to section 1394.
