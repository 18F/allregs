                                Sec. 363.167  How will a converted savings bond be registered?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The registration of the converted bond will be the same as on the definitive bond, provided that it was registered properly in an authorized form of registration. We will change a definitive savings bond that was not registered in an authorized form of registration to the closest authorized form of registration. For example, a definitive savings bond erroneously registered ``John Doe and Jane Doe'' will be changed to ``John Doe or Jane Doe.'' We are not liable to any person for any such decision as to the closest form of authorized registration.</p>
