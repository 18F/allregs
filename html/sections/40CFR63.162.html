                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compliance with this subpart will be determined by review of the  records required by Sec. 63.181 of this subpart and the reports required  by Sec. 63.182 of this subpart, review of performance test results, and  by inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An owner or operator may request a determination of  alternative means of emission limitation to the requirements of  Secs. 63.163 through 63.170, and Secs. 63.172 through 63.174 of this  subpart as provided in Sec. 63.177.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator makes a determination that a means of  emission limitation is a permissible alternative to the requirements of  Secs. 63.163 through 63.170, and Secs. 63.172 through 63.174 of this  subpart, the owner or operator shall comply with the alternative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each piece of equipment in a process unit to which this subpart  applies shall be identified such that it can be distinguished readily  from equipment that is not subject to this subpart. Identification of  the equipment does not require physical tagging of the equipment. For  example, the equipment may be identified on a plant site plan, in log  entries, or by designation of process unit boundaries by some form of  weatherproof identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Equipment that is in vacuum service is excluded from the  requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Equipment that is in organic HAP service less than 300 hours per  calendar year is excluded from the requirements of Secs. 63.163 through  63.174 of this subpart and Sec. 63.178 of this subpart if it is  identified as required in Sec. 63.181(j) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When each leak is detected as specified in Secs. 63.163 and  63.164; Secs. 63.168 and 63.169; and Secs. 63.172 through 63.174 of   this subpart, the following requirements apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Clearly identify the leaking equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The identification on a valve may be removed after it has been  monitored as specified in Secs. 63.168(f)(3), and 63.175(e)(7)(i)(D) of  this subpart, and no leak has been detected during the follow-up  monitoring. If the owner or operator elects to comply using the  provisions of Sec. 63.174(c)(1)(i) of this subpart, the identification  on a connector may be removed after it is monitored as specified in  Sec. 63.174(c)(1)(i) and no leak is detected during that monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The identification which has been placed on equipment determined  to have a leak, except for a valve or for a connector that is subject to  the provisions of Sec. 63.174(c)(1)(i), may be removed after it is  repaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em> of this section, all  terms in this subpart that define a period of time for completion of  required tasks (e.g., weekly, monthly, quarterly, annual), refer to the  standard calendar periods unless specified otherwise in the section or  subsection that imposes the requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the initial compliance date does not coincide with the  beginning of the standard calendar period, an owner or operator may  elect to utilize a period beginning on the compliance date, or may elect  to comply in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (g)(2) or  (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Time periods specified in this subpart for completion of  required tasks may be changed by mutual agreement between the owner or  operator and the Administrator, as specified in subpart A of this part.  For each time period that is changed by agreement, the revised period  shall remain in effect until it is changed. A new request is not  necessary for each recurring period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance shall be required before the end of the standard  calendar period within which the compliance deadline occurs, if there  remain at least 3 days for tasks that must be performed weekly, at least  2 weeks for tasks that must be performed monthly, at least 1 month for  tasks that must be performed each quarter, or at least 3 months for  tasks that must be performed annually; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In all other cases, compliance shall be required before the end  of the first full standard calendar period after the period within which  the initial compliance deadline occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In all instances where a provision of this subpart requires  completion of a task during each of multiple successive periods, an  owner or operator may perform the required task at any time during each  period, provided the task is conducted at a reasonable interval after  completion of the task during the previous period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In all cases where the provisions of this subpart require an  owner or operator to repair leaks by a specified time after the leak is  detected, it is a violation of this subpart to fail to take action to  repair the leaks within the specified time. If action is taken to repair  the leaks within the specified time, failure of that action to  successfully repair the leak is not a violation of this subpart.  However, if the repairs are unsuccessful, a leak is detected and the  owner or operator shall take further action as required by applicable  provisions of this subpart.
