                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who may file. Any person who believes that he or she or any  specific class of individuals has been or is being subjected to  discrimination prohibited by the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity  provisions of JTPA or this part may file a written complaint by him or  herself or by a representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where to file. The complaint may be filed either with the  recipient or with the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing. A complaint filed pursuant to this part must be  filed within 180 days of the alleged discrimination. The Director, for  good cause shown, may extend the filing time. This time period for  filing is for the administrative convenience of the Directorate and does  not create a defense for the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contents of complaints. Each complaint shall be filed in writing  and shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be signed by the complainant or his or her authorized  representative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contain the complainant's name and address (or specify another  means of contacting him or her);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the respondent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe the complainant's allegations in sufficient detail to  allow the Director or the recipient, as applicable, to determine  whether:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Directorate or the recipient, as applicable, has  jurisdiction over the complaint;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The complaint was timely filed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The complaint has apparent merit, i.e., whether the  allegations, if true, would violate any of the nondiscrimination and  equal opportunity provisions of JTPA or this part. The information  required by this paragraph may be provided by completing and submitting  the Directorate's Complaint Information and Privacy Act Consent Forms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Right to representation. Each complainant and respondent has the  right to be represented by an attorney or other individual of his or her  own choice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Election of recipient-level complaint processing. Any person who  elects to file his or her complaint with the recipient shall allow the  recipient 60 days to process the complaint.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, during the 60-day period, the recipient offers the  complainant a resolution of the complaint but the resolution offered is  not satisfactory to the complainant, the complainant or his or her  representative may file a complaint with the Director within 30 days  after the recipient notifies the complainant of its proposed resolution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days, the recipient shall offer a resolution of the  complaint to the complainant, and shall notify the complainant of his or  her right to file a complaint with the Director, and inform the  complainant that this right must be exercised within 30 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, by the end of 60 days, the recipient has not completed its  processing of the complaint or has failed to notify the complainant of  the resolution, the complainant or his or her representative may, within  30 days of the expiration of the 60-day period, file a complaint with  the Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Director may extend the 30-day time limit if the complainant  is not notified as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, or for  other good cause shown.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notification of no jurisdiction. The recipient shall notify the  complainant in writing immediately upon determining that it does not  have jurisdiction over a complaint that alleges a violation of the  nondiscrimination and equal opportunity provisions of JTPA or this part.  The notification shall also include the basis for such determination, as  well as a statement of the complainant's right to file a written  complaint with the Director within 30 days of receipt of the  notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Complaints filed with the Director. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notification of  acceptance of complaint. The Director shall determine whether the  Directorate will accept a complaint filed pursuant to this section.  Where the Directorate accepts a complaint for investigation, he or she  shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acknowledge acceptance of the complaint for investigation to the  complainant and the respondent, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Advise the complainant and respondent of the issues over which  the Directorate has accepted jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any complainant, respondent, or the authorized representative of  any complainant or respondent, may contact the Directorate for  information regarding the complaint filed pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a complaint contains insufficient information, the  Director shall seek the needed information from the complainant. If the  complainant is unavailable after reasonable means have been used to  locate him or her, or the information is not furnished within 15 days of  the receipt of such request, the complaint file may be closed without  prejudice upon notice sent to the complainant's last known address.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Director may issue a subpoena, as authorized by Section  163(c) of JTPA, directing the person named therein to appear and give  testimony and/or produce documentary evidence, before a designated  representative, relating to the complaint being investigated. Such  attendance of witnesses, and the production of such documentary  evidence, may be required from any place in the United States, at any  designated time and place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where the Directorate lacks jurisdiction over a complaint, he or  she shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> So advise the complainant, indicating why the complaint falls  outside the coverage of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity  provisions of JTPA or this part; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where possible, refer the complaint to an appropriate Federal,  State or local authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where a complaint lacks apparent merit or has not been timely  filed, it need not be investigated. Where a complaint will not be  investigated, the Director shall so inform the complainant and indicate  the basis for that determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where a complaint alleging discrimination based on age falls  within the jurisdiction of the Age Discrimination Act of 1975, as  amended, the Director shall refer the complaint in accordance with the  provisions of 45 CFR 90.43(c)(3), and shall so advise the complainant  and the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where a complaint solely alleges a charge of individual  employment discrimination covered by the nondiscrimination and equal  opportunity provisions of JTPA or this part and by title VII of the  Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2000e to 2000e-17), the  Equal Pay Act of 1963, as amended (29 U.S.C. 206(d)), or the Age  Discrimination in Employment Act of 1976, as amended (29 U.S.C. 621, et  seq.), the Director shall refer such ``joint complaint'' to the Equal  Employment Opportunity Commission for investigation and conciliation  under procedures for handling joint complaints at 29 CFR part 1691, and  shall advise the complainant and the respondent of the referral.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Determinations. The Director shall determine at the conclusion  of the investigation of a complaint whether there is reasonable cause to  believe that a violation of the nondiscrimination and equal opportunity  provisions of JTPA or this part has occurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon making such a cause finding, the Director shall issue an  Initial Determination. The Initial Determination shall notify the  complainant and the respondent, in writing, of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The specific findings of the investigation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The proposed corrective or remedial action and the time by which  the corrective or remedial action must be completed, as provided in  Sec. 34.44;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Whether it will be necessary for the respondent to enter into a  written agreement, as provided in Sec. 34.45; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The opportunity to engage in voluntary compliance negotiations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a no cause determination is made, the complainant and the  respondent shall be so notified in writing. Such determination  represents final agency action of the Department.</p>
