The alarm must be located where it is observed easily by plant operating  personnel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For positive pressure fabric filter systems, a bag leak  detection system must be installed in each baghouse compartment or cell.  For negative pressure or induced air fabric filters, the bag leak  detector must be installed downstream of the fabric filter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Where multiple detectors are required, the system's  instrumentation and alarm may be shared among detectors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you are using something other than a wet scrubber, activated  carbon, selective non-catalytic reduction, an electrostatic  precipitator, or a dry scrubber to comply with the emission limitations  under Sec. 60.2105, you must install, calibrate (to the manufacturers'  specifications), maintain, and operate the equipment necessary to  monitor compliance with the site-specific operating limits established  using the procedures in Sec. 60.2115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you use activated carbon injection to comply with the  emission limitations in this subpart, you must measure the minimum  mercury sorbent flow rate once per hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If you use selective noncatalytic reduction to comply with the  emission limitations, you must complete the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the date on which the initial performance test is  completed or is required to be completed under Sec. 60.2125, whichever  date comes first, ensure that the affected facility does not operate  above the maximum charge rate, or below the minimum secondary chamber  temperature (if applicable to your CISWI unit) or the minimum reagent  flow rate measured as 3-hour block averages at all times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation of the affected facility above the maximum charge  rate, below the minimum secondary chamber temperature and below the  minimum reagent flow rate simultaneously constitute a violation of the  nitrogen oxides emissions limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you use an electrostatic precipitator to comply with the  emission limits of this subpart, you must monitor the secondary power to  the electrostatic precipitator collection plates and maintain the 3-hour  block averages at or above the operating limits established during the  mercury or particulate matter performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For waste-burning kilns not equipped with a wet scrubber or dry  scrubber, in place of hydrogen chloride testing with EPA Method 321 at  40 CFR part 63, appendix A, an owner or operator must install,  calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for monitoring hydrogen chloride  emissions discharged to the atmosphere and record the output of the  system. To demonstrate continuous compliance with the hydrogen chloride  emissions limit for units other than waste-burning kilns not equipped  with a wet scrubber or dry scrubber, a facility may substitute use of a  hydrogen chloride CEMS for conducting the hydrogen chloride annual  performance test, monitoring the minimum hydrogen chloride sorbent flow  rate, monitoring the minimum scrubber liquor pH, and monitoring minimum  injection rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance with the particulate matter  emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a particulate matter  CEMS for conducting the PM annual performance test and using other CMS  for monitoring PM compliance (e.g., bag leak detectors, ESP secondary  power, PM scrubber pressure).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance with the dioxin/furan  emissions limit, a facility may substitute use of a continuous automated  sampling system for the dioxin/furan annual performance test.
