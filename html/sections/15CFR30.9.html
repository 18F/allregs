                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The USPPI or the authorized filing agent is responsible for  electronically transmitting accurate EEI as known at the time of filing  in the AES and transmitting any changes to that information as soon as  they are known. Corrections, cancellations, or amendments to that  information shall be electronically identified and transmitted to the  AES for all required fields as soon as possible. The provisions of this  paragraph relating to the reporting of corrections, cancellations, or  amendments to EEI, shall not be construed as a relaxation of the  requirements of the rules and regulations pertaining to the preparation  and filing of EEI. Failure to correct the EEI is a violation of the  provisions of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For shipments where the USPPI or the authorized agent has  received an error message from AES, the corrections shall take place as  required. Fatal error messages are sent to filers when EEI is not  accepted in the AES   and update rejected messages are sent when a correction is not accepted  in the AES. Fatal errors must be corrected and EEI resubmitted prior to  export for shipments filed predeparture and for post-departure shipments  but not later than five (5) calendar days after the date of export.  Failure to respond to fatal error messages for shipments filed  predeparture prior to export of the cargo subjects the principal party  or authorized agent to penalties provided for in Subpart H of this part.  Failing to transmit corrections to the AES constitutes a violation of  the regulations in this part and renders such principal party or  authorized agent subject to the penalties provided for in Subpart H of  this part. Update rejected messages must be corrected as soon as  possible. For EEI that generates a warning message, the correction shall  be made within four (4) calendar days of receipt of the original  transmission. For EEI that generates a verify message, the correction,  when warranted, shall be made within four (4) calendar days of receipt  of the message. A compliance alert indicates that the shipment was not  reported in accordance with the FTR. The USPPI or the authorized agent  is required to review its filing practices and take required corrective  actions to conform with export reporting requirements.
