                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> (or  section 6501(c)(4) if the period is extended by agreement) for assessing  a deficiency against the citizen for his taxable year has not expired  before the date of the election, determined under paragraph (b) of this  section. Thus, for example, a taxable year of a U.S. citizen beginning  before January 1, 1967, is open for purposes of this subparagraph if,  before the election under section 981(c)(1) and Sec. 1.981-2, such  citizen has never filed a return for such year and a return was required  under section 6012 without reference to section 981. For example, if a  U.S. citizen spouse on a calendar year basis who has never filed a  return for 1960 decides in 1975 that he wishes to make the election  under section 981(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and Sec. 1.981-2 in order to avoid being subject  to tax for 1960 on his share of the community income for that year, he  may in 1975 elect the benefits of section 981(c)(2) by filing an  election in accordance with paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-2. In such case,  a taxable year or years of the nonresident alien spouse of such citizen  ending or beginning within 1960 shall be treated in 1975 as an open  taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply even though the  period prescribed by section 6501 for assessing a deficiency against the  nonresident alien spouse for his taxable year or years ending or  beginning within the taxable year of the U.S. citizen has expired before  the election is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If either spouse dies during a taxable year to which an election  under Sec. 1.981-1 or Sec. 1.981-2 applies, the taxable year of the  decedent and the surviving spouse shall be determined under this  paragraph without regard to section 981(e)(4), relating to death of  spouse during the taxable year. See paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.443-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For definition of the term ``taxable year'', see section 441(b)  and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date of election. (1) For purposes of Sec. 1.981-1 and this  section the date of an election made under section 981(a) and  Sec. 1.981-1 is the date on which the return, amended return, or claim  for refund required by paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 1.981-1 is filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. 1.981-2 and this section the date of an  election made under section 981(c)(1) and Sec. 1.981-2 is the date on  which the returns, amended returns, or claims for refund, required by  paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 1.981-2 are filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For provisions treating timely mailing as timely filing, see  section 7502 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Spouses with different taxable years. If the U.S. citizen and  his nonresident alien spouse do not have the same taxable year, as  defined in section 441(b) and the regulations thereunder, the election  under Sec. 1.981-1 or Sec. 1.981-2 shall apply to each taxable year of  such citizen in respect of which the election is made and to that period  falling within the consecutive taxable years of the nonresident alien  spouse which coincides with the period covered by such taxable year of  the citizen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Election on behalf of deceased spouse. Any election, statement,  or request, required to be made under paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-1, or  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.981-2, by one of the spouses may, if such spouse  is deceased, be made by the executor, administrator, or other person  charged with the property of such deceased spouse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Extension of period of limitations on assessment or refund--(1)  Assessment of deficiency. Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, if an election under section 981(a) and Sec. 1.981-1, or  under section 981(c)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and Sec. 1.981-2, is properly made, the period  within which a deficiency may be assessed for any taxable year to which  the election applies shall, to the extent the deficiency is attributable  to the application of such election, not expire before one year after  the date of the election, determined under paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Refund of tax. Except as provided in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, if an election under section 981(a) and Sec. 1.981-1, or  under section 981(c)(1) and Sec. 1.981-2, is properly made, the period  within which a claim for credit or refund of an overpayment for any  taxable year to which the election applies may be filed shall, to the  extent the overpayment is attributable to the application of the  election, not expire before one year after the date of the election,  determined under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of  Sec. 1.981-2, is not required to join in the election by the U.S.  citizen spouse under section 981(c)(1) and Sec. 1.981-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment of interest for extension period. To the extent that an  overpayment or deficiency for any taxable year is attributable to an  election made under Sec. 1.981-1 or Sec. 1.981-2, no interest shall be  allowed or paid for any period ending with the day before the date which  is one year after the date of the election, determined under paragraph  (b) of this section.
