                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Age Discrimination Act of 1975 (the ``Act''), as amended, is designed to prohibit discrimination on the basis of age in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assistance. The Act also permits federally-assisted programs or activities, and recipients of Federal funds, to continue to use certain age distinctions and factors other than age which meet the requirements of the Act and this regulation.
