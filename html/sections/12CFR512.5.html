                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person who is compelled or requested to furnish documentary evidence or give testimony at an investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding shall have the right to examine, upon request, the Office resolution authorizing such proceeding. Copies of such resolution shall be furnished, for their retention, to such persons only with the written approval of the Deputy Chief Counsel for Enforcement or the appropriate Regional Counsel for Enforcement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any witness at an investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding may be accompanied and advised by an attorney personally representing that witness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such attorney shall be a member in good standing of the bar of the highest court of any state, Commonwealth, possession, territory, or the District of Columbia, who has not been suspended or debarred from practice by the bar of any such political entity or before the Office in accordance with the provisions of part 513 of this chapter and has not been excluded from the particular investigative proceeding or formal examination proceeding in accordance with paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such attorney may advise the witness before, during, and after the taking of his testimony and may briefly question the witness, on the record, at the conclusion of his testimony, for the sole purpose of clarifying any of the answers the witness has given. During the taking of the testimony of a witness, such attorney may make summary notes solely for his use in representing his client. All witnesses shall be sequestered, and, unless permitted in the discretion of the designated representative, no witness or accompanying attorney may be permitted to be present during the taking of testimony of any other witness called in such proceeding. Neither attorney(s) for the association(s) that are the subjects of the investigative proceedings or formal examination proceedings, nor attorneys for any other interested persons, shall have any right to be present during the testimony of any witness not personally being represented by such attorney.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Office, for good cause, may exclude a particular attorney from further participation in any investigation in which the Office has found the attorney to have engaged in dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous or contumacious conduct. The person conducting an investigation may report to the Office instances of apparently dilatory, obstructionist, egregious, contemptuous or contumacious conduct on the part of an attorney.

After due notice to the attorney, the Office may take such action as the circumstances warrant based upon a written record evidencing the conduct of the attorney in that investigation or such other or additional written or oral presentation as the Office may permit or direct.
