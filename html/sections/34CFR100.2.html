                            <p class="depth0">This regulation applies to any program to which Federal financial  assistance is authorized to be extended to a recipient under a law  administered by the Department, including the Federal financial  assistance listed in appendix A of this regulation. It applies to money  paid, property transferred, or other Federal financial assistance  extended after the effective date of the regulation pursuant to an  application approved prior to such effective date. This regulation does  not apply to (a) any Federal financial assistance by way of insurance or  guaranty contracts, (b) money paid, property transferred, or other  assistance extended before the effective date of this regulation, (c)  the use of any assistance by any individual who is the ultimate  beneficiary, or (d) any employment practice, or any employer, employment  agency, or labor organization, except to the extent described in Sec.  100.3. The fact that a type of Federal assistance is not listed in  appendix A shall not mean, if title VI of the Act is otherwise  applicable, that a program is not covered. Federal financial assistance  under statutes now in force or hereinafter enacted may be added to this  list by notice published in the Federal Register.  (Authority: Secs. 602, 604, Civil Rights Act of 1964; 78 Stat. 252, 253;  42 U.S.C. 2000d-1, 2000d-3)  [45 FR 30918, May 9, 1980, as amended at 65 FR 68053, Nov. 13, 2000]</p>
