                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Subject to the provisions of paragraph (b) of this  section, if an individual who is a U.S. person transfers property to a  trust that is not a foreign trust, and such trust becomes a foreign  trust while the U.S. person is alive, the U.S. individual is treated as  a U.S. transferor and is deemed to transfer the property to a foreign  trust on the date the domestic trust becomes a foreign trust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amount deemed transferred. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this  section, the property deemed transferred to the trust when it becomes a  foreign trust includes undistributed net income, as defined in section  665(a), attributable to the property previously transferred.  Undistributed net income for periods prior to the migration is taken  into account only for purposes of determining the portion of the trust  that is attributable to the property transferred by the U.S. person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  section. For purposes of the example, A is a resident alien, B is A's  son, who is a resident alien, and DT is a domestic trust. The example is  as follows:</p><p class="depth2">Example. Outbound migration of domestic trust. On January 1, 2002, A  transfers property to DT, for the benefit of B. On January 1, 2003, DT  acquires a foreign trustee who has the power to determine whether and  when distributions will be made to B. Under section 7701(a)(30)(E) and  Sec. 301.7701-7(d)(ii)(A) of this chapter, DT becomes a foreign trust  on January 1, 2003. Under paragraph (a) of this section, A is treated as  transferring property to a foreign trust on January 1, 2003. Under  paragraph (b) of this section, the property deemed transferred to the  trust when it becomes a foreign trust includes undistributed net income,  as defined in section 665(a), attributable to the property deemed  transferred.
