                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart sets forth the Consumer Product Safety Commission's criteria and requirements governing membership and involvement by Commission officials and employees in the activities of voluntary standards development bodies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission realizes there are advantages and benefits afforded by

greater involvement of Commission personnel in the standards activities of domestic and international voluntary standards organizations. However, such involvement might present an appearance or possibility of the Commission giving preferential treatment to an organization or group or of the Commission losing its independence or impartiality. Also, such involvement may present real or apparent conflict of interest situations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The purpose of this subpart is to further the objectives and programs of the Commission and to do so in a manner that ensures that such involvement:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is consistent with the intent of the Consumer Product Safety Act and the other acts administered by the Commission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is not contrary to the public interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Presents no real or apparent conflict of interest, and does not result in or create the appearance of the Commission giving preferential treatment to an organization or group or the Commission compromising its independence or impartiality; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Takes into account Commission resources and priorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commission employees must obtain approval from their supervisor and the Office of the Executive Director to be involved in voluntary standards activities. They must regularly report to the Voluntary Standards Coordinator regarding their involvement in standards activities, and provide copies of all official correspondence and other communications between the CPSC and the standards developing entities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All Commission employees involved in voluntary standards activities are subject to any restrictions for avoiding conflicts of interest and for avoiding situations that would present an appearance of bias.</p>
