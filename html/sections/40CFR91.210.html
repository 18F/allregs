                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> End-of-year and final reports must indicate the engine family,  the actual sales volume, the values required to calculate credits as  given in Sec. 91.207, and the number of credits generated/required.  Manufacturers must also submit how and where credit surpluses were  dispersed (or are to be banked) and/or how and through what means credit  deficits were met. Copies of contracts related to credit trading must be  included or supplied by the broker, if applicable. The report must  include a calculation of credit balances to show that the credit  summation is equal to or greater than zero.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The sales volume for end-of-year and final reports must be based  on the location of the point of first retail sale (for example, retail  customer or dealer) also called the final product purchase location.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> End-of-year reports must be submitted within 90 days of the  end of the model year to: Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group  (6403-J), US Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave.,  NW., Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final reports must be submitted within 270 days of the end of  the model year to: Manager, Engine Compliance Programs Group (6403-J),  U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW.,  Washington, DC 20460.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> of the Clean Air Act for each engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A manufacturer generating credits for banking only who fails to  submit end-of-year reports in the applicable specified time period (90  days after the end of the model year) may not use the credits until such  reports are received and reviewed by EPA. Use of projected credits  pending EPA review is not permitted in these circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Errors discovered by EPA or the manufacturer in the end-of-year  report, including errors in credit calculation, may be corrected in the  final report up to 270 days from the end of the model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If EPA or the manufacturer determines that a reporting error  occurred on an end-of-year or final report previously submitted to EPA  under this section, the manufacturer's credits and credit calculations  must be recalculated. Erroneous positive credits will be void except as  provided in paragraph (h) of this section. Erroneous negative credit  balances may be adjusted by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If within 270 days of the end of the model year, EPA review  determines a reporting error in the manufacturer's favor (that is,  resulting in an increased credit balance) or if the manufacturer  discovers such an error within 270 days of the end of the model year,  EPA shall restore the credits for use by the manufacturer.</p>
