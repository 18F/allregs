                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. With respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes  attributable to nonpayroll payments made after December 31, 1993, a  taxpayer is either a monthly or a semi-weekly depositor based on an  annual determination. Except as provided in this section, the rules of  Sec. 31.6302-1 shall apply to determine the time and manner of making  deposits of nonpayroll withheld taxes   as though they were employment taxes. Paragraph (b) of this section  defines nonpayroll withheld taxes. Paragraph (c) of this section  provides rules for determining whether a taxpayer is a monthly or a  semi-weekly depositor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Nonpayroll withheld taxes defined. For purposes of this section,  effective with respect to payments made after December 31, 1993,  nonpayroll withheld taxes means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amounts withheld under section 3402(q), relating to withholding  on certain gambling winnings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amounts withheld under section 3402 with respect to amounts paid  as retirement pay for service in the Armed Forces of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts withheld under section 3402(o)(1)(B), relating to  certain annuities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annuities withheld under section 3405, relating to withholding  on pensions, annuities, IRAs, and certain other deferred income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Amounts withheld under section 3406, relating to backup  withholding with respect to reportable payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Determination of deposit status--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rules for calendar years  1994 and 1995. On January 1, 1994, a taxpayer's depositor status for  nonpayroll withheld taxes is the same as the taxpayer's status on  January 1, 1994, for taxes reported on Form 941 under Sec. 31.6302-1. A  taxpayer generally retains that depositor status for nonpayroll withheld  taxes for all of calendar years 1994 and 1995. However, a taxpayer that  under this paragraph (c) is a monthly depositor for 1994 and 1995 will  immediately lose that status and become a semi-weekly depositor of  nonpayroll withheld taxes if the One-Day rule of Sec. 31.6302-1(c)(3) is  triggered with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. See paragraph (d)  of this section for a special rule regarding the application of the One- Day rule of Sec. 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for calendar years after 1995--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  calendar years after 1995, the determination of whether a taxpayer is a  monthly or a semi-weekly depositor for a calendar year is based on an  annual determination and generally depends on the aggregate amount of  nonpayroll withheld taxes reported by the taxpayer for the lookback  period as defined in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Monthly depositor. A taxpayer is a monthly depositor of  nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of  nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined  in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) is $50,000 or less. A taxpayer  ceases to be a monthly depositor of nonpayroll withheld taxes on the  first day after the taxpayer is subject to the One-Day rule in  Sec. 31.6302-1(c)(3) with respect to nonpayroll withheld taxes. At that  time, the taxpayer immediately becomes a semi-weekly depositor of  nonpayroll withheld taxes for the remainder of the calendar year and the  succeeding calendar year. See paragraph (d) of this section for a  special rule regarding the application of the One-Day rule of  Sec. 31.6302-1(c)(3) to nonpayroll withheld taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Semi-weekly depositor. A taxpayer is a semi-weekly depositor  of nonpayroll withheld taxes for a calendar year if the amount of  nonpayroll withheld taxes accumulated in the lookback period (as defined  in paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) exceeds $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Lookback period. For purposes of this section, the lookback  period for nonpayroll withheld taxes is the second calendar year  preceding the current calendar year. For example, the lookback period  for calendar year 1996 is calendar year 1994. A new taxpayer is treated  as having nonpayroll withheld taxes of zero for any calendar year in  which the taxpayer did not exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Special rules. A taxpayer must treat nonpayroll withheld taxes,  which are reported on Form 945, ``Annual Return of Withheld Federal  Income Tax,'' separately from taxes reportable on Form 941, ``Employer's  QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return'' (or any other return, for example, Form  943, ``Employer's Annual Federal Tax Return for Agricultural  Employees''). Taxes reported on Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941  are not combined for purposes of determining whether a deposit of either  is due, whether the One-Day rule of Sec. 31.6302-1(c)(3) applies, or  whether any safe harbor is applicable. In addition, taxes reported on  Form 945 and taxes reported on Form 941 must be deposited separately.  (See paragraph (b)   of Sec. 31.6302-1 for rules for determining an employer's deposit status  for taxes reported on Form 941.) Taxes reported on Form 945 for one  calendar year must be deposited separately from taxes reported on Form  945 for another calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date. Section 31.6302-4(d) applies to  deposits and payments made after December 31, 2010.

(i) In the case of a  calendar month which begins after December 31, 1980, but before April 1,  1991--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of subdivision (i) shall not apply if the employer was  required to make a deposit of taxes pursuant to (b) of this subdivision  (i) with respect to an eighth-monthly period which occurred during the  calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> for a deposit with respect  to the close of an eighth-monthly period if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> His deposit is not less than 95 percent (90 percent before  January 1, 1982) of the aggregate amount of the taxes with respect to  wages paid during the period for which the deposit is made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such eighth-monthly period occurs in a month other than the  last month of a period for which a return is required to be filed  (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as a return period), he  deposits any underpayment with his first deposit which is otherwise  required by this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) to be made after the 15th day of  the following month.  For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b), a ``first-time 3-banking- day depositor'' is an employer who establishes to the satisfaction of  the Commissioner that he was not required (but for this exception) to  make a deposit pursuant to this paragraph (a)(1)(i)(b) (or pursuant to  paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(b) of this section) with respect to each period in  any preceding month of the current calendar quarter and with respect to  each period in the 4 calendar quarters preceding the current calendar  quarter. An employer may in no event qualify as a ``first-time 3- banking-day depositor'' with respect to any eighth-monthly period if the  undeposited taxes at the close of that period are $10,000 or more.  The excess (if any) of a deposit over the actual taxes for a deposit  period shall be applied in order of time to each of the employer's  succeeding deposits   with respect to the same return period, until exhausted, to the extent  that the amount by which the taxes for a subsequent deposit period  exceed the deposit for such subsequent deposit period. For purposes of  this paragraph (a)(1)(i), ``eighth-monthly period'' means the first 3  days of a calendar month, the 4th day through the 7th day of a calendar  month, the 8th day through the 11th day of a calendar month, the 12th  day through the 15th day of a calendar month, the 16th day through the  19th day of a calendar month, the 20th day through the 22nd day of a  calendar month, the 23rd day through the 25th day of a calendar month,  or the portion of a calendar month following the 25th day of such month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The periods within which taxes must be desposited under this  section are determined, in the case of employers paying advance earned  income credit amounts, by reference to the amount of taxes required to  be deposited after reduction for advance amounts paid to employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a calendar month which begins after March 31,  1991, but before January 1, 1993--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)(ii)(b)</em> of this section with respect to an eighth-month period  which occurred during the calendar month.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer A's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with  respect to wages paid in April 1991 is $800. Since that amount is in  excess of $500, but less than $3,000, A must deposit the $800 in a  Federal Reserve bank or authorized financial institution by May 15,  1991.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer B's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with  respect to wages paid in April 1991 is $400. Since that amount is less  than $500, B has no deposit obligation for the month of April. In May  1991 B's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages  paid during the month is $450. Since the $400 in taxes in April was not  required to be deposited, that amount is taken into account in  determining if a deposit is required for May. The aggregate amount of  taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid for the two months is in  excess of $500, thus requiring a deposit. Since June 15, 1991, is a  Saturday, B must deposit the $850 in a Federal Reserve bank or  authorized financial institution by Monday, June 17, 1991, pursuant to  section 7503 of the Code.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that B  deposits the $400 in taxes from April on May 15, 1991. Because the $400  was not required to be deposited, that amount is taken into account in  determining if a deposit obligation exists for May. Since the aggregate  amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid for the two  months, $850, is in excess of $500, a deposit in the aggregate amount of  $850 is required by Monday, June 17, 1991. Since $400 was previously  deposited, B must deposit an additional $450 by June 17, 1991.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On Friday, April 5, 1991, a payroll date, Employer C  accumulates $450 in taxes with respect to wages paid on that date.  Although not required to do so, C deposits the $450 in an authorized  depository. On Friday, April 19, 1991, C accumulates an additional $450  in taxes with respect to wages paid. The aggregate amount of taxes  accumulated with respect to wages paid during the calendar month is  $900. C has a deposit obligation of $900 for the calendar month and must  deposit an additional $450 in an authorized depository by May 15, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> and paragraphs (a)(1)(ii)(c), (d), and (f) of  this section, ``banking days'' are assumed to include all calendar days  except Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer  D's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is  $3,500. Since that amount is in excess of $3,000, but less than  $100,000, D has a deposit obligation of $3,500 that must be satisfied by  April 8, 1991, the third banking day after the close of the eighth- monthly period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer  E's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is  $3,500. E has a deposit obligation of $3,500 that must be satisfied by  April 8, 1991, three banking days after the close of the April 1-3  eighth-monthly period. For the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991,  E's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is  $2,800. Since E was required to make a deposit for the April 1-3 eighth- monthly period, that $3,500 amount is not taken into account in  determining any obligations that arise in subsequent eighth-monthly  periods. E does not have an eighth-monthly deposit obligation with  respect to the April 4-7 period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. For the eighth-monthly period April 1-3, 1991, Employer  F's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is  $2,800. Since that amount is less than $3,000, no deposit is required  with respect to that eighth-monthly period. For the eighth-monthly  period April 4-7, 1991, F's aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with  respect to wages paid is $2,500. Since F was not required to deposit the  $2,800 in taxes from the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period, that amount is  taken into account in determining F's deposit obligation for the April  4-7 eighth-monthly period. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated for  the two eighth-monthly periods is $5,300. F has a deposit obligation of  $5,300 that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days  after the close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that F  deposits the $2,800 from the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period on April 4,  1991. Because the $2,800 was not required to be deposited, that amount  is taken into account in determining F's deposit obligation for the  April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. The aggregate amount of taxes  accumulated for the two eighth-monthly periods is $5,300. Since that  amount is in excess of $3,000, a deposit obligation exists after the  close of the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period. As $2,800 of that amount  was previously deposited, F has a deposit obligation of $2,500 that must  be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking days after the close of  the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On Friday, April 12, 1991, the beginning of an eighth- monthly period (April 12-15), G accumulates $3,500 in taxes with respect  to wages paid and deposits the $3,500 in an authorized depository on  that date although a deposit of the $3,500 was not required to be made  on that date. On Monday, April 15, 1991, the end of the April 12-15  eighth-monthly period, G accumulates an additional $2,000 in taxes with  respect to wages paid. The aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with  respect to wages paid during the April 12-15 eighth-monthly period of  $5,500. G has a deposit obligation for the eighth-monthly period of  $5,500. Since $3,500 of that amount was previously deposited, G has a  remaining deposit obligation of $2,000 that must be satisfied by  Thursday, April 18, 1991, three banking days after the close of the  eighth-monthly period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If on any day within an eighth-monthly period the aggregate  amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid is $100,000 or  more, the employer shall deposit that aggregate amount in a Federal  Reserve bank or authorized financial institution on the first banking  day after that day. Taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid prior  to that day shall not be taken into account if a deposit was required  under this section with respect to such tax amounts. Taxes deposited on  any given day with respect to wages paid on that day do not reduce the  aggregate amount of taxes accumulated on that day for purposes of  determining the deposit requirement (if any) for that day.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On Thursday, April 4, 1991, the beginning of the April 4- 7 eighth-monthly period, Employer H accumulates $55,000 in taxes with  respect to wages paid on that date. On Saturday, April 6, 1991, H  accumulates an additional $50,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid. H  has a deposit obligation of $105,000 that must be satisfied by Monday,  April 8, the next banking day after Saturday, April 6.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On Friday, April 12, 1991, the beginning of the April 12- 15 eighth-monthly period, J accumulates $60,000 in taxes with respect to  wages paid and deposits the $60,000 in an authorized depository on that  date although a deposit of the $60,000 was not required to be made on  that date. On Monday, April 15, 1991, the last day in the April 12-15  eighth-monthly period, J accumulates an additional $50,000 in taxes with  respect to wages paid. On Monday, April 15, the aggregate amount of  taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during the eighth-monthly  period to date totals $110,000. J has a $110,000 deposit obligation that  must be satisfied by the next banking day after the $100,000 threshold  is reached. Since $60,000 of the $110,000 was already deposited, J has a  remaining deposit obligation of $50,000 that must be satisfied by  Tuesday, April 16, 1991, the next banking day following April 15th.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On Monday, April 1, 1991, Employer K accumulates $105,000  in taxes with respect to wages paid on that date. On that same day, K  deposits in an authorized depository $10,000 of the $105,000  accumulated. K has a $105,000 deposit obligation that must be satisfied  by the next banking day, April 2, 1991. The $10,000 deposited on April 1  cannot be used to reduce the aggregate amount of accumulated taxes with  respect to that date. K has a remaining deposit obligation of $95,000  that must be satisfied by April 2, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If, with respect to any eighth-monthly period, an employer  incurs an obligation to deposit in accordance with Sec. 31.6302(c)- 1(a)(1)(ii)(c), and later, within the same eighth-monthly period,  accumulates with respect to wages paid taxes of $3,000 or more, but less  than $100,000, an additional deposit is required in accordance with  Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii)(b). However, if the amount of taxes is  $100,000 or more, an additional deposit is required in accordance with  Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii)(c).</p><p class="depth0">Example. On Tuesday, April 2, 1991, Employer L accumulates $110,000  in aggregate taxes with respect to wages paid. In accordance with  paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(c) of this section, L has a $110,000 deposit  obligation that must be satisfied by Wednesday, April 3, 1991, the next  banking day following April 2. On Wednesday, April 3, 1991, L  accumulates an additional $10,000 in taxes with respect to wages paid  that date. In accordance with paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(b) of this section, L  now has an additional deposit obligation of $10,000 that must be  satisfied by Monday, April 8, 1991, the 3rd banking day following the  close of the April 1-3 eighth-monthly period. The obligation to deposit  the $10,000 is separate and distinct from the obligation to deposit the  $110,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An employer will be considered to have satisfied the deposit  obligation imposed by paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) (b), (c) and (d) of this  section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The deposit that is made is not less than 95 percent of the  aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid during  the period for which the deposit is made, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the eighth-monthly period (or, in the case of a deposit  required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(c) of this section, the day on which  the obligation arose) is in a month other than the last month of the  return period, the employer deposits any remaining amount due with the  first deposit otherwise required to be made after the fifteenth day of  the following month. In the case of the last month of the return period,  see Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any excess of a deposit over the actual taxes required to be  deposited to date (overdeposit) during the return period shall be  applied in order of time to each of the employer's succeeding deposit  obligations within the same return period. In the determination of the  aggregate amount of taxes accumulated with respect to wages paid in  succeeding deposit periods, the overdeposit does not reduce the  aggregate amount accumulated although the overdeposit is credited to the  depositor's account.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employer M's deposit obligation for the eighth-monthly  period April 1-3, 1991, is $3,200. On April 8, 1991, three banking days  after the close of the eighth-monthly period, M deposits $4,000 in an  authorized depository, $800 in excess of the amount required to be  deposited. During the eighth-monthly period April 4-7, 1991, M  accumulates $3,750 in taxes with respect to wages paid during such  period. Although the $800 overdeposit for the April 1-3 eighth-monthly  period is credited to M's account, it may not be used to determine  whether a deposit obligation exists for the April 4-7 eighth-monthly  period. The two deposit obligations are separate and distinct. Since the  amount of taxes accumulated with   respect to the April 4-7 eighth-monthly period is an amount greater than  $3,000, a deposit is required under paragraph (a)(1)(ii)(b) of this  section within three banking days after the close of the period. M has a  remaining deposit obligation of $2,950 ($3,750 accumulated less $800  overdeposit) that must be satisfied by April 10, 1991, three banking  days after the close of the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The periods within which taxes must be deposited under this  section are determined, in the case of employers paying advance earned  income credit amounts, by reference to the amount of taxes required to  be deposited after reduction for advance amounts paid to employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (a)(1)(ii), the term ``wages  paid'' includes all amounts included in wages, e.g., under section  3121(v) of the Code, regardless of whether they have actually been paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As used in subdivisions (i) and (ii) of this subparagraph, the  term ``taxes'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The employee tax withheld under section 3102,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The employer tax under section 3111, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The income tax withheld under section 3402, including amounts  withheld with respect to qualified State individual income taxes,   Exclusive of taxes with respect to wages for domestic service in a  private home of the employer or, if paid before April 1, 1971, wages for  agricultural labor.

However, a deposit for a period in  one calendar quarter shall be made separately from any deposit for a  period in another calendar quarter. An amount of tax which is not   required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if the employer  so desires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Deposits. Each remittance of amounts required to be deposited  under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be accompanied by a Federal  Tax Deposit form. Such form shall be prepared in accordance with the  instructions applicable thereto. The remittance, together with the  Federal Tax Deposit form, shall be forwarded to a financial institution  authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance with 31 CFR  Part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal Reserve bank.  For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a Federal  Reserve bank, see 31 CFR Part 214.7. The timeliness of the deposit will  be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax Deposit form by the  Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial institution or, if  section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is treated as received  under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits under this section  shall report on the return, for the period with respect to which such  deposits are made, information regarding such deposits according to the  instructions that apply to such return and pay at that time (or deposit  by the due date of such return) the balance, if any, of the taxes due  for such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Time deemed paid. In general, amounts deposited under  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph shall be considered as paid on the  last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of such tax  (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such  return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of  section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of  limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to  April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year  which contains the period for which such amount was so deposited, such  amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procurement of prescribed form. Copies of the Federal Tax  Deposit form will so far as possible be furnished employers. An employer  will not be excused from making a deposit, however, by the fact that no  form has been furnished to it. An employer not supplied with the Federal  Tax Deposit form should make application therefor in ample time to make  the required deposits within the time prescribed. The employer may  secure the form or additional forms by application therefor; such  application shall supply the employer's name, identification number,  address, and the taxable period to which the deposits will relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions--(1) Monthly returns. The provisions of this section  are not applicable with respect to taxes for the month in which the  employer receives notice that returns are required under Sec. 31.6011  (a)-5 (or for any subsequent month for which such a return is required),  if those taxes are also required to be deposited under the separate  accounting procedures provided in Sec. 301.7512-1 of this chapter  (Regulations on Procedure and Administration) (which procedures are  applicable if notification is given of failure to comply with certain  employment tax requirements). In cases in which a monthly return is  required under Sec. 31.6011 (a)-5 but the taxes are not required to be  deposited under the separate accounting procedures provided in  Sec. 301.7512-1, the provisions of this section shall apply except that  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(iv)</em> shall not authorize the deferral of any deposit to  a date after the date on which the return is required to be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Wages paid in nonconvertible foreign currency. The provisions of  this section are not applicable with respect to taxes paid in  nonconvertible foreign currency pursuant to Sec. 301.6316-7 of this  chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).

In  the case of a calendar month which begins after March 31, 1991, if, at a  time prescribed under Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) or (v) for the deposit  of accumulated taxes, the aggregate amount of accumulated employee tax  withheld after March 31, 1991, under section 3202 and employer tax  imposed after March 31, 1991, under section 3221(a) and (b) equals an  amount required to be deposited under Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) or  (v), the employer shall deposit the accumulated railroad retirement  taxes described in sections 3202 and 3221 at the time and in the manner  prescribed in Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) or (v) (except that  accumulated railroad retirement taxes described in section 3221(c) shall  in no case be required to be deposited earlier than the first day on  which a deposit is otherwise required by Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(ii) to  be made after the 15th day of the month following the month in which the  section 3221(c) tax arises).

A deposit required to be made  by this section shall be made separately from a deposit required by any  other section. An employer may make one, or more than one remittance of  the amount required to be deposited. An amount of tax which is not  required to be deposited may nevertheless be deposited if   the employer so desires. If the aggregate amount of the taxes deposited  is in excess of the taxes shown on the return, a credit or refund may be  obtained; and in the event the excess is applied as a credit against  such taxes for a subsequent return period, the employer shall reduce the  amount of one or more of the deposits otherwise required for such  subsequent return period by the amount of such credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section, the  remittance, together with the form, shall be forwarded to a financial  institution authorized as a depositary for Federal taxes in accordance  with 31 CFR part 214 or, at the election of the employer, to a Federal  Reserve bank. For procedures governing the deposit of Federal taxes at a  Federal Reserve bank, see 31 CFR part 214.7. The timeliness of the  deposit will be determined by the date stamped on the Federal Tax  Deposit form by the Federal Reserve bank or the authorized financial  institution or, if section 7502(e) applies, by the date the deposit is  treated as received under section 7502(e). Each employer making deposits  under this section shall report on the return, for the period with  respect to which such deposits are made, information regarding such  deposits according to the instructions that apply to such return and pay  at that time (or deposit by the due date of such return) the balance, if  any, of the taxes due for such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time deemed paid. In general, amounts deposited under  subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall be considered as paid on the  last day prescribed for filing the return in respect of such tax  (determined without regard to any extension of time for filing such  return), or at the time deposited, whichever is later. For purposes of  section 6511 and the regulations thereunder, relating to period of  limitation on credit or refund, if an amount is so deposited prior to  April 15th of a calendar year immediately succeeding the calendar year  in which occurs the period for which such amount was so deposited, such  amount shall be considered as paid on such April 15th.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>-3  Deposit rules for taxes under the Federal Unemployment Tax Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Requirement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.
