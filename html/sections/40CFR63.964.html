operator as follows to check for defects that could result in air emissions to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The owner or operator shall visually inspect each drain as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the case when the drain is using a water seal to control air emissions, the owner or operator shall verify appropriate liquid levels are being maintained and identify any other defects that could reduce water seal control effectiveness.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> In the case when the drain is using a closure device to control air emissions, the owner or operator shall visually inspect each drain to verify that the closure device is in place and there are no defects. Defects include, but are not limited to, visible cracks, holes, or gaps in the closure devices; broken, cracked, or otherwise damaged seals or gaskets on closure devices; and broken or missing plugs, caps, or other closure devices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The owner or operator shall visually inspect each junction box to verify that closure devices are in place and there are no defects.

In this case, the owner or operator shall repair the defect the next time the process or unit that is generating the regulated-material managed in the individual drain system stops operation. Repair of the defect shall be completed before the process or unit resumes operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the defect repair in accordance with the requirements specified in Sec.  63.965(a)(3) of this subpart.
