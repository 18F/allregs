                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations in this part set forth the policies, procedures,  and requirements for the Emergency Wetlands Reserve Program (EWRP).  Under the EWRP, NRCS will make offers to purchase wetland conservation  easements from persons owning croplands that were damaged by the 1993  Midwest floods if those lands have the potential for restoration to  wetland conditions and if the owner voluntarily agrees to restore and  maintain those conditions. The easements are to be purchased to promote  the restoration and maintenance of wetland characteristics, such as  hydrologic conditions of inundation or saturation of the soil and  hydrophytic vegetation. The functions and values of the wetlands for  wildlife habitat, water quality improvement, flood water retention,  floodway enhancement, ground water recharge,   open space, aesthetic values, and environmental education will thus be  promoted. The wetland conservation easements will permanently prohibit  use of the affected land as cropland. Additionally, the easement shall  require permanent maintenance of the wetland conditions, except in the  case of natural disaster.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The EWRP is available only in the following States: Illinois,  Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and  Wisconsin. Certain cropland areas within these States have been  determined to have been inundated by the Midwest floods of 1993. As more  fully defined and described in this part, eligible land may include  farmed wetlands or prior converted wetlands (wetlands converted prior to  December 23, 1985), together with adjacent lands on which the wetlands  are functionally dependent so long as the likelihood of successful  restoration of such land and the potential wetland values merit  inclusion in the program with reasonable costs.</p>
