As specified in section 7(d) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3105(d)), the Board may not approve an application to establish a branch or an agency, or to establish or acquire ownership or control of a commercial lending company, unless it determines that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each of the foreign bank and any parent foreign bank engages directly in the business of banking outside the United States and, except as provided in paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, is subject to comprehensive supervision or regulation on a consolidated basis by its home country supervisor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The foreign bank has furnished to the Board the information that the Board requires in order to assess the application adequately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis for determining comprehensive consolidated supervision. In determining whether a foreign bank and any parent foreign bank is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, the Board shall determine whether the foreign bank is supervised or regulated in such a manner that its home country supervisor receives sufficient information on the worldwide operations of the foreign bank (including the relationships of the bank to any affiliate) to assess the foreign bank's overall financial condition and compliance with law and regulation. In making such a determination, the Board shall assess, among other factors, the extent to which the home country supervisor:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ensures that the foreign bank has adequate procedures for monitoring and controlling its activities worldwide;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtains information on the condition of the foreign bank and its subsidiaries and offices outside the home country through regular reports of examination, audit reports, or otherwise;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Obtains information on the dealings and relationship between the foreign bank and its affiliates, both foreign and domestic;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Receives from the foreign bank financial reports that are consolidated on a worldwide basis, or comparable information that permits analysis of the foreign bank's financial condition on a worldwide, consolidated basis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Evaluates prudential standards, such as capital adequacy and risk asset exposure, on a worldwide basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of comprehensive consolidated supervision not required in certain circumstances. (A) If the Board is unable to find, under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, that a foreign bank is subject to comprehensive consolidated supervision, the Board may, nevertheless, approve an application by the foreign bank if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The home country supervisor is actively working to establish arrangements for the consolidated supervision of such bank; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All other factors are consistent with approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In deciding whether to use its discretion under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), the Board also shall consider whether the foreign bank has adopted and implemented procedures to combat money laundering. The Board also may take into account whether the home country supervisor is developing a legal regime to address money laundering or is participating in multilateral efforts to combat money laundering. In approving an application under this paragraph (c)(1)(iii), the Board, after requesting and taking into consideration the views of the licensing authority, may impose any conditions or restrictions relating to the activities or business operations of the proposed branch, agency, or commercial lending company subsidiary, including restrictions on sources of funding. The Board shall coordinate with the licensing authority in the implementation of such conditions or restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional standards. In acting on any application under this subpart, the Board may take into account:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consent of home country supervisor.

Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home country supervisor of any parent of the foreign bank share material information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other supervisory authorities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assurances to Board. (A) Whether the foreign bank has provided the Board with adequate assurances that information will be made available to the Board on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its affiliates that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other applicable federal banking statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the foreign bank has provided the Board with adequate assurances that information will be made available to the Board on the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its affiliates that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other applicable federal banking statutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> These assurances shall include a statement from the foreign bank describing the laws that would restrict the foreign bank or any of its parents from providing information to the Board;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Measures for prevention of money laundering.

(i) As specified in section 5(a)(3) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(3)), the Board may not approve an application by a foreign bank to establish a branch, other than a limited branch, outside the home state of the foreign bank under section 5(a)(1) or (2) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(1), (2)) unless the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As specified in section 5(a)(3) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(3)), the Board may not approve an application by a foreign bank to establish a branch, other than a limited branch, outside the home state of the foreign bank under section 5(a)(1) or (2) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(1), (2)) unless the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Determines that the foreign bank's financial resources, including the capital level of the bank, are equivalent to those required for a domestic bank to be approved for branching under section 5155 of the Revised Statutes (12 U.S.C. 36) and section 44 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) (12 U.S.C. 1831u);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Consults with the Department of the Treasury regarding capital equivalency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Applies the standards specified in section 7(d) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3105(d)) and this paragraph (c); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Applies the same requirements and conditions to which an application by a domestic bank for an interstate merger is subject under section 44(b)(1), (3), and (4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C. 1831u(b)(1), (3), (4)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As specified in section 5(a)(7) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(7)), the Board may not approve an application to establish a branch through a change in status of an agency or limited branch outside the foreign bank's home state unless:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The establishment and operation of such branch is permitted by such state; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Such agency or branch has been in operation in such state for a period of time that meets the state's minimum age requirement permitted under section 44(a)(5) of the Federal

Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 183u(a)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Board conditions on approval. The Board may impose any conditions on its approval as it deems necessary, including a condition which may permit future termination by the Board of any activities or, in the case of a federal branch or a federal agency, by the Comptroller, based on the inability of the foreign bank to provide information on its activities or those of its affiliates that the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce compliance with U.S. banking laws.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Representative offices--(1) Permissible activities. A representative office may engage in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Permissible activities. A representative office may engage in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Representational and administrative functions. Representational and administrative functions in connection with the banking activities of the foreign bank, which may include soliciting new business for the foreign bank; conducting research; acting as liaison between the foreign bank's head office and customers in the United States; performing preliminary and servicing steps in connection with lending; \11\ or performing back-office functions; but shall not include contracting for any deposit or deposit-like liability, lending money, or engaging in any other banking activity for the foreign bank;---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\11\ See 12 CFR 250.141(h) for activities that constitute preliminary and servicing steps.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Credit approvals under certain circumstances.

As specified in section 10(a)(2) of the IBA (12 U.S.C. 3107(a)(2)), in acting on the application of a foreign bank to establish a representative office, the Board shall take into account, to the extent it deems appropriate, the standards for approval set out in paragraph (c) of this section. The standard regarding supervision by the foreign bank's home country supervisor (as set out in paragraph (c)(1)(i)(A) of this section) will be met, in the case of a representative office application, if the Board makes a finding that the applicant bank is subject to a supervisory framework that is consistent with the activities of the proposed representative office, taking into account the nature of such activities and the operating record of the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special-purpose foreign government-owned banks.
