The regulations in 40 CFR part 1054 require that fuel lines used with handheld Small SI engines installed in cold-weather equipment must meet the standards for EPA Cold-Weather Fuel Lines. Unless specified otherwise in this subchapter U, fuel lines used with all other engines and equipment subject to the provisions of this part 1060, including fuel lines associated with outboard engines or portable marine fuel tanks, must meet the standards for EPA Nonroad Fuel Lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following standards apply for each fuel line classification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> EPA Low-Emission Fuel Lines must have permeation emissions at or below 10 g/m\2\/day when measured according to the test procedure described in Sec.  1060.510.

For example, you may certify fuel lines for

portable marine fuel tanks as assemblies of fuel hose, primer bulbs, and self-sealing end connections. The length of such an assembly must not be longer than a typical in-use installation and must always be less than 2.5 meters long. You may also certify primer bulbs separately. The standard applies with respect to the total permeation emissions divided by the wetted internal surface area of the assembly. Where it is not practical to determine the actual internal surface area of the assembly, you may assume that the internal surface area per unit length of the assembly is equal to the ratio of internal surface area per unit length of the hose section of the assembly.
