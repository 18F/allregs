                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally, loan and grant disbursements may be requested on an as needed basis, thereby reducing the need for supervised bank accounts. For all construction loans and those loans using multiple advances, only the actual amount to be disbursed at loan closing will be requested through the automated systems. Subsequent disbursements will be ordered as needed. However, supervised bank accounts may be used in certain circumstances. For example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a construction loan is made and the construction is substantially completed, but a small amount is being withheld pending completion of landscaping or some similar item. In this case, funds not disbursed may be placed in a supervised bank account for future disbursement as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a large number of checks will be issued in the construction of a dwelling or other development. In such cases, loan and grant disbursements will be requested in accordance with 7 CFR part 2018, subpart D as necessary, deposited in a supervised bank account, and disbursed as necessary to suppliers, sub-contractors, etc.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Association loan and grant funds made on a multiple advance basis may be deposited in a supervised bank account when required by State statutes or when determined necessary by the loan approval official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Supervised bank accounts may be used when needed as defined in paragraph (a)(5) of this section to ensure the correct expenditures of all or a part of loan and grant funds, borrower contributions, and borrower income. Such accounts will be limited in amount and duration to the extent feasible through the prudent disbursement of funds and the prompt termination of the interests of Rural Development and other lenders when the accounts are no longer required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When it is determined by the Servicing Official that special supervision is needed in the management of the borrower's finances, funds may be deposited in a supervised bank account. This supervisory technique will be used for a temporary period to help the borrower learn to properly manage his/her finances. Such a period will not exceed 1 year unless extended by the Servicing Official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Program instructions provide information as to the type of note to be utilized and the method of handling advances and the interest accrued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The debt instruments executed at the time of loan closing constitute an obligation on the part of the Government to disburse all funds at one time or in multiple advances, provided the funds are for purposes authorized by the Government at the time of loan closing. This obligatory commitment takes priority over any intervening liens or advances by other creditors, regardless of the provisions of the State laws involved.
