This endorsement provides coverage for malting barley production and quality losses at a price per bushel greater than that offered under the Small Grains Crop Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">3. You must have the Basic Provisions and the Small Grains Crop Provisions in force to elect to insure malting barley under this endorsement.</p><p class="depth0">4. You must elect either Option A or Option B on or before the sales closing date:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> No coverage will be provided under:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Either Option A or Option B of this endorsement if you fail to elect either Option A or Option B, or if you elect Option B but fail to have a malting barley contract in effect by the acreage reporting date; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Option B of this endorsement if you have not met the production requirements specified in section 1(a) of Option B (in such case, you will only have coverage under the Small Grains Crop Provisions unless you elect coverage under Option A on or before the sales closing date);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If you elect coverage under Option A, and subsequently enter into a malting barley contract, your coverage will continue under the terms of Option A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Your election (Option A or Option B) will continue from year to year unless you cancel or change your election on or before the sales closing date, or your coverage is otherwise canceled or terminated under the terms of your policy; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In counties with both fall and spring sales closing dates, you may elect this endorsement until the spring sales closing date only if you do not have any fall planted acreage of approved malting barley varieties.</p><p class="depth0">5. All acreage in the county planted to approved malting varieties that is insurable under the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley and your elected Option will be insured under this endorsement, except any acreage on which you produce seed under the terms of the seed contract.</p><p class="depth0">6. In lieu of the definitions and provisions regarding units and unit division in the Basic Provisions and the Small Grains Crop Provisions, all malting barley acreage in the county insured under this endorsement will be considered as one basic unit regardless of whether such acreage is owned, rented for cash, or rented for a share of the crop. Your shares in the malting barley acreage insured under this endorsement must be designated separately on the acreage report. For example, if you have 100 percent share in 50 acres and 75 percent share in 10 acres you must list the 50 acres separately from the 10 acres on your acreage report and include the percent share for each.</p><p class="depth0">7. You must select a percentage of the additional value price on or before the sales closing date (you can select only one percentage even if more than one additional value price is applicable, and this percentage must be 100 percent or less). In the event you choose a percentage less than 100 percent of the additional value price, we will multiply that percentage by the additional value price specified in Option A or Option B, as applicable, to determine the additional value price applicable to this endorsement.</p><p class="depth0">8. The additional premium amount for this coverage will be determined by multiplying your malting barley production guarantee (per acre) by your additional value price, by the premium rate, by the acreage planted to approved malting barley varieties, by your share at the time coverage begins. The premium rate you pay will be adjusted by a malting barley factor contained in the actuarial documents, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">9. In addition to the reporting requirements contained in section 6 of the Basic Provisions, you must provide all the information required by the Option you elect.</p><p class="depth0">10. In accordance with section 14 of the Basic Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> We will settle your claim within 30 days if all production:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Meets the quality criteria specified in section 14(a)(2) of this endorsement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grades U.S. No. 4 or worse in accordance with the grades and grade requirements for the subclasses six-rowed and two-rowed barley, or for the class barley in accordance with the Official United States Standards for Grain; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is not accepted by a buyer for malting purposes; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Whenever any production fails one or more of the quality criteria specified in section 14(a)(2) of this endorsement and grades U.S. No. 3 or better, we will not agree upon the amount of loss until the earlier of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date you sell, feed, donate, or otherwise utilize such production for any purpose; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> May 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the insured malting barley is normally harvested.

This endorsement for malting barley does not provide prevented planting coverage. Such coverage is only provided in accordance with the provisions of the Small Grains Crop Provisions for feed barley.</p><p class="depth0">12. Production from all acreage insured under this endorsement and any production of feed barley varieties must not be commingled prior to our making all determinations under section 14. Failure to keep production separate as required herein will result in denial of your claim for indemnity.</p><p class="depth0">13. In the event of loss or damage covered by this endorsement, we will settle your claim by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Multiplying the insured acreage by your malting barley production guarantee (per acre) determined in accordance with section 2 of Option A or Option B, as applicable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Multiplying the result in section 13(a) by your respective additional value price per bushel;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Multiplying the number of bushels of production to count determined in accordance with section 14 by your additional value price per bushel (If more than one additional value price is applicable, the highest additional value price will be used until the number of bushels covered at the higher additional value price is reached and the remainder of the production will be multiplied by the lower additional value price. For example, if variety A is grown under a malting barley price agreement and 1000 bushels of variety A are insured using an additional value price of $0.68 per bushel but only 500 bushels of variety A are produced, the 500 bushels would be valued at $0.68 per bushel and all other production of other varieties will be valued at the lower additional value price unless such production is acceptable under the terms of the malting barley price agreement, in which case 500 bushels of the other varieties would also be valued at $0.68 per bushel);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Subtracting the result of section 13(c) from the result in section 13(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Multiplying the result of section 13(d) by your share.</p><p class="depth0">14.
