                            <p class="depth0">It may be found that a State statute purporting to regulate the  service of process in foreign countries is so drawn as to mention  service by an American consular officer or a person appointed by him,  without mention of or provision for alternate methods of service. State  laws of this description do not operate in derogation of the laws of the  foreign jurisdiction wherein it may be sought to effect service of legal  process, and such State laws do not serve to impose upon American  consular officers duties or obligations which they are unauthorized to  accept under Federal law, or require them to perform acts contrary to  Federal regulations (see Sec. 92.85).</p>
