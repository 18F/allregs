                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions supplement definitions contained in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). As used in the regulations in parts 40, 41, 42, 43 and 45 of this subchapter, the term:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> Accompanying or accompanied by means not only an alien in the physical company of a principal alien but also an alien who is issued an immigrant visa within 6 months of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accompanying or accompanied by means not only an alien in the physical company of a principal alien but also an alien who is issued an immigrant visa within 6 months of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date of issuance of a visa to the principal alien;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of adjustment of status in the United States of the principal alien; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The date on which the principal alien personally appears and registers before a consular officer abroad to confer alternate foreign state chargeability or immigrant status upon a spouse or child.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An ``accompanying'' relative may not precede the principal alien to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Act means the Immigration and Nationality Act (or INA), as amended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Competent officer, as used in INA 101(a)(26), means a ``consular officer'' as defined in INA 101(a)(9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Consular officer, as defined in INA 101(a)(9) includes commissioned consular officers and the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services, and such other officers as the Deputy Assistant Secretary may designate for the purpose of issuing nonimmigrant and immigrant visas, but does not include a consular agent, an attach[eacute] or an assistant attach[eacute]. For purposes of this regulation, the term ``other officers'' includes civil service visa examiners employed by the Department of State for duty at visa-issuing offices abroad, upon certification by the chief of the consular section under whose direction such examiners are employed that the examiners are qualified by knowledge and experience to perform the functions of a consular officer in the issuance or refusal of visas. The designation of visa examiners shall expire upon termination of the examiners' employment for such duty and may be terminated at any time for cause by the Deputy Assistant Secretary. The assignment by the Department of any foreign service officer to a diplomatic or consular office abroad in a position administratively designated as requiring, solely, partially, or principally, the performance of consular functions, and the initiation of a request for a consular commission, constitutes designation of the officer as a ``consular officer'' within the meaning of INA 101(a)(9).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Department means the Department of State of the United States of America.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Dependent area means a colony or other component or dependent area overseas from the governing foreign state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> DHS means the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Documentarily qualified means that the alien has reported that all the documents specified by the consular officer as sufficient to meet the requirements of INA 222(b) have been obtained, and the consular office has completed the necessary clearance procedures.
