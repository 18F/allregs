Each such change must  be approved by the NSPM prior to implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 30 days after the sponsor receives a notice described in  paragraph (c) of this section, the sponsor may file a petition with the  Director of Flight Standards Service (the Director) for reconsideration  of the NSPM finding. The sponsor must address its petition to the  Director, Flight Standards Service, AFS-1, Federal Aviation  Administration, 800 Independence Ave., SW., Washington, DC 20591. The  filing of such a petition to reconsider stays the notice pending a  decision by the Director. However, if the Director finds that there is a  situation that requires immediate action in the interest of safety in  air commerce, he may, upon a statement of the reasons, require a change  effective without stay.
