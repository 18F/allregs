                                Sec. 459.12  Effluent limitations guidelines representing the degree of control technology currently available.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In establishing the limitations set forth in this section, EPA took  into account all information it was able to collect, develop and solicit  with respect to factors (such as age and size of plant, raw materials,  manufacturing processes, products produced, treatment technology  available energy requirements and costs) which can affect the industry  subcategorization and effluent levels established. It is, however,  possible that data which would affect these limitations have not been  available and, as a result, these limitations should be adjusted for  certain plants in this industry. An individual discharger or other  interested person may submit   evidence to the Regional Administrator (or to the State, if the State  has the authority to issue NPDES permits) that factors relating to the  equipment of facilities involved, the process applied, or other such  factors related to such discharger are fundamentally different from the  factors considered in the establishment of the guidelines. On the basis  of such evidence or other available information, the Regional  Administrator (or the State) will make a written finding that such  factors are or are not fundamentally different for that facility  compared to those specified in the Development Document. If such  fundamentally different factors are found to exist, the Regional  Administrator or the State shall establish for the discharger effluent  limitations in the NPDES permit either more or less stringent than the  limitations established herein, to the extent dictated by such  fundamentally different factors. Such limitations must be approved by  the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. The  Administrator may approve or disapprove such limitations, specify other  limitations, or initiate proceedings to revise these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following limitations establish the quantity or quality of  pollutants or pollutant properties, controlled by this paragraph, which  may be discharged from a photographic processing point source subject to  the provisions of this paragraph after application of the best  practicable control technology currently available:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Effluent limitations</p><p class="depth2">-----------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Average of daily</p><p class="depth2">Effluent characteristic             Maximum     values for 30</p><p class="depth2">for any 1  consecutive days</p><p class="depth2">day         shall not</p><p class="depth2">exceed-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Metric units (kilograms per</p><p class="depth2">1,000 m \2\ of product)</p><p class="depth2">----------------------------- Ag........................................        0.14              0.07 CN........................................        0.18              0.09 pH........................................
