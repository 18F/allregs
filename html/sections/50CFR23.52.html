                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. A Management Authority may issue a duplicate document, either a copy of the original or a re-issued original, when a CITES document has been lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed. These provisions do not apply to a document that has expired or that requires amendment. To renew a U.S. CITES document, see part 13 of this subchapter. To amend a U.S. CITES document, see part 13 of this subchapter if the activity has not yet occurred or, if the activity has already occurred, see Sec.  23.53 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> U.S. and foreign general provisions. The following provisions apply to the issuance and acceptance of a replacement CITES document:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The permittee must notify the issuing Management Authority that the document was lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The issuing Management Authority must be satisfied that the CITES document was lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The issuing Management Authority should immediately inform the Management Authority in the country of destination and, for commercial shipments, the Secretariat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the replacement CITES document is a copy, it must indicate that it is a ``replacement'' and a ``true copy of the original,'' contain a new dated original signature of a person authorized to sign CITES documents for the issuing Management Authority, and give the reason for replacement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the replacement CITES document is a newly issued original document, it must indicate that it is a ``replacement,'' include the number and

date of issuance of the document being replaced, and give the reason for replacement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In the United States, you may not use an original single-use CITES document issued under a CITES master file or CITES annual program as a replacement document for a shipment that has already left the country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> U.S. application procedures. To apply for a replacement CITES document, you must do all of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Complete application Form 3-200-66 and submit it to the U.S. Management Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consult the list to find the types of information you need to provide (more than one circumstance may apply to you):

The criteria in this paragraph (d) apply to the issuance and acceptance of U.S. and foreign documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When applying for a U.S. replacement document, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances for the lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed CITES document are reasonable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the shipment has already been made, the wildlife or plant was legally exported or re-exported, and the Management Authority of the importing country has indicated it will accept the replacement CITES document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The specimens were presented to the appropriate official for inspection at the time of import and a request for a replacement CITES document was made at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For acceptance of foreign CITES replacement documents in the United States, you must provide sufficient information for us to find that your proposed activity meets all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The specimens were presented to the appropriate official for inspection at the time of import and a request for a replacement CITES document was made at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The importer or the importer's agent submitted a signed, dated, and notarized statement at the time of import that describes the circumstances that resulted in the CITES document being lost, damaged, stolen, or accidentally destroyed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The importer or the importer's agent provided a copy of the original lost, stolen, or accidentally destroyed document at the time of import showing that the document met the requirements in Sec. Sec.  23.23, 23.24, and 23.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> U.S. standard conditions. In addition to the conditions in Sec.  23.56, the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the original CITES document is found, you must return it to the U.S. Management Authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A CITES document issued for a shipment that has already occurred does not require validation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Validation. For an export or re-export that has not left the United States, follow the procedures in Sec.  23.27.

If the shipment has left the United States and is in a foreign country, submit the unvalidated replacement CITES document to the appropriate foreign authorities. We will not validate the replacement CITES document for a shipment that has already been shipped to a foreign country. We do not require validation on replacement documents issued by foreign Management Authorities.
