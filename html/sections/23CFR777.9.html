                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Actions eligible for Federal funding. There are a number of  actions that can be taken to minimize the impact of highway projects on  wetlands or natural habitats. The following actions qualify for Federal- aid highway funding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Avoidance and minimization of impacts to wetlands or natural  habitats through realignment and special design, construction features,  or other measures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Compensatory mitigation alternatives, either inside or outside  of the right-of-way. This includes, but is not limited to, such measures  as on-site mitigation, when that alternative is determined to be the  preferred approach by the appropriate regulatory agency; improvement of  existing degraded or historic wetlands or natural habitats through  restoration or enhancement on or off site; creation of new wetlands; and  under exceptional circumstances, preservation of existing wetlands or  natural habitats on or off   site. Restoration of wetlands is generally preferable to enhancement or  creation of new wetlands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Improvements to existing wetlands or natural habitats. Such  activities may include, but are not limited to, construction or  modification of water level control structures or ditches, establishment  of natural vegetation, re-contouring of a site, installation or removal  of irrigation, drainage, or other water distribution systems, integrated  pest management, installation of fencing, monitoring, and other measures  to protect, enhance, or restore the wetland or natural habitat character  of a site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mitigation banks. In accordance with all applicable Federal law  (including regulations), with respect to participation in compensatory  mitigation related to a project funded under title 23, U.S. Code, that  has an impact on wetlands or natural habitat occurring within the  service area of a mitigation bank, preference shall be given, to the  maximum extent practicable, to the use of the mitigation bank, if the  bank contains sufficient available credits to offset the impact and the  bank is approved in accordance with the Federal Guidance for the  Establishment, Use, and Operation of Mitigation Banks, or other  agreement between appropriate agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mitigation banking alternatives eligible for participation with  Federal-aid funds including such measures as the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mitigation banks in which mitigation credits are purchased by  State DOTs to mitigate impacts to wetlands or natural habitats due to  projects funded under title 23, U.S. Code, including privately owned  banks or those established with private funds to mitigate wetland or  natural habitat losses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Single purpose banks established by and for the use of a State  DOT with Federal-aid participation; or multipurpose publicly owned  banks, established with public, non-title 23 Federal highway funds, in  which credits may be purchased by highway agencies using title 23  highway funds on a per-credit basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contributions to statewide and regional efforts to conserve,  restore, enhance and create wetlands or natural habitats. Federal-aid  funds may participate in the development of statewide and regional  wetlands conservation plans, including any efforts and plans authorized  pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 (Pub. L. 101- 640, 104 Stat. 4604). Contributions to these efforts may occur in  advance of project construction only if such efforts are consistent with  all applicable requirements of Federal law and regulations and State  transportation planning processes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Mitigation or restoration of historic impacts to wetlands and  natural habitats caused by past highway projects funded pursuant to  title 23, U.S. Code, even if there is no current federally funded  highway project in the immediate vicinity. These impacts must be related  to transportation projects funded under the authority of title 23, U.S.  Code.</p>
