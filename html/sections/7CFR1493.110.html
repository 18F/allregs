                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Guarantee fee rates. Payment Guarantee fee rates charged may be  one of the following two types:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Those that are announced on the USDA Web site and are based upon  the length of the payment terms provided for in the Firm Export Sales  Contract, the degree of risk that CCC assumes, as determined by CCC, and  any other factors which CCC determines appropriate for consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Those where Exporters are invited to submit a competitive bid  for coverage. If CCC determines to offer coverage on a competitive fee  bid basis, instructions for bidding, and minimum fee rates, if  applicable, will be made available on the USDA Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of fee. The guarantee fee will be computed by  multiplying the Guaranteed Value by the guarantee fee rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of fee. The Exporter shall remit, with his application,  the full amount of the guarantee fee. Applications will not be accepted  until the guarantee fee has been received by CCC. The Exporter's wire  transfer or check for the guarantee fee shall be made payable to CCC and  be submitted in the manner specified on the USDA Web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refunds of fee. Guarantee fees paid in connection with  applications that are accepted by CCC will ordinarily not be refundable.  Once CCC notifies an Exporter of acceptance of an application, the fee  for that application will not be refunded unless the Director determines  that such refund will be in the best interest of CCC, even if the  Exporter withdraws the application prior to CCC's issuance of the  Payment Guarantee. If CCC does not accept an application for a Payment  Guarantee or accepts only part of the guarantee   coverage requested, a full or pro rata refund of the fee will be made.</p>
