                                Sec.  73.1400  Transmission system monitoring and control.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The licensee of an AM, FM, TV or Class A TV station is responsible  for assuring that at all times the station operates within tolerances  specified by applicable technical rules contained in this part and in  accordance with the terms of the station authorization. Any method of  complying with applicable tolerances is permissible. The following are  typical methods of transmission system operation:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Attended operation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Attended operation consists of ongoing  supervision of the transmission facilities by a station employee or  other person designated by the licensee. Such supervision may be  accomplished by either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Direct supervision and control of transmission system parameters  by a person at the transmitter site; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Remote control of the transmission system by a person at the  main studio or other location. The remote control system must provide  sufficient transmission system monitoring and control capability so as  to ensure compliance with Sec.  73.1350.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A station may also be monitored and controlled by an automatic  transmission system (ATS) that is configured to contact a person  designated by the licensee in the event of a technical malfunction. An  automatic transmission system consists of monitoring devices, control  and alarm circuitry, arranged so that they interact automatically to  operate the station's transmitter and maintain technical parameters  within licensed values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A hybrid system containing some remote control and some ATS  features is also permissible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of remote control or ATS operation, not every  station parameter need be monitored or controlled if the licensee has  good reason to believe that its stability is so great that its  monitoring and control are unnecessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unattended operation. Unattended operation is either the absence  of human supervision or the substitution of automated supervision of a  station's transmission system for human supervision. In the former case,  equipment is employed which is expected to operate within assigned  tolerances for extended periods of time. The latter consists of the use  of a self-monitoring or ATS-monitored and controlled transmission system  that, in lieu of contacting a person designated by the licensee,  automatically takes the station off the air within three hours of any  technical malfunction which is capable of causing interference.
