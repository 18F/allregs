                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party may move, with or without supporting affidavits, for a decision by the Presiding Officer in that party's favor as to all or any part of the matters involved in the proceeding. The moving party shall annex to the motion a separate, short, and concise statement of the material facts as to which the moving party contends that there is no genuine issue to be heard. Motions may be filed at any time. Any other party may file an answer supporting or opposing the motion, with or without affidavits, within twenty (20) days after service of the motion. The party shall annex to any answer

opposing the motion a separate, short, and concise, statement of the material facts as to which it is contended there exists a genuine issue to be heard. All material facts set forth in the statement to be filed by the moving party will be deemed to be admitted unless controverted by the statement required to be filed by the opposing party. The opposing party may, within ten (10) days after service, respond in writing to new facts and arguments presented in any statement filed in support of the motion. No further supporting statements or responses thereto may be entertained. The Presiding Officer may dismiss summarily or hold in abeyance motions filed shortly before the hearing commences or during the hearing if the other parties or the Presiding Officer would be required to divert substantial resources from the hearing in order to respond adequately to the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Affidavits must set forth those facts that would be admissible in evidence and show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein. The Presiding Officer may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by further affidavits. When a motion for summary disposition is made and supported as provided in this section, a party opposing the motion may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of its answer; its answer by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this section must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue of fact. If no such answer is filed, the decision sought, if appropriate, must be rendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Presiding Officer shall render the decision sought if the filings in the proceeding show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a decision as a matter of law. However, in any proceeding involving a construction authorization for a geologic repository operations area, the procedure described in this section may be used only for the determination of specific subordinate issues and may not be used to determine the ultimate issue as to whether the authorization must be issued.
