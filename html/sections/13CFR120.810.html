The applicant also must include an operating budget, approved by the applicant's Board of Directors, which demonstrates the required financial ability (as described in Sec. 120.825), and a plan to meet CDC operational requirements (without specializing in a particular industry) in Secs. 120.821, and 120.826 through 120.830.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The District Office will forward the application and its recommendation to the D/FA, who will make the final decision.
