Preclearance may be used only for air travelers and their baggage, not for merchandise.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Private aircraft.

This definition applies if the aircraft is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Manned entirely by members of the armed forces or civil service of such government, or by both;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transporting only property of such government, or passengers traveling on official business of such government; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Carrying neither passengers nor cargo.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Residue cargo. ``Residue cargo'' is any cargo on board an aircraft arriving in the U.S. from a foreign area if the:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Final delivery airport in the U.S. is not the port of arrival; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cargo remains on board the aircraft and travels from port to port in the U.S., for final delivery in a foreign area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Scheduled airline.
