                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> States shall submit to the Administrator a proposed State UIC  program complying with Sec.  145.22 of this part within 270 days of the  date of promulgation of the UIC regulations on June 24, 1980. The  administrator may, for good cause, extend the date for submission of a  proposed State UIC program for up to an additional 270 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States shall submit to the Administrator 6 months after the date  of promulgation of the UIC regulations a report describing the State's  progress in developing a UIC program. If the Administrator extends the  time for submission of a UIC program an additional 270 days, pursuant to  Sec.  145.21(a), the State shall submit a second report six months after  the first report is due. The Administrator may prescribe the manner and  form of the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The requirements of Sec.  145.21 (a) and (b) shall not apply to  Indian Tribes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EPA will establish a UIC program in any State which does not  comply with paragraph (a) of this section. EPA will continue to operate  a UIC program in such a State until the State receives approval of a UIC  program in accordance with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2">Note: States which are authorized to administer the NPDES permit  program under section 402 of CWA are encouraged to rely on existing  statutory authority, to the extent possible, in developing a State UIC  program. Section 402(b)(1)(D) of CWA requires that NPDES States have the  authority ``to issue permits which control the disposal of pollutants  into wells.'' In many instances, therefore, NPDES States will have  existing statutory authority to regulate well disposal which satisfies  the requirements of the UIC program. Note, however, that CWA excludes  certain types of well injections from the definition of ``pollutant.''  If the State's statutory authority contains a similar exclusion it may  need to be modified to qualify for UIC program approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a State can demonstrate to EPA's satisfaction that there are  no underground injections within the State for one or more classes of  injection wells (other than Class IV wells) subject to SDWA and that  such injections cannot legally occur in the State until the State has  developed an approved program for those classes of injections, the State  need not submit a program to regulate those injections and a partial  program may be approved. The demonstration of legal prohibition shall be  made by either explicitly banning new injections of the class not  covered by the State program or providing a certification from the State  Attorney General that such new injections cannot legally occur until the  State has developed an approved program for that class. The State shall  submit a program to regulate both those classes of injections for which  a   demonstration is not made and class IV wells.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When a State UIC program is fully approved by EPA to regulate  all classes of injections, the State assumes primary enforcement  authority under section 1422(b)(3) of SDWA. EPA retains primary  enforcement responsibility whenever the State program is disapproved in  whole or in part. States which have partially approved programs have  authority to enforce any violation of the approved portion of their  program. EPA retains authority to enforce violations of State  underground injection control programs, except that, when a State has a  fully approved program, EPA will not take enforcement actions without  providing prior notice to the State and otherwise complying with section  1423 of SDWA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A State can assume primary enforcement responsibility for the  UIC program, notwithstanding Sec.  145.21(3), when the State program is  unable to regulate activities on Indian lands within the State. EPA will  administer the program on Indian lands if the State does not seek this  authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To establish a Federal UIC Class VI program in States not  seeking full UIC primary enforcement responsibility approval, pursuant  to the SDWA section 1422(c), States shall, by September 6, 2011, submit  to the Administrator a new or revised State UIC program complying with  Sec. Sec.  145.22 or 145.32 of this part. Beginning on September 6, 2011  the requirements of subpart H of part 146 of this chapter will be  applicable and enforceable by EPA in each State that has not received  approval of a new Class VI program application under section 1422 of the  Safe Drinking Water Act or a revision of its UIC program under section  1422 of the Safe Drinking Water Act to incorporate subpart H of part  146. Following September 6, 2011, EPA will publish a list of the States  where subpart H of part 146 has become applicable.
