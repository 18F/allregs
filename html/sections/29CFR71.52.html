                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following systems of records are eligible for exemption  under 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5) because they contain investigatory material  compiled solely for the purpose of determining suitability, eligibility,  or qualifications for Federal civilian employment, military service,  Federal contracts, or access to classified information, but only to the  extent that the disclosure of such material would reveal the identity of  a source who furnished information to the Government under an express  promise that the identity of the source would be held in confidence, or,  prior to January 1, 1975 , under an implied promise that the identity of  the source would be held in confidence. Accordingly, these systems of  records are exempt from (c)(3), (d)(1), (d)(2), (d)(3), (d)(4), (e)(1),  (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(I) and (f) of 5 U.S.C. 552a.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> DOL/OASAM-20 (Personnel Investigation Records), a system of  records maintained by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for  Administration and Management (OASAM).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DOL/OIG-1 (General Investigative Files, and Subject Title Index,  USDOL/OIG), a system of records maintained by the Office of the  Inspector General (OIG).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> DOL/OIG-2 (Freedom of Information/Privacy Acts Records), a  system of records maintained by the OIG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> DOL/OIG-3 (Case Development Records), a system of records  maintained by the OIG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> DOL/OIG-5 (Investigative Case Tracking Systems/Audit Information  Reporting Systems, USDOL/OIG), a system of records maintained by the  OIG.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> This exemption applies to the extent that information in these  systems   is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(k)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (6) of this section, from the following  subsections of 5 U.S.C. 552a:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> is specifically  exempted for this system of records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, (d)(3), and (d)(4). Access to the  records contained in these systems would inform the subject of an actual  or potential investigation of the existence of that investigation, of  the nature and scope of the information and evidence obtained as to his  or her activities, and of the identity of witnesses or informants. Such  access would, accordingly, provide information that could enable the  subject to avoid detection. This result, therefore, would constitute a  serious impediment to effective investigation not only because it would  prevent the successful completion of the investigation but also because  it could endanger the physical safety of witnesses or informants, lead  to the improper influencing of witnesses, the destruction of evidence,  or the fabrication of testimony.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Subsection (e)(1). The notices for these systems of records  published in the Federal Register set forth the basic statutory or  related authority for maintenance of this system. However, in the course  of civil and related investigations, cases and matters, the agency will  occasionally obtain information concerning actual or potential  violations of law that are not strictly or technically within its  statutory or other authority or may compile information in the course of  an investigation which may not be relevant to a specific case. In the  interests of effective investigation, it is necessary to retain some or  all of such information in these systems of records since it can aid in  establishing patterns of compliance and can provide valuable leads for  Federal and other law enforcement agencies. Moreover, it is difficult to  know during the course of an investigation what is relevant and  necessary. In this connection, facts or evidence may not seem relevant  at first, but later in the investigation, their relevance is borne out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(G)</em> and (H). Since an exemption is being  claimed for subsections (f) (Agency Rules) and (d) (Access to Records)  of the Act, these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that these  systems of records are exempted from subsections (f) and (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Subsection (e)(4)(I). The categories of sources of the records  in these systems have been published in the Federal Register in broad  generic terms in the belief that this is all that subsection (e)(4)(I)  of the Act requires. In the event, however, that this subsection should  be interpreted to require more detail as to the identity of sources of  the records in this system, exemption from this provision is necessary  in order to protect the confidentiality of the sources of investigatory  information. Such exemption is further necessary to protect the privacy  and physical safety of witnesses and informants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Subsection (f). Procedures for notice to an individual pursuant  to subsection (f)(1) as to existence of records pertaining to the  individual dealing with an actual or potential investigation must be  exempted because such notice to an individual would be detrimental to  the successful conduct and/or completion of an investigation or case,  pending or future. In addition, mere notice of the fact of an  investigation could inform the subject or others that their activities  are under or may   become the subject of an investigation and could enable the subjects to  avoid detection, to influence witnesses improperly, to destroy evidence,  or to fabricate testimony. Since an exemption is being claimed for  subsection (d) of the Act (Access to Records), the rules required  pursuant to subsections (f)(2) through (5) are inapplicable to these  systems of records to the extent that these systems of records are  exempted from subsection (d).</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
