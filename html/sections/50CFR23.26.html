                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Article VIII of the Treaty provides that Parties take  appropriate measures to enforce the Convention to prevent illegal  trafficking in wildlife and plants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Original CITES documents. A separate original or a true copy of  a CITES document must be issued before the import, introduction from the  sea, export, or re-export occurs, and the document must accompany each  shipment. No copy may be used in place of an   original except as provided in Sec.  23.23(e)(3) or when a shipment is  in transit (see Sec.  23.22). Fax or electronic copies are not  acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Acceptance of CITES documents. We will accept a CITES document  as valid for import, introduction from the sea, export, or re-export  only if the document meets the requirements of this section, Sec. Sec.   23.23 through 23.25, and the following conditions:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Altered or      The CITES document has not been altered (including</p><p class="depth0">modified CITES      by rubbing or scratching out), added to, or</p><p class="depth0">document            modified in any way unless the change is validated</p><p class="depth0">on the document by the stamp and authorized</p><p class="depth0">signature of the issuing Management Authority, or</p><p class="depth0">if the document was issued as a partially completed</p><p class="depth0">document, the Management Authority lists on the</p><p class="depth0">face of the document which blocks must be completed</p><p class="depth0">by the permit holder. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (2) Annual reports  The Party issuing the CITES document has submitted</p><p class="depth0">annual reports and is not subject to any action</p><p class="depth0">under Article VIII paragraph 7(a) that would not</p><p class="depth0">allow trade in CITES species. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (3) CITES document  U.S. and foreign CITES documents must meet the</p><p class="depth0">general provisions and criteria in subparts C and</p><p class="depth0">E. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (4) Conditions      All conditions on the CITES document are met. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (5) Convention      The Party issuing the CITES document is not subject</p><p class="depth0">implementation      to any action under Article VIII or Article XIII</p><p class="depth0">paragraph 3 that would not allow trade in the</p><p class="depth0">species. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (6) Extension of    The validity of a CITES document may not be extended</p><p class="depth0">validity            except as provided in Sec.   23.73 for certain</p><p class="depth0">timber species. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (7) Fraudulent      The CITES document is authentic and does not contain</p><p class="depth0">CITES document or   erroneous or misleading information.</p><p class="depth0">CITES document</p><p class="depth0">containing false</p><p class="depth0">information ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (8) Humane          Live wildlife or plants were transported in</p><p class="depth0">transport           compliance with the International Air Transport</p><p class="depth0">Association Live Animals Regulations (for animals)</p><p class="depth0">or the International Air Transport Association</p><p class="depth0">Perishable Cargo Regulations (for plants)</p><p class="depth0">(incorporated by reference, see Sec.   23.9). ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (9) Legal           The Party or non-Party issuing the CITES document</p><p class="depth0">acquisition         has made the required legal acquisition finding. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (10) Management     The CITES document was issued by a Party or non-</p><p class="depth0">Authority and       Party that has designated a Management Authority</p><p class="depth0">Scientific          and Scientific Authority and has provided</p><p class="depth0">Authority           information on these authorities to the</p><p class="depth0">Secretariat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (11) Name of        A CITES document is specific to the name on the face</p><p class="depth0">importer and        of the document and may not be transferred or</p><p class="depth0">exporter            assigned to another person. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (12) Non-detriment  The Party or non-Party issuing the CITES document</p><p class="depth0">has made the required non-detriment finding. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (13) Phytosanitary  A phytosanitary certificate may be used to export</p><p class="depth0">certificate         artificially propagated plants only if the issuing</p><p class="depth0">Party has provided copies of the certificates,</p><p class="depth0">stamps, and seals to the Secretariat. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (14) Quota          For species with a quota on file with the</p><p class="depth0">Secretariat, the quantity exported from a

mark is described on the CITES document.</p><p class="depth0">Appendix-I</p><p class="depth0">wildlife ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (16) Registered     The operation is included in the Secretariat's</p><p class="depth0">commercial          register.</p><p class="depth0">nursery for</p><p class="depth0">Appendix-I plants ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (17) Retrospective  A CITES document was not issued retrospectively</p><p class="depth0">CITES documents     except as provided in Sec.   23.53. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ (18) Shipment       The contents of the shipment match the description</p><p class="depth0">contents            of specimens provided on the CITES document,</p><p class="depth0">including the units and species. A shipment cannot</p><p class="depth0">contain more or different specimens or species than</p><p class="depth0">certified or validated on the CITES document at the</p><p class="depth0">time of export or re-export; the quantity of</p><p class="depth0">specimens validated or certified may be less, but</p><p class="depth0">not more, than the quantity stated at the time of</p><p class="depth0">issuance. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Wild-          A wild-collected specimen (indicated on the CITES</p><p class="depth0">collected           document with a source code of ``W'') is not coming</p><p class="depth0">specimen            from a country that is outside the range of the</p><p class="depth0">species, unless we have information indicating that</p><p class="depth0">the species has been established in the wild in</p><p class="depth0">that country through accidental introduction or</p><p class="depth0">other means. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Verification of a CITES document. We may request verification of  a CITES document from the Secretariat or a foreign Management Authority  before deciding whether to accept it under some circumstances,  including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> We receive reliable information that indicates the need for  CITES document verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> We have reasonable grounds to believe that a CITES document is  not valid or authentic because the species is being traded in a manner  detrimental to the survival of the species or in violation of foreign  wildlife or plant laws, or any applicable Management or Scientific  Authority finding has not been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The re-export certificate refers to an export permit that does  not exist or is not valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The CITES document includes a species for which the Secretariat  has published an annotated quota.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> We have reasonable grounds to believe that the document is  fraudulent, contains false information, or has unauthorized changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> We have reasonable grounds to believe that the specimen  identified as bred in captivity or artificially propagated is a wild  specimen, was produced from illegally acquired parental stock, or  otherwise does not qualify for these exemptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> We know or have reasonable grounds to believe that an Appendix-I  specimen was not bred at a facility registered with the CITES  Secretariat and that the purpose of the import is commercial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The import of a specimen designated as bred in captivity or  artificially propagated is from a non-Party. For an Appendix-I specimen,  we must consult with the Secretariat.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> For a retrospectively issued CITES document, both the importing  and exporting or re-exporting countries' Management Authorities have not  agreed to the issuance of the document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> For a replacement CITES document, we need clarification of the  reason the document was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> The export permit or re-export certificate does not contain  validation or certification by an inspecting official at the time of  export of the actual quantity exported or re-exported.
