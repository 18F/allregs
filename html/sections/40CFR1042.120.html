                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. You must warrant to the ultimate purchaser  and each subsequent purchaser that the new engine, including all parts  of its emission control system, meets two conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is designed, built, and equipped so it conforms at the time  of sale to the ultimate purchaser with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is free from defects in materials and workmanship that may  keep it from meeting these requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> only on the engine's age (in years).</p><p class="depth2">The warranty period begins when the engine is placed into service.  The following minimum warranty periods apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Category 1 and Category 2 engines, your emission-related  warranty must be valid for at least 50 percent of the engine's useful  life in hours of operation or a number of years equal to at least 50  percent of the useful life in years, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Category 3 engines, your emission-related warranty must be  valid throughout the engine's full useful life as specified in Sec.   1042.104(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Components covered. The emission-related warranty covers all  components whose failure would increase an engine's emissions of any  regulated pollutant, including components listed in 40 CFR part 1068,  Appendix I, and components from any other system you develop to control  emissions. The emission-related warranty for freshly manufactured marine  engines covers these components even if another company produces the  component. Your emission-related warranty does not need to cover  components whose failure would not increase an engine's emissions of any  regulated pollutant. For remanufactured engines, your emission-related  warranty is required to cover only those parts that you supply or those  parts for which you specify allowable part manufacturers. It does not  need to cover used parts that are not replaced during the remanufacture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limited applicability. You may deny warranty claims under this  section if the operator caused the problem through improper maintenance  or use, as described in 40 CFR 1068.115.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Owners manual. Describe in the owners manual the emission- related warranty provisions from this section that apply to the engine.  [73 FR 37243, June 30, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 22999, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
