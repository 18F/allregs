                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Formaldehyde emission levels. All plywood and particleboard  materials bonded with a resin system or coated with a surface finish  containing formaldehyde shall not exceed the following formaldehyde  emission levels when installed in manufactured homes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Plywood materials shall not emit formaldehyde in excess of 0.2  parts per million (ppm) as measured by the air chamber test method  specified in Sec. 3280.406.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Particleboard materials shall not emit formaldehyde in excess of  0.3 ppm as measured by the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Product certification and continuing qualification. All plywood  and particleboard materials to be installed in manufactured homes which  are bonded with a resin system or coated with a surface finish  containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol-formaldehyde  resin system or finish, shall be certified by a nationally recognized  testing laboratory as complying with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Separate certification shall be done for each plant where the  particleboard is produced or where the plywood or particleboard is  surface-finished.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To certify plywood or particleboard, the testing laboratory  shall witness or conduct the air chamber test specified in Sec.  3280.406 on randomly selected panels initially and at least quarterly  thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The testing laboratory must approve a written quality control  plan for each plant where the particleboard is produced or finished or  where the plywood is finished. The quality control plan must be designed  to assure that all panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section. The  plan must establish ongoing procedures to identify increases in the  formaldehyde emission characteristics of the finished product resulting  from the following changes in production.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of plywood:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The facility where the unfinished panels are produced is  changed;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The thickness of the panels is changed so that the panels are  thinner; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The grooving pattern on the panels is changed so that the  grooves are deeper or closer together.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of particleboard:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The resin formulation is changed so that the formaldehyde-to- urea ratio is increased;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount of formaldehyde resin used is increased; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The press time is decreased.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of plywood or particleboard:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The finishing or top coat is changed and the new finishing or  top coat has a greater formaldehyde content; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount of finishing or top coat used on the panels is  increased, provided that such finishing or top coat contains  formaldehyde.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The testing laboratory shall periodically visit the plant to  monitor quality control procedures to assure that all certified panels  meet the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> To maintain its certification, plywood or particleboard must be  tested by the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406 whenever one  of the following events occurs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of particleboard, the resin formulation is changed  so that the formaldehyde-to-urea ratio is increased; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of particleboard or plywood, the finishing or top  coat is changed and the new finishing or top coat contains formaldehyde;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of particleboard or plywood, the testing  laboratory determines that an air chamber test is necessary to assure  that panels comply with paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the event that an air chamber test measures levels of  formaldehyde from plywood or particleboard in excess of those permitted  under paragraph (a) of this section, then the tested product's  certification immediately lapses as of the date of production of the  tested panels. No panel produced on the same date as the tested panels  or on any day thereafter may be used or certified for use in  manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provided, however, that a new product certification may be  obtained by testing randomly selected panels which were produced on any  day following the date of production of the tested panels. If such  panels pass the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406, then the  plywood or particleboard produced on that day and subsequent days may be  used and certified for use in manufactured homes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provided further, that plywood or particleboard produced on the  same day as the tested panels, and panels produced on subsequent days,  if not certified pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, may be  used in manufactured homes only under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Each panel is treated with a scavenger, sealant, or other means  of reducing formaldehyde emissions which does not adversely affect the  structural quality of the product; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Panels randomly selected from the treated panels are tested by  and pass the air chamber test specified in Sec. 3280.406.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Panel identification. Each plywood and particleboard panel to be  installed in manufactured homes which is bonded or coated with a resin  system containing formaldehyde, other than an exclusively phenol- formaldehyde resin system, shall be stamped or labeled so as to identify  the product manufacturer, date of production and/or lot number, and the  testing laboratory certifying compliance with this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Treatment after certification. If certified plywood or  particleboard subsequently is treated with paint, varnish, or any other  substance containing formaldehyde, then the certification is no longer  valid. In such a case, each stamp or label placed on the panels pursuant  to paragraph (c) of this section must be obliterated. In addition, the  treated panels may be recertified and reidentified in accordance with  paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.  [49 FR 32011, Aug. 9, 1984]</p>
