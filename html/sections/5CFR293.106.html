                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To ensure the security and confidentiality of personnel records,  in whatever form, each agency shall establish administrative, technical,  and physical controls to protect information in personnel records from  unauthorized access, use, modification, destruction, or disclosure. As a  minimum, these controls shall require that all persons whose official  duties require access to and use of personnel records be responsible and  accountable for safeguarding those records and for ensuring that the  records are secured whenever they are not in use or under the direct  control of authorized persons. Generally, personnel records should be  held, processed, or stored only where facilities and conditions are  adequate to prevent unauthorized access.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personnel records must be stored in metal filing cabinets which  are locked when the records are not in use, or in a secured room.  Alternative storage facilities may be employed provided they furnish an  equivalent or greater degree of security than these methods. Except for  access by the data subject, only employees whose official duties require  access shall be allowed to handle and use personnel records, in whatever  form or media the records might appear. To the extent feasible, entry  into personnel record storage areas shall be similarly limited.  Documentation of the removal of records from storage areas must be kept  so that adequate control procedures can be established to assure that  removed records are returned on a timely basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disposal and destruction of personnel records shall be in  accordance with the General Record Schedule issued by the General  Services Administration for the records or, alternatively, with Office  or agency records control schedules approved by the National Archives  and Records Service of the General Services Administration.</p>
