                                Sec. 25.113  Station construction, launch authority, and operation of spare satellites.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Construction permits are not required for earth stations. Construction of such stations may commence prior to grant of an earth station license at the applicant's own risk, subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.1312 and part 17 of this chapter concerning environmental processing and construction, marking, and lighting of antenna structures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction permits are not required for Ancillary Terrestrial Component (ATC) stations. A party with licenses issued under this part for launch and operation of 1.5/1.6 GHz or 1.6/2.4 GHz GHz Mobile-Satellite Service space stations and operation of associated ATC facilities may commence construction of ATC base stations at its own risk after commencing physical construction of the space stations, subject to the requirements of Sec. 1.1312 and part 17 of this chapter. Such an MSS/ATC licensee may also conduct equipment tests for the purpose of making adjustments and measurements necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of its ATC license, applicable rules in this part, and technical design requirements. Prior to commencing such construction and pre-operational testing, an MSS/ATC licensee must notify the Commission of the commencement of physical satellite construction and the licensee's intention to construct and test ATC facilities. This notification must be filed electronically in the appropriate file in the International Bureau Filing System database. The notification must specify the frequencies the licensee proposes to use for pre-operational testing and the name, address, and telephone number of a representative for the reporting and mitigation of any interference resulting from such testing. MSS/ATC licensees engaging in pre-operational testing must comply with Sec. Sec. 5.83, 5.85(c), 5.111, and 5.117 of this chapter regarding experimental operations. An MSS/ATC licensee may not offer ATC service to the public for compensation during pre-operational testing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)-(e)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Construction permits are not required for U.S.-licensed space stations, except for stations that the applicant proposes to operate to disseminate program content to be received by the public at large, rather than only by subscribers. Construction of a station for which a construction permit is not required may commence, at the applicant's own risk, prior to grant of a license. Before commencing pre-grant construction, however, an applicant must notify the Commission in writing that it plans to begin construction at its own risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as set forth in paragraph (h) of this section, a launch authorization and station license (i.e., operating authority) must be applied for and granted before a space station may be launched and operated in orbit. Request for launch authorization may be included in an application for space station license. However, an application for authority to launch and operate an on-ground spare satellite will be

considered pursuant to the following procedures:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare NGSO-like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.157, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applications for launch and operation of an on-ground spare GSO-like satellite will be considered pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sec. 25.158, except as set forth in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Neither paragraph (g)(1) nor (g)(2) of this section will apply in cases where the space station to be launched is determined to be an emergency replacement for a previously authorized space station that has been lost as a result of a launch failure or a catastrophic in-orbit failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Operators of NGSO satellite systems licensed by the Commission need not file separate applications to operate technically identical in-orbit spares launched pursuant to a blanket license granted under Sec. 25.114(a). However, the licensee must notify the Commission within 30 days of bringing the in-orbit spare into operation and certify that its activation has not increased the number of operating space stations above the number previously authorized and that the licensee has determined by measurement that the activated spare is operating within the terms of the license.
[56 FR 24016, May 28, 1991, as amended at 61 FR 4366, Feb. 6, 1996; 61 FR 9951, Mar. 12, 1996; 61 FR 55582, Oct. 28, 1996; 62 FR 5927, Feb. 10, 1997; 62 FR 64172, Dec. 4, 1997; 68 FR 51502, Aug. 27, 2003; 69 FR 47794, Aug. 6, 2004; 70 FR 32253, June 2, 2005; 77 FR 3954, Jan. 26, 2012; 78 FR 8421, Feb. 6, 2013; 79 FR 8314, Feb. 12, 2014; 79 FR 27503, May 14, 2014]</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 79 FR 27503, May 14, 2014, in Sec. 25.113, in the second sentence in paragraph (b), ``1.5/1.6 GHz, 1.6/2.4 GHz, or 2 GHz Mobile-Satellite Service'' was corrected to read ``1.5/1.6 GHz or 1.6/2.4 GHz GHz Mobile-Satellite Service''.
