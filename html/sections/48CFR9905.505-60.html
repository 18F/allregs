                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An auditor recommends disallowance of certain direct labor and  direct material costs, for which a billing has been submitted under a  contract, on the basis that these particular costs were not required for  performance and were not authorized by the contract. The contracting  officer issues a written decision which supports the auditor's position  that the questioned costs are   unallowable. Following receipt of the contracting officer's decision,  the educational institution must clearly identify the disallowed direct  labor and direct material costs in the institution's accounting records  and reports covering any subsequent submission which includes such  costs. Also, if the educational institution's base for allocation of any  indirect cost pool relevant to the subject contract consists of direct  labor, direct material, total prime cost, total cost input, etc., the  institution must include the disallowed direct labor and material costs  in its allocation base for such pool. Had the contracting officer's  decision been against the auditor, the educational institution would  not, of course, have been required to account separately for the costs  questioned by the auditor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An educational institution incurs, and separately identifies, as  a part of a service center or expense pool, certain costs which are  expressly unallowable under the existing and currently effective  regulations. If the costs of the service center or indirect expense pool  are regularly a part of the educational institution's base for  allocation of other indirect expenses, the educational institution must  allocate the other indirect expenses to contracts and other final cost  objectives by means of a base which includes the identified unallowable  indirect costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An auditor recommends disallowance of certain indirect costs.  The educational institution claims that the costs in question are  allowable under the provisions of Office Of Management and Budget  Circular A-21, Cost Principles For Educational Institutions; the auditor  disagrees. The issue is referred to the contracting officer for  resolution pursuant to the contract disputes clause. The contracting  officer issues a written decision supporting the auditor's position that  the total costs questioned are unallowable under the Circular. Following  receipt of the contracting officer's decision, the educational  institution must identify the disallowed costs and specific other costs  incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances in any subsequent  estimating, cost accumulation or reporting for Government contracts, in  which such costs are included. If the contracting officer's decision had  supported the educational institution's contention, the costs questioned  by the auditor would have been allowable and the educational institution  would not have been required to provide special identification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An educational institution incurred certain unallowable costs  that were charged indirectly as general administration and general  expenses (GA&GE;). In the educational institution's proposals for final  indirect cost rates to be applied in determining allowable contract  costs, the educational institution identified and excluded the expressly  unallowable GA&GE; costs form the applicable indirect cost pools. In  addition, during the course of negotiation of indirect cost rates to be  used for bidding and billing purposes, the educational institution  agreed to classify as unallowable cost, various directly associated  costs of the identifiable unallowable costs. On the basis of  negotiations and agreements between the educational institution and the  contracting officer's authorized representatives, indirect cost rates  were established, based on the net balance of allowable GA&GE.;  Application of the rates negotiated to proposals, and to billings, for  covered contracts constitutes compliance with the Standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An employee, whose salary, travel, and subsistence expenses are  charged regularly to the general administration and general expenses  (GA&GE;), an indirect cost category, takes several business associates on  what is clearly a business entertainment trip. The entertainment costs  of such trips is expressly unallowable because it constitutes  entertainment expense prohibited by OMB Circular A-21, and is separately  identified by the educational institution. In these circumstances, the  employee's travel and subsistence expenses would be directly associated  costs for identification with the unallowable entertainment expense.  However, unless this type of activity constituted a significant part of  the employee's regular duties and responsibilities on which his salary  was based, no part of the employee's salary would be required to be  identified as a directly associated cost of the unallowable  entertainment expense.</p>
