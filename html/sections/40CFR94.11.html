                                Sec. 94.11  Requirements for rebuilding certified engines.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions of this section apply with respect to engines subject to the standards prescribed in Sec. 94.8 and are applicable to the process of engine rebuilding. Engine rebuilding means to overhaul an engine or to otherwise perform extensive service on the engine (or on a portion of the engine or engine system). For the purpose of this definition, perform extensive service means to disassemble the engine (or portion of the engine or engine system), inspect and/or replace many of the parts, and reassemble the engine (or portion of the engine or engine system) in such a

manner that significantly increases the service life of the resultant engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When rebuilding an engine, portions of an engine, or an engine system, there must be a reasonable technical basis for knowing that the resultant engine is equivalent, from an emissions standpoint, to a certified configuration (i.e., tolerances, calibrations, specifications), and the model year(s) of the resulting engine configuration must be identified. A reasonable basis would exist if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parts installed, whether the parts are new, used, or rebuilt, are such that a person familiar with the design and function of motor vehicle engines would reasonably believe that the parts perform the same function with respect to emission control as the original parts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any parameter adjustment or design element change is made only:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In accordance with the original engine manufacturer's instructions; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where data or other reasonable technical basis exists that such parameter adjustment or design element change, when performed on the engine or similar engines, is not expected to adversely affect in-use emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When an engine is being rebuilt and remains installed or is reinstalled in the same vessel, it must be rebuilt to a configuration of the same or later model year as the original engine. When an engine is being replaced, the replacement engine must be an engine of (or rebuilt to) a certified configuration that is equivalent, from an emissions standpoint, to the engine being replaced.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> At time of rebuild, emission-related codes or signals from on-board monitoring systems may not be erased or reset without diagnosing and responding appropriately to the diagnostic codes, regardless of whether the systems are installed to satisfy requirements in Sec. 94.211 or for other reasons and regardless of form or interface. Diagnostic systems must be free of all such codes when the rebuilt engine is returned to service. Such signals may not be rendered inoperative during the rebuilding process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> When conducting a rebuild, all critical emission-related components listed in Appendix I of this part not otherwise addressed by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be checked and cleaned, adjusted, repaired, or replaced as necessary, following manufacturer recommended practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When conducting a rebuild, all critical emission-related components listed in Appendix I of this part not otherwise addressed by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be checked and cleaned, adjusted, repaired, or replaced as necessary, following manufacturer recommended practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the installation of a rebuilt engine, all critical emission-related components listed in Appendix I of this part not otherwise addressed by paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section must be checked as necessary, following manufacturer recommended practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records shall be kept by parties conducting activities included in paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. At minimum the records shall include the hours of operation at the time of rebuild, a listing of work performed on the engine and emission-related control components (including a listing of parts and components used, engine parameter adjustments, emission-related codes or signals responded to and reset), and work performed under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Parties may keep records in whatever format or system they choose as long as the records are understandable to an EPA enforcement officer or can be otherwise provided to an EPA enforcement officer in an understandable format when requested.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Parties are not required to keep records of information that is not reasonably available through normal business practices including information on activities not conducted by themselves or information that they cannot reasonably access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Parties may keep records of their rebuilding practices for an engine family rather than on each individual engine rebuilt in cases where those rebuild practices are followed routinely.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records must be kept for a minimum of two years after the engine is rebuilt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For Category 3 engines, the owner and operator shall also comply with the recordkeeping requirements in the Annex VI Technical Code (incorporated by reference at Sec. 94.5) regarding the Engine Book of Record Parameters.
