                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Presiding Officer may certify a ruling for interlocutory  review by the Administrator where a party so requests and the Presiding  Officer concludes that (1) the ruling from which review is sought  involves an important question as to which there is substantial ground  for difference of opinion, and (2) either (i) a subsequent reversal of  his ruling would be likely to result in substantial delay or expense if  left to the conclusion of the proceedings, or (ii) a ruling on the  question by the Administrator would be of material assistance in  expediting the hearing. The certificate shall be in writing and shall  specify the material relevant to the ruling certified. If the  Administrator determines that interlocutory review is not warranted, he  may decline to consider the ruling which has been certified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the Presiding Officer declines to certify a ruling the  party who had requested certification may apply to the Administrator for  interlocutory review, or the Administrator may on his own motion direct  that any matter be submitted to him for review, subject to the standards  for review set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. An application  for review shall be in writing and shall briefly state the grounds  relied on. If the Administrator takes no action with respect to such  application for interlocutory review within 15 days of its filing, such  application shall be deemed to have been denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the  Administrator, the hearing shall continue pending consideration by the  Administrator of any ruling or request for interlocutory review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unless otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the  Administrator, briefs in response to any application for interlocutory  review may be filed by any party within five days of the filing of the  application for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Failure to request or obtain interlocutory review does not waive  the rights of any party to complain of a ruling following completion of  the hearing. Within five days following the close of a hearing under  this part, any party may apply to the Administrator for post-hearing  review of any procedural ruling, or any ruling made by the Presiding  Officer concerning the admission or exclusion of evidence to which  timely objection was made. Within seven days following the filing of any  such application any other party may file a brief in response thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the Administrator on review under paragraph (e) of this  section determines that evidence was improperly excluded, he may order  its admission   without remand for further proceedings, or may remand with such  instructions as he deems appropriate concerning cross-examination, or  opportunity for any party to submit further evidence, with respect to  such evidence as he directs should be admitted. In making his  determination whether to remand, the Administrator shall consider  whether the statutory time restraints permit a remand, and whether it  would be constructive to allow cross-examination or further evidence  with respect to the newly admitted evidence. If evidence is admitted  without cross-examination, the Administrator shall consider the lack of  opportunity for cross-examination in determining the weight to be given  such evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Motions shall be brief, in writing, and may be filed at any time  following the publication of the proposed effluent standards, unless  otherwise ordered by the Presiding Officer or the Administrator. Unless  otherwise ordered or provided in these rules, responses to motions may  be filed within seven days of the actual filing of the motion with the  hearing clerk.</p>
