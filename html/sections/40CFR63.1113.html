An owner or operator  of an affected source may request a determination of alternative means  of emission limitation to the requirements of design, equipment, work  practice, or operational standards of this subpart or of a subpart  referenced by this subpart. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an  alternative means of emission limitation will achieve a reduction in HAP  emissions at least equivalent to the reduction in emissions from that  source achieved under any design, equipment, work practice, or  operational standards (but not performance standards) in this subpart,  the Administrator will publish in the Federal Register a notice  permitting the use of the alternative means for purposes of compliance  with that requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The notice may condition the permission on requirements related  to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any such notice shall be published only after public notice and  an opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of submittal. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order to obtain approval, any  person seeking permission to use an alternative means of compliance  under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the  Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves  equivalent emission reductions. An owner or   operator of an affected source seeking permission to use an alternative  means of compliance who has not previously performed testing shall also  submit a proposed test plan. If the owner or operator seeks permission  to use an alternative means of compliance based on previously performed  testing, they shall submit the results of testing, a description of the  procedures followed in testing or monitoring, and a description of  pertinent conditions during testing or monitoring.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator who requests an alternative means of  emissions limitation shall submit a description of the proposed testing,  monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting that will be used and the  proposed basis for demonstrating compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For storage vessels, the owner or operator shall include the  results of actual emissions tests using full-size or scale-model storage  vessels that accurately collect and measure all regulated HAP emissions  using a given control technique, and that accurately simulate wind and  account for other emission variables such as temperature and barometric  pressure, or an engineering analysis that the Administrator determines  to be an accurate method of determining equivalence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For proposed alternatives to equipment leak requirements  referenced by this subpart, the owner or operator shall also submit the  information specified in and meet the requirements for alternate means  of emission limitation specified in the referenced subparts.</p>
