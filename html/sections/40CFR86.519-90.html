                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The CVS (Constant Volume Sampler) is calibrated using an accurate flowmeter and restrictor valve. Measurements of various parameters are made and related to flow through the unit. Procedures used by EPA for both PDP (Positive Displacement Pump) and CFV (Critical Flow Venturi) are outlined below. Other procedures yielding equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator. After the calibration curve has been obtained, verification of the entire system can be performed by injecting a known mass of gas into the system and comparing the mass indicated by the system to the true mass injected. An indicated error does not necessarily mean that the calibration is wrong, since other factors can influence the accuracy of the system, e.g., analyzer calibration. A verification procedure is found in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> PDP calibration. (1) The following calibration procedures outlines the

equipment, the test configuration, and the various parameters which must be measured to establish the flow rate of the constant volume sampler pump. All the parameters related to the pump are simultaneously measured with the parameters related to a flowmeter which is connected in series with the pump. The calculated flow rate (at pump inlet absolute pressure and temperature) can then be plotted versus a correlation function which is the value of a specific combination of pump parameters. The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following calibration procedures outlines the

The linear equation which relates the pump flow and the correlation function is then determined. In the event that a CVS has a multiple speed drive, a calibration for each range must be performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This calibration procedure is based on the measurement of the absolute values of the pump and flowmeter parameters that relate the flow rate at each point. Three conditions must be maintained to assure the accuracy and integrity of the calibration curve. First, the pump pressures should be measured at taps on the pump rather than at the external piping on the pump inlet and outlet. Pressure taps that are mounted at the top center and bottom center of the pump drive headplate are exposed to the actual pump cavity pressures, and therefore reflect the absolute pressure differentials. Secondly, temperature stability must be maintained during the calibration. The laminar flowmeter is sensitive to inlet temperature oscillations which cause the data points to be scattered. Gradual changes ([1 C ([1.8 F)) in temperature are acceptable as long as they occur over a period of several minutes. Finally, all connections between the flowmeter and the CVS pump must be absolutely void of any leakage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> During an exhaust emission test the measurement of these same pump parameters enables the user to calculate the flow rate from the calibration equation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Connect a system as shown in Figure F78-5. Although particular types of equipment are shown, other configurations that yield equivalent results may be used if approved in advance by the Administrator.

The following ``gravimetric'' technique can be used to verify that the CVS and analytical instruments can accurately measure a mass of gas that has been injected into the system. If the CVS and analytical system will be used only in the testing of gasoline-fueled vehicles, the system verification may be performed using either propane or carbon monoxide. If the CVS and analytical system will be used with methanol-fueled vehicles as well as gasoline-fueled vehicles, system verification performance check must include a methanol check in addition to either the propane or carbon monoxide check. (Verification can also be accomplished by constant flow metering using critical flow orifice devices.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a small cylinder that has been charged with pure propane or carbon monoxide gas (CAUTION--carbon monoxide is poisonous).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine a reference cylinder weight to the nearest 0.01 grams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a quantity of pure propane or carbon monoxide into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Following completion of step (3) above (if methanol injection is required), continue to operate the CVS in the normal manner and release a known quantity of pure methanol (in gaseous form) into the system during the sampling period (approximately 5 minutes). This step does not need to be performed with each verification, provided that it is performed at least twice annually.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The calculations of Sec. 86.544 are performed in the normal way except in the case of propane. The density of propane (0.6109 kg/m\3\/carbon atom (17.30 g/ft\3\/carbon atom)) is used in place of the density of exhaust hydrocarbons. In the case of carbon monoxide, the density of 1.164 kg/m\3\ (32.97 g/ft\3\) is used.

In the case of methanol, the density of 1.332 kg/m\3\ (37.71 g/ft\3\) is used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The gravimetric mass is subtracted from the CVS measured mass and then divided by the gravimetric mass to determine the percent accuracy of the system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The cause for any discrepancy greater than [2 percent must be found and corrected. The Administrator, upon request, may waive the requirement to comply with [2 percent methanol recovery tolerance, and instead require compliance with a higher tolerance (not to exceed [6 percent), provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator determines that compliance with the specified tolerance is not practically feasible; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer makes information available to the Administrator which indicates that the calibration tests and their results are consistent with good laboratory practice, and that the results are consistent with the results of calibration testing conducted by the Administrator.
