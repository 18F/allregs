                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A motor vehicle or engine may be finally admitted into the  United States upon approval of the certificate holder's application to  the Administrator. Such application shall be made either by completing  EPA forms or by submitting the data electronically to EPA's computer, in  accordance with EPA instructions. Such application shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The information required in Sec. 85.1504(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Information demonstrating that the vehicle or engine has been  modified in accordance with a valid certificate of conformity. Such  demonstration shall be made in one of the following ways:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Through an attestation by the certificate holder that the  vehicle or engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of  the certificate holder's certificate, and presentation to EPA of a  statement by the appropriate OEM that the OEM will provide to the  certificate holder and to EPA information concerning running changes to  the vehicle or engine described in the certificate holder's application  for certification, and actual receipt by EPA of notification by the  certificate holder of any running changes already implemented by the OEM  at the time of application and their effect on emissions; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Through an attestation by the certificate holder that the  vehicle or engine has been modified in accordance with the provisions of  the certificate holder's certificate of conformity and that the  certificate holder has conducted an FTP test, at a laboratory within the  United States, that demonstrates compliance with Federal emission  requirements on every third vehicle or third engine imported under that  certificate within 120 days of entry, with sequencing of the tests to be  determined by the date of importation of each vehicle or engine. Should  the certificate holder have exceeded a threshold of 300 vehicles or  engines imported under the certificate without adjustments or other  changes in accordance with paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the amount  of required FTP testing may be reduced to every fifth vehicle or engine.  In order to make a demonstration under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this  section, a certificate holder must have received permission from the  Administrator to do so;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The results of every FTP test which the certificate holder  conducted on the vehicle or engine. Should a subject vehicle or engine  have failed an FTP at any time, the following procedures are applicable:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The certificate holder may either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Conduct one FTP retest that involves no adjustment of the  vehicle or engine from the previous test (e.g., adjusting the RPM,  timing, air-to-fuel ratio, etc.) other than adjustments to adjustable  parameters that, upon inspection, were found to be out of tolerance.  When such an allowable adjustment is made, the parameter may be reset  only to the specified (i.e., nominal) value (and not any other value  within the tolerance band); or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Initiate a change in production (running change) under the  provisions of 40 CFR 86.084-14(c)(13) or 86.1842-01, as applicable, that  causes the vehicle to meet Federal emission requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the certificate holder chooses to retest in accordance with  paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) of this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Such retests must be completed no later than five working days  subsequent to the first FTP test;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Should the subject vehicle or engine fail the second FTP, then  the certificate holder must initiate a change in production (a running  change) under   the provisions of 40 CFR 86.084-14(c)(13) or 86.1842-01, as applicable,  that causes the vehicle to meet Federal emission requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the certificate holder chooses to initiate a change in  production (a running change) under the provisions of 40 CFR 86.084- 14(c)(13) or 86.1842-01 as applicable, that causes the vehicle to meet  Federal requirements, changes involving adjustments of adjustable  vehicle parameters (e.g., adjusting the RPM, timing, air/fuel ratio)  must be changes in the specified (i.e., nominal) values to be deemed  acceptable by EPA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Production changes made in accordance with this section must be  implemented on all subsequent vehicles or engines imported under the  certificate after the date of importation of the vehicle or engine which  gave rise to the production change.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Commencing with the first vehicle or engine receiving the  running change, every third vehicle or engine imported under the  certificate must be FTP tested to demonstrate compliance with Federal  emission requirements until, as in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section,  a threshold of 300 vehicles or engines imported under the certificate is  exceeded, at which time the amount of required FTP testing may be  reduced to every fifth vehicle or engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reports concerning these running changes shall be made to both  the Manufacturers Operations and Certification Divisions of EPA within  ten working days of initiation of the running change. The cause of any  failure of an FTP shall be identified, if known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The applicable deterioration factor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The FTP results adjusted by the deterioration factor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Such other information that may be specified by applicable  regulations or on the certificate under which the vehicle or engine has  been modified in order to assure compliance with requirements of the  Act;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All information required under Sec. 85.1510;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> An attestation by the certificate holder that the certificate  holder is responsible for the vehicle's or engine's compliance with  Federal emission requirements, regardless of whether the certificate  holder owns the vehicle or engine imported under this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The name, address and telephone number of the person who the  certificate holder prefers to receive EPA notification under  Sec. 85.1505(c); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Such other information as is deemed necessary by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA approval for final admission of a vehicle or engine under  this section shall be presumed not to have been granted if a vehicle has  not been properly modified to be in conformity in all material respects  with the description in the application for certification or has not  complied with the provisions of Sec. 85.1505(a)(2) or its final FTP  results, adjusted by the deterioration factor, if applicable, do not  comply with applicable emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 85.1505(b), EPA approval for final  admission of a vehicle or engine under this section shall be presumed to  have been granted should the certificate holder not have received oral  or written notice from EPA to the contrary within 15 working days of the  date of EPA's receipt of the certificate holder's application under  Sec. 85.1505(a). Such EPA notice shall be made to an employee of the  certificate holder. If application is made on EPA forms, the date on a  certified mail receipt shall be deemed to be the official date of  notification to EPA. If application is made by submitting the data  electronically, the date of acceptance by EPA's computer shall be deemed  to be the official date of notification to EPA. During this 15 working  day period, the vehicle or engine must be stored at a location where the  Administrator will have reasonable access to the vehicle or engine for  his/her inspection.
