The grantee may impose separate restrictions on an operator or subgrantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the grantee or we discover that fees charged by the operator of a BIG-funded facility do not follow Sec.  86.90 and the facility unfairly competes with other marinas or makes excessive profits, the grantee must notify the operator in writing. The operator must respond to the notice in writing, and either justify or correct the fee schedule. If the operator justifies the fee schedule, the grantee and we must allow reasonable business decisions and only call for a change in the fee schedule if the operator is unable to show that the increase or decrease is reasonable.</p>
