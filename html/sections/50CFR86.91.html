                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An operator of a BIG-funded facility may increase or decrease  user fees during its useful life without our prior approval if they are  consistent with prevailing market rates. The grantee may impose separate  restrictions on an operator or subgrantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the grantee or we discover that fees charged by the operator  of a BIG-funded facility do not follow Sec.  86.90 and the facility  unfairly competes with other marinas or makes excessive profits, the  grantee must notify the operator in writing. The operator must respond  to the notice in writing, and either justify or correct the fee  schedule. If the operator justifies the fee schedule, the grantee and we  must allow reasonable business decisions and only call for a change in  the fee schedule if the operator is unable to show that the increase or  decrease is reasonable.</p>
