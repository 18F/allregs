                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Real property interests determined to be excess to transportation needs may be sold or conveyed to a public entity or to a private party in accordance with Sec. 710.403(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal, State, and local agencies shall be afforded the opportunity to acquire real property interests considered for disposal when such real property interests have potential use for parks, conservation, recreation, or related purposes, and when such a transfer is allowed by State law. When this potential exists, the STD shall notify the appropriate resource agencies of its intentions to dispose of the real property interests. The notifications can be accomplished by placing the appropriate agencies on the States' disposal notification listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Real property interests may be retained by the STD to restore, preserve, or improve the scenic beauty and environmental quality adjacent to the transportation facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where the transfer of properties to other agencies at less than fair market value for continued public use is clearly justified as in the public interest and approved by the FHWA, the deed shall provide for reversion of the property for failure to continue public ownership and use. Where property is sold at fair market value no reversion clause is required. Disposal actions described in 23 CFR 710.403(d)(1) for less

than fair market value require a public interest determination and FHWA approval, consistent with that section.
