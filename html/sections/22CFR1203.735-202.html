                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptance prohibited. Except as provided in paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section, an employee shall not solicit or accept, directly or indirectly, any gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of monetary value, from a person who:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has, or is seeking to obtain, contractual or other business or financial relations with the employee's agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conducts operations or activities that are regulated by the employee's agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has interests that may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's official duty; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Appears to be offering the gift with the hope or expectation of obtaining advantage or preferment in dealing with the U.S. Government for any purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance permitted. The provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gifts, gratuities, favors, entertainments, loans, or any other thing of monetary value received on account of close family or personal relationships when the circumstances make it clear that it is that relationship rather than the business of the persons concerned which is the motivating factor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acceptance of loans from banks or other financial institutions on customary terms to finance proper and usual activities of employees, such as home mortgage loans;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceptance of unsolicited advertising or promotional material, such as pens, pencils, note pads, calendars, and other items of nominal intrinsic value;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Acceptance of rates and discounts offered to employees as a class.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Acceptance permitted for IDCA employees. For IDCA employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply to: Acceptance of food and

refreshments of nominal value on infrequent occasions in the ordinary course of a luncheon or dinner meeting or other meeting or on an inspection tour where an employee may properly be in attendance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acceptance permitted for AID employees. For AID employees the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section do not apply in the following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment of nominal value on infrequent occasions offered in the ordinary course of luncheons, dinners, or other meetings and gatherings hosted by foreign governments or agencies and officials thereof, embassies, and international organizations, where the primary purpose of the function is representational or social, rather than the transaction of business. Where the primary purpose of the function is the transaction of business, acceptance is not permitted, except if there is justification and reporting in accordance with paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participation in widely attended lunches, dinners, and similar gatherings sponsored by industrial, technical, and professional associations for the discussion of matters of mutual interest to Government and industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment in the unusual situation where the employee, by virtue of the location of the person, firm, corporation, or other entity, or the regulations governing its dining facilities, finds it inconvenient or impracticable not to accept the offer. Each case of acceptance shall be reported in accordance with the requirement of paragraph (d)(4) of this section. In no other case shall employees accept food, refreshments, or entertainment from private corporations, entities, firms, or individual contractors at occasions which are other than widely attended functions whose purposes are unrelated to Agency business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In exceptional circumstances where acceptance of food, refreshments, or entertainment is not authorized by paragraphs (d) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, but where, in the judgment of the individual concerned, the Government's interest would be served by such acceptance directly or indirectly from any foreign government, agency, or official thereof or a private person, firm, corporation, or other entity which is engaged or is endeavoring to engage in business transactions of any sort with AID, an employee may accept the offer: Provided, That a report of the circumstances, together with the employee's statement as to how the Government's interests were served, will be made within 48 hours to the employee's supervisor, or, if the employee is serving abroad, or on temporary duty abroad, to the Mission Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Gifts to superiors. An employee shall for a gift to an official superior, make a donation as a gift to an official superior, or accept a gift from an employee receiving less pay than the employee (5 U.S.C. 7351). However, this paragraph does not prohibit a voluntary gift of nominal value or donation in a nominal amount made on a special occasion such as marriage, illness, or retirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Neither this section nor Sec. 1203.735-204 precludes an employee from receipt of bona fide reimbursement, unless prohibited by law, for expenses of travel and such other necessary subsistence as is compatible with this part for which no Government payment or reimbursement is made. However, this paragraph does not allow an employee to be reimbursed, or payment to be made on the employee's behalf, for excessive personal living expenses, gifts, entertainment, or other personal benefits, nor does it allow an employee to be reimbursed by a person for travel on official business under agency orders when reimbursement is proscribed by Decision B-128527 of the Comptroller General dated March 7, 1967.</p>
