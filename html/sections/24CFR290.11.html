HUD may combine two or more of the required  notifications, as appropriate, to simplify the disposition process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing of notifications. Disposition-related notifications  (i.e., pre-foreclosure notification to tenants and units of general  local government; pre-disposition community and tenant input  notification; state and local government right of first refusal  notification) will be made, as appropriate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 60 or more days before HUD forecloses on a project; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Before, or not more than 30 days after, HUD acquires a project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methods of notification--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To tenants. Pre-disposition  notification will be delivered to each unit in the project, or sent to  each unit by first class mail. Where HUD is mortgagee-in-possession or  owner of a project, the notice will also be posted in the project office  and in appropriate conspicuous and accessible locations around the  project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To units of general local government. Pre-disposition  notification to a unit of general local government will be sent to the  chief executive officer of the unit of general local government by first  class mail. For purposes of receiving or sending any notices or  information under this part, the unit of general local government is its  chief executive officer, or the person designated by the chief executive  officer to receive or send the notice or information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the community or any other party. HUD will consult with  tenants and their organizations, officials of units of general local  government, and other entities as HUD determines to be appropriate, to  identify community recipients of any required notification. Any notice  required to be made to any party other than a tenant or a unit of  general local government will be sent by first class mail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Content of notifications. Notifications will, as appropriate,  identify the project acquired or to be foreclosed by HUD; provide the  general terms and conditions concerning the sale, future use, and  operation of the project as proposed by HUD; indicate the time by which  any offers must be made or any comments must be submitted; and state  that the full disposition recommendation and analysis and other  supporting information will be available for inspection and copying at  the HUD Field Office.</p>
