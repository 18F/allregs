                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any funds paid to a recipient in excess of the amount to which the recipient is finally determined to be entitled under the terms and conditions of the award constitute a debt to the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OMB Circular A-110 informs each Federal agency that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a debt is not paid within a reasonable period after the demand for payment, the Federal agency may reduce the debt by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Making administrative offset against other requests for reimbursement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Withholding advance payments otherwise due to the recipient.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Taking other action permitted by statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided by law, the Federal awarding agency shall charge interest on an overdue debt in accordance with 4 CFR Chapter II, ``Federal Claims Collection Standards.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DoD grants officers shall follow the procedures in 32 CFR 22.820 for issuing demands for payment and transferring debts to DoD payment offices for collection. Recipients will be informed about pertinent procedures and timeframes through the written notices of grants officers' decisions and demands for payment.</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 32--Contract Provisions</p><p class="depth2">All contracts awarded by a recipient, including those for amounts less than the simplified acquisition threshold, shall contain the following provisions as applicable:</p><p class="depth2">1. Equal Employment Opportunity--All contracts shall contain a provision requiring compliance with E.O. 11246 (3 CFR, 1964-1965 Comp., p. 339), ``Equal Employment Opportunity,'' as amended by E.O. 11375 (3 CFR, 1966-1970 Comp., p. 684), ``Amending Executive Order 11246 Relating to Equal Employment Opportunity,'' and as supplemented by regulations at 41 CFR ch. 60, ``Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Equal Employment Opportunity, Department of Labor.''</p><p class="depth2">2. Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874 and 40 U.S.C. 276c)--All contracts and subawards in excess of $2000 for construction or repair awarded by recipients and subrecipients shall include a provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti-Kickback'' Act (18 U.S.C. 874), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 3, ``Contractors and Subcontractors on Public Building or Public Work Financed in Whole or in Part by Loans or Grants from the United States''). The Act provides that each contractor or subrecipient shall be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to give up any part of the compensation to which he is otherwise entitled. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the responsible DoD Component.</p><p class="depth2">3. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7)--This Act applies to procurements under awards only when the Federal program legislation specifically makes it apply (i.e., Davis-Bacon does not by itself apply to procurements under awards). In cases where another statute does make the Davis-Bacon Act apply, all construction contracts awarded by the recipients and subrecipients of more than $2,000 shall include a provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a to a-7) and as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5, ``Labor Standards Provisions Applicable to Contracts Governing Federally Financed and Assisted Construction''). Under this Act, contractors shall be required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than the minimum wages specified in a wage determination made by the Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors shall be required to pay wages not less than once a week. The recipient shall place a copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the Department of Labor in each solicitation and the award of a contract shall be conditioned upon the acceptance of the wage determination. The recipient shall report all suspected or reported violations to the Federal awarding agency.</p><p class="depth2">4. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333)--Where applicable, all contracts awarded by recipients in excess of $100,000 for construction or other purposes that involve the employment of mechanics or laborers shall include a provision for compliance with sections 102 and 107 of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 327-333), as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part 5). Under section 102 of the Act, each contractor shall be required to compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not less than 1\1/2\ times the basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. Section

107 of the Act is applicable to construction work and provides that no laborer or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for transportation or transmission of intelligence.</p><p class="depth2">5. Rights to Inventions Made Under a Contract, Grant or Cooperative Agreement--Contracts, grants, or cooperative agreements for the performance of experimental, developmental, or research work shall provide for the rights of the Federal Government and the recipient in any resulting invention in accordance with 37 CFR part 401, ``Rights to Inventions Made by Nonprofit Organizations and Small Business Firms Under Government Grants, Contracts and Cooperative Agreements.''</p><p class="depth2">6. Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.), as amended--Contracts and subawards of amounts in excess of $100,000 shall contain a provision that requires the recipient to agree to comply with all applicable standards, orders or regulations issued pursuant to the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act as amended (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.). Violations shall be reported to the responsible DoD Component and the Regional Office of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).</p><p class="depth2">7. Byrd Anti-Lobbying Amendment (31 U.S.C. 1352)--Contractors who apply or bid for an award of $100,000 or more shall file the required certification. Each tier certifies to the tier above that it will not and has not used Federal appropriated funds to pay any person or organization for influencing or attempting to influence an officer or employee of any agency, a member of Congress, officer or employee of Congress, or an employee of a member of Congress in connection with obtaining any Federal contract, grant or any other award covered by 31 U.S.C. 1352. Each tier shall also disclose any lobbying with non-Federal funds that takes place in connection with obtaining any Federal award. Such disclosures are forwarded from tier to tier up to the recipient.</p><p class="depth2">8. Debarment and Suspension (E.O.s 12549 and 12689)--A contract award with an amount expected to equal or exceed $25,000 and certain other contract awards (see 2 CFR 1125.220, which implements OMB guidance at 2 CFR 180.220) shall not be made to parties listed on the Governmentwide Excluded Parties List System, in accordance with the DoD adoption at 2 CFR part 1125 of the OMB guidance implementing E.O.s 12549 (3 CFR, 1986 Comp., p. 189) and 12689 (3 CFR, 1989 Comp., p. 235), ``Debarment and Suspension.'' The Excluded Parties List System accessible on the Internet at www.epls.gov contains the names of parties debarred, suspended, or otherwise excluded by agencies, as well as parties declared ineligible under statutory or regulatory authority other than E.O. 12549.
