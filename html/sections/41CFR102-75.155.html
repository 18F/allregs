If the landholding agency is unable to submit an acceptable report,  the property will no longer be considered as excess property and the  disposal agency will cease activity for the disposal of the property.  However, GSA may accept the report of excess on a conditional basis and  identify what deficiencies in the report must be corrected in order for  the report to gain full acceptance.</p><p class="depth0">Designation as Personal Property</p>
