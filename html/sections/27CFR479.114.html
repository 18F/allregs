                            <p class="depth0">Any person desiring to export a firearm without payment of the  transfer tax must file with the Director an application on Form 9  (Firearms), Application and Permit for Exportation of Firearms, in  quadruplicate, for a permit providing for deferment of tax liability.  Part 1 of the application shall show the name and address of the foreign  consignee, number of firearms covered by the application, the intended  port of exportation, a complete description of each firearm to be  exported, the name, address, State Department license number (or date of  application if not issued), and identification of the special  (occupational) tax stamp of the transferor. Part 1 of the application  shall be executed under the penalties of perjury by the transferor and  shall be supported by a certified copy of a written order or contract of  sale or other evidence showing that the firearm is to be shipped to a  foreign designation. Where it is desired to make a transfer free of tax  to another person who in turn will export the firearm, the transferor  shall likewise file an application supported by evidence that the  transfer will start the firearm in course of exportation, except,  however, that where such transferor and exporter are registered special- taxpayers the transferor will not be required to file an application on  Form 9 (Firearms).</p>
