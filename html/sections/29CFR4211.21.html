                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Subject to the approval of the PBGC pursuant to  this subpart, a plan, other than a plan that primarily covers employees  in the building and construction industry, may adopt, by amendment, any  allocation method or modification to an allocation method that is not  permitted under subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)(A)</em> of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Substantial overallocation not allowed. No plan may adopt an  allocation method or modification to an allocation method that results  in a systematic and substantial overallocation of the plan's unfunded  vested benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of method prior to approval. A plan may implement an  alternative allocation method or modification to an allocation method  that requires PBGC approval before that approval is given. However, the  plan sponsor shall assess liability in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demand for payment. Until the PBGC approves the allocation  method or modification, a plan may not demand withdrawal liability under  section 4219 of ERISA in an amount that exceeds the lesser of the amount  calculated under the amendment or the amount calculated under the  allocation method that the plan would be required to use if the PBGC did  not approve the amendment. The plan must inform each withdrawing  employer of both amounts and explain that the higher amount may become  payable depending on the PBGC's decision on the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjustment of liability. When necessary because of the PBGC  decision on the amendment, the plan shall adjust the amount demanded  from each employer under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and the  employer's withdrawal liability payment schedule. The length of the  payment schedule shall be increased, as necessary. The plan shall   notify each affected employer of the adjusted liability and payment  schedule and shall collect the adjusted amount in accordance with the  adjusted schedule.</p>
