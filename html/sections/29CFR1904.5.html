                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic requirement. You must consider an injury or illness to be work-related if an event or exposure in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing injury or illness. Work-relatedness is presumed for injuries and illnesses resulting from events or exposures occurring in the work environment, unless an exception in Sec. 1904.5(b)(2) specifically applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Implementation. (1) What is the ``work environment''? OSHA defines the work environment as ``the establishment and other locations where one or more employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> What is the ``work environment''? OSHA defines the work environment as ``the establishment and other locations where one or more employees are working or are present as a condition of their employment. The work environment includes not only physical locations, but also the equipment or materials used by the employee during the course of his or her work.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Are there situations where an injury or illness occurs in the work environment and is not considered work-related? Yes, an injury or illness occurring in the work environment that falls under one of the following exceptions is not work-related, and therefore is not recordable.



------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">You are not required to record injuries and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>..................  At the time of the injury or illness, the</p><p class="depth0">employee was present in the work environment as</p><p class="depth0">a member of the general public rather than as an</p><p class="depth0">employee.(ii).................  The injury or illness involves signs or symptoms</p><p class="depth0">that surface at work but result solely from a</p><p class="depth0">non-work-related event or exposure that occurs</p><p class="depth0">outside the work environment.(iii)................  The injury or illness results solely from</p><p class="depth0">voluntary participation in a wellness program or</p><p class="depth0">in a medical, fitness, or recreational activity</p><p class="depth0">such as blood donation, physical examination,</p><p class="depth0">flu shot, exercise class, racquetball, or</p><p class="depth0">baseball.(iv).................  The injury or illness is solely the result of an</p><p class="depth0">employee eating, drinking, or preparing food or</p><p class="depth0">drink for personal consumption (whether bought</p><p class="depth0">on the employer's premises or brought in). For</p><p class="depth0">example, if the employee is injured by choking</p><p class="depth0">on a sandwich while in the employer's</p><p class="depth0">establishment, the case would not be considered</p><p class="depth0">work-related.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the employee is made ill by ingesting</p><p class="depth0">food contaminated by workplace contaminants</p><p class="depth0">(such as lead), or gets food poisoning from food</p><p class="depth0">supplied by the employer, the case would be</p><p class="depth0">considered work-related.(v)..................  The injury or illness is solely the result of an</p><p class="depth0">employee doing personal tasks (unrelated to</p><p class="depth0">their employment) at the establishment outside</p><p class="depth0">of the employee's assigned working hours.(vi).................  The injury or illness is solely the result of</p><p class="depth0">personal grooming, self medication for a non-</p><p class="depth0">work-related condition, or is intentionally self-</p><p class="depth0">inflicted.(vii)................  The injury or illness is caused by a motor</p><p class="depth0">vehicle accident and occurs on a company parking</p><p class="depth0">lot or company access road while the employee is</p><p class="depth0">commuting to or from work.(viii)...............  The illness is the common cold or flu (Note:</p><p class="depth0">contagious diseases such as tuberculosis,</p><p class="depth0">brucellosis, hepatitis A, or plague are</p><p class="depth0">considered work-related if the employee is</p><p class="depth0">infected at work).(ix).................  The illness is a mental illness. Mental illness</p><p class="depth0">will not be considered work-related unless the</p><p class="depth0">employee voluntarily provides the employer with</p><p class="depth0">an opinion from a physician or other licensed</p><p class="depth0">health care professional with appropriate</p><p class="depth0">training and experience (psychiatrist,</p><p class="depth0">psychologist, psychiatric nurse practitioner,</p><p class="depth0">etc.) stating that the employee has a mental</p><p class="depth0">illness that is work-related.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> How do I handle a case if it is not obvious whether the precipitating event or exposure occurred in the work environment or occurred away from work? In these situations, you must evaluate the employee's work duties and environment to decide whether or not one or more events or exposures in the work environment either caused or contributed to the resulting condition or significantly aggravated a pre-existing condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> How do I know if an event or exposure in the work environment ``significantly aggravated'' a preexisting injury or illness? A preexisting injury or illness has been significantly aggravated, for purposes of OSHA injury and illness recordkeeping, when an event or exposure in the work environment results in any of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Death, provided that the preexisting injury or illness would likely not have resulted in death but for the occupational event or exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loss of consciousness, provided that the preexisting injury or illness would likely not have resulted in loss of consciousness but for the occupational event or exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> One or more days away from work, or days of restricted work, or days of job transfer that otherwise would not have occurred but for the occupational event or exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Medical treatment in a case where no medical treatment was needed for the injury or illness before the workplace event or exposure, or a change in medical treatment was necessitated by the workplace event or exposure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Which injuries and illnesses are considered pre-existing conditions? An injury or illness is a preexisting condition if it resulted solely from a non-work-related event or exposure that occured outside the work environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> How do I decide whether an injury or illness is work-related if the employee is on travel status at the time the injury or illness occurs? Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is on travel status are work-related if, at the time of the injury or illness, the employee was engaged in work activities ``in the interest of the employer.'' Examples of such activities include travel to and from customer contacts, conducting job tasks, and entertaining or being entertained to transact, discuss, or promote business (work-related entertainment includes only entertainment activities being engaged in at the direction of the employer).</p><p class="depth0">Injuries or illnesses that occur when the employee is on travel status do not have to be recorded if they meet one of the exceptions listed below.



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">You may use the following to</p><p class="depth0">1904.5 (b)(6)                     If the employee has . . .                   determine if an injury or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.....................  checked into a hotel or motel for one or more days..  When a traveling employee checks</p><p class="depth0">into a hotel, motel, or into an</p><p class="depth0">other temporary residence, he</p><p class="depth0">or she establishes a ``home</p><p class="depth0">away from home.'' You must</p><p class="depth0">evaluate the employee's</p><p class="depth0">activities after he or she</p><p class="depth0">checks into the hotel, motel,</p><p class="depth0">or other temporary residence</p><p class="depth0">for their work-relatedness in</p><p class="depth0">the same manner as you evaluate</p><p class="depth0">the activities of a non-</p><p class="depth0">traveling employee. When the</p><p class="depth0">employee checks into the</p><p class="depth0">temporary residence, he or she</p><p class="depth0">is considered to have left the</p><p class="depth0">work environment. When the</p><p class="depth0">employee begins work each day,</p><p class="depth0">he or she re-enters the work</p><p class="depth0">environment. If the employee</p><p class="depth0">has established a ``home away</p><p class="depth0">from home'' and is reporting to</p><p class="depth0">a fixed worksite each day, you</p><p class="depth0">also do not consider injuries</p><p class="depth0">or illnesses work-related if</p><p class="depth0">they occur while the employee</p><p class="depth0">is commuting between the</p><p class="depth0">temporary residence and the job</p><p class="depth0">location.(ii)....................  taken a detour for personal reasons.................  Injuries or illnesses are not</p><p class="depth0">considered work-related if they</p><p class="depth0">occur while the employee is on</p><p class="depth0">a personal detour from a</p><p class="depth0">reasonably direct route of</p><p class="depth0">travel (e.g., has taken a side</p><p class="depth0">trip for personal reasons).----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> How do I decide if a case is work-related when the employee is working at home? Injuries and illnesses that occur while an employee is working at home, including work in a home office, will be considered work-related if the injury or illness occurs while the employee is performing work for pay or compensation in the home, and the injury or illness is directly related to the performance of work rather than to the general home environment or setting. For example, if an employee drops a box of work documents and injures his or her foot, the case is considered work-related. If an employee's fingernail is punctured by a needle from a sewing machine used to perform garment work at home, becomes infected and requires medical treatment, the injury is considered work-related. If an employee is injured because he or she trips on the family dog while rushing to answer a work phone call, the case is not considered work-related. If an employee working at home is electrocuted because of faulty home wiring, the injury is not considered work-related.</p>
