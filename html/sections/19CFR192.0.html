This part also sets forth regulations concerning controls exercised by Customs with respect to the exportation of certain merchandise. This part also makes provision for the Automated Export System (AES), implemented by the Census Regulations at part 30, subpart E (15 CFR part 30, subpart E), and provides the grounds under which Customs, as one of the reviewing agencies of the government's export partnership, may deny an application for post-departure filing status or revoke a participant's privilege to use such filing option, and provides for the appeal procedures to challenge such action by Customs.
