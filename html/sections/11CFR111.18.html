In all other cases such attempts by the Commission shall continue for at  least thirty (30) days, not to exceed ninety (90) days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nothing in these regulations shall be construed to prevent the  Commission from entering into a conciliation   agreement with a respondent prior to a Commission finding of probable  cause if a respondent indicates by letter to the General Counsel a  desire to enter into negotiations directed towards reaching such a  conciliation agreement. However, the Commission is not required to enter  into any negotiations directed towards reaching a conciliation agreement  unless and until it makes a finding of probable cause to believe. Any  conciliation agreement reached under this subsection is subject to the  provisions of subsection (b) of this section and shall have the same  force and effect as a conciliation agreement reached after a Commission  finding of probable cause to believe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a conciliation agreement is reached between the Commission  and the respondent, the General Counsel shall send a copy of the signed  agreement to both complainant and respondent.</p>
