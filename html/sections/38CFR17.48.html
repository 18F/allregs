                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section sets forth requirements for persons residing in  housing under the Compensated Work Therapy/Transitional Residences  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> House managers shall be responsible for coordinating and  supervising the day-to-day operations of the facilities. The local VA  program coordinator shall select each house manager and may give  preference to an individual who is a current or past resident of the  facility or the program. A house manager must have the following  qualifications:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A stable, responsible and caring demeanor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Leadership qualities including the ability to motivate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effective communication skills including the ability to  interact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A willingness to accept feedback;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A willingness to follow a chain of command.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each resident admitted to the Transitional Residence, except for  a house manager, must also be in the Compensated Work Therapy program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount of actual operating expenses of the residence  (utilities, maintenance, furnishings, appliances, service equipment, all  other operating costs) for the previous fiscal year plus 15 percent of  that amount equals the total operating budget for the current fiscal  year. The total operating budget is to be divided by the average number  of beds occupied during the previous fiscal year and the resulting  amount is the average yearly amount per bed. The bi-weekly fee shall  equal 1/26th of the average yearly amount per bed, except that a  resident shall not, on average, pay more than 30 percent of their gross  CWT (Compensated Work Therapy) bi-weekly earnings. The VA program  manager shall, bi-annually, conduct a review of the factors in this  paragraph for determining resident payments. If he or she determines  that the payments are too high or too low by more than 5 percent of the  total operating budget, he or she shall recalculate resident payments  under the criteria set forth in this paragraph, except that the  calculations shall be based on the current fiscal year (actual amounts  for the elapsed portion and projected amounts for the remainder).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the revenues of a residence do not meet the expenses of the  residence resulting in an inability to pay actual operating expenses,  the medical center of jurisdiction shall provide the funds necessary to  return the residence to fiscal solvency in accordance with the  provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The length of stay in housing under the Compensated Work  Therapy/Transitional Residences program is based on the individual needs  of each resident, as determined by consensus of the resident and his/her  VA Clinical Treatment team. However, the length of stay should not  exceed 12 months.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 2032)  [70 FR 29627, May 24, 2005, as amended at 79 FR 54615, Sept. 12, 2014]</p>
