If a United States person recognizes gain upon the sale or exchange of a share (or block) of stock of a domestic corporation which was formed or availed of principally for the holding, directly or indirectly, of stock of one or more foreign corporations, and if the conditions of paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 1.1248-1 would be met by such person in respect of the share (or block) if the domestic corporation were a foreign corporation, then section 1248 shall apply in respect of such gain in accordance with the rules provided in paragraph (b) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for a rule suspending the application of this section in certain circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application.
