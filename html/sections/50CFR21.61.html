                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Which Canada geese are covered by this regulation? This  regulation addresses the population control of resident Canada geese, as  defined in Sec.  21.3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What is the resident Canada goose population control program,  and what is its purpose? The resident Canada goose population control  program is a managed take program implemented under the authority of the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act to reduce and stabilize resident Canada goose  populations when traditional and otherwise authorized management  measures are unsuccessful, not feasible for dealing with, or applicable,  in preventing injury to property, agricultural crops, public health, and  other interests from resident Canada geese. The Director is authorized  to allow States and Tribes to implement a population control, or managed  take, program to remedy these injuries. When authorized by the Director,   managed take allows additional methods of taking resident Canada geese,  allows shooting hours for resident Canada geese to extend to one-half  hour after sunset, and removes daily bag limits for resident Canada  geese inside or outside the migratory bird hunting season frameworks as  described in this section. The intent of the program is to reduce  resident Canada goose populations in order to protect personal property  and agricultural crops and other interests from injury and to resolve  potential concerns about human health. The management and control  activities allowed or conducted under the program are intended to  relieve or prevent damage and injurious situations. No person should  construe this program as opening, reopening, or extending any hunting  season contrary to any regulations established under section 3 of the  Migratory Bird Treaty Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What areas are eligible to participate in the program? When  approved by the Director, the State and Tribal wildlife agencies of  Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia,  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland,  Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana,  Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North  Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island,  South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia, West  Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming may implement the resident Canada goose  population control program components in the Atlantic, Central, and  Mississippi Flyway portions of these States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> What is required in order for State governments to participate  in a managed take program? Following the conclusion of the first full  operational year of Sec. Sec.  21.49 through 21.52 of this part, any  wildlife agency from a State listed in 21.61(c) may request approval for  the population control program. A request must include a discussion of  the State's or Tribe's efforts to address its injurious situations  utilizing the methods approved in this rule or a discussion of the  reasons why the methods authorized by these rules are not feasible for  dealing with, or applicable to, the injurious situations that require  further action. Discussions should be detailed and provide the Service  with a clear understanding of the injuries that continue, why the  authorized methods utilized have not worked, and why methods not  utilized could not effectuate resolution of the injuries. A State's  request for approval may be for an area or areas smaller than the entire  State. Upon written approval by the Director, any State or Tribal  government responsible for the management of wildlife and migratory  birds may, without permit, kill or cause to be killed under its general  supervision, resident Canada geese under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Activities conducted under the managed take program may not  affect endangered or threatened species as designated under the  Endangered Species Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control activities may be conducted under this section only  between August 1 and August 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Control measures employed through this section may be  implemented only between the hours of one-half hour before sunrise to  one-half hour after sunset.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nothing in the program may limit or initiate management actions  on Federal land without concurrence of the Federal agency with  jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> States and Tribes must designate participants who must operate  under the conditions of the managed take program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> States and Tribes must inform participants of the requirements/ conditions of the program that apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> States and Tribes must keep annual records of activities carried  out under the authority of the program. Specifically, information must  be collected on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The number of individuals participating in the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of days individuals participated in the program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total number of resident Canada geese shot and retrieved  during the program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The number of resident Canada geese shot but not retrieved. The  States and Tribes must submit an annual report summarizing activities   conducted under the program and an assessment of the continuation of the  injuries on or before June 1 of each year to the Chief, Division of  Migratory Bird Management, at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> What is required for individuals to participate in the program?  Individual participants in State and Tribal programs covered by the  managed take program must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Participants must comply with all applicable State and Tribal  laws or regulations including possession of whatever permit(s) or other  authorization(s) may be required by the State or Tribal government  concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participants who take resident Canada geese under the program  may not sell or offer for sale those birds or their plumage, but may  possess, transport, and otherwise properly use them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participants must permit at all reasonable times, including  during actual operations, any Service special agent or refuge officer,  State or Tribal wildlife or deputy wildlife agent, warden, protector, or  other wildlife law enforcement officer free and unrestricted access over  the premises on which such operations have been or are being conducted  and must promptly furnish whatever information an officer requires  concerning the operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participants may take resident Canada geese by any method except  those prohibited as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> With a trap, snare, net, rifle, pistol, swivel gun, shotgun  larger than 10 gauge, punt gun, battery gun, machine gun, fish hook,  poison, drug, explosive, or stupefying substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> From or by means, aid, or use of a sinkbox or any other type of  low-floating device, having a depression affording the person a means of  concealment beneath the surface of the water.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> From or by means, aid, or use of any motor vehicle, motor- driven land conveyance, or aircraft of any kind, except that paraplegic  persons and persons missing one or both legs may take from any  stationary motor vehicle or stationary motor-driven land conveyance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> From or by means of any motorboat or other craft having a motor  attached, or any sailboat, unless the motor has been completely shut off  and the sails furled, and its progress has ceased. A craft under power  may be used only to retrieve dead or crippled birds; however, the craft  may not be used under power to shoot any crippled birds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> By the use or aid of live birds as decoys. No person may take  resident Canada geese on an area where tame or captive live geese are  present unless such birds are, and have been for a period of 10  consecutive days before the taking, confined within an enclosure that  substantially reduces the audibility of their calls and totally conceals  the birds from the sight of resident Canada geese.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> By means or aid of any motor-driven land, water, or air  conveyance, or any sailboat used for the purpose of or resulting in the  concentrating, driving, rallying, or stirring up of resident Canada  geese.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> By the aid of baiting, or on or over any baited area, where a  person knows or reasonably should know that the area is or has been  baited as described in Sec.  20.11(j) and (k) of this part. Resident  Canada geese may not be taken on or over lands or areas that are baited  areas, and where grain or other feed has been distributed or scattered  solely as the result of manipulation of an agricultural crop or other  feed on the land where grown, or solely as the result of a normal  agricultural operation as described in Sec.  20.11(h) and (l) of this  part. However, nothing in this paragraph prohibits the taking of  resident Canada geese on or over the following lands or areas that are  not otherwise baited areas:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Standing crops or flooded standing crops (including aquatics);  standing, flooded, or manipulated natural vegetation; flooded harvested  croplands; or lands or areas where seeds or grains have been scattered  solely as the result of a normal agricultural planting, harvesting,  post-harvest manipulation or normal soil stabilization practice as  described in Sec.  20.11(g), (i), (l), and (m) of this part;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with  natural vegetation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> From a blind or other place of concealment camouflaged with  vegetation from agricultural crops, as long as such camouflaging does  not result in the exposing, depositing, distributing, or scattering of  grain or other feed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Standing or flooded standing agricultural crops where grain is  inadvertently scattered solely as a result of a hunter entering or  exiting a hunting area, placing decoys, or retrieving downed birds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Participants may not possess shot (either in shotshells or as  loose shot for muzzleloading) other than steel shot, bismuth-tin,  tungsten-iron, tungsten-polymer, tungsten-matrix, tungsten-nickel iron,  or other shots that are authorized in Sec.  20.21(j) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Under what conditions would we suspend the managed take program?  Following authorization by the Director, we will annually assess the  overall impact and effectiveness of the program on resident Canada goose  populations to ensure compatibility with long-term conservation of this  resource. If at any time evidence is presented that clearly demonstrates  that resident Canada geese populations no longer need to be reduced in  order to allow resolution or prevention of injury to people, property,  agricultural crops, or other interests, the Director, in writing, will  suspend the program for the resident Canada goose population in  question. However, resumption of injuries caused by growth of the  population and not otherwise addressable by the methods available in  part 21 may warrant reinstatement of such regulations. A State must  reapply for approval, including the same information and discussions  noted in 21.61(d). Depending on the location of the injury or threat or  injury, the Director, in writing, may suspend or reinstate this  authorization for one or more resident Canada goose populations, but not  others.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> What population information is the State or Tribe required to  collect concerning the resident Canada goose managed take program?  Participating States and Tribes must provide an annual estimate of the  breeding population and distribution of resident Canada geese in their  State. The States and Tribes must submit this estimate on or before  August 1 of each year, to the Chief, Division of Migratory Bird  Management, at the address provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> What are the general program conditions and restrictions? The  program is subject to the conditions elsewhere in this section, and,  unless otherwise specifically authorized, the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nothing in this section applies to any Federal land within a  State's or Tribe's boundaries without written permission of the Federal  agency with jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> States may not undertake any actions under this section if the  activities adversely affect other migratory birds or species designated  as endangered or threatened under the authority of the Endangered  Species Act. Persons operating under this section must immediately  report the take of any species protected under the Endangered Species  Act to the Service. Further, to protect certain species from being  adversely affected by management actions, States must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Follow the Federal State Contingency Plan for the whooping  crane;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct no activities within 300 meters of a whooping crane or  Mississippi sandhill crane nest; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Follow all Regional (or National when available) Bald Eagle  Nesting Management guidelines for all management activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Has the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) approved the  information collection requirements of the program? OMB has approved the  information collection and recordkeeping requirements of the program  under OMB control number 1018-0133. We may not conduct or sponsor, and  you are not required to respond to, a collection of information unless  it displays a currently valid OMB control number. You may send comments  on the information collection and recordkeeping requirements to the  Service's Information Collection Clearance Officer at the address  provided at 50 CFR 2.1(b).
