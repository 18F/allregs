                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The contractor shall develop and apply a quality assurance  program specifying procedures for assuring contract quality, as directed  by the contracting officer. At a minimum, the program should include  procedures to address:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accuracy of payments and recovery of overpayments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timeliness of payments to beneficiaries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quality of services and responsiveness to beneficiaries;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quality of service and responsiveness to OPM; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Detection and recovery of fraudulent claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor must prepare overpayment recovery guidelines to  include a system of internal controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contracting officer may order the correction of a deficiency  or a modification in the contractor's services and/or quality assurance  program. The contractor shall take the necessary action promptly to  implement the contracting officer's order. If the contracting officer  orders the correction of a deficiency or a modification of the  contractor's services and/or quality assurance program pursuant to this  paragraph after the contract year has begun, the costs incurred in  correcting the deficiency or making the modification will not be  considered to the contractor's detriment in the cost control factor of  the service charge [if applicable] for the following contract year.  However, if there is a deficiency, the deficiency itself may be taken  into consideration.  [58 FR 40380, July 28, 1993, as amended at 70 FR 41153, July 18, 2005]</p>
