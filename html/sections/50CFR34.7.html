                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Fee areas administered by the Service will be appraised in accordance with standard appraisal procedures in order to estimate the fair market value of each area as a whole. The evaluation will be premised on an appropriate determination of highest and best use in accordance with existing or potential zoning, the present condition of the land and the general economic situation in the vicinity. Standard appraisal techniques will involve a market data comparison of these areas with similar properties which have sold recently in the local market. These techniques may also include consideration of potential income and development of the cost approach for special use properties having limited marketability. An appropriate evaluation of these areas will also take into consideration a discount for size as recognized by the market for large properties where applicable. The

appraisals will be accomplished by the regional director, using Service staff appraisers or private appraisers contracted by the Service.
The Act requires that improvements placed upon the land after the date of Federal Acquisition be excluded from the fair market value. The only structures that will be included in the appraisal are those that were present at the time of Federal acquisition and have not been the subject of substantial renovation or modification with Federal funds. Evaluation of improvements will be based on their contributory value to the area as determined by the highest and best use study. Lands occupied by improvements not subject to appraisal will be valued as though unimproved.
The appraisals will be reviewed by the Service's review appraisers and the determination of the regional director as to fair market value shall be final and conclusive and shall be the basis for computation of revenue sharing payments.</p>
