Cancellations determined by the authorized officer to be necessary to  protect the public lands will be apportioned by the authorized officer  based upon the level of available forage and the magnitude of the change  in public land acreage available, or as agreed to among the authorized  users and the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When public lands are disposed of or devoted to a public purpose  which precludes livestock grazing, the permittees and lessees shall be  given 2 years' prior notification except in cases of emergency (national  defense requirements in time of war, natural disasters, national  emergency needs, etc.) before their grazing permit or grazing lease and  grazing preference may be canceled. A permittee or lessee may  unconditionally waive the 2-year prior notification. Such a waiver shall  not prejudice the permittee's or lessee's right to reasonable  compensation for, but not to exceed the fair market value of his or her  interest in authorized permanent range improvements located on these  public lands (see Sec. 4120.3-6).
