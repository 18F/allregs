Each such waiver shall be in  writing and supported by a statement of the facts and the grounds  forming the basis of the waiver. For a waiver in an individual case, the  Fund must determine that application of the requirement to be waived  would adversely affect the achievement of the purposes of the Act. For  waivers of general applicability, the Fund will publish notification of  granted waivers in the Federal Register.</p>
