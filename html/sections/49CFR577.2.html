                            <p class="depth0">The purpose of this part is to ensure that notifications of defects or noncompliances adequately inform and effectively motivate owners of potentially defective or noncomplying motor vehicles or items of replacement equipment to have such vehicles or equipment inspected and, where necessary, remedied as quickly as possible. It is also to ensure that dealers and distributors of motor vehicles and items of replacement equipment are made aware of the existence of defects and noncompliances and of their rights and responsibilities with regard thereto.
