                                Sec.  11.25  Interim suspension and discipline based upon conviction
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification of OED Director. Upon being convicted of a crime in  a court of the United States, any State, or a foreign country, a  practitioner subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Office  shall notify the OED Director in writing of the same within thirty days  from the date of such conviction. Upon being advised or learning that a  practitioner subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the Office has  been convicted of a crime, the OED Director shall make a preliminary  determination whether the crime constitutes a serious crime warranting  interim suspension. If the crime is a serious crime, the OED Director  shall file with the USPTO Director proof of the conviction and request  the USPTO Director to issue a notice and order set forth in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section. The OED Director shall in addition, without  Committee on Discipline authorization, file with the USPTO Director a  complaint against the practitioner complying with Sec.  11.34 predicated  upon the conviction of a serious crime. If the crime is not a serious  crime, the OED Director shall process the matter in the same manner as  any other information or evidence of a possible violation of any USPTO  Rule of Professional Conduct coming to the attention of the OED  Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interim suspension and referral for disciplinary proceeding. All  proceedings under this section shall be handled as expeditiously as  possible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The USPTO Director has authority to place a practitioner on  interim suspension after hearing the request for interim suspension on  the documentary record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notification served on practitioner. Upon receipt of a certified  copy of the court record, docket entry or judgment demonstrating that  the practitioner has been so convicted together with the complaint, the  USPTO Director shall forthwith issue a notice directed to the  practitioner in accordance with Sec. Sec.  11.35(a), (b) or (c), and to  the OED Director, containing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of the court record, docket entry, or judgment of  conviction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A copy of the complaint; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An order directing the practitioner to file a response with  the USPTO Director and the OED Director, within forty days of the date  of the notice, establishing that there is a genuine issue of material  fact that the crime did not constitute a serious crime, the practitioner  is not the individual found guilty of the crime, or that the conviction  was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a  deprivation of due process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hearing and final order on request for interim suspension. The  request for interim suspension shall be heard by the USPTO Director on  the documentary record unless the USPTO Director determines that the  practitioner's response establishes a genuine issue of material fact  that: The crime did not constitute a serious crime, the practitioner is  not the person who committed the crime, or that the conviction was so  lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a  deprivation of due process. If the USPTO Director determines that there  is no genuine issue of material fact regarding the defenses set forth in  the preceding sentence, the USPTO Director shall enter an appropriate  final order regarding the OED Director's request for interim suspension  regardless of the pendency of any criminal appeal. If the USPTO Director  is unable to make such determination because there is a genuine issue of  material fact, the USPTO Director shall enter a final order dismissing  the request and enter a further order referring the complaint to a  hearing officer for a hearing and entry of an initial decision in  accordance with the other rules in this part and directing the  practitioner to file an answer to the complaint in accordance with Sec.   11.36.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Termination. The USPTO Director has authority to terminate an  interim suspension. In the interest of justice, the USPTO Director may  terminate an interim suspension at any time upon a showing of  extraordinary circumstances, after affording the OED Director an  opportunity to respond to the request to terminate interim suspension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Referral for disciplinary proceeding. Upon entering a final  order imposing interim suspension, the USPTO Director shall refer the  complaint to a hearing officer to conduct a formal disciplinary  proceeding. The formal disciplinary proceeding, however, shall be stayed  by the hearing officer until all direct appeals from the conviction are  concluded. Review of the initial decision of the hearing officer shall  be pursuant to Sec.  11.55.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proof of conviction and guilt--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conviction in the United  States. For purposes of a hearing for interim suspension and a hearing  on the formal charges in a complaint filed as a consequence of the  conviction, a certified copy of the court record, docket entry, or  judgment of conviction in a court of the United States or any State  shall establish a prima facie case by clear and convincing evidence that  the practitioner was convicted of a serious crime and that the  conviction was not lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as to  constitute a deprivation of due process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Conviction in a foreign country. For purposes of a hearing for  interim suspension and on the formal charges filed as a result of a  finding of guilt, a certified copy of the court record, docket entry, or  judgment of conviction in a court of a foreign country shall establish a  prima facie case by clear and convincing evidence that the practitioner  was convicted of a serious crime and that the conviction was not lacking  in notice or opportunity to be heard as to constitute a deprivation of  due process. However, nothing in this paragraph shall preclude the  practitioner from demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence in any  hearing on a request for interim suspension there is a genuine issue of  material fact to be considered when determining if the elements of a  serious crime were committed in violating the criminal law of the  foreign country and whether a disciplinary sanction should be entered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Crime determined not to be serious crime. If the USPTO Director  determines that the crime is not a serious crime, the complaint shall be  referred to the OED Director for investigation under Sec.  11.22 and  processing as is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reinstatement--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon reversal or setting aside a finding of  guilt or a conviction. If a practitioner suspended solely under the  provisions of paragraph (b) of this section demonstrates that the  underlying finding of guilt or conviction of serious crimes has been  reversed or vacated, the order for interim suspension shall be vacated  and the practitioner shall be placed on active status unless the finding  of guilt was reversed or the conviction was set aside with respect to  less than all serious crimes for which the practitioner was found guilty  or convicted. The   vacating of the interim suspension will not terminate any other  disciplinary proceeding then pending against the practitioner, the  disposition of which shall be determined by the hearing officer before  whom the matter is pending, on the basis of all available evidence other  than the finding of guilt or conviction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Following conviction of a serious crime. Any practitioner  convicted of a serious crime and disciplined in whole or in part in  regard to that conviction, may petition for reinstatement under  conditions set forth in Sec.  11.60 no sooner than five years after  being discharged following completion of service of his or her sentence,  or after completion of service under probation or parole, whichever is  later.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice to clients and others of interim suspension. An interim  suspension under this section shall constitute a suspension of the  practitioner for the purpose of Sec.  11.58.  [73 FR 47689, Aug. 14, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 20200, Apr. 3, 2013]</p>
