In case of exceptional circumstances, satisfactorily  shown by the petitioner, a request for modification of rules or orders  may be made by telegram or otherwise, upon notice to all parties or  attorneys of record, but such request shall be followed by a petition  filed and served in accordance with subpart D of this part.</p>
