                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for authority for emergency discontinuance,  reduction, or impairment of service shall be made by electronically  filing an informal request through the ``Submit a Non-Docketed Filing''  module of the Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System. Such  requests shall be made as soon as practicable but not later than 15 days  in the case of public coast stations, or 65 days in all other cases,  after the occurrence of the conditions which have occasioned the  discontinuance, reduction, or impairment. The request shall make  reference to this section and show the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effective date of such discontinuance, reduction, or  impairment, and the identification of the service area affected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature and estimated duration of the conditions causing the  discontinuance, reduction, or impairment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The facts showing that such conditions could not reasonably have  been foreseen by the carrier in sufficient time to prevent such  discontinuance, reduction, or impairment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the service involved;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The nature of service which will be available or substituted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The effect upon rates to any person in the community;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The efforts made and to be made by applicant to restore the  original service or establish comparable service as expeditiously as  possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority for the emergency discontinuance, reduction, or  impairment of service for a period of 60 days shall be deemed to have  been granted by the Commission effective as of the date of the filing of  the request unless, on or before the 15th day after the date of filing,  the Commission shall notify the carrier to the contrary. Renewal of such  authority may be requested by letter or telegram, filed with the  Commission not later than 10 days prior to the expiration of such 60-day  period, making reference to this section and showing that such  conditions may reasonably be expected to continue for a further period  and what efforts the applicant has made to restore the original or  establish comparable service. If the same or comparable service is  reestablished before the termination of the emergency authorization, the  carrier shall notify the Commission promptly. However, the Commission  may, upon specific request of the carrier and upon a proper showing,  contained in such informal request, authorize such discontinuance,  reduction, or impairment of service for an indefinite period or  permanently.
