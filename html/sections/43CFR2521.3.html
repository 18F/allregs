                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lands which may be assigned. While by the Act of March 3, 1891  (26 Stat. 1096; 43 U.S.C. 329), assignments of desert-land entries were  recognized, the Department of the Interior, largely for administrative  reasons, held that a desert-land entry might be assigned as a whole or  in its entirety, but refused to recognize the assignment of only a  portion of an entry. The Act of March 28, 1908, however, provides for an  assignment of such entries, in whole or in part, but this does not mean  that less than a legal subdivision may be assigned. Therefore no  assignment, otherwise than by legal subdivisions, will be recognized.  The legal subdivisions assigned must be contiguous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifications of assignees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Act of March 28, 1908, also  provides that no person may take a desert-land entry by assignment  unless he is qualified to enter the tract so assigned to him. Therefore,  if a person is not at least 21 years of age and, excepting Nevada, a  resident citizen of the State wherein the land involved is located; or  if he is not a ciitzen of the United States, or a person who has  declared his intention to become a citizen thereof; or, if he has made a  desert-land entry in his own right and is not entitled under Sec.  2521.1 to make a second or an additional entry, he cannot take such an  entry by assignment. The language of the act indicates that the taking  of an entry by assignment is equivalent to the making of an entry, and  this being so, no person is allowed to take more than one entry by  assignment, unless it be done as the exercise of a right of second or  additional entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A person who has the right to make a second or additional  desert-land entry may exercise that right by taking an assignment of a  desert-land entry, or part of such entry, if he is otherwise qualified  to make a desert-land entry for the particular tract assigned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Act of March 28, 1908, also provides that no assignment to  or for the benefit of any corporation shall be authorized or recognized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Showing required of assignees; recognition of assignments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  As evidence of the assignment there should be transmitted to the  authorizing officer the original deed of assignment or a certified copy  thereof. Where the deed of assignment is recorded a certified copy may  be made by the officer who has custody of the record. Where the original  deed is presented to an officer qualified to take proof in desert-land  cases, a copy certified by such officer will be accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An assignee must file with his deed of assignment, a statement  on a form approved by the Director, showing his qualifications to take  the entry assigned to him. He must show what applications or entries, if  any, have been made by him or what entries assigned to him under the  agricultural public land laws, and he must also show his qualifications  as a citizen of the United States; that he is 21 years of age or over;  and also that he is a resident citizen of the State in which the land  assigned to him is situated, except in the State of Nevada, where  citizenship of the United States only is required. If the assignee is  not a native-born citizen of the United States, he should also furnish a  statement as to his citizenship status in accordance with subpart 1811  of this chapter. If the assignee is a woman, she should in all cases  state whether she is married, and if so, she must make the showing  required by subpart 1811 of this chapter. Desert-land entries are  initiated by the payment of 25 cents per acre, and no assignable right  is acquired by the application prior to such payment. (6 L.D. 541, 33  L.D. 152.) An assignment made on the day of such payment, or   soon thereafter, is treated as suggesting fraud, and such cases will be  carefully scrutinized. The provisions of law authorizing the assignment  of desert entries, in whole or in part, furnish no authority to a  claimant under said law to make an executory contract to convey the land  after the issuance of patent and thereafter to proceed with the  submission of final proof in furtherance of such contract. (34 L.D.  383.) The sale of land embraced in an entry at any time before final  payment is made must be regarded as an assignment of the entry, and in  such cases the person buying the land must show that he possesses all  the qualifications required of an assignee. (29 L.D. 453.) The assignor  of a desert-land entry may execute the assignment before any officer  authorized to take acknowledgements of deeds. The assignee must furnish  a statement on a form approved by the Director as to his qualifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No assignments of desert-land entries or parts of entries are  conclusive until examined in the proper office and found satisfactory  and the assignment recognized. When recognized, however, the assignee  takes the place of the assignor as effectively as though he had made the  entry, and is subject to any requirement that may be made relative  thereto. The assignment of a desert-land entry to one disqualified to  acquire title under the desert-land law, and to whom, therefore,  recognition of the assignment is refused by the authorizing officer,  does not of itself render the entry fraudulent, but leaves the right  thereto in the assignor. In such connection, however, see 42 L.D. 90 and  48 L.D. 519.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All applications for recognition of assignment of desert-land  entries must be accompanied by an application service fee of $10 which  will not be returnable.</p>
