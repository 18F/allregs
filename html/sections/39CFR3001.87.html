                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Service and contents. In the interest of expedition and limited  to information which appears reasonably calculated to lead to the  discovery of admissible evidence, any participant in a proceeding may  propound to any other participant no more than a total of 25 written,  sequentially numbered interrogatories, by witness, requesting non- privileged information relevant to the subject matter of the proceeding.  An interrogatory with subparts that are logically or factually subsumed  within and necessarily related to the primary question will be counted  as one interrogatory. The respondent shall answer each interrogatory and  furnish such information as is available. The participant propounding  the interrogatories shall file them with the Commission in conformance  with Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12. Follow-up interrogatories to  clarify or elaborate on the answer to an earlier discovery request may  be filed after the period for intervenor discovery on the Postal Service  case ends if the interrogatories are filed within 7 days of receipt of  the answer to the previous interrogatory. In extraordinary  circumstances, follow-up interrogatories may be filed not less than 6  days prior to the filing date for the participant's rebuttal or  surrebuttal testimony.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Answers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Answers to interrogatories shall be prepared so  that they can be incorporated into the record as written cross- examination. Each answer shall begin on a separate page, identify the  individual responding and the relevant testimony number, if any, the  participant who propounded the interrogatory, and the number and text of  the question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each interrogatory shall be answered separately and fully in  writing by the individual responsible for the answer, unless it is  objected to, in which event the reasons for objection shall be stated in  a motion to be excused from answering in the manner prescribed by  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An interrogatory otherwise proper is not necessarily  objectionable because an answer would involve an opinion or contention  that relates to fact or the application of law to fact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Answers filed by a respondent shall be filed in conformance with  Sec. Sec. 3001.9 through 3001.12 within 7 days of the filing of the  interrogatories or within such other period as may be fixed by the  Commission or presiding officer. Any other period fixed by the  Commission or presiding officer shall end before the conclusion of the  hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Motion to be excused from answering. A respondent may, in lieu  of answering an interrogatory, file a motion pursuant to Sec.  3001.75(b) to be excused from answering.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Supplemental answers. A respondent has a duty to timely amend a  prior answer if it obtains information upon the basis of which it knows  that the answer was incorrect when made or is no longer true. A  respondent shall serve supplemental answers to update or to correct  responses whenever necessary, up until the date the answer could have  been accepted into evidence as written cross-examination. A respondent  shall indicate whether the answer merely supplements the previous answer  to make it current or whether it is a complete replacement for the  previous answer.</p>
