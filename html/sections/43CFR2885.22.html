                                Sec. 2885.22  How may I make rental payments when land encumbered by my term or perpetual linear grant is being transferred out of Federal ownership?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em>, (2), and (3) of this section. The formula for this calculation  is: One-time Payment = Annual Rent/(Y-CR), where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual Rent = Current Annual Rent Applicable to the Subject  Property from the Per Acre Rent Schedule;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Y = Yield Rate from the Per Acre Rent Schedule (5.27 percent);  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CR = Annual Percent Change in Rent as Determined by the Most  Recent 10-Year Average of the difference in the IPD-GDP Index from  January of one year to January of the following year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>, as updated under  Sec. 2885.19(a)(1) and(2). However, the per acre zone value and zone  number used in this annual rental determination will be based on the per  acre land value from acceptable market information or an appraisal  report, if any, for the land transfer action and not the county average  per acre land and building value from the NASS Census. You may also  submit an appraisal report on your own initiative in accordance with  Sec. 2806.25(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When no acceptable market information is available and no  appraisal report has been completed for the land transfer action, or  when the BLM requests it, you must prepare an appraisal report as  required under Sec. 2806.25(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Term Grant. If the land your grant encumbers is being  transferred out of Federal ownership, you may pay in advance the total  rent amount for the entire term of the grant or any remaining years. The  BLM will use the annual rent calculated from the Per Acre Rent Schedule  multiplied by the number of years in the rent payment period (the length  of time for which the holder is paying rent) to determine the one-time  rent. However, this amount must not exceed the one-time rent payment for  a perpetual grant as determined under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this  section.  [73 FR 65074, Oct. 31, 2008]</p>
