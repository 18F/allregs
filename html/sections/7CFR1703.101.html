                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The transmission of information is vital to the economic development, education, and health of rural Americans. To further this objective, RUS will provide financial assistance to distance learning and telemedicine projects that will improve the access of people residing in rural areas to educational, learning, training, and health care services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In providing financial assistance, RUS will give priority to rural areas that it believes have the greatest need for distance learning and telemedicine services. RUS believes that generally the need is greatest in areas that are economically challenged, costly to serve, and experiencing outward migration. This program is consistent with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that designate telecommunications service discounts for schools, libraries, and rural health care centers. RUS will take into consideration the community's involvement in the proposed project and the applicant's ability to leverage grant funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In administering this subpart, RUS will not favor or mandate the use of one particular technology over another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rural institutions are encouraged to cooperate with each other, with applicants, and with end-users to promote the program being implemented under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> RUS staff will make diligent efforts to inform potential applicants in rural areas of the programs being implemented under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Administrator will provide only loans under this subpart to any entity that has received a telecommunications or electric loan under the Rural Electrification Act of 1936. Telecommunications and Electric borrowers are encouraged to seek a loan under this subpart to bolster educational and health care opportunities in the rural communities they serve. A borrower receiving a loan shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Make the loan available to entities that qualify as distance learning or telemedicine projects satisfying the requirements of this subpart, under any terms it so chooses as long as the terms are no more stringent than the terms under which it received the financial assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the loan to acquire, install, improve, or extend a distance learning or telemedicine system referred to in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Administrator will allocate funds that are appropriated each fiscal year for the subparts E, F, and G, of this part respectively. Not more than 30 days before the end of the fiscal year, the Administrator may transfer any funds not committed to grants in the combination loan and grant program to the grant program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Financial assistance may be provided for end user sites. Financial assistance may also be provided for hubs located in rural or non-rural areas if they are necessary to provide distance learning or telemedicine services to rural residents at end user sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The Administrator will publish, at the end of each fiscal year, a notice in the Federal Register of all applications receiving financial assistance under this subpart. Subject to the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, (5 U.S.C. 552), applications will be available for public inspection at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1400 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC, 20250.</p>
