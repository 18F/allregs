                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as specified in paragraph (b) of this section, the owner  or operator of a heat exchange system that meets the criteria in Sec.   63.640(c)(8) must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (c) through  (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A heat exchange system is exempt from the requirements in  paragraphs (c) through (g) of this section if all heat exchangers within  the heat exchange system either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Operate with the minimum pressure on the cooling water side at  least 35 kilopascals greater than the maximum pressure on the process  side; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employ an intervening cooling fluid containing less than 5  percent by weight of total organic HAP, as determined according to the  provisions of Sec.  63.180(d) of this part and table 1 of this subpart,  between the process and the cooling water. This intervening fluid must  serve to isolate the cooling water from the process fluid and must not  be sent through a cooling tower or discharged. For purposes of this  section, discharge does not include emptying for maintenance purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> through (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each cooling tower return line or any representative riser  within the cooling tower prior to exposure to air for each heat exchange  system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat  exchanger or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is  covered by the selected monitoring location(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selected heat exchanger exit line(s) so that each heat exchanger  or group of heat exchangers within a heat exchange system is covered by  the selected monitoring location(s). The selected monitoring location  may be at a point where discharges from multiple heat exchange systems  are combined provided that the combined cooling water flow rate at the  monitoring location does not exceed 40,000 gallons per minute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange  system prior to any heat exchanger. If multiple heat exchange systems  use the same water feed (i.e., inlet water from the same primary water  source), the owner or operator may monitor at one representative  location and use the monitoring results for that sampling location for  all heat exchange systems that use that same water feed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Monitoring method. Determine the total strippable hydrocarbon  concentration (in parts per million by volume (ppmv) as methane) at each  monitoring location using the ``Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso  Method) for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from  Water   Sources'' Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures  Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas  Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by  reference--see Sec.  63.14) using a flame ionization detector (FID)  analyzer for on-site determination as described in Section 6.1 of the  Modified El Paso Method.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section  also apply to the inlet water feed line for a once-through heat exchange  system, if monitoring of the inlet water feed is elected as provided in  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total  strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas  of 6.2 ppmv.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitor quarterly using a leak action level defined as a total  strippable hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas  of 3.1 ppmv unless repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of  this section. If a repair is delayed as provided in paragraph (f) of  this section, monitor monthly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring frequency and leak action level for new sources. For  a heat exchange system at a new source, the owner or operator must  monitor monthly using a leak action level defined as a total strippable  hydrocarbon concentration (as methane) in the stripping gas of 3.1 ppmv.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)(ii)</em> of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this  section and the measurement value of the corresponding sample taken from  the location specified in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or  exceeds the leak action level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, or (c)(2)(i) of this section  equals or exceeds the leak action level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a leak is detected, the owner or operator must repair the  leak to reduce the measured concentration to below the applicable action  level as soon as practicable, but no later than 45 days after  identifying the leak, except as specified in paragraphs (e) and (f) of  this section. Repair includes re-monitoring at the monitoring location  where the leak was identified according to the method specified in  paragraph (c)(3) of this section to verify that the measured  concentration is below the applicable action level. Actions that can be  taken to achieve repair include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Physical modifications to the leaking heat exchanger, such as  welding the leak or replacing a tube;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Blocking the leaking tube within the heat exchanger;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Changing the pressure so that water flows into the process  fluid;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Replacing the heat exchanger or heat exchanger bundle; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Isolating, bypassing, or otherwise removing the leaking heat  exchanger   from service until it is otherwise repaired.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the owner or operator detects a leak when monitoring a  cooling tower return line under paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the  owner or operator may conduct additional monitoring of each heat  exchanger or group of heat exchangers associated with the heat exchange  system for which the leak was detected as provided under paragraph  (c)(1)(ii) of this section. If no leaks are detected when monitoring  according to the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section,  the heat exchange system is considered to meet the repair requirements  through re-monitoring of the heat exchange system as provided in  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section. The owner or  operator must determine if a delay of repair is necessary as soon as  practicable, but no later than 45 days after first identifying the leak.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the repair is technically infeasible without a shutdown and  the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is initially and remains  less than the delay of repair action level for all monthly monitoring  periods during the delay of repair, the owner or operator may delay  repair until the next scheduled shutdown of the heat exchange system.  If, during subsequent monthly monitoring, the delay of repair action  level is exceeded, the owner or operator must repair the leak within 30  days of the monitoring event in which the leak was equal to or exceeded  the delay of repair action level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the necessary equipment, parts, or personnel are not  available and the total strippable hydrocarbon concentration is  initially and remains less than the delay of repair action level for all  monthly monitoring periods during the delay of repair, the owner or  operator may delay the repair for a maximum of 120 calendar days. The  owner or operator must demonstrate that the necessary equipment, parts,  or personnel were not available. If, during subsequent monthly  monitoring, the delay of repair action level is exceeded, the owner or  operator must repair the leak within 30 days of the monitoring event in  which the leak was equal to or exceeded the delay of repair action  level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> of this section and the measurement value of the  corresponding sample taken from the location specified in paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action  level.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, or  (c)(2)(i) of this section equals or exceeds the delay of repair action  level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)(1)</em>  through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reason(s) for delaying repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A schedule for completing the repair as soon as practical.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The date and concentration of the leak as first identified and  the results of all subsequent monthly monitoring events during the delay  of repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the leak concentration as specified in paragraph (c)  of this section and convert the stripping gas leak concentration (in  ppmv as methane) to an equivalent liquid concentration, in parts per  million by weight (ppmw),   using equation 7-1 from ``Air Stripping Method (Modified El Paso Method)  for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound Emissions from Water  Sources'' Revision Number One, dated January 2003, Sampling Procedures  Manual, Appendix P: Cooling Tower Monitoring, prepared by Texas  Commission on Environmental Quality, January 31, 2003 (incorporated by  reference--see Sec.  63.14) and the molecular weight of 16 grams per  mole (g/mol) for methane.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the mass flow rate of the cooling water at the  monitoring location where the leak was detected. If the monitoring  location is an individual cooling tower riser, determine the total  cooling water mass flow rate to the cooling tower. Cooling water mass  flow rates may be determined using direct measurement, pump curves, heat  balance calculations, or other engineering methods. Volumetric flow  measurements may be used and converted to mass flow rates using the  density of water at the specific monitoring location temperature or  using the default density of water at 25 degrees Celsius, which is 997  kilograms per cubic meter or 8.32 pounds per gallon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For delay of repair monitoring intervals prior to repair of  the leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for  the leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the monitoring  interval by multiplying the leak concentration in the cooling water,  ppmw, determined in (g)(4)(i) of this section, by the mass flow rate of  the cooling water determined in (g)(4)(ii) of this section and by the  duration of the delay of repair monitoring interval. The duration of the  delay of repair monitoring interval is the time period starting at  midnight on the day of the previous monitoring event or at midnight on  the day the repair would have had to be completed if the repair had not  been delayed, whichever is later, and ending at midnight of the day the  of the current monitoring event.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For delay of repair monitoring intervals ending with a repaired  leak, calculate the potential strippable hydrocarbon emissions for the  leaking heat exchange system or heat exchanger for the final delay of  repair monitoring interval by multiplying the duration of the final  delay of repair monitoring interval by the leak concentration and  cooling water flow rates determined for the last monitoring event prior  to the re-monitoring event used to verify the leak was repaired. The  duration of the final delay of repair monitoring interval is the time  period starting at midnight of the day of the last monitoring event  prior to re-monitoring to verify the leak was repaired and ending at the  time of the re-monitoring event that verified that the leak was  repaired.
