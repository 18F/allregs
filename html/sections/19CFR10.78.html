Fish (except cod, haddock, hake, pollock, cusk, mackerel, and swordfish) the product of an American fishery landed in a foreign country and there not further advanced than beheaded, eviscerated, packed in ice, frozen and with fins removed, shall be entitled to free entry, whether or not such processing is done by the American fishery. Products of an American fishery prepared or preserved on the treaty coasts of Newfoundland, Magdalen Islands, or Labrador, as such coasts are defined in the Convention of 1818 between the United States and Great Britain, shall be entitled to free entry only if the preparation or preservation is done by an American fishery.
