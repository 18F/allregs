                                Sec.  301-70.910  Do the rules in this part apply to travel on Government in support of the President and Vice President?

                            <p class="depth0">Given the unique functions and needs of the presidency and the vice presidency, section 4 of Circular A-126, ``Improving the Management and Use of Government Aircraft,'' Revised May 1992, makes clear that Circular A-126 does not apply to aircraft while in use by or in support of the President or Vice President. Since the principal purpose of the rules in this part is to implement Circular A-126, the rules in this part also do not apply to such travel. If any questions arise regarding travel related to the President or Vice President, contact the Office of the Counsel to the President or the Office of the Counsel to the Vice President, respectively.</p>
