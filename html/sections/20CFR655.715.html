                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of subparts H and I of this part:</p><p class="depth0">Actual wage means the wage rate paid by the employer to all  individuals with experience and qualifications similar to the H-1B  nonimmigant's experience and qualifications for the specific employment  in question at the place of employment. The actual wage established by  the employer is not an average of the wage rates paid to all workers  employed in the occupation.</p><p class="depth0">Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) means an official appointed pursuant  to 5 U.S.C. 3105.</p><p class="depth0">Administrator means the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division,  Employment Standards Administration, Department of Labor, and such  authorized representatives as may be designated to perform any of the  functions of the Administrator under subpart H or I of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Aggrieved party means a person or entity whose operations or  interests are adversely affected by the employer's alleged non- compliance with the labor condition application and includes, but is not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A worker whose job, wages, or working conditions are adversely  affected by the employer's alleged non-compliance with the labor  condition application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A bargaining representative for workers whose jobs, wages, or  working conditions are adversely affected by the employer's alleged non- compliance with the labor condition application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A competitor adversely affected by the employer's alleged non- compliance with the labor condition application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A government agency which has a program that is impacted by the  employer's alleged non-compliance with the labor condition application.</p><p class="depth0">Area of intended employment means the area within normal commuting  distance of the place (address) of employment where the H-1B  nonimmigrant is or will be employed. There is no rigid measure of  distance which constitutes a normal commuting distance or normal  commuting area, because there may be widely varying factual  circumstances among different areas (e.g., normal commuting distances  might be 20, 30, or 50 miles). If the place of employment is within a  Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) or a Primary Metropolitan  Statistical Area (PMSA), any place within the MSA or PMSA is deemed to  be within normal commuting distance of the place of employment; however,  all locations within a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (CMSA)  will not automatically be deemed to be within normal commuting distance.  The borders of MSAs and PMSAs are not controlling with regard to the  identification of the normal commuting area; a location outside of an  MSA or PMSA (or a CMSA) may be within normal commuting distance of a  location that is inside (e.g., near the border of) the MSA or PMSA (or  CMSA).</p><p class="depth0">Attorney General means the chief official of the U.S. Department of  Justice or the Attorney General's designee.</p><p class="depth0">Authorized agent and authorized representative mean an official of  the employer who has the legal authority to commit the employer to the  statements in the labor condition application.</p><p class="depth0">Center Director means the Department official to whom the  Administrator has delegated his authority for purposes of NPC operations  and functions.</p><p class="depth0">Certification means the determination by a certifying officer that a  labor condition application is not incomplete and does not contain  obvious inaccuracies.</p><p class="depth0">Certify means the act of making a certification.</p><p class="depth0">Certifying Officer means a Department of Labor official, or such  official's designee, who makes determinations about whether or not to  certify labor condition applications.</p><p class="depth0">Chief Administrative Law Judge (Chief ALJ) means the chief official  of the Office of the Administrative Law Judges of the Department of  Labor or the Chief Administrative Law Judge's designee.</p><p class="depth0">Department and DOL mean the United States Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Homeland Security (DHS) through the United States  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) makes the determination  under the INA on whether to grant visa petitions of employers seeking  the admission of non-immigrants under H-1B visa for the purpose of  employment.</p><p class="depth0">Division means the Wage and Hour Division of the Employment  Standards Administration, DOL.</p><p class="depth0">Employed, employed by the employer, or employment relationship means  the employment relationship as determined under the common law, under  which the key determinant is the putative employer's right to control  the means and manner in which the work is performed. Under the common  law, ``no shorthand formula or magic phrase * * * can be applied to find  the answer * * *. [A]ll of the incidents of the relationship must be  assessed and weighed with no one factor being decisive.'' NLRB v. United  Ins. Co. of America, 390 U.S. 254, 258 (1968).</p><p class="depth0">Employer means a person, firm, corporation, contractor, or other  association or organization in the United States that has an employment  relationship with H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrants and/or U.S.  worker(s). In the case of an H-1B nonimmigrant (not including E-3 and H- 1B1 nonimmigrants), the person, firm, contractor, or other association  or organization in the United States that files a petition with the  United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) on behalf of the nonimmigrant is  deemed to be the employer of that nonimmigrant. In the case of an E-3  and H-1B1 nonimmigrant, the person, firm, contractor, or other  association or organization in the United States that files an LCA with  the Department of Labor on behalf of the nonimmigrant is deemed to be  the employer of that nonimmigrant.</p><p class="depth0">Employment and Training Administration (ETA) means the agency within  the Department which includes the Office of Foreign Labor Certification  (OFLC).</p><p class="depth0">Employment Standards Administration (ESA) means the agency within  the Department which includes the Wage and Hour Division.</p><p class="depth0">INA means the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended, 8 U.S.C.  1101 et seq.</p><p class="depth0">Independent authoritative source means a professional, business,  trade, educational or governmental association, organization, or other  similar entity, not owned or controlled by the employer, which has  recognized expertise in an occupational field.</p><p class="depth0">Independent authoritative source survey means a survey of wages  conducted by an independent authoritative source and published in a  book, newspaper, periodical, loose-leaf service, newsletter, or other  similar medium, within the 24-month period immediately preceding the  filing of the employer's application. Such survey shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reflect the average wage paid to workers similarly employed in  the area of intended employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Be based upon recently collected data--e.g., within the 24-month  period immediately preceding the date of publication of the survey; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Represent the latest published prevailing wage finding by the  authoritative source for the occupation in the area of intended  employment.</p><p class="depth0">Interested party means a person or entity who or which may be  affected by the actions of an H-1B employer or by the outcome of a  particular investigation and includes any person, organization, or  entity who or which has notified the Department of his/her/its interest  or concern in the Administrator's determination.</p><p class="depth0">Lockout means a labor dispute involving a work stoppage, wherein an  employer withholds work from its employees in order to gain a concession  from them.</p><p class="depth0">Occupation means the occupational or job classification in which the  H-1B nonimmigrant is to be employed.</p><p class="depth0">Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) means the  organizational component within the ETA that provides national  leadership and policy guidance and develops regulations and procedures  to carry out the responsibilities of the Secretary of Labor under the  INA concerning alien workers seeking admission to the United States in  order to work under the Immigration and Nationality Act, as amended.</p><p class="depth0">Period of intended employment means the time period between the  starting and ending dates inclusive of the H-1B nonimmigrant's intended  period of employment in the occupational classification at the place of  employment as set forth in the labor condition application.</p><p class="depth0">Place of employment means the worksite or physical location where  the work actually is performed by the H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 nonimmigrant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> or (ii)--is satisfied:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee developmental activity. An H-1B worker who is stationed  and regularly works at one location may temporarily be at another  location for a particular individual or employer-required developmental  activity such as a management conference, a staff seminar, or a formal  training course (other than ``on-the-job-training'' at a location where  the employee is stationed and regularly works). For the H-1B worker  participating in such activities, the location of the activity would not  be considered a ``place of employment'' or ``worksite,'' and that  worker's presence at such location--whether owned or controlled by the  employer or by a third party--would not invoke H-1B program requirements  with regard to that employee at that location. However, if the employer  uses H-1B nonimmigrants as instructors or resource or support staff who  continuously or regularly perform their duties at such locations, the  locations would be ``places of employment'' or ``worksites'' for any  such employees and, thus, would be subject to H-1B program requirements  with regard to those employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (C)) are all met--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The nature and duration of the H-1B worker's job functions  mandates his/her short-time presence at the location. For this purpose,  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The H-1B nonimmigrant's job must be peripatetic in nature, in  that the normal duties of the worker's occupation (rather than the  nature of the employer's business) requires frequent travel (local or  non-local) from location to location; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The H-1B worker's duties must require that he/she spend most  work time at one location but occasionally travel for short periods to  work at other locations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The H-1B worker's presence at the locations to which he/she  travels from the ``home'' worksite is on a casual, short-term basis,  which can be recurring but not excessive (i.e., not exceeding five  consecutive workdays for any one visit by a peripatetic worker, or 10  consecutive workdays for any one visit by a worker who spends most work  time at one location and travels occasionally to other locations); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The H-1B nonimmigrant is not at the location as a  ``strikebreaker'' (i.e., the H-1B nonimmigrant is not performing work in  an occupation in which workers are on strike or lockout).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples of ``non-worksite'' locations based on worker's job  functions: A computer engineer sent out to customer locations to  ``troubleshoot'' complaints regarding software malfunctions; a sales  representative making calls on prospective customers or established  customers within a ``home   office'' sales territory; a manager monitoring the performance of out- stationed employees; an auditor providing advice or conducting reviews  at customer facilities; a physical therapist providing services to  patients in their homes within an area of employment; an individual  making a court appearance; an individual lunching with a customer  representative at a restaurant; or an individual conducting research at  a library.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples of ``worksite'' locations based on worker's job  functions: A computer engineer who works on projects or accounts at  different locations for weeks or months at a time; a sales  representative assigned on a continuing basis in an area away from his/ her ``home office;'' an auditor who works for extended periods at the  customer's offices; a physical therapist who ``fills in'' for full-time  employees of health care facilities for extended periods; or a physical  therapist who works for a contractor whose business is to provide  staffing on an ``as needed'' basis at hospitals, nursing homes, or  clinics.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whenever an H-1B worker performs work at a location which is not  a ``worksite'' (under the criterion in paragraph (1)(i) or (1)(ii) of  this definition), that worker's ``place of employment'' or ``worksite''  for purposes of H-1B obligations is the worker's home station or regular  work location. The employer's obligations regarding notice, prevailing  wage and working conditions are focused on the home station ``place of  employment'' rather than on the above-described location(s) which do not  constitute worksite(s) for these purposes. However, whether or not a  location is considered to be a ``worksite''/''place of employment'' for  an H-1B nonimmigrant, the employer is required to provide reimbursement  to the H-1B nonimmigrant for expenses incurred in traveling to that  location on the employer's business, since such expenses are considered  to be ordinary business expenses of employers (Sec. Sec.  655.731(c)(7)(iii)(C); 655.731(c)(9)). In determining the worker's  ``place of employment'' or ``worksite,'' the Department will look  carefully at situations which appear to be contrived or abusive; the  Department would seriously question any situation where the H-1B  nonimmigrant's purported ``place of employment'' is a location other  than where the worker spends most of his/her work time, or where the  purported ``area of employment'' does not include the location(s) where  the worker spends most of his/her work time.</p><p class="depth0">Required wage rate means the rate of pay which is the higher of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The actual wage for the specific employment in question; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The prevailing wage rate (determined as of the time of filing  the LCA application) for the occupation in which the H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3  nonimmigrant is to be employed in the geographic area of intended  employment. The prevailing wage rate must be no less than the minimum  wage required by Federal, State, or local law.</p><p class="depth0">Secretary means the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's designee.</p><p class="depth0">Specialty occupation:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of the E-3 and H-1B programs (but not the H-1B1  program), specialty occupation means an occupation that requires  theoretical and practical application of a body of specialized  knowledge, and attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree (or its  equivalent) in the specific specialty as a minimum for entry into the  occupation in the United States. The nonimmigrant in a specialty  occupation shall possess the following qualifications:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Full state licensure to practice in the occupation, if licensure  is required for the occupation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Completion of the required degree; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Experience in the specialty equivalent to the completion of  such degree and recognition of expertise in the specialty through  progressively responsible positions relating to the specialty. INA, 8  U.S.C. 1184(i)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of the United States-Chile Free Trade  Agreement. For H-1B1 nonimmigrants from Singapore, additional  occupations that qualify as specialty occupations are Disaster Relief  Claims Adjuster and Management Consultant, as defined in Appendix 11A.2  of the United States-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determinations of specialty occupation and of nonimmigrant  qualifications for the H-1B and H-1B1 programs are not made by the  Department of Labor, but by the Department of State and/or United States  Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) of the Department of  Homeland Security in accordance with the procedures of those agencies  for processing visas, petitions, extensions of stay, or requests for  change of nonimmigrant status for H-1B or H-1B1 nonimmigrants.</p><p class="depth0">Specific employment in question means the set of duties and  responsibilities performed or to be performed by the H-1B nonimmigrant  at the place of employment.</p><p class="depth0">State means one of the 50 States, the District of Columbia, Guam,  Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0">State Workforce Agency, formerly State Employment Security Agency or  SESA means the State agency which, under the State Administrator, is  designated by the Governor to administer Wagner-Peyser Act funded  employment and workforce information services (State agency) and the  State unemployment compensation program.</p><p class="depth0">Strike means a labor dispute wherein employees engage in a concerted  stoppage of work (including stoppage by reason of the expiration of a  collective-bargaining agreement) or engage in any concerted slowdown or  other concerted interruption of operation.</p><p class="depth0">United States worker (``U.S. worker'') means an employee who is  either</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A citizen or national of the United States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An alien who is lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the  United States, is admitted as a refugee under section 207 of the INA, is  granted asylum under section 208 of the INA, or is an immigrant  otherwise authorized (by the INA or by DHS) to be employed in the United  States.</p><p class="depth0">Wage rate means the remuneration (exclusive of fringe benefits) to  be paid, stated in terms of amount per hour, day, month or year (see  definition of ``Required Wage Rate'').
