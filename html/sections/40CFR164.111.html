As soon as practicable thereafter, the Environmental Appeals Board shall announce its decision whether to grant or to deny the motion. Unless the Environmental Appeals Board shall determine otherwise, operation of the order shall not be stayed pending the decision to grant or to deny the motion. In the event that any such motion is granted by the Environmental Appeals Board, the applicable rules of practice, as set out elsewhere herein, shall be followed.
