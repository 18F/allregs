                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> By March 31, 2010, each nuclear power reactor  licensee, licensed under 10 CFR part 50, shall implement the  requirements of this section through revisions to its Commission- approved Physical Security Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall establish, implement and maintain its access  authorization program in accordance with the requirements of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each applicant for an operating license under the provisions of  part 50 of this chapter, and each holder of a combined license under the  provisions of part 52 of this chapter, shall implement the requirements  of this section before fuel is allowed on site (protected area).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The licensee or applicant may accept, in part or whole, an  access authorization program implemented by a contractor or vendor to  satisfy appropriate elements of the licensee's access authorization  program in accordance with the requirements of this section. Only a  licensee shall grant an individual unescorted access. Licensees and  applicants shall certify individuals' unescorted access authorization  and are responsible to maintain, deny, terminate, or withdraw unescorted  access authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applicability. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The following individuals shall be subject to  an access authorization program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual to whom a licensee intends to grant unescorted  access to nuclear power plant protected or vital areas or any individual  for whom a licensee or an applicant intends to certify unescorted access  authorization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any individual whose duties and responsibilities permit the  individual to take actions by electronic means, either on site or  remotely, that could adversely impact the licensee's or applicant's  operational safety, security, or emergency preparedness;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any individual who has responsibilities for implementing a  licensee's or applicant's protective strategy, including, but not  limited to, armed security force officers, alarm station operators, and  tactical response team leaders; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The licensee or applicant access authorization program  reviewing official or contractor or vendor access authorization program  reviewers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other individuals, at the licensee's or applicant's discretion,  including employees of a contractor or a vendor who are designated in  access authorization program procedures, are subject to an access  authorization program that meets the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General performance objective. The licensee's or applicant's  access authorization program must provide high assurance that the  individuals who are specified in paragraph (b)(1), and, if applicable,  paragraph (b)(2) of this section are trustworthy and reliable, such that  they do not constitute an unreasonable risk to public health and safety  or the common defense and security, including the potential to commit  radiological sabotage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Background investigation. In order to grant an individual  unescorted access to the protected area or vital area of a nuclear power  plant or certify an individual unescorted access authorization,  licensees, applicants and contractors or vendors shall ensure that the  individual has been subject to a background investigation. The  background   investigation must include, but is not limited to, the following  elements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Informed consent. Licensees, applicants, and contractors or  vendors shall not initiate any element of a background investigation  without the informed and signed consent of the subject individual. This  consent shall include authorization to share personal information with  appropriate entities. The licensee or applicant to whom the individual  is applying for unescorted access and unescorted access authorization,  respectively, or the contractors or vendors supporting the licensee or  applicant shall inform the individual of his or her right to review  information collected to assure its accuracy, and provide the individual  with an opportunity to correct any inaccurate or incomplete information  that is developed by licensees, applicants, or contractors or vendors  about the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The subject individual may withdraw his or her consent at any  time. Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall inform the  individual that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Withdrawal of his or her consent will remove the individual's  application for access authorization under the licensee's or applicant's  access authorization program or contractor or vendor access  authorization program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other licensees and applicants shall have access to information  documenting the withdrawal. Additionally, the contractors or vendors may  have the same access to the information, if such information is  necessary for assisting licensees or applicants complying with  requirements set forth in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an individual withdraws his or her consent, licensees,  applicants, and contractors or vendors may not initiate any elements of  the background investigation that were not in progress at the time the  individual withdrew his or her consent, but shall complete any  background investigation elements that are in progress at the time  consent is withdrawn. The licensee or applicant shall record the status  of the individual's application for unescorted access or unescorted  access authorization, respectively. Contractors or vendors may record  the status of the individual's application for unescorted access or  unescorted access authorization for licensees or applicants.  Additionally, licensees, applicants, or contractors or vendors shall  collect and maintain the individual's application for unescorted access  or unescorted access authorization; his or her withdrawal of consent for  the background investigation; the reason given by the individual for the  withdrawal; and any pertinent information collected from the background  investigation elements that were completed. This information must be  shared with other licensees in accordance with paragraph (o)(6) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall  inform, in writing, any individual who is applying for unescorted access  or unescorted access authorization that the following actions are  sufficient cause for denial or unfavorable termination of unescorted  access or unescorted access authorization status:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Refusal to provide a signed consent for the background  investigation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Refusal to provide, or the falsification of, any personal  history information required under this section, including the failure  to report any previous denial or unfavorable termination of unescorted  access or unescorted access authorization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Refusal to provide signed consent for the sharing of personal  information with other licensees, applicants, or the contractor or  vendors under paragraph (d)(4)(v) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Failure to report any arrests or legal actions specified in  paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Personal history disclosure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who is applying  for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization shall disclose  the personal history information that is required by the licensee's or  applicant's access authorization program, including any information that  may be necessary for the reviewing official to make a determination of  the individual's trustworthiness and reliability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Licensees, applicants, and contractors or vendors shall not  require an individual to disclose an administrative withdrawal of  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization under   the requirements of Sec. 73.56(g), (h)(7), or (i)(1)(v) of this  section. However, the individual must disclose this information if the  individual's unescorted access or unescorted access authorization is  administratively withdrawn at the time he or she is seeking unescorted  access or unescorted access authorization, or the individual's  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization was subsequently  denied or terminated unfavorably by a licensee, applicant, or contractor  or vendor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Verification of true identity. Licensees, applicants, and  contractors or vendors shall verify the true identity of an individual  who is applying for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization  in order to ensure that the applicant is the person that he or she has  claimed to be. At a minimum, licensees, applicants, and contractors or  vendors shall validate that the social security number that the  individual has provided is his or hers, and, in the case of foreign  nationals, validate the claimed non-immigration status that the  individual has provided is correct. In addition, licensees and  applicants shall also determine whether the results of the  fingerprinting required under Sec. 73.57 confirm the individual's  claimed identity, if such results are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employment history evaluation. Licensees, applicants, and  contractors or vendors shall ensure that an employment history  evaluation has been completed on a best effort basis, by questioning the  individual's present and former employers, and by determining the  activities of the individual while unemployed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the claimed employment period, the individual must provide  the reason for any termination, eligibility for rehire, and other  information that could reflect on the individual's trustworthiness and  reliability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the claimed employment was military service the individual  shall provide a characterization of service, reason for separation, and  any disciplinary actions that could affect a trustworthiness and  reliability determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If education is claimed in lieu of employment, the individual  shall provide any information related to the claimed education that  could reflect on the individual's trustworthiness and reliability and,  at a minimum, verify that the individual was registered for the classes  and received grades that indicate that the individual participated in  the educational process during the claimed period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If a previous employer, educational institution, or any other  entity with which the individual claims to have been engaged fails to  provide information or indicates an inability or unwillingness to  provide information within 3 business days of the request, the licensee,  applicant, or contractor or vendor shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Document this refusal or unwillingness in the licensee's,  applicant's, or contractor's or vendor's record of the investigation;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtain a confirmation of employment, educational enrollment and  attendance, or other form of engagement claimed by the individual from  at least one alternate source that has not been previously used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When any licensee, applicant, contractor, or vendor is seeking  the information required for an unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization decision under this section and has obtained a signed  release from the subject individual authorizing the disclosure of such  information, other licensees, applicants, contractors and vendors shall  make available the personal or access authorization information  requested regarding the denial or unfavorable termination of unescorted  access or unescorted access authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> In conducting an employment history evaluation, the licensee,  applicant, contractor, or vendor may obtain information and documents by  electronic means, including, but not limited to, telephone, facsimile,  or e-mail. Licensees, applicants, contractors, or vendors shall make a  record of the contents of the telephone call and shall retain that  record, and any documents or electronic files obtained electronically,  in accordance with paragraph (o) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Credit history evaluation. Licensees, applicants, contractors  and vendors shall ensure that the full credit   history of any individual who is applying for unescorted access or  unescorted access authorization is evaluated. A full credit history  evaluation must include, but is not limited to, an inquiry to detect  potential fraud or misuse of social security numbers or other financial  identifiers, and a review and evaluation of all of the information that  is provided by a national credit-reporting agency about the individual's  credit history. For individuals including foreign nationals and United  States citizens who have resided outside the United States and do not  have established credit history that covers at least the most recent  seven years in the United States, the licensee, applicant, contractor or  vendor must document all attempts to obtain information regarding the  individual's credit history and financial responsibility from some  relevant entity located in that other country or countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Character and reputation evaluation. Licensees, applicants,  contractors, and vendors shall ascertain the character and reputation of  an individual who has applied for unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization by conducting reference checks. Reference checks may not  be conducted with any person who is known to be a close member of the  individual's family, including but not limited to, the individual's  spouse, parents, siblings, or children, or any individual who resides in  the individual's permanent household. The reference checks must focus on  the individual's reputation for trustworthiness and reliability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Criminal history review. The licensee's or applicant's reviewing  official shall evaluate the entire criminal history record of an  individual who is applying for unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization to determine whether the individual has a record of  criminal activity that may adversely impact his or her trustworthiness  and reliability. A criminal history record must be obtained in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 73.57. For individuals who do  not have or are not expected to have unescorted access, a criminal  history record of the individual shall be obtained in accordance with  the requirements set forth in paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Psychological assessment.

If the reviewing  official has a reason to believe that the reported individual's  trustworthiness or reliability is questionable, the reviewing official  shall either administratively withdraw or terminate the individual's  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization while completing  the re-evaluation or investigation. If the reviewing official determines  from the information provided that there is cause for additional action,  the reviewing official may inform the supervisor of the reported  individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Self-reporting of legal actions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any individual who has  applied for unescorted access or unescorted access authorization or is  maintaining unescorted access or unescorted access authorization under  this section shall promptly report to the reviewing official, his or her  supervisor, or other management personnel designated in site procedures  any legal action(s) taken by a law enforcement authority or court of law  to which the individual has been subject that could result in  incarceration or a court order or that requires a court appearance,  including but not limited to an arrest, an indictment, the filing of  charges, or a conviction, but excluding minor civil actions or  misdemeanors such as parking violations or speeding tickets.

On the day that  the report is received, the reviewing official shall evaluate the  circumstances related to the reported legal action(s) and re-determine  the reported individual's unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The licensee or applicant shall inform the individual of this  obligation, in writing, prior to granting unescorted access or  certifying unescorted access authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Granting unescorted access and certifying unescorted access  authorization. Licensees and applicants shall implement the requirements  of this paragraph for granting or certifying initial or reinstated  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization. The investigatory  information collected to satisfy the requirements of this section for  individuals who are being considered for unescorted access or unescorted  access authorization shall be valid for a trustworthiness and  reliability determination by a licensee or applicant for 30 calendar  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determination basis. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The licensee's or applicant's reviewing  official shall determine whether to grant, certify, deny, unfavorably  terminate, maintain, or administratively withdraw an individual's  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization status, based on an  evaluation of all of the information required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The licensee's or applicant's reviewing official may not grant  unescorted access or certify unescorted   access authorization status to an individual until all of the  information required by this section has been evaluated by the reviewing  official and the reviewing official has determined that the accumulated  information supports a determination of the individual's trustworthiness  and reliability. However, the reviewing official may deny or terminate  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization of any individual  based on disqualifying information even if not all the information  required by this section has been collected or evaluated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unescorted access for NRC-certified personnel. Licensees and  applicants shall grant unescorted access to any individual who has been  certified by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as suitable for such  access.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Access denial. Licensees or applicants may not permit an  individual, who is identified as having an access-denied status by  another licensee subject to this section, or has an access authorization  status other than favorably terminated, to enter any nuclear power plant  protected area or vital area, under escort or otherwise, or take actions  by electronic means that could adversely impact the licensee's or  applicant's safety, security, or emergency response or their facilities,  under supervision or otherwise, except upon completion of the initial  unescorted access authorization process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Granting unescorted access and certifying unescorted access  authorization--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization. In satisfying the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of  this section, for individuals who have never held unescorted access or  unescorted access authorization status or whose unescorted access or  unescorted access authorization status has been interrupted for a period  of 3 years or more, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor  shall satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (d), (e), (f), and (g) of  this section. In meeting requirements set forth in paragraph (d)(4) of  this section, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor shall  evaluate the 3 years before the date on which the application for  unescorted access was submitted, or since the individual's eighteenth  birthday, whichever is shorter. For the 1-year period preceding the date  upon which the individual applies for unescorted access or unescorted  access authorization, the licensee, applicant or contractor or vendor  shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted with  every employer, regardless of the length of employment. For the  remaining 2-year period, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or  vendor shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted  with the employer by whom the individual claims to have been employed  the longest within each calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> of this section, as applicable. However,  for individuals whose unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization was interrupted for less than or equal to 30 calendar  days, licensees, applicants, or contractors or vendors must only satisfy  the requirements set forth in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of  this section. The applicable periods of interruption are determined by  the number of calendar days between the day after the individual's  access was terminated and the day upon which the individual applies for  unescorted access or unescorted access authorization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Update of unescorted access or unescorted access authorization.  For individuals whose last unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization status has been interrupted for more than 30 calendar days  but less than or equal to 365 calendar days, the licensee, applicant or  contractor or vendor shall complete the individual's employment history  evaluation in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of  this section, within 5 business days   after reinstatement. The licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor  shall ensure that the employment history evaluation has been conducted  with the employer by whom the individual claims to have been employed  the longest within the calendar month. However, if the employment  history evaluation is not completed within 5 business days of  reinstatement due to circumstances that are outside of the licensee's,  applicant's, or contractor's or vendor's control and the licensee or  applicant, contractor or vendor is not aware of any potentially  disqualifying information regarding the individual within the past 5  years, the licensee may extend the individual's unescorted access an  additional 5 business days. If the employment history evaluation is not  completed within this extended 5 business days, the licensee shall  administratively withdraw unescorted access and complete the employment  history evaluation in accordance with Sec. 73.56(d)(4) of this section.  For re-certification of unescorted access authorization, prior to re- certification of unescorted access authorization status of an  individual, the licensee or applicant shall complete all the elements  stated above including drug screening and employment evaluation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reinstatement of unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization. For individuals whose last unescorted access or  unescorted access authorization status has been interrupted for greater  than 365 calendar days but fewer than 3 years the licensee, applicant or  contractor or vendor shall evaluate the period of time since the  individual last held unescorted access or unescorted access  authorization status, up to and including the day the individual applies  for re-instated unescorted access authorization. For the 1-year period  preceding the date upon which the individual applies for unescorted  access authorization, the licensee, applicant, or contractor or vendor  shall ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted with  every employer, regardless of the length of employment. For the  remaining period, the licensee, applicant or contractor or vendor shall  ensure that the employment history evaluation is conducted with the  employer by whom the individual claims to have been employed the longest  within each calendar month. In addition, the individual shall be subject  to the psychological assessment required in Sec. 73.56(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Accepting unescorted access authorization from other access  authorization programs. Licensees who are seeking to grant unescorted  access or certify unescorted access authorization or applicants who are  seeking to certify unescorted access authorization to an individual who  is subject to another access authorization program or another access  authorization program that complies with this section may rely on those  access authorization programs or access authorization program elements  to comply with the requirements of this section. However, the licensee  who is seeking to grant unescorted access or the licensee or applicant  who is seeking to certify unescorted access authorization shall ensure  that the program elements to be accepted have been maintained consistent  with the requirements of this section by the other access authorization  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Information sharing.
