In providing such services, the State agency shall consider and be sensitive to the preferences, needs, and skills of individual MSFWs and the availability of job and training opportunities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each State agency shall assure that, in a local area, the same local offices, including itinerant and satellite offices, but exclusive of day-haul operations, offer services to both non-MSFWs and MSFWs. Separate farm labor service local offices, which offer only farmwork to agricultural workers while another local office serving the same geographical area offers other JS services to other applicants, are prohibited so that all applicants receive employment services on the same basis.</p>
