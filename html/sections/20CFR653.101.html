In providing such services, the State agency shall consider and  be sensitive to the preferences, needs, and skills of individual MSFWs  and the availability of job and training opportunities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each State agency shall assure that, in a local area, the same  local offices, including itinerant and satellite offices, but exclusive  of day-haul operations, offer services to both non-MSFWs and MSFWs.  Separate farm labor service local offices, which offer only farmwork to  agricultural workers while another local office serving the same  geographical area offers other JS services to other applicants, are  prohibited so that all applicants receive employment services on the  same basis.</p>
