                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Seeds of plants grown as crops (other than the kind(s) and variety(ies) included in the pure seed) shall be considered other crop seeds, unless recognized as weed seeds by applicable laws, or regulations, or by general usage. All interpretations and definitions for ``pure seed'' in Sec. 201.48 shall also apply in determining whether seeds are ``other crop seed'' or ``inert matter'' with the following two exceptions which may be applied as acceptable alternatives:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uniform Blowing Procedure in Sec. 201.51a(a) for kinds listed in Sec. 201.47(e) may be disregarded. If disregarded, all seed units (as defined in Sec. 201.47a) for these kinds found in the working sample shall be manually separated into pure seed and inert matter. Only units containing at least one caryopsis with some degree of endosperm development which can be detected either by slight pressure or by examination over light are considered other crop seed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Multiple Unit Procedure in Sec. 201.51a(b) for kinds listed in Sec. 201.48(g)(3) may be disregarded. If disregarded, all multiple units and single units (as defined in Sec. 201.51a(b)) for these kinds found in the working sample shall be manually separated into single florets. Each floret containing a caryopsis with some degree of endosperm development, which can be detected either by slight pressure or examination over light, is considered other crop seed. Empty florets and glumes, if present, are considered inert matter. Refer to Sec. 201.51(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
