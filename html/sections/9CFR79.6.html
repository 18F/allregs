                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In reviewing a State for Consistent State status, the Administrator will evaluate the State statutes, regulations, and directives pertaining to animal health activities; reports and publications of the State animal health agency; and a written statement from the State animal health agency describing State scrapie control activities and certifying that these activities meet the requirements of this section. In determining whether a State is a Consistent State, the Administrator will determine whether the State:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the authority, based on State law or regulation, to restrict the movement of all scrapie-infected and source flocks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has the authority, based on State law or regulation, to require the reporting of any animal suspected of having scrapie and test results for any animals tested for scrapie to State or Federal animal health authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has, in cooperation with APHIS personnel, drafted and signed a memorandum of understanding between APHIS and the State that delineates the respective roles of each in the National Scrapie Program implementation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has placed all known scrapie-infected and source flocks under movement restrictions, with movement of animals only to slaughter, to feedlots under permit and movement restrictions that ensure later movement to slaughter, for destruction, or for research. Scrapie-positive and suspect animals may be moved only for transport to an approved research facility or for purposes of destruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has effectively implemented policies to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Investigate all animals reported as scrapie suspect animals within 7 days of notification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Designate a flock's status, within 15 days of notification that the flock contains a scrapie-positive animal, based on an investigation by State or Federal animal health authorities and in accordance with this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Restrict the movement, in accordance with paragraph (a)(4) of this section, of newly designated scrapie-infected and source flocks within 7 days after they are designated in accordance with Sec. 79.4;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Relieve infected and source flock movement restrictions only after completion of a flock plan created in accordance with Sec. 54.14 of this chapter or a flock plan created in accordance with an approved scrapie control pilot project, or as permitted by the conditions of such a flock plan, and after agreement by the owner to comply with a 5-year post-exposure management and monitoring plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Conduct an epidemiologic investigation of source and infected flocks that includes the designation of high-risk and exposed animals and that identifies animals to be traced;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Conduct tracebacks of scrapie-positive animals and traceouts of high-risk and exposed animals and report any out-of-State traces to the appropriate State within 45 days of receipt of notification of a scrapie-positive animal; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Conduct tracebacks based on slaughter sampling within 15 days of receipt of notification of a scrapie-positive animal at slaughter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Effectively monitors and enforces quarantines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Effectively enforces State reporting laws and regulations for scrapie.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Has designated at least one APHIS or State animal health official to coordinate scrapie program activities in the State and to serve as the designated scrapie epidemiologist in the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Has educated those engaged in the interstate movement of sheep and goats regarding the identification and recordkeeping requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Has provided APHIS with a plan and timeline for complying with the following additional requirements, which must be met within 2 years of designation of the State as a Consistent State \5\:---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\5\ This provision would apply until January 1, 2003. Any State designated as a Consistent State after that date would have to meet all requirements prior to designation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Requires, based on State law or regulation, and effectively enforces official identification upon change of ownership of all animals of any age not in slaughter channels and any sheep over 18 months of age as evidenced by eruption of the second incisor such that the animal may be traced to its flock of birth; provided that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A State may exempt commercial goats in intrastate commerce that have not been in contact with sheep from this identification requirement if there has been in that State no case of scrapie in a commercial goat in the past 10 years that originated in that State and cannot be attributed to exposure to infected sheep, and there are no exposed commercial goat herds in that State; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A State may exempt commercial whitefaced sheep or commercial hair sheep under 18 months of age in intrastate commerce from this identification requirement if there has been in that State no case of scrapie in the exempted class that originated from that State, and there are no exposed commercial whitefaced or hair sheep flocks in that State that have been exposed by a female animal.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> States that exempt these types of commercial animals must put in place the regulations necessary to require identification of these animals within 90 days of these conditions no longer existing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintains in the National Scrapie Database administered by APHIS, or in a State database approved by the Administrator as compatible with the National Scrapie Database, the State's:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Premises information and assigned premises numbers and individual identification number sequences assigned for use as premises identification;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Individual animal information on all scrapie-positive, suspect, high-risk, and exposed animals in the State;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Individual animal information on all out-of-State animals to be traced; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Accurate flock status data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Requires official individual identification of any live scrapie-positive, suspect, or high-risk animal of any age and of any sexually intact exposed animal of more than 1 year of age or any sexually intact exposed animal of less than 1 year of age upon change of ownership (except for exposed animals moving in slaughter channels at less than 1 year of age), whether or not the animal resides in a source or infected flock.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Effectively enforces movement restrictions on all scrapie-positive, suspect, and high-risk animals throughout their lives unless they are moved in accordance with Sec. 79.3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Requires that tissues from all scrapie-positive or suspect animals and female high-risk animals that have lambed (when they have died or have been destroyed) be submitted to a laboratory authorized by the Administrator to conduct scrapie tests and requires complete destruction of the carcasses of scrapie-positive and suspect animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Prohibits any animal from being removed from slaughter channels unless it is identified to the flock of birth, is not from an Inconsistent State, and is not scrapie-exposed or from an infected or source flock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Administrator determines that statutory changes are needed to bring a State into full compliance, the Administrator may grant up to a 2-year extension to allow a State to acquire additional authorities before removing a State's Consistent Status. The decision to grant an extension will be based on the State's ability to prevent the movement of scrapie-infected animals out of the State and on the progress being made in making the needed statutory changes.</p>
