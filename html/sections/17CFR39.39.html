                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General business risk means any potential impairment of a  systemically important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C  derivatives clearing organization's financial position, as a business  concern, as a consequence of a decline in its revenues or an increase in  its expenses, such that expenses exceed revenues and result in a loss  that the derivatives clearing organization must charge against capital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Wind-down means the actions of a systemically important  derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing  organization to effect the permanent cessation or sale or transfer or  one or more services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recovery means the actions of a systemically important  derivatives clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing  organization, consistent with its rules, procedures, and other ex-ante  contractual arrangements, to address any uncovered credit loss,  liquidity shortfall, capital inadequacy, or business, operational or  other structural weakness, including the replenishment of any depleted  pre-funded financial resources and liquidity arrangements, as necessary  to maintain the systemically important derivatives clearing  organization's or subpart C derivatives clearing organization's  viability as a going concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Operational risk means the risk that deficiencies in information  systems or internal processes, human errors, management failures or  disruptions from external events will result   in the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services provided by a  systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart C  derivatives clearing organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Unencumbered liquid financial assets include cash and highly  liquid securities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recovery and wind-down plan. Each systemically important  derivatives clearing organization and subpart C derivatives clearing  organization shall maintain viable plans for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Recovery or orderly wind-down, necessitated by uncovered credit  losses or liquidity shortfalls; and, separately,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recovery or orderly wind-down necessitated by general business  risk, operational risk, or any other risk that threatens the derivatives  clearing organization's viability as a going concern.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In developing the plans specified in paragraph (b) of this  section, the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or  subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall identify scenarios  that may potentially prevent it from being able to meet its obligations,  provide its critical operations and services as a going concern and  assess the effectiveness of a full range of options for recovery or  orderly wind-down. The plans shall include procedures for informing the  Commission, as soon as practicable, when the recovery plan is initiated  or wind-down is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A systemically important derivatives clearing organization or  subpart C derivatives clearing organization shall have procedures for  providing the Commission and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation  with information needed for purposes of resolution planning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Financial resources to support the recovery and wind-down plan.  (1) In evaluating the resources available to cover an uncovered credit  loss or liquidity shortfall as part of its recovery plans pursuant to  paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this section, a systemically important derivatives  clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing organization may  consider, among other things, assessments of additional resources  provided for under its rules that it reasonably expects to collect from  non-defaulting clearing members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. The plan shall include evidence and analysis to  support the conclusion that the amount considered necessary is, in fact,  sufficient to implement the plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Resources counted in meeting the requirements of Sec. Sec.  39.11(a)(1) and 39.33 may not be allocated, in whole or in part, to the  recovery plans required by paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Other  resources may be allocated, in whole or in part, to the recovery plans  required by either paragraphs (b)(1) or (2) of this section, but not  both paragraphs, and only to the extent the use of such resources is not  otherwise limited by the Act, Commission regulations, the systemically  important derivatives clearing organization's or subpart C derivatives  clearing organization's rules, or any contractual arrangements to which  the systemically important derivatives clearing organization or subpart  C derivatives clearing organization is a party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Plan for raising additional financial resources. All  systemically important derivatives clearing organizations and subpart C  derivatives clearing organizations shall maintain viable plans for  raising additional financial resources, including, where appropriate,  capital, in a scenario in which the systemically important derivatives  clearing organization or subpart C derivatives clearing   organization is unable, or virtually unable, to comply with any  financial resources requirements set forth in this part. This plan shall  be approved by the board of directors and be updated regularly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Commission may, upon request, grant an entity, which has  been designated as a systemically important derivatives clearing  organization or that has elected to become subject to subpart C, up to  one year to comply with any provision of this section or of Sec. 39.35.</p>
