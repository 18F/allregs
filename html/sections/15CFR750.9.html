                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lost, stolen or destroyed. If a license is lost, stolen or  destroyed, you, as the licensee, may obtain a duplicate of the license  by submitting a letter to the BIS at the address listed in Sec.  748.1(d)(2) of the EAR, Attention: ``Duplicate License Request''. You  must certify in your letter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the original license ([number] issued to [name and address  of licensee]) has been lost, stolen or destroyed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The circumstances under which it was lost, stolen or destroyed;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the original license is found, the licensee will return  either the original or duplicate license to the BIS. Note that if  shipment was made against the original license, those shipments must be  counted against the duplicate license. If you are issued a duplicate  license you must retain the duplicate license in accordance with the  recordkeeping provisions of part 762 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hong Kong Trade Department. BIS will automatically issue a  duplicate license whenever the license lists a party in Hong Kong as the  intermediate consignee, or when Hong Kong is identified as the country  from which the reexport will take place. The duplicate license will be  labeled ``Duplicate for Hong Kong Trade Department''. This duplicate  must be forwarded to the reexporter or intermediate consignee for  submission to the Hong Kong Trade Department. The original license must  be retained on file by the licensee in accordance with the recordkeeping  provisions contained in part 762 of the EAR.
