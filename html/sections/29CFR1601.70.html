                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> State and local fair employment practice agencies or authorities which qualify under section 706(c) of title VII and this section shall be designated as ``FEP agencies.'' The qualifications for designation under section 706(c) are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the State or political subdivision has a fair employment practice law which makes unlawful employment practices based upon race, color, religion, sex, national origin or disability; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the State or political subdivision has either established a State or local authority or authorized an existing State or local authority that is empowered with respect to employment practices found to be unlawful, to do one of three things: To grant relief from the practice; to seek relief from the practice; or to institute criminal proceedings with respect to the practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any State or local agency or authority seeking FEP agency designation should submit a written request to the Chairman of the Commission. However, if the Commission is aware that an agency or authority meets the above criteria for FEP agency designation, the Commission shall defer charges to such agency or authority even though no request for FEP agency designation has been made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A request for FEP agency designation should include a copy of the agency's fair employment practices law and any rules, regulations and guidelines of general interpretation issued pursuant thereto. Submission of such data will allow the Commission to ascertain which employment practices are made unlawful and which bases are covered by the State or local entity. Agencies or authorities are requested, but not required, to provide the following helpful information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A chart of the organization of the agency or authority responsible for administering and enforcing said law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of funds made available to or allocated by the agency or authority for fair employment purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The identity and telephone number of the agency (authority) representative whom the Commission may contact with reference to any legal or other questions that may arise regarding designation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A detailed statement as to how the agency or authority meets the qualifications of paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of Sec. 1601.70.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where both State and local FEP agencies exist, the Commission reserves the right to defer to the State FEP agency only. However, where there exist agencies of concurrent jurisdiction, the Commission may defer to the FEP agency which would best serve the purposes of title VII, the ADA, or GINA, or to both.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Chairman or his or her designee, will provide to the Attorney General of the concerned State (and corporation counsel of a concerned local government, if appropriate) an opportunity to comment upon aspects of State or local law which might affect the qualifications of any new agency in that State otherwise cognizable under this section.
