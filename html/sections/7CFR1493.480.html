If the exporter breaches or violates these certifications with respect to a SCGP payment guarantee, CCC will have the right, notwithstanding any other rights provided under this subpart, to annul guarantee coverage for any commodities not yet exported and/or to proceed against the exporter. The exporter, in submitting the evidence of export and providing the statement set forth in Sec. 1493.470(a)(10), certifies that:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The agricultural commodity or product exported under the payment guarantee is a U.S. agricultural commodity as defined by Sec. 1493.410(x).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agricultural commodities of the grade, quality and quantity called for in the exporter's sales contract with the importer have been exported to the country specified in the payment guarantee;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There is an importer obligation as defined in Sec. 1493.410(n) to cover the exported value of the commodity exported;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> There have not been and will not be any corrupt payments or extra sales services or other items extraneous to the transaction provided, financed, or guaranteed in connection with the transaction, and that the transaction complies with applicable United States law; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The information provided pursuant to Sec. 1493.420 has not changed, the exporter still meets all of the qualification requirements of Sec. 1493.420 and the exporter will immediately notify CCC if there is a change of circumstances which would cause it to fail to meet such requirements.
