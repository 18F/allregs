                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">You will perform the risk-based capital stress test as described in  summary form below and as described in detail in appendix A to this  subpart. The risk-based capital stress test spreadsheet is also  available electronically at http://www.fca.gov. The risk-based capital  stress test has five components:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Data requirements. You will use the following data to implement  the risk-based capital stress test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You will use Corporation loan-level data to implement the credit  risk component of the risk-based capital stress test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You will use Call Report data as the basis for Corporation data  over the 10-year stress period supplemented with your interest rate risk  measurements and tax data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You will use other data, including the 10-year Constant Maturity  Treasury (CMT) rate and the applicable Internal Revenue Service  corporate income tax schedule, as further described in appendix A to  this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Credit risk. The credit risk part estimates loan losses during a  period of sustained economic stress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each loan in the Farmer Mac I portfolio, you will determine  a default probability by using the logit functions specified in appendix  A to this subpart with each of the following variables:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Borrower's debt-to-asset ratio at loan origination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Loan-to-value ratio at origination, which is the loan amount  divided by the value of the property;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Debt-service-coverage ratio at origination, which is the  borrower's net income (on- and off-farm) plus depreciation, capital  lease payments, and interest, less living expenses and income taxes,  divided by the total term debt payments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The origination loan balance stated in 1997 dollars based on  the consumer price index; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The worst-case percentage change in farmland values (23.52  percent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You will then calculate the loss rate by multiplying the default  probability for each loan by the estimated loss-severity rate, which is  the average loss of the defaulted loans in the data set (20.9 percent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You will calculate losses by multiplying the loss rate by the  origination loan balances stated in 1997 dollars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You will adjust the losses for loan seasoning, based on the  number of years since loan origination, according to the functions in  appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You will calculate loss rates on rural utility loans as further  described in appendix A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You will further adjust losses for loans that collateralize the  general obligation of AgVantage Plus volume, and for loans where the  program loan counterparty retains a subordinated interest in accordance  with appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The losses must be applied in the risk-based capital stress test  as specified in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate risk. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the first year of the stress  period, you will adjust interest rates for two scenarios, an increase in  rates and a decrease in rates. You must determine your risk-based  capital level based on whichever scenario would require more capital.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You will calculate the interest rate stress based on changes to  the quarterly average of the 10-year CMT. The starting rate is the 3- month average of the most recent CMT monthly rate series. To calculate  the change in the starting rate, determine the average yield of the  preceding 12 monthly 10-year CMT rates. Then increase and decrease the  starting rate by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 50 percent of the 12-month average if the average rate is less  than 12 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 600 basis points if the 12-month average rate is equal to or  higher than 12 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Following the first year of the stress period, interest rates  remain at the new level for the remainder of the stress period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You will apply the interest rate changes scenario as indicated  in appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may use other interest rate indices in addition to the 10- year CMT subject to our concurrence, but in no event can your risk-based  capital level be less than that determined by using only the 10-year  CMT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cashflow generator. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must adjust your financial  statements based on the credit risk inputs and interest rate risk inputs  described above to generate pro forma financial statements for each year  of the 10-year stress test. The cashflow generator produces these  financial statements. You may use the cashflow generator spreadsheet  that is described in appendix A to this subpart and available  electronically at http://www.fca.gov. You may also use any reliable  cashflow program that can develop or produce pro forma financial  statements using generally accepted accounting principles and widely  recognized financial modeling methods, subject to our concurrence. You  may disaggregate financial data to any greater degree than that  specified in appendix A to this subpart, subject to our concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must use model assumptions to generate financial statements  over the 10-year stress period. The major assumption is that cashflows  generated by the risk-based capital stress test are based on a steady- state scenario. To implement a steady-state scenario, when on- and off- balance sheet assets and liabilities amortize or are paid down, you must  replace them with similar assets and liabilities (AgVantage Plus volume  is not replaced when it matures). Replace amortized assets from  discontinued loan programs with current loan programs. In general, keep  assets with small balances in constant proportions to key program  assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must simulate annual pro forma balance sheets and income  statements in the risk-based capital stress test using Farmer Mac's  starting position, the credit risk and interest rate risk components,  resulting cashflow outputs, current operating strategies and policies,  and other inputs as shown in appendix A to this subpart and the  electronic spreadsheet available at http://www.fca.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculation of capital requirement. The calculations that you  must use to solve for the starting regulatory capital amount are shown  in appendix A to this subpart and in the electronic spreadsheet  available at http://www.fca.gov.
