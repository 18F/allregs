                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General exception for qualifying assets. Commercial loans, commercial real estate loans, and automobile loans that are securitized through a securitization transaction shall be subject to a 0 percent risk retention requirement under subpart B, provided that the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The assets meet the underwriting standards set forth in Secs. 246.16 (qualifying commercial loans), 246.17 (qualifying CRE loans), or 246.18 (qualifying automobile loans) of this part, as applicable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The securitization transaction is collateralized solely by loans of the same asset class and by servicing assets;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The securitization transaction does not permit reinvestment periods; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The sponsor provides, or causes to be provided, to potential investors a reasonable period of time prior to the sale of asset-backed securities of the issuing entity, and, upon request, to the Commission, and to its appropriate Federal banking agency, if any, in written form under the caption ``Credit Risk Retention'', a description of the manner in which the sponsor determined the aggregate risk retention requirement for the securitization transaction after including qualifying commercial loans, qualifying CRE loans, or qualifying automobile loans with 0 percent risk retention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Risk retention requirement. For any securitization transaction described in paragraph (a) of this section, the percentage of risk retention required under Sec. 246.3(a) is reduced by the percentage evidenced by the ratio of the unpaid principal balance of the qualifying commercial loans, qualifying CRE loans, or qualifying automobile loans (as applicable) to the total unpaid principal balance of commercial loans, CRE loans, or automobile loans (as applicable) that are included in the pool of assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities issued pursuant to the securitization transaction (the qualifying asset ratio); provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The qualifying asset ratio is measured as of the cut-off date or similar date for establishing the composition of the securitized assets collateralizing the asset-backed securities issued pursuant to the securitization transaction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the qualifying asset ratio would exceed 50 percent, the qualifying asset ratio shall be deemed to be 50 percent; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The disclosure required by paragraph (a)(4) of this section also includes descriptions of the qualifying commercial loans, qualifying CRE loans, and qualifying automobile loans (qualifying assets) and descriptions of the assets that are not qualifying assets, and the material differences between the group of qualifying assets and the group of assets that are not qualifying assets with respect to the

composition of each group's loan balances, loan terms, interest rates, borrower credit information, and characteristics of any loan collateral.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exception for securitizations of qualifying assets only. Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, the risk retention requirements of subpart B of this part shall not apply to securitization transactions where the transaction is collateralized solely by servicing assets and either qualifying commercial loans, qualifying CRE loans, or qualifying automobile loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Record maintenance. A sponsor must retain the disclosures required in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the certifications required in Secs. 246.16(a)(8), 246.17(a)(10), and 246.18(a)(8), as applicable, in its records until three years after all ABS interests issued in the securitization are no longer outstanding. The sponsor must provide the disclosures and certifications upon request to the Commission and the sponsor's appropriate Federal banking agency, if any.</p>
