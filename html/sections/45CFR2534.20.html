                            <p class="depth0">The President, acting through the Corporation, may make Presidential awards for service to individuals providing significant service, and to outstanding programs. Information about recipients of such awards will be widely disseminated. The President may provide such awards to any deserving individual or program, regardless of whether the individual is serving in a program authorized by this chapter or whether the program is itself authorized by this chapter. In no instance, however, may the award be a cash award.
