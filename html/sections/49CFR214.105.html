                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. All fall protection systems required by  this subpart shall conform to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fall protection systems shall be used only for personal fall  protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any fall protection system subjected to impact loading shall be  immediately and permanently removed from service unless fully inspected  and determined by a competent person to be undamaged and suitable for  reuse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All fall protection system components shall be protected from  abrasions, corrosion, or any other form of deterioration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All fall protection system components shall be inspected prior  to each use for wear, damage, corrosion, mildew, and other  deterioration. Defective components shall be permanently removed from  service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prior to use and after any component or system is changed,  bridge workers shall be trained in the application limits of the  equipment, proper hook-up, anchoring and tie-off techniques, methods of  use, and proper methods of equipment inspection and storage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The railroad or railroad contractor shall provide for prompt  rescue of bridge workers in the event of a fall.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Connectors shall have a corrosion-resistant finish, and all  surfaces and edges shall be smooth to prevent damage to interfacing  parts of the system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Connectors shall be drop forged, pressed or formed steel, or  made of equivalent-strength materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Anchorages, including single- and double-head anchors, shall be  capable of supporting at least 5,000 pounds per bridge worker attached,  or shall be designed, installed, and used under supervision of a  qualified person as part of a complete personal fall protection system  that maintains a safety factor of at least two.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personal fall arrest systems. All components of a personal fall  arrest system shall conform to the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Lanyards and vertical lifelines that tie off one bridge worker  shall have a minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Self-retracting lifelines and lanyards that automatically limit  free fall distance to two feet or less shall have components capable of  sustaining a minimum static tensile load of 3,000 pounds applied to the  device with the lifeline or lanyard in the fully extended position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Self-retracting lifelines and lanyards that do not limit free  fall distance to two feet or less, ripstitch, and tearing and deformed  lanyards shall be capable of withstanding 5,000 pounds applied to the  device with the lifeline or lanyard in the fully extended position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Horizontal lifelines shall be designed, installed, and used  under the supervision of a competent person, as part of a complete  personal fall arrest system that maintains a safety factor of at least  two.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Lifelines shall not be made of natural fiber rope.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Body belts shall not be used as components of personal fall  arrest systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The personal fall arrest system shall limit the maximum  arresting force on a bridge worker to 1,800 pounds when used with a body  harness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The personal fall arrest system shall bring a bridge worker to a  complete stop and limit maximum deceleration distance a bridge worker  travels to 3.5 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The personal fall arrest system shall have sufficient strength  to withstand twice the potential impact energy of a bridge worker free  falling a distance of six feet, or the free fall distance permitted by  the system, whichever is less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The personal fall arrest system shall be arranged so that a  bridge worker cannot free fall more than six feet and cannot contact the  ground or any lower horizontal surface of the bridge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Personal fall arrest systems shall be worn with the attachment  point of the body harness located in the center of the wearer's back  near shoulder level, or above the wearer's head.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> When vertical lifelines are used, each bridge worker shall be  provided with a separate lifeline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Devices used to connect to a horizontal lifeline that may  become a vertical lifeline shall be capable of locking in either  direction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Dee-rings and snap-hooks shall be capable of sustaining a  minimum tensile load of 3,600 pounds without cracking, breaking, or  taking permanent deformation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Dee-rings and snap-hooks shall be capable of sustaining a  minimum tensile load of 5,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Snap-hooks shall not be connected to each other.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Snap-hooks shall be dimensionally compatible with the member to  which they are connected to prevent unintentional disengagement, or  shall be a locking snap-hook designed to prevent unintentional  disengagement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Unless of a locking type, snap-hooks shall not be engaged:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Directly, next to a webbing, rope, or wire rope;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To each other;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To a dee-ring to which another snap-hook or other connector is  attached;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> To a horizontal lifeline; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> To any object that is incompatibly shaped or dimensioned in  relation to the snap-hook so that unintentional disengagement could  occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safety net systems. Use of safety net systems shall conform to  the following standards and practices:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Safety nets shall be installed as close as practicable under the  walking/working surface on which bridge workers are working, but shall  not be installed more than 30 feet below such surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the distance from the working surface to the net exceeds 30  feet, bridge workers shall be protected by personal fall arrest systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The safety net shall be installed such that any fall from the  working surface to the net is unobstructed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as provided in this section, safety nets and net  installations shall be drop-tested at the jobsite after initial  installation and before being used as a fall protection system, whenever  relocated, after major repair, and at six-month intervals if left in one  place. The drop-test shall consist of a 400-pound bag of sand 30 inches,  plus or minus two inches, in diameter dropped into the net from the  highest (but not less than 3\1/2\ feet) working surface on which bridge  workers are to be protected.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the railroad or railroad contractor demonstrates that a  drop-test is not feasible and, as a result, the test is not performed,  the railroad or railroad contractor, or designated competent person,  shall certify that the net and its installation are in compliance with  the provisions of this section by preparing a certification record prior  to use of the net.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The certification shall include an identification of the net,  the date it was determined that the net was in compliance with this  section, and the signature of the person making this determination. Such  person's signature shall certify that the net and its installation are  in compliance with this section. The most recent certification for each  net installation shall be available at the jobsite where the subject net  is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Safety nets and their installations shall be capable of  absorbing an impact force equal to that produced by the drop test  specified in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The safety net shall be installed such that there is no contact  with surfaces or structures below the net when subjected to an impact  force equal to the drop test specified in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Safety nets shall extend outward from the outermost projection  of the work surface as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the vertical distance from the working level to the  horizontal plane of the net is 5 feet or less, the minimum required  horizontal distance of the outer edge of the net beyond the edge of the  working surface is 8 feet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the vertical distance from the working level to the  horizontal plane of the net is 5 feet, but less than 10 feet, the  minimum required horizontal distance of the outer edge of the net beyond  the edge of the working surface is 10 feet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When the vertical distance from the working level to the  horizontal plane of the net is more than 10 feet, the minimum required  horizontal distance of the outer edge of the net beyond the edge of the  working surface is 13 feet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Defective nets shall not be used. Safety nets shall be inspected  at least once a week for mildew, wear, damage, and other deterioration.  Defective components shall be removed permanently from service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Safety nets shall be inspected after any occurrence that could  affect the integrity of the safety net system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Tools, scraps, or other materials that have fallen into the  safety net shall be removed as soon as possible, and at least before the  next work shift.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Each safety net shall have a border rope for webbing with a  minimum breaking strength of 5,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The maximum size of each safety net mesh opening shall not  exceed 36 square inches and shall not be longer than 6 inches on any  side measured center-to-center of mesh ropes or webbing. All mesh  crossing shall be secured to prevent enlargement of the mesh opening.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Connections between safety net panels shall be as strong as  integral net components and shall be spaced not more than 6 inches  apart.
