                            <p class="depth0">After potential markets have been located (but prior to initiation  of formal bidding procedures), preliminary determinations of various  separation methods, storage, and transportation costs have been made,  and estimated tonnages of both recoverable high-grade paper and residual  solid waste have been established, an analysis should be conducted which  compares the costs of the present waste collection and disposal system  with the proposed segregated systems. At a minimum, the study should  include all capital, operating and overhead costs and take into account  credits for revenue from paper sales and savings from diverting recycled  materials from disposal. Potential costs to upgrade collection and  disposal practices to comply with EPA's Guidelines for the Storage and  Collection of Residential, Commercial and Institutional Solid Wastes (40  CFR part 243) and Thermal Processing and Land Disposal Guidelines (40  CFR parts 240 and 241) should be included in the analysis. In  formulating a separation system and evaluating its costs, every effort  should be made to use janitorial and waste collection resources  efficiently. This cost analysis should enable the facility to determine  the most cost effective method of implementing the requirement of this  part.</p>
