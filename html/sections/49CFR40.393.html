The duration of the PIE is one of the  elements of the proceeding that the service agent may contest (see Sec.  40.381(b)) and about which the Director makes a decision (see Sec.  40.387(b)(4)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In deciding upon the duration of the PIE, the Director considers  the seriousness of the conduct on which the PIE is based and the  continued need to   protect employers and employees from the service agent's noncompliance.  The Director considers factors such as those listed in Sec. 40.389 in  making this decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The duration of a PIE will be between one and five years, unless  the Director reduces its duration under Sec. 40.407.</p>
