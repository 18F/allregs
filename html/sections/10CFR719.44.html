For costs associated with the creation and use of  computerized databases, contractors and retained legal counsel must  ensure that the creation and use of computerized databases is necessary  and cost-effective. Use of databases originally created by the  Department or its contractors for other purposes, but that can be used  to assist a contractor or retained legal counsel in connection with a  particular matter, should be considered.
