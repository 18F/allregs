It adopts the definition of occupational safety and health issues expressed in Sec. 1909.2(c)(1) of this chapter. The State has adopted the Federal Field Operations Manual and all the Federal standards except those found in 29 CFR parts 1915, 1916, 1917, and 1918 (ship repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and longshoring). In addition, the Occupational and Radiation Protection Division will be enforcing State standards under the Radiation Protection Act (chapter 284, Laws of 1971, 12-9-1 through 12-9-11, New Mexico Statutes Annotated). However, since this Act provides protection to the general public, in the event of conflict between Radiation Protection Act standards and

occupational safety and health standards, employees will receive the protection provided under the more stringent regulation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan identifies the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Agency, with its subordinate organization, the Occupational and Radiation Protection Division, as the State agency designated to administer the plan throughout the State.
