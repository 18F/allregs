                                Sec. 199.22  TRICARE Retiree Dental Program (TRDP).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The TRDP is a premium based indemnity dental insurance  coverage program that will be available to retired members of the  Uniformed Services, their dependents, and certain other beneficiaries,  as specified in paragraph (d) of this section. The TRDP is authorized by  10 U.S.C. 1076c.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General provisions. (1) At a minimum, benefits are the  diagnostic services, preventive services, basic restorative services  (including endodontics), oral surgery services, and emergency services  specified in paragraph (f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section. Additional services  comparable to those contained in paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 199.13 may be  covered   pursuant to benefit policy decisions made by the Director, TRICARE  Management Activity, or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Premium costs for this coverage will be paid by the enrollee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Geographic scope. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The TRDP is applicable to authorized  providers in the 50 United States and the District of Columbia, Canada,  Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) (ASD (HA))  may extend the TRDP to geographic areas other than those specified in  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. In extending the TRDP overseas, the  ASD (HA) is authorized to establish program elements, methods of  administration, and payment rates and procedures that are different from  those in effect for the areas specified in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section to the extent the ASD (HA), or designee, determines necessary  for the effective and efficient operation of the TRDP. These differences  may include, but are not limited to, specific provisions for  preauthorization of care, varying licensure and certification  requirements for foreign providers, and other differences based on  limitations in the availability and capabilities of the Uniformed  Services overseas dental treatment facilities and a particular nation's  civilian sector providers in certain areas. The Director, TRICARE  Management Activity shall issue guidance, as necessary, to implement the  provisions of this paragraph. TRDP enrollees residing in overseas  locations will be eligible for the same benefits as enrollees residing  in the continental United States, although dental services may not be  available or accessible in all locations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section or by the Assistant  Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) or designee, the TRDP is  administered in a manner similar to the TRICARE Dental Program under  Sec. 199.13 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The TRDP shall be administered through a contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as may be specifically provided in this section, to the  extent terms defined in Sec. 199.2 and Sec. 199.13(b) are relevant to  the administration of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program, the  definitions contained in Sec. 199.2 and Sec. 199.13(b) shall apply to  the TRDP as they do to TRICARE/CHAMPUS and the TRICARE Dental Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eligibility and enrollment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligibility. Enrollment in the  TRICARE Retiree Dental Program is open to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Members of the Uniformed Services who are entitled to retired  pay, or former members of the armed forces who are Medal of Honor  recipients and who are not otherwise entitled to dental benefits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Members of the Retired Reserve under the age of 60;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Eligible dependents of a member described in paragraph  (d)(1)(i) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section who are covered by the  enrollment of the member;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)(A)</em>, (B), or (C)  of this section at the time of application for enrollment of their  dependents under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The member is enrolled under Section 1705 of Title 38, United  States Code, to receive ongoing, comprehensive dental care from the  Department of Veterans Affairs pursuant to Section 1712 of Title 38,  United States Code, and 38 CFR 17.93, 17.161, or 17.166. Authorization  of such dental care must be confirmed in writing by the Department of  Veterans Affairs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The member is enrolled in a dental plan that is available to the  member as a result of employment of the member that is separate from the  Uniformed Service of the member, and the dental plan is not available to  dependents of the member as a result of such   separate employment by the member. Enrollment in this dental plan and  the exclusion of dependents from enrollment in the plan must be  confirmed by documentation from the member's employer or the dental  plan's administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The member is prevented by a current and enduring medical or  dental condition from being able to obtain benefits under the TRDP. The  specific medical or dental condition and reason for the inability to use  the program's benefits over time, if not apparent based on the  condition, must be documented by the member's physician or dentist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The unremarried surviving spouse and eligible child dependents  of a deceased member who died while in status described in paragraph  (d)(1)(i) or paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section; the unremarried  surviving spouse and eligible child dependents who receive a surviving  spouse annuity; or the unremarried surviving spouse and eligible child  dependents of a deceased member who died while on active duty for a  period of more than 30 days and whose eligible dependents are not  eligible or no longer for the TRICARE Dental Program.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraphs (d)(1)(iii), (d)(1)(iv), and (d)(1)(v):</p><p class="depth0">Eligible dependents of Medal of Honor recipients are described in  Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(i) (except for former spouses) and Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii)  (except for a child placed in legal custody of a Medal of Honor  recipient under Sec. 199.3(b)(2)(ii)(H)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notification of eligibility. The contractor will notify persons  eligible to receive dental benefits under the TRICARE Retiree Dental  Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Election of coverage. In order to initiate dental coverage,  election to enroll must be made by the member or eligible dependent.  Enrollment in the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program is voluntary and will  be accomplished by submission of an application to the TRDP contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Enrollment periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enrollment period for basic benefits.  The initial enrollment for the basic dental benefits described in  paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall be for a period of 24 months  followed by month-to-month enrollment as long as the enrollee remains  eligible and chooses to continue enrollment. An enrollee's disenrollment  from the TRDP at any time for any reason, including termination for  failure to pay premiums, is subject to a lockout period of 12 months.  After any lockout period, eligible individuals may elect to reenroll and  are subject to a new initial enrollment period. The enrollment periods  and conditions stipulated in this paragraph apply only to the basic  benefit coverage described in paragraph (f)(1) of this section.  Effective with the implementation of an enhanced benefit program, new  enrollments for basic coverage will cease. Enrollees in the basic  program at that time may continue their enrollment for basic coverage,  subject to the applicable provisions of this section, as long as the  contract administering that coverage is in effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> and (B) of this section  shall incur a lockout period of 12 months before re-enrollment can  occur. Former enrollees who re-enroll following a lockout period or  following a period of disenrollment after completion of an enrollment  period must comply with all provisions that apply to new enrollees,  including a new enrollment commitment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Termination of coverage--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Involuntary termination. TRDP  coverage is terminated when the member's entitlement to retired pay is  terminated, the member's status as a member of the Retired Reserve is  terminated, a dependent child loses eligible child dependent status, or  a surviving spouse remarries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> or  (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section will not be  honored, and premiums will not be refunded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Extenuating circumstances. Under limited circumstances, TRDP  enrollees shall be disenrolled by the contractor before the completion  of an enrollment period commitment upon request by an enrollee if the  enrollee submits written, factual documentation that independently  verifies that one of the following extenuating circumstances occurred  during the enrollment period. In general, the circumstances must be  unforeseen and long-term and must have originated after the effective  date of TRDP coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The enrollee is prevented by a serious medical condition from  being able to utilize TRDP benefits,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The enrollee would suffer severe financial hardship by  continuing TRDP enrollment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any other circumstances which the Secretary considers  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date of voluntary termination. For cases determined to  qualify for disenrollment under the grace period provisions in paragraph  (d)(5)(ii)(A) of this section, enrollment is completely nullified  effective from the beginning date of coverage. For cases determined to  qualify for disenrollment under the extenuating circumstances provisions  in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(B) of this section, the effective date of  disenrollment is the first of the month following the contractor's  initial determination on the disenrollment request or the first of the  month following the last use of TRDP benefits under the enrollment,  whichever is later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Appeal process for denied voluntary enrollment termination. An  enrollee has the right to appeal the contractor's determination that a  disenrollment request does not qualify under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) or  (B) of this section. The enrollee may appeal that determination by  submitting a written appeal to the TMA, Office of Appeals and Hearings,  with a copy of the contractor's determination notice and relevant  documentation supporting the disenrollment request. This appeal must be  received by TMA within 60 days of the date on the contractor's  determination notice. The burden of proof is on the enrollee to  establish affirmatively by substantial evidence that the enrollee  qualifies to be disenrolled under paragraphs (d)(5)(ii)(A) or (B) of  this section. TMA will issue written notification to the enrollee and  the contractor of its appeal determination within 60 days from the date  of receipt of the appeal request. That determination is final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Continuation of dependents' enrollment upon death of enrollee.  Coverage of a dependent in the TRDP under an enrollment of a member or  surviving spouse who dies during the period of enrollment shall continue  until the end of that period and may be renewed by (or for) the  dependent, so long as the premium paid is sufficient to cover  continuation of the dependent's enrollment. Coverage may be terminated  when the premiums paid are no longer sufficient to cover continuation of  the enrollment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Premium payments. Persons enrolled in the dental plan will be  responsible for paying the full cost of the premiums in order to obtain  the dental insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Premium payment method. The premium payment may be collected  pursuant to procedures established by the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Health Affairs) or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effects of failure to make premium payments. Failure to make  premium payments will result in the enrollee's disenrollment from the  TRDP and a lockout period of 12 months. Following this period of time,  eligible individuals will be able to re-enroll.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Member's payment of premiums. The cost of the TRDP monthly  premium will be paid by the enrollee. Interested beneficiaries may  contact the dental contractor-insurer to obtain the enrollee premium  cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Plan benefits. The Director, TRICARE Management Activity, or  designee, may modify the services covered by the TRDP to the extent  determined appropriate based on developments in common dental care  practices and standard dental programs. In addition, the Director,  TRICARE Management Activity, or designee, may establish such exclusions  and limitations as are consistent with those established by dental  insurance and prepayment plans to control utilization and quality of  care for the services and items covered by the TRDP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The minimum TRDP benefit is basic dental care to include  diagnostic services, preventive services, restorative services,  endodontic services, periodontic services, oral surgery services, and  other general services. The following is the minimum TRDP covered dental  benefit:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Diagnostic services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Clinical oral examinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Radiographs and diagnostic imaging.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tests and laboratory examinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Preventive services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Dental prophylaxis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Topical fluoride treatment (office procedure).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sealants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other preventive services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Space maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Restorative services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Amalgam restorations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Resin-based composite restorations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other restorative services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Endodontic services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pulp capping.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pulpotomy and pulpectomy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Root canal therapy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Apexification and recalcification procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Apicoectomy and periradicular services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Other endodontic procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Periodontic Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Surgical services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Periodontal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Oral surgery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Extractions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Surgical extractions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Alveoloplasty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Biopsy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Other surgical procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Other general services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Palliative (emergenery) treatment of dental pain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Therapeutic drug injection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Other drugs and/or medicaments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Treatment of postsurgical complications.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 199.13 may be covered  pursuant to TRDP benefit policy decisions made by the Director,  OCHAMPUS, or designee. In general, these include additional diagnostic  and preventive services, major restorative services, prosthodontics  (removable and fixed), additional oral surgery services, orthodontics,  and additional adjunctive general services (including general anesthesia  and intravenous sedation). Enrollees in the basis plan will be given an  enrollment option at the time the enhanced plan is implemented.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Alternative course of treatment policy. The Director, TRICARE  Management Activity, or designee, may establish, in accordance with  generally accepted dental benefit practices, an alternative course of  treatment policy which provides reimbursement in instances where the  dentist and TRDP enrollee select a more expensive service, procedure, or  course of treatement than in customarily provided. The alternative  course of treatment policy must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be  consistent with sound professional standards of generally accepted  dental practice for the dental condition concerned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The service, procedure, or course of treatment must be a  generally accepted alternative for a service or procedure covered by the  TRDP for the dental condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payment for the alternative service or procedure may not  exceed the lower of the prevailing limits for the alternative procedure,  the prevailing limits or dental plan contractor's scheduled allowance  for the otherwise authorized benefit procedure for which the alternative  is substituted, or the actual charge for the alternative procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Maximum coverage amounts. Each enrollee is subject to an annual  maximum coverage amount for non-orthodontic dental benefits and, if an  orthodontic benefit is offered, a lifetime maximum coverage amount for  orthodontics as established by the Director, TRICARE Management  Activity, or designee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Annual notification of rates. TRDP premiums will be determined  as part of the competitive contracting process. Information on the  premium rates will be widely distributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Authorized providers. The TRDP enrollee may seek covered  services from any provider who is fully licensed and approved to provide  dental care in the state where the provider is located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Benefit payment. Enrollees are not required to utilize the  special network of dental providers established by the TRDP contractor.  For enrollees who do use these network providers, however, providers  shall not balance bill any amount in excess of the maximum payment  allowable by the TRDP. Enrollees using non-network providers may balance  billed amounts in excess of allowable charges. The maximum payment  allowable by the TRDP (minus the appropriate cost-share) will be the  lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Billed charges; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Usual, Customary and Reasonable rates, in which the customary  rate is calculated at the 50th percentile of billed charges in that  geographic area, as measured in an undiscounted charge profile in 1995  or later for that geographic area (as defined by three-digit zip code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Appeal procedures. All levels of appeal established by the  contractor shall be exhausted prior to an appeal being filed with the  TMA. Procedures comparable to those established for appeal of benefit  determinations under Sec. 199.10 of this part shall apply together with  the procedures for appeal of voluntary disenrollment determinations  described in paragraph (d)(5)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Preemption of State laws. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to 10 U.S.C. 1103, the  Department of Defense has determined that in the administration of  chapter 55 of title 10, U.S. Code, preemption of State and local laws  relating to health insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care  delivery or financing methods is necessary to achieve important Federal  interests, including but not limited to the assurance of uniform  national health programs for military families and the operation of such  programs at the lowest possible cost to the Department of Defense, that  have a direct and substantial effect on the conduct of military affairs  and national security policy of the United States. This determination is  applicable to the dental services contracts that implement this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Based on the determination set forth in paragraph (l)(1) of this  section, any State or local law or regulation pertaining to health or  dental insurance, prepaid health or dental plans, or other health or  dental care delivery, administration, and financing methods is preempted  and does not apply in connection with the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program  contract. Any such law, or regulation pursuant to such law, is without  any force or effect, and State or local governments have no legal  authority to enforce them in relation to the TRICARE Retiree Dental  Program contract. (However, the Department of Defense may, by contract,  establish legal obligations on the part of the TRICARE Retiree Dental  Program contractor to conform with requirements similar to or identical  to requirements of State or local laws or regulations).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The preemption of State and local laws set forth in paragraph  (l)(2) of this section includes State and local laws imposing premium  taxes on health or dental insurance carriers or underwriters or other  plan managers, or   similar taxes on such entities. Such laws are laws relating to health  insurance, prepaid health plans, or other health care delivery or  financing methods, within the meaning of section 1103. Preemption,  however, does not apply to taxes, fees, or other payments on net income  or profit realized by such entities in the conduct of business relating  to DoD health services contracts, if those taxes, fees or other payments  are applicable to a broad range of business activity. For the purposes  of assessing the effect of Federal preemption of State and local taxes  and fees in connection with DoD health and dental services contracts,  interpretations shall be consistent with those applicable to the Federal  Employees Health Benefits Program under 5 U.S.C. 8909(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Administration. The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health  Affairs) or designee may establish other rules and procedures for the  administration of the TRICARE Retiree Dental Program.  [62 FR 66993, Dec. 23, 1997, as amended at 65 FR 48913, Aug. 10, 2000;  65 FR 49492, Aug. 14, 2000; 66 FR 9658, Feb. 9, 2001; 67 FR 4354, Jan.  30, 2002; 67 FR 15725, Apr. 3, 2002; 72 FR 54213, Sept. 24, 2007; 72 FR  64537, Nov. 16, 2007; 73 FR 59504, Oct. 9, 2008]</p>
