Where the amount of any bond  is no longer sufficient and the bond is in less than the maximum amount,  the manufacturer shall immediately file a strengthening or superseding  bond as required by this subpart. The amount of any such bond (or the  total amount including strengthening bonds, if any) need not exceed  $250,000 for a manufacturer producing or receiving cigarettes in bond;  need not exceed $150,000 for a manufacturer producing or receiving  cigars, smokeless tobacco, pipe tobacco, or roll-your-own tobacco in  bond; and need not exceed $250,000 for a manufacturer producing or  receiving any combination of tobacco products in bond. The bond of a  manufacturer of tobacco products shall in no case be less than $1,000.  [T.D. ATF-232, 51 FR 28080, Aug. 5, 1986; T.D. ATF-243, 51 FR 43194,  Dec. 1, 1986, as amended by T.D.
