A digital low power television or television translator station which is causing or receiving interference or is predicted to cause or receive interference to or from an authorized TV broadcast station, DTV station or allotment or other protected station or service, may at any time file a displacement relief application for change in channel, together with technical modifications

that are necessary to avoid interference or continue serving the station's protected service area, provided the proposed transmitter site is not located more than 30 miles from the reference coordinates of the existing station's community of license. See Sec.  76.53 of this chapter. A displacement relief application shall be filed on FCC Form 346 and will be considered a minor change and will be placed on public notice for a period of not less than 30 days to permit the filing of petitions to deny. These applications will not be subject to the filing of competing applications. Where a displacement relief application for a digital low power television or television translator station becomes mutually exclusive the application(s) for new analog or digital low power television or television translator stations, with a displacement relief application for an analog low power television or television translator station, or with other non-displacement relief applications for facilities modifications of analog or digital low power television or television translator stations, priority will be afforded to the displacement application for the digital low power television or television translator station to the exclusion of other applications. Mutually exclusive displacement relief applications for digital low power television and television translator stations shall be resolved via the Commission's part 1 and broadcast competitive bidding rules, Sec.  1.2100 et seq., and Sec.  73.5000 et seq. of this chapter.

(i) An application for a replacement digital television translator may be filed at any time. A license for a replacement digital television translator will be issued only to a television broadcast station licensee that demonstrates in its application that a portion of the station's pre-transition analog service area will not be served by its full, post-transition digital facilities and that the proposed translator will be used to provide service to the area where service has been lost.'' Replacement digital television translators may operate on channels 2-51. Applications for replacement digital television translator shall be given processing priority over all other low power television and TV translator applications except displacement applications (with which they shall have co-equal priority) as set forth in 47 CFR 73.3572(a)(4)(ii). The service area of the replacement translator shall be limited to only a demonstrated loss area within the full-service station's pre-transition analog service area. ``Analog service area'' is defined as the existing, authorized, protected service area actually served by the analog signal prior to analog termination for the DTV transition. An applicant for a replacement digital television translator may propose a de minimis expansion of its full-service pre-transition analog service area upon demonstrating that the expansion is necessary to replace its analog loss area. The license for the replacement digital television translator will be associated with the full power station's main license, will be assigned the same call sign, may not be separately assigned or transferred, and will be renewed with the full-service station's main license.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An application for a replacement digital television translator may be filed at any time.

Low power television and TV translator stations operating analog (NTSC) or digital facilities above Channel 51 that have not submitted a digital displacement application by 11:59 pm local time on September 1, 2011 will be required to cease operations altogether by December 31, 2011. These stations' authorization for facilities above Channel 51 shall be cancelled. Any digital displacement application submitted by a low power television or TV translator station operating analog (NTSC) or digital facilities above Channel 51 that is submitted after 11:59 pm local time on September 1, 2011 will be dismissed. In addition, any outstanding construction permit (analog or digital) for an channel above Channel 51 will be rescinded on December 31, 2011, and any pending application (analog or digital) for a channel above Channel 51 will be dismissed on December 31, 2011, if the permittee has not submitted a digital displacement application by 11:59 pm local on September 1, 2011.
