                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each owner or operator using a control device to comply with  Sec. 63.126(b)(1) or (b)(2) of this subpart shall keep the following up- to-date, readily accessible records:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> While the transfer vent stream is being vented to the control  device, continuous records of the equipment operating parameters  specified to be monitored under Sec. 63.127 of this subpart, and listed  in table 7 of this subpart or specified by the Administrator in  accordance with Secs. 63.127(c) and 63.129(b). For flares, the hourly  records and records of pilot flame outages specified in table 7 shall be  maintained in place of continuous records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For flares, records of the times and duration of all periods  during which the pilot flame is absent shall be kept rather than daily  averages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If carbon adsorber regeneration stream flow and carbon bed  regeneration temperature are monitored, the records specified in table 7  of this subpart shall be kept instead of the daily averages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Records of the duration of all periods when the vent stream is  diverted through by-pass lines shall be kept rather than daily averages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For boilers or process heaters, records of any changes in the  location at which the vent stream is introduced into the flame zone as  required under the reduction of total organic HAP emissions in  Sec. 63.126(b)(1) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a vapor collection system containing valves that could divert  the emission stream away from the control device is used, each owner or  operator of a Group 1 transfer rack subject to   the provisions of Sec. 63.127(d) of this subpart shall keep up-to-date,  readily accessible records of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> was operating and whether a diversion was detected at  any time during the hour, as well as records of the times of all periods  when the vent stream is diverted from the control device or the flow  indicator is not operating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>,  hourly records of flow are not required. In such cases, the owner or  operator shall record that the monthly visual inspection of the seals or  closure mechanisms has been done, and shall record the occurrence of all  periods when the seal mechanism is broken, the by-pass line valve  position has changed, or the key for a lock-and-key type lock has been  checked out, and records of any car-seal that has broken, as listed in  table 7 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of a Group 1 transfer rack who uses a  flare to comply with Sec. 63.126(b)(2) of this subpart shall keep up-to- date, readily accessible records of the flare pilot flame monitoring  specified under Sec. 63.127(a)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator of a transfer rack subject to the  requirements of Sec. 63.126 of this subpart shall submit to the  Administrator Periodic Reports of the following information according to  the schedule in Sec. 63.152(c) of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reports of daily average values of monitored parameters for all  operating days when the daily average values were outside the range  established in the Notification of Compliance Status or operating  permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)(A)</em> of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reports of the times and durations of all periods recorded under  paragraph (b)(1) of this section when the vent stream was diverted from  the control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reports of all times recorded under paragraph (b)(2) of this  section when maintenance is performed on car-sealed valves, when the car  seal is broken, when the by-pass line valve position is changed, or the  key for a lock-and-key type configuration has been checked out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reports of the times and durations of all periods recorded under  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section in which all pilot flames of a flare  were absent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reports of all carbon bed regeneration cycles during which the  parameters recorded under paragraph (a)(2)(vi) of this section were  outside the ranges established in the Notification of Compliance Status  or operating permit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of this subpart, has been performed. Various  methods for the record of verification can be used, such as: A check off  on a log sheet; a list of DOT serial numbers or Method 27 data; or a  position description for gate security, showing that the security guard  will not allow any trucks on site that do not have the appropriate  documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(3)</em> of this section in a readily accessible  location on site:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An analysis demonstrating the design and actual annual  throughput of the transfer rack;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An analysis documenting the weight-percent organic HAP's in the  liquid loaded. Examples of acceptable documentation include but are not  limited to analyses of the material and engineering calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An analysis documenting the annual rack weighted average HAP  partial pressure of the transfer rack.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For Group 2 transfer racks that are limited to transfer of  organic HAP's with partial pressures less than 10.3 kilopascals,  documentation is required of the organic HAP's (by compound) that are  transferred. The rack weighted average partial pressure does not need to  be calculated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For racks transferring one or more organic HAP's with partial  pressures greater than 10.3 kilopascals, as well as one or more organic  HAP's with partial pressures less than 10.3 kilopascals, a rack weighted  partial pressure shall be documented. The rack weighted average HAP  partial pressure shall be weighted by the annual throughput of each  chemical transferred.
