On those tracts where payments have been made pursuant to part 134 of this chapter, annual assessments beginning with the year 1957 at the rate of $0.42 per acre will be made until the entire cost of $16.7535 per acre shall have been repaid

to the United States Treasury. Landowners may pay at any time the total of the then remaining indebtedness. Under the act of March 10, 1928 (45 Stat. 210) the unpaid charges stand as a lien against the lands until paid.
