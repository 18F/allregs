                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Equal rights. Every member of a labor organization shall have  equal rights and privileges within such organization to nominate  candidates, to vote in elections or referendums of the labor  organization, to attend membership meetings and to participate in the  deliberations and voting upon the business of such meetings, subject to  reasonable rules and regulations in such organization's constitution and  bylaws.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Freedom of speech and assembly. Every member of any labor  organization shall have the right to meet and assemble freely with other  members; and to express any views, arguments or opinions; and to express  at meetings of the labor organization his views upon candidates in an  election of the labor organization or upon any business properly before  the meeting, subject to the organization's established and reasonable  rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings: Provided, That nothing  herein shall be construed to impair the right of a labor organization to  adopt and enforce reasonable rules as to the responsibility of every  member toward the organization as an institution and to his refraining  from conduct that would interfere with its performance of its legal or  contractual obligations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dues, initiation fees, and assessments. Except in the case of a  federation of national or international labor organizations, the rates  of dues and initiation fees payable by members of any labor organization  in effect on the date this section is published shall not be increased,  and no general or special assessment shall be levied upon such members,  except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a local organization, (A) by majority vote by  secret ballot of the members in good standing voting at a general or  special membership meeting, after reasonable notice of the intention to  vote upon such question, or (B) by majority vote of the members in good  standing voting in a membership referendum conducted by secret ballot;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a labor organization, other than a local labor  organization or a federation of national or international labor  organizations, (A) by majority vote of the delegates voting at a regular  convention, or at a special convention of such labor organization held  upon not less than 30 days written notice to the principal office of  each local or constituent labor organization entitled to such notice, or  (B) by majority vote of the members in good standing of such labor  organization voting in a membership referendum conducted by secret  ballot, or (C) by majority vote of the members of the executive board or  similar governing body of such labor organization, pursuant to express  authority contained in the constitution and bylaws of such labor  organization: Provided, That such action on the part of the executive  board or similar governing body shall be effective only until the next  regular convention of such labor organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Protection of the right to sue. No labor organization shall  limit the right of any member thereof to institute an action in any  court, or in a proceeding before any administrative agency, irrespective  of whether or not the labor organization or its officers are named as  defendants or respondents in such action or proceedings, or the right of  any   member of a labor organization to appear as a witness in any judicial,  administrative, or legislative proceeding, or to petition any  legislature or to communicate with any legislator: Provided, That any  such member may be required to exhaust reasonable hearing procedures  (but not to exceed a 4-month lapse of time) within such organization,  before instituting legal or administrative proceedings against such  organizations or any officer thereof.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Safeguards against improper disciplinary action. No member of  any labor organization may be fined, suspended, expelled, or otherwise  disciplined, except for nonpayment of dues by such organization or by  any officer thereof unless such member has been (i) served with written  specific charges; (ii) given a reasonable time to prepare his defense;  (iii) afforded a full and fair hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any provision of the constitution and bylaws of any labor  organization which is inconsistent with the provisions of this section  shall not be a defense to any proceeding instituted against the labor  organization under this part or under the CSRA or FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing contained in this section shall limit the rights and  remedies of any member of a labor organization under any State or  Federal law or before any court or other tribunal, or under the  constitution and bylaws of any labor organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It shall be the duty of the secretary or corresponding principal  officer of each labor organization, in the case of a local labor  organization, to forward a copy of each agreement made by such labor  organization with an agency, Department or activity to any employee who  requests such a copy and whose rights as such employee are directly  affected by such agreement, and in the case of a labor organization  other than a local labor organization, to forward a copy of any such  agreement to each constituent unit which has members directly affected  by such agreement; and such officer shall maintain at the principal  office of the labor organization of which he is an officer, copies of  any such agreement made or received by such labor organization, which  copies shall be available for inspection by any member or by any  employee whose rights are affected by such agreement. An employee's  rights under this paragraph shall be enforceable in the same manner as  the rights of a member.  [45 FR 15158, Mar. 7, 1980.
