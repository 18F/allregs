                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board makes disability decisions for claims of disability under the Railroad Retirement Act. These decisions are based either on the rules contained in the Board's regulations in this part or the rules contained in the regulations of the Social Security Administration, whichever is controlling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A disability decision is made only if the claimant meets other basic eligibility requirements for the specific disability benefit for which he or she is applying. For example, a claimant for an occupational disability annuity must first meet the eligibility requirements for that annuity, as explained in part 216 of this chapter, in order for the Board to make a disability decision.</p>
