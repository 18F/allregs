                                Sec. 24.304  Chaptalization (Brix adjustment) and amelioration record.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A proprietor who chaptalizes juice or ameliorates juice  or wine, or both, shall maintain a record of the operation and the  transaction date. Records will be maintained for each kind of wine  produced (grape, apple, strawberry, etc.). No form of record is  prescribed, but the record maintained will contain the information  necessary to enable appropriate TTB officers to readily determine  compliance with chaptalization and amelioration limitations. All   quantities will be recorded in wine gallons, and, where sugar is used,  the quantity will be determined either by measuring the increase in  volume or, for pure dry sugar by considering that each 13.5 pounds  results in a volumetric increase of one gallon. If grape juice is  chaptalized and subsequently this juice or wine is ameliorated, the  quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice will be included as  ameliorating material. If fruit juice other than grape is chaptalized  and this juice or wine is ameliorated, the quantity of pure dry sugar  added for chaptalization is not considered ameliorating material;  however, if liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup is used, the quantity of  water in such sugar is included as ameliorating material. The record  will include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The volume of juice (exclusive of pulp) deposited in fermenters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The maximum volume of ameliorating material to which the juice  is entitled, as provided in Sec. 24.178;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The volume of ameliorating or chaptalizing material used; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The volume of material authorized but not yet used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supporting records. The amelioration record will show the basis  for entries and calculations, including determination of the natural  fixed acid level and total solids content of juice, as applicable. The  records are maintained on the basis of annual accounting periods, with  each period commencing on July 1 of a year and ending on the following  June 30, except the record for an accounting period may be continued  after June 30, where the juice or wine included therein is to be held  after that date for completion. When the amelioration of wine included  in the record for one accounting period is complete, the record is  closed and any unused ameliorating material may not be used. The  proprietor may mix wines before amelioration of the wine is completed;  however, the proprietor shall additionally maintain records necessary to  establish the quantity of unused authorized material to which the  resultant mixture would be entitled so that appropriate TTB officers may  readily ascertain compliance with amelioration limitations.  (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended 1385, as amended  (26 U.S.C. 5367, 5384))  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  1512-0298)  [T.D.
