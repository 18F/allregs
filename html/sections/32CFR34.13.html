                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acceptable contributions. All contributions, including cash  contributions and third party in-kind contributions, shall be accepted  as part of the recipient's cost sharing or matching when such  contributions meet all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are verifiable from the recipient's records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They are not included as contributions for any other federally- assisted project or program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> They are necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient  accomplishment of project or program objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> They are allowable under Sec. 34.17.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> They are not paid by the Federal Government under another award,  except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Costs that are authorized by Federal statute to be used for cost  sharing or matching; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Independent research and development (IR&D;) costs. In  accordance with the for-profit cost principle in 48 CFR 31.205-18(e),  use of IR&D; as cost sharing is permitted, whether or not the Government  decides at a later date to reimburse any of the IR&D; as allowable  indirect costs. In such cases, the IR&D; must meet all of the criteria in  paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) and (a) (6) through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> They are provided for in the approved budget, when approval of  the budget is required by the DoD Component.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If they are real property or equipment, whether purchased with  recipient's funds or donated by third parties, they must have the grants  officer's prior approval if the contributions' value is to exceed  depreciation or use charges during the project period (paragraphs (b)(1)  and (b)(4)(ii) of this section discuss the limited circumstances under  which a grants officer may approve higher values). If a DoD Component  requires approval of a recipient's budget (see paragraph (a)(6) of this  section), the grants officer's approval of the budget satisfies this  prior approval requirement, for real property or equipment items listed  in the budget.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> They conform to other provisions of this part, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Valuing and documenting contributions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Valuing recipient's  property or services of recipient's employees. Values shall be  established in accordance with the applicable cost principles in  Sec. 34.17, which means that amounts chargeable to the project are  determined on the basis of costs incurred. For real property or  equipment used on the project, the cost principles authorize  depreciation or use charges. The full value of the item may be applied  when the item will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully  depreciated by the end of the award. In cases where the full value of a  donated capital asset is to be applied as cost sharing or matching, that  full value shall be the lesser of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The certified value of the remaining life of the property  recorded in the recipient's accounting records at the time of donation;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The current fair market value. However, when there is  sufficient justification, the grants officer may approve the use of the  current fair market value of the donated property, even if it exceeds  the certified value at the time of donation to the project. The grants  officer may accept the use of any reasonable basis for determining the  fair market value of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Valuing services of others' employees. When an employer other  than the recipient furnishes the services of an employee, those services  shall be valued at the employee's regular rate of pay plus an amount of  fringe benefits and overhead (at an overhead rate appropriate for the  location where the services are performed) provided these services are  in the same skill for which the employee is normally paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Valuing volunteer services. Volunteer services furnished by  professional and technical personnel, consultants, and other skilled and  unskilled labor may be counted as cost sharing or matching if the  service is an integral and necessary part of an approved project or  program. Rates for volunteer services shall be consistent with those  paid for similar work in the recipient's organization. In those  instances in which the required skills are not found in the recipient  organization, rates shall be consistent with those paid for similar work  in the labor market in which the recipient competes for the kind of  services involved. In either case, paid fringe benefits that are  reasonable, allowable, and allocable may be included in the valuation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Valuing property donated by third parties. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Donated supplies  may include such items as office supplies or laboratory supplies. Value  assessed to donated supplies included in the cost sharing or matching  share shall be reasonable and shall not exceed the fair market value of  the property at the time of the donation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Normally only depreciation or use charges for equipment and  buildings may be applied. However, the fair rental charges for land and  the full value of equipment or other capital assets may be allowed, when  they will be consumed in the performance of the award or fully  depreciated by the end of the award, provided that the grants officer  has approved the charges. When use charges are applied, values shall be  determined in accordance with the usual accounting policies of the  recipient, with the following qualifications:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The value of donated space shall not exceed the fair rental  value of comparable space as established by an independent appraisal of  comparable space and facilities in a privately-owned building in the  same locality.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The value of loaned equipment shall not exceed its fair rental  value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Documentation. The following requirements pertain to the  recipient's supporting records for in-kind contributions from third  parties:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Volunteer services shall be documented and, to the extent  feasible, supported by the same methods used by the recipient for its  own employees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for determining the valuation for personal services  and property shall be documented.</p>
