                                Sec. 40.195  What happens when an individual is unable to provide areturn-to-duty test because of a permanent or long-term medical condition?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section concerns a situation in which an employee has a medical condition that precludes him or her from providing a sufficient specimen for a pre-employment follow-up or return-to-duty test and the condition involves a permanent or long-term disability. As the MRO in this situation, you must do the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must determine if there is clinical evidence that the individual is an illicit drug user. You must make this determination by personally conducting, or causing to be conducted, a medical evaluation and through consultation with the employee's physician and/or the physician who conducted the evaluation under Sec. 40.193(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you do not personally conduct the medical evaluation, you must ensure that one is conducted by a licensed physician acceptable to you.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, the MRO or the physician conducting the evaluation may conduct an alternative test (e.g., blood) as part of the medically appropriate procedures in determining clinical evidence of drug use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the medical evaluation reveals no clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a negative test with written notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under Sec. 40.193(d) and any further medical examination. This report must state the basis for the determination that a permanent or long-term medical condition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and for the determination that no signs and symptoms of drug use exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Check ``Negative'' (Step 6) on the CCF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sign and date the CCF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the medical evaluation reveals clinical evidence of drug use, as the MRO, you must report the result to the employer as a cancelled test with written notations regarding results of both the evaluation conducted under Sec. 40.193(d) and any further medical examination. This report must state that a permanent or long-term medical condition exists, making provision of a sufficient urine specimen impossible, and state the reason for the determination that signs and symptoms of drug use exist. Because this is a cancelled test, it does not serve the purposes of a negative test (i.e., the employer is not authorized to allow the employee to begin or resume performing safety-sensitive functions, because a negative test is needed for that purpose).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this section, permanent or long-term medical conditions are those physiological, anatomic, or psychological abnormalities documented as being present prior to the attempted collection, and considered not amenable to correction or

cure for an extended period of time, if ever.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Examples would include destruction (any cause) of the glomerular filtration system leading to renal failure; unrepaired traumatic disruption of the urinary tract; or a severe psychiatric disorder focused on genito-urinary matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acute or temporary medical conditions, such as cystitis, urethritis or prostatitis, though they might interfere with collection for a limited period of time, cannot receive the same exceptional consideration as the permanent or long-term conditions discussed in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.
