In such cases the position of ``Construction Certifier'' shall be filled by more than one engineer. This official is responsible for certifying that the construction complies with all technical and code requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The ``Certification Coordinator'' shall administer the certification program and serve as the official point of contact for RUS. The certifying officer or construction certifier may also serve as the certification coordinator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification borrowers, shall submit and obtain RUS approval of a work plan before construction and related engineering begin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The work plan shall provide a description of the proposed construction and methods of purchasing in such detail as to enable RUS to monitor the

The approvals noted in Sec. 1753.93(a)(1), (4) and (5) will be reported immediately to RUS using RUS Form 158. Approval of closeouts, Sec. 1753.93(a) (6) and (7), will be reported immediately on RUS Form 159.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As the construction program progresses, the certification borrower shall request, by letter, RUS approval of any significant changes in work plan schedules and budgets and in certification officials.</p>
