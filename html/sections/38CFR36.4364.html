                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Expandable condominiums. The following policies apply to  condominium regimes which may be increased in size by the declarant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The declarant's right to expand the regime must be fully  described in the declaration. The declaration must contain provisions  adequate to ensure that future improvements to the condominium will be  consistent with initial improvements in terms of quality of  construction. The declarant must build each phase in accordance with an   approved general plan for the total development (Sec. 36.4361(d)(2))  supported by detailed plats and plans of each phase prior to the  construction of the particular phase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The reservation of a right to expand the condominium regime, the  method of expansion and the result of an expansion must not affect the  statutory validity of the condominium regime or the validity of title to  the units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The declaration or equivalent document must contain a covenant  that the condominium regime may not be amended or merged with a  successor condominium regime without prior written approval of the  Secretary. The declarant may have the proposed legal documentation to  accomplish the merger reviewed prior to recordation. However, the  Secretary's final approval of the merger will not be granted until the  successor condominium has been legally established and construction  completed. The declarant may add phases to an expandable condominium  regime without the prior approval of the Secretary if the phasing  implements a previously approved general plan for the total development.  A copy of the amendment to the declaration or other annexation document  which adds each phase must be submitted to the Secretary in accordance  with Sec. 36.4365(b)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Liens arising in connection with the declarant's ownership of,  and construction of improvements upon, the property to be added must not  adversely affect the rights of existing unit owners, or the priority of  first mortgages on units in the existing condominium property. All  taxes, assessments, mechanic's liens, and other charges affecting such  property, covering any period prior to the addition of the property,  must be paid or otherwise satisfactorily provided for by the declarant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The declarant must purchase (at declarant's own expense) a  general liability insurance policy in an amount not less than $1 million  for each occurrence, to cover any liability which owners of previously  sold units are exposed to as a result of further condominium project  development.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Each expandable project shall have a specified maximum number of  units which will give each unit owner a minimum percentage of interest  in the common elements. Each project shall also have a specified minimum  number of units which will give each unit owner a maximum percentage of  interest in the common elements. The minimum number of units to be built  should be that which would be adequate to reasonably support the common  elements. The maximum number of units to be built should be that which  would not overload the capacity of the common facilities. The maximum  possible percentage(s) and the minimum possible percentage(s) of  undivided interest in the common elements for each type of unit must be  stated in the declaration or equivalent document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The declaration or equivalent document shall set forth clearly  the basis for reallocation of unit owner's ownership interests, common  expense liabilities and voting rights in the event the number of units  in the condominium is increased. Such reallocation shall be according to  the applicable criteria set forth in Sec. Sec. 36.4361(b) and  36.4362(c)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The declarant's right to expand the condominium must be for a  reasonable period of time with a specific ending date. The maximum  acceptable period will usually be from 5 to 7 years after the date of  recording the declaration. On a case basic, longer periods of expansion  rights will be acceptable, particularly in circumstances involving  sizable condominium developments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Series projects. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each phase in the series approach is to be  considered as a separate project. A separate set of legal documents must  be filed for each phase or project that relates to the condominium  within its own boundary. The declaration for each phase must describe  the particular project as a part of the whole development area, but  subject only the one phase to the condominium regime. A separate unit  ratio must be established that would relate each unit to all units of  the particular condominium for purposes of ownership in the common  areas, voting   rights and assessment liability. A separate association may be created  to govern the affairs of each condominium. Each phase is subject to a  separate presale requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of proposed projects, or projects under  construction, the declaration should state the number of total units  that the developer intends to build on other sections of the development  area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em>, 3710(a)(6))  (The Office of Management and Budget has approved the information  collection requirements of this section under control number 2900-0448)  [73 FR 6310, Feb. 1, 2008. Redesignated at 75 FR 33705, June 15, 2010,  as amended at 80 FR 34319, June 16, 2015]</p>
