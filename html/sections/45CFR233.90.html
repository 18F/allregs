                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> State plan requirements. A State plan under title IV-A of the  Social Security Act shall provide that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental  support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home,  or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, or (if the State plan  includes such cases) the unemployment of his or her parent who is the  principal earner will be made only in relation to the child's natural or  adoptive parent, or in relation to the child's stepparent who is  married, under State law, to the child's natural or adoptive parent and  is legally obligated to support the child under State law of general  applicability which requires stepparents to support stepchildren to the  same extent that natural or adoptive parents are required to support  their children. Under this requirement, the inclusion in the family, or  the presence in the home, of a ``substitute parent'' or ``man-in-the- house'' or any individual other than one described in this paragraph is  not an acceptable basis for a finding of ineligibility or for assuming  the availability of income by the State; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where it has reason to believe that a child receiving aid is in  an unsuitable environment because of known or suspected instances of  physical or mental injury, sexual abuse or exploitation, or negligent  treatment or maltreatment of such child, under circumstances which  indicate the child's health or welfare is threatened, the State or local  agency will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bring such condition to the attention of a court, law- enforcement agency, or other appropriate agency in the State, providing  whatever data it has with respect to the situation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In reporting such conditions, use the same criteria as are used  in the State for all other parents and children; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cooperate with the court or other agency in planning and  implementing action in the best interest of the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions for plan approval. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A child may not be denied AFDC  either initially or subsequently ``because of the conditions of the home  in which the child resides'', or because the home is considered  ``unsuitable'', unless ``provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State  statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child''.  (Section 404(b) of the Social Security Act.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An otherwise eligible child who is under the age of 18 years may  not be denied AFDC, regardless of whether she attends school (unless she  is required to participate in the JOBS program pursuant to Sec. 250.30  and she is assigned to educational activities) or makes satisfactory  grades.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A state may elect to include in its AFDC program children age 18  who are full-time students in a secondary school, or in the equivalent  level of vocational or technical training, and who may reasonably be  expected to complete the program before reaching age 19.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A child may not be denied AFDC either initially or  subsequently because a parent or other caretaker relative fails to  cooperate with the child support agency in performing any of the  activities needed to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Establish the paternity of a child born out of wedlock; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Obtain support from a person having a legal duty to support the  child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any parent or caretaker relative who fails to so cooperate  shall be treated in accordance with Sec. 232.12 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> An otherwise eligible child may not be denied AFDC if a parent  is mentally or physically incapacitated as defined in paragraph  (c)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federal financial participation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Federal financial  participation under title IV-A of the Social Security Act in payments  with respect to a ``dependent child,'' as defined in section 406(a) of  the Act, is available within the following interpretations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Needy child deprived by reason of. The phrase ``needy child * *  * deprived * * * by reason of'' requires that both need and deprivation  of parental support or care exist in the individual case. The phrase  encompasses the situation of any child who is in need and otherwise  eligible, and whose parent--father or mother--either has died, has a  physical or mental incapacity, or is continually absent from the home.  This interpretation is equally applicable whether the parent was the  chief bread winner or devoted himself or herself primarily to the care  of the child, and whether or not the parents were married to each other.  The determination whether a child has been deprived of parental support  or care is made in relation to the child's natural parent or, as  appropriate, the adoptive parent or stepparent described in paragraph  (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Death of a parent. If either parent of a child is deceased, the  child is deprived of parental support or care, and may, if he is in need  and otherwise eligible, be included within the scope of the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Continued absence of the parent from the home. Continued  absence of the parent from the home constitutes the reason for  deprivation of parental support or care when the parent is out of the  home, the nature of the absence is such as either to interrupt or to  terminate the parent's functioning as a provider of maintenance,  physical care, or guidance for the child, and the known or indefinite  duration of the absence precludes counting on the parent's performance  of the function of planning for the present support or care of the  child. If these conditions exist, the parent may be absent for any  reason, and may have left only recently or some time previously; except  that a parent whose absence is occasioned solely by reason of the  performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United  States (as defined in section 101(3) of Title 37, United States code) is  not considered absent from the home. A parent who is a convicted  offender but is permitted to live at home while serving a court-imposed  sentence by performing unpaid public work or unpaid community service  during the workday is considered absent from the home.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> ``Physical or mental incapacity''. ``Physical or mental  incapacity'' of a parent shall be deemed to exist when one parent has a  physical or mental defect, illness, or impairment. The incapacity shall  be supported by competent medical testimony and must be of such a  debilitating nature as to reduce substantially or eliminate the parent's  ability to support or care for the otherwise eligible child and be  expected to last for a period of at least 30 days. In making the  determination of ability to support, the agency shall take into account  the limited employment opportunities of handicapped individuals.  A finding of eligibility for OASDI or SSI benefits, based on disability  or blindness is acceptable proof of incapacity for AFDC purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> ``Living with [a specified relative] in a place of residence  maintained * * * as his * * * own home''. (A) A child may be considered  to meet the requirement of living with one of the relatives specified in  the Act if his home is with a parent or a person in one of the following  groups:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any blood relative, including those of half-blood, and including  first cousins, nephews, or nieces, and persons of preceding generations  as denoted by prefixes of grand, great, or great-great.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, and stepsister.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Person who legally adopt a child or his parent as well as the  natural and other legally adopted children of such persons, and other  relatives of the adoptive parents in accordance with State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Spouses of any persons named in the above groups even after the  marriage is terminated by death or divorce.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A home is the family setting maintained or in process of being  established, as evidenced by assumption and continuation of  responsibility for day to day care of the child by the relative with  whom the child is living. A home exists so long as the relative  exercises responsibility for the care and control of the child, even  though either the child or the relative is temporarily   absent from the customary family setting. Within this interpretation,  the child is considered to be ``living with'' his relative even though:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> He is under the jurisdiction of the court (e.g., receiving  probation services or protective supervision); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Legal custody is held by an agency that does not have physical  possession of the child.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Federal financial participation is available in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Initial payments made on behalf of a child who goes to live with  a relative specified in section 406(a)(1) of the Social Security Act  within 30 days of the receipt of the first payment, provided payments  are not made for concurrent period for the same child in the home of  another relative or as foster care under title IV-E;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments made for the entire month in the course of which a  child leaves the home of a specified relative, provided payments are not  made for a concurrent period for the same child in the home of another  relative or as foster care under title IV-E; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Payments made to persons acting for relatives specified in  section 406(a)(1) of the Act in emergency situations that deprive the  child of the care of the relative through whom he has been receiving  aid, for a temporary period necessary to make and carry out plans for  the child's continuing care and support.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> (A) and (B) of this section it must be  medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month  such payments are made or within the three-month period following such  month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was living  with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families  with dependent children. Federal financial participation is not  available to meet the needs of the unborn child. (Refer to Medicaid  regulations at 42 CFR 435.115 for Medicaid coverage of pregnant women.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Federal financial participation (at the 50 percent rate) is  available in any expenses incurred in establishing eligibility for AFDC,  including expenses incident to obtaining necessary information to  determine the existence of incapacity of a parent or pregnancy of a  mother.
