This program is intended to be the basis from which the hatching industry may conduct a program for the prevention and control of salmonellosis. It is intended to reduce the incidence of Salmonella organisms in day-old poultry through an effective and practical sanitation program in the hatchery. This will afford other segments of the poultry industry an opportunity to reduce

the incidence of Salmonella in their products. The following requirements must be met for a flock to be of this classification:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An Authorized Agent shall collect a minimum of five environmental samples, e.g., chick papers, hatching trays, and chick transfer devices, from the hatchery at least every 30 days. Testing must be performed at an authorized laboratory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To claim products are of this classification, all products shall be derived from a hatchery that meets the requirements of the classification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This classification may be revoked by the Official State Agency if the participant fails to follow recommended corrective measures.
