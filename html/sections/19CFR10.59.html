A written declaration of  the owner or agent of the vessel may be required in connection with the  withdrawal, certifying to the vessel's suitableness and substantial  readiness with necessary fittings, outfit, and equipment already  installed on its departure in ballast for service in a class of trade  specified in   section 309 and agreeing to notify the port director if it is laid up or  diverted from such class of trade prior to the carriage of cargo or  passengers in such trade.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A withdrawal of articles may not be made under section 309,  Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, for use on a trial or test trip of a  vessel preparatory to its actually engaging in trades.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The classes of articles which may be withdrawn as provided for  by section 309, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, include the containers  in which the articles are withdrawn and laden even though for tariff  purposes the containers are classifiable separately from their contents,  except unusual containers within the purview of General Rule of  Interpretation 5, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States  (HTSUS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For the purpose of allowing the privileges of section 309,  Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, to aircraft as provided for therein, an  aircraft shall be deemed to be a vessel within the meaning of each  provision of this section and of Sec.

Such withdrawal shall be permitted only after the approval by the  port director of a special written application, in triplicate, on  Customs Form 5125, of the withdrawer, supported by a bond on Customs  Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of  this chapter executed by the withdrawer.

(The withdrawer shall retain the triplicate copy  as evidence of consumption on board or landing under Customs  supervision.) The approval shall be subject to the further conditions  that any such withdrawn article remaining on board while the vessel is  in port shall be safeguarded in the manner and to such extent as the  district director for the port or place of arrival shall deem necessary  and that failure to comply with the conditions upon which a  conditionally free withdrawal is approved shall subject the total  quantity of withdrawn articles to the assessment and collection of an  amount equal to the duties and taxes that would have been assessed on  the entire quantity of supplies withdrawn had such supplies been  regularly entered, or withdrawn, for consumption.</p><p class="depth2">Exemption from internal-revenue tax on distilled spirits, alcohol,  wines, and beer removed from any internal-revenue bonded warehouse,  industrial alcohol premises, bonded wine cellar, or brewery; and  drawback on taxpaid distilled spirits or wines removed from an export  storage room, or on taxpaid beer removed from a brewery (or place of  storage elsewhere), for use as supplies on vessels under section 309,  Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, are governed by regulations of the  Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pursuant to section 309(d) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as  amended, the Department of Commerce has found and advised the Secretary  of the Treasury of the foreign countries which allow   privileges to aircraft registered in the United States substantially  reciprocal to those described in sections 309 and 317 of the Tariff Act  of 1930, as amended.
