Article III of the Convention on the International Regulations  for Preventing Collisons at Sea, 1972 (72 COLREGS), done at London,  October 20, 1972, as rectified by Proces-Verbal of December 1, 1973,  provides that a party may notify the Secretary-General of the  International Maritime Organization (IMO, formerly Inter-Governmental  Maritime Consultative Organization or IMCO) that it extends the  application of the Convention to territory for which it is responsible  for international relations. Since it is the intention of the United  States that the 72 COLREGS apply to all U.S. territories and possessions  to the same extent that the International Regulations for Preventing  Collisions at Sea, 1960 (60 COLREGS) (16 USC 794, TIAS 5813) previously  applied, the United States has given notice to the Secretary-General  that the provisions of the 1972 COLREGS are applicable on July 15, 1977,  to the following territories and possessions for which the United States  is responsible for international relations:  Puerto Rico Guam The Canal Zone The Virgin Islands of the United States American Samoa Midway Island Wake Island Johnston Island Palmyra Island Kingman Reef Howland Island Baker Island Jarvis Island Navassa Island</p><p class="depth0">b. In accordance with Article III, other parties to the Convention  have notified the Secretary-General that application of 72 COLREGS is  extended. These parties with their territorial extensions are listed in  Table 1.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1. Territorial Extensions of Other Parties to 72 COLREGS ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Territories to which 72</p><p class="depth0">Party to convention                 COLREGS are extended ------------------------------------------------------------------------ United Kingdom............................  Hong Kong. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Because earlier formulations of the COLREGS were not elaborated as  treaties, they came into force by the almost simultaneous enactment of  domestic legislation by the majority of maritime nations. The COLREGS  were judicially considered as being customary international law, that is  to say international law based upon the consensus of maritime nations  rather than upon an express instrument. Because 72 COLREGS was  elaborated as a treaty, and under usual treaty practice only parties are  bound, there may be a period of time after the 72 COLREGS come into  force during which the ships of a nation not party to 72 COLREGS might  not be considered as being bound to comply with the convention. While it  is most likely that the 72 COLREGS will rapidly achieve the status of  customary international law, thereby obviating any concern on the part  of the mariner as to whether a particular nation is a party, it does not  necessarily follow that the courts in all nations will apply 72 COLREGS  to the vessels of a non-party nation. In the absence of changes in their  domestic law there may be certain nations that will feel compelled to  continue 60 COLREGS in force, despite the coming into force of 72  COLREGS.</p><p class="depth0">The following nations are Contracting Parties for which 72 COLREGS  will apply upon the Convention's entry into force:  Algeria Bahamas Belgium Brazil Bulgaria Canada Denmark Finland France German Democratic Republic Germany, Federal Republic Ghana Greece Hungary Iceland India Liberia Mexico Monaco Netherlands New Zealand Nigeria Norway Papua New Guinea Poland Romania South Africa Spain Sweden Switzerland Syrian Arab Republic USSR United Kingdom United States Yugloslavia Zaire</p><p class="depth0">The following nations have accepted the 60 COLREGS but are not  Contracting Parties to 72 COLREGS: Argentina Australia Austria Barbados Burma China Cuba Cyprus Czechoslovakia Ecuador Egypt Fiji Gambia Indonesia Ireland Israel Italy Ivory Coast Jamaica Japan Kuwait Lebanon Libyan Arab Republic    Madagascar Maldives Morocco Oman Pakistan Paraguay Peru Philippines Portugal Republic of Korea Singapore Surinam Tonga Trinidad Tobago Tunisia Turkey United Republic of Cameroon  [CGD 77-075, 42 FR 26976, May 26, 1977.
