Those individuals identified may obtain  information for the evaluation of performance from the program office,  administrative contracting office, audit office, end users of the  product or service, and any other technical or business advisor, as  appropriate; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Address management controls and appropriate management reviews  of past performance evaluations, to include accountability for  documenting past performance on PPIRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If agency procedures do not specify the individuals responsible  for past performance evaluation duties, the contracting officer is  responsible for this function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interim evaluations may be prepared as required, in accordance  with agency procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The evaluation should include a clear, non-technical  description of the principal purpose of the contract or order. The  evaluation should reflect how the contractor performed. The evaluation  should include clear relevant information that accurately depicts the  contractor's performance, and be based on objective facts supported by  program and contract or order performance data. The evaluations should  be tailored to the contract type, size, content, and complexity of the  contractual requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation factors for each assessment shall include, at a  minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Technical (quality of product or service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cost control (not applicable for firm-fixed-price or fixed- price with economic price adjustment arrangements).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Schedule/timeliness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Management or business relations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Small business subcontracting (as applicable, see Table 42-2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other (as applicable) (e.g., late or nonpayment to  subcontractors, trafficking violations, tax delinquency, failure to  report in accordance with contract terms and conditions, defective cost  or pricing data, terminations, suspension and debarments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Evaluation factors may include subfactors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each factor and subfactor used shall be evaluated and a  supporting narrative provided. Each evaluation factor, as listed in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, shall be rated in accordance with a  five scale rating system (i.e., exceptional, very good, satisfactory,  marginal, and unsatisfactory). The ratings and narratives must reflect  the definitions in the tables 42-1 or 42-2 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the contract provides for incentive fees, the incentive- fee contract performance evaluation shall be entered into CPARS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the contract provides for award fee, the award fee-contract  performance adjectival rating as described in 16.401(e)(3) shall be  entered into CPARS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Agency evaluations of contractor performance, including both  negative and positive evaluations, prepared under this subpart shall be  provided to the contractor as soon as practicable after completion of  the evaluation. The contractor will receive a CPARS-system generated  notification when an evaluation is ready for comment. Contractors shall  be afforded up to 14 calendar days from the date of notification of  availability of the past performance evaluation to submit comments,  rebutting statements, or additional information. Agencies shall provide  for review at a level above the contracting officer to consider  disagreements between the parties regarding the evaluation. The ultimate  conclusion on the performance evaluation is a decision of the  contracting agency. Copies of the evaluation, contractor response, and  review comments, if any, shall be retained as part of the evaluation.  These evaluations may be used to support future award decisions, and  should therefore be marked ``Source Selection Information''. Evaluation  of Federal Prison Industries (FPI) performance may be used to support a  waiver request (see 8.604) when FPI is a mandatory source in accordance  with subpart 8.6. The completed evaluation shall not be released to  other than Government personnel and the contractor whose performance is  being evaluated during the period the information may be used to provide  source selection information. Disclosure of such information could cause  harm both to the commercial interest of the Government and to the  competitive position of the contractor being evaluated as well as impede  the efficiency of Government operations. Evaluations used in determining  award or incentive fee payments may also be used to satisfy the  requirements of this subpart. A copy of the annual or final past  performance evaluation shall be provided to the contractor as soon as it  is finalized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Agencies shall require frequent evaluation (e.g., monthly,  quarterly) of agency compliance with the reporting requirements in  42.1502, so agencies can readily identify delinquent past performance  reports and monitor their reports for quality control.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Agencies shall prepare and submit all past performance  evaluations electronically in the CPARS at http://www.cpars.gov. These  evaluations, including any contractor-submitted information (with  indication whether agency review is pending), are automatically  transmitted to PPIRS at http://www.ppirs.gov not later than 14 days  after the date on which the contractor is notified of the evaluation's  availability for comment. The Government shall update PPIRS with any  contractor comments provided after 14 days, as well as any subsequent  agency review of comments received. Past performance evaluations for  classified contracts and special access programs shall not be reported  in CPARS, but will be reported as stated in this subpart and in  accordance with agency procedures. Agencies shall ensure that  appropriate management and technical controls are in place to ensure  that only authorized personnel have access to the data and the  information safeguarded in accordance with 42.1503(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Agencies shall use the past performance information in PPIRS  that is within three years (six for construction and architect-engineer  contracts) of the completion of performance of the evaluated contract or  order, and information contained in the Federal Awardee Performance and  Integrity Information System (FAPIIS), e.g., terminations for default or  cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Other contractor performance information. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Agencies shall  ensure information is accurately reported in the Federal Awardee  Performance and Integrity Information System (FAPIIS) module of CPARS  within 3 calendar days after a contracting officer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Issues a final determination that a contractor has submitted  defective cost or pricing data;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Makes a subsequent change to the final determination concerning  defective cost or pricing data pursuant to 15.407-1(d);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Issues a final termination for cause or default notice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Makes a subsequent withdrawal or a conversion of a termination  for default to a termination for convenience; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Receives a final determination after an administrative  proceeding, in accordance with 22.1704(d)(1), that substantiates an  allegation of a violation of the trafficking in persons prohibitions in  22.1703(a) and 52.222-50(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Agencies shall establish CPARS focal points who will register  users to report data into the FAPIIS module of CPARS (available at  http://www.cpars.gov/, then select FAPIIS).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With regard to information that may be covered by a disclosure  exemption under the Freedom of Information Act, the contracting officer  shall follow the procedures at 9.105-2(b)(2)(iv).</p><p class="depth0">Table 42-1--Evaluation Ratings Definitions ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exceptional..............................
