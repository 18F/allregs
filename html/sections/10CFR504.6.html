                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> OFP may prohibit, by order, the use of natural gas or petroleum  as a primary energy source in existing powerplants under certain  circumstances. In the case of certifying powerplants under section 301  of the Act, as amended, the petitioner must present evidence to support  the certification, required by Sec. 504.6 (c), (d), (e), and (f). In the  case of electing powerplants, OFP must make the following findings  required by Sec. 504.6 (c), (d), (e), and (f), in order to issue a  prohibition order to the unit, pursuant to former section 301 (b) or  (c):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The unit currently has, or previously had, the technical  capability to use an alternate fuel as a primary energy source;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The unit has this technical capability now, or it could have the  technical capability without:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A substantial physical modification of the unit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A substantial reduction in the rated capacity of the unit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It is financially feasible for the unit to use an alternate fuel  as its primary energy source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of electing powerplants, OFP must make a proposed  finding regarding the technical capability of a unit to use alternate  fuel as identified in paragraph (a) (1) of this section prior to the  date of publication of the notice of the proposed prohibition. OFP will  publish this finding in   The Federal Register along with the notice of the proposed prohibition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Technical capability. (1) In the case of electing and certifying  powerplants, OFP will consider ``technical capability'' on a case-by- case basis in order to make the required finding. In the case of a  certifying powerplant, the powerplant should present information to  support the certification relevant to the considerations set forth  below. OFP will consider the ability of the unit, from the point of fuel  intake to physically sustain combustion of a given fuel and to maintain  heat transfer. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ OFP will not ordinarily consider the nature or absence of  appurtenances outside the unit. For example, OFP will examine the  furnace configuration and ash removal capability but will not normally  consider the need to install pollution control equipment as a measure of  technical capability. Furthermore, OFP will not normally conclude that  the absence of fuel handling equipment, such as conveyor belts,  pulverizers, or unloading facilities, bears on the issue of a unit's  ``technical capability'' to burn an alternate fuel. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> OFP considers that a unit ``had'' the technical capability to  use an alternate fuel if the unit was once able to burn that fuel  (regardless of whether the unit was expressly designed to burn that fuel  or whether it ever actually did burn it), but is no longer able to do so  at the present due to temporary or permanent alterations to the unit  itself. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ For example, a unit which at one time burned solid coal but  which could no longer do so because its coal firing ports and sluicing  channels had been cemented over, would be classified as having ``had''  the technical capability to use coal. (The question of whether it again  ``could have'' such capability without ``substantial physical  modification'' is a separate and additional question.) ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A unit ``has'' the technical capability to use an alternate fuel  if it can burn an alternate fuel, notwithstanding the fact that  adjustments must be made to the unit beforehand or that pollution  control equipment may be required to meet air quality requirements. \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ A unit designed to burn natural gas shall be presumed to have  the technical capability to burn a synthetic fuel such as medium Btu gas  from coal (assuming such gas is available unless convincing evidence to  the contrary is submitted in rebuttal). Also a unit designed to burn oil  may, depending upon the chemical characteristics, be a unit that ``has''  the technical capability to burn liquefied coal. The fact that certain  adjustments may be necessary does not render this a ``hypothetical'' as  opposed to a ``real'' capability. Even an oil fired unit converting from  the use of #2 distillate to #6 residual oil may be required to adjust or  replace burner nozzles and add soot blowers. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Substantial physical modification. In the case of electing and  certifying powerplants, OFP will make its determination on whether a  physical modification to a unit is ``substantial'' on a case-by-case  basis. In the case of certifying powerplants, OFP will consider the  factors set forth below for the purpose of concurrence in the  certification. OFP will consider physical modifications made to the unit  as ``substantial'' where warranted by the magnitude and complexity of  the engineering task or where the modification would impact severely  upon operations at the site. \5\ OFP will not, however, assess physical  modification on the basis of cost. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Generally, modification of a unit to burn coal or an alternate  fuel will be considered insubstantial if significant alterations to the  boiler, such as a change to the furnace configuration or a complete  respacing of the tubes, are not required. Minor alterations such as  replacement of burners or additions of soot blowers, and additions or  alterations outside the boiler, shall not cause the modification to be  substantial. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Substantial reduction in rated capacity. In the case of electing  and certifying powerplants, OFP will make this determination on the  basis of the following factors. A certifying powerplant should present  information to support its certification regarding these factors in  order for OFP to make its review for concurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> OFP regards a unit's derating of 25 percent or more, as a result  of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, as  substantial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> OFP will presume that a derating of less than 10 percent, as a  result of converting a unit from oil or gas to an alternate fuel, is not  substantial unless   convincing evidence to the contrary is submitted in rebuttal. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ For example, units that are the subject of a prohibition order  will not have installed any operating air pollution control equipment  sufficient to burn coal in compliance with applicable environmental  equipments. The installation and use of air pollution control equipment  alone can, in many cases, produce a derating. Moreover, the shift to  coal itself will, because of differences in energy density and fuel flow  characteristics, typically involve some derating. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> OFP will assess units for which a derating is claimed of 10  percent or more, but less than 25 percent, on a case-by-case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In assessing whether a unit's derating is not substantial, OFP  will consider the impact of a reduction in rated capacity of the unit  taking into consideration all necessary appurtenances such as air  pollution control equipment required to burn an alternate fuel in  compliance with environmental requirements expected to be applicable at  the date the prohibitions contained in the final prohibition order  become effective. However, the potential order recipient may raise in  rebuttal the impact of derating on the site at which the unit is located  and on the system as well as on the unit itself, if under paragraph  (e)(2), or case-by-case, if under paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Financial feasibility. In the case of certifying and electing  powerplants, OFP will make this finding based on the following  considerations. A certifying powerplant should present information to  support its certification relevant to these considerations in order for  OFP to make its review for concurrence. Conversion of a unit to burn  coal or an alternate fuel shall be deemed financially feasible if the  firm has the actual ability to obtain sufficient capital to finance the  conversion, including all necessary land, coal and ash handling  equipment, pollution control equipment, and all other necessary  expenditures, without violating legal restrictions on its ability to  raise debt or equity capital, unreasonably diluting shareholder equity,  or unreasonably adversely affecting its credit rating. OFP will consider  any economic or financial factors presented by the proposed order  recipient in determining the firm's ability or inability to finance the  conversion including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The required coverage ratios on the firm's debt and preferred  stock;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The firm's investment program; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The financial impact of the conversion, including other  conversions which are or may be undertaken voluntarily by the proposed  order recipient or imposed upon the recipient's system by the Act, and  including pending or planned construction or reconstruction of  alternate-fuel-fired plants and plants exempt from FUA prohibitions. \7\  Where helpful in clarifying the long-term financial feasibility of a  conversion, DOE may analyze the economic benefits anticipated from  operation of the converted unit or units using coal or other alternate  fuel relative to those from continued operation using petroleum or  natural gas. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ OFP will not require the proposed order recipient to cancel or  defer construction or reconstruction of any alternate-fuel-fired  facility, or any facility exempt from the prohibitions of the Act, for  which a decision to finance such facility has been made by the  appropriate company official before the publication of the prohibition  order. The proposed order recipient may choose to cancel or defer any  such facility.
