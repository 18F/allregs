                            <p class="depth0">Under certain conditions, the proprietor must prepay the distilled  spirits tax required, using TTB F 5000.24, Excise Tax Return, before  removing spirits from the bonded premises. Those conditions are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the proprietor has not given TTB a withdrawal bond or a  unit bond;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the proprietor has posted a withdrawal or a unit bond, but  has defaulted on any payment of tax under this section, and the tax  payment remains in default. The proprietor must continue to prepay the  tax until the appropriate TTB officer decides that allowing the  proprietor to make deferred tax payments again will not jeopardize the  revenue;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the proprietor receives a notice from the appropriate TTB  officer that the tax must be prepaid. Such notice may be issued to the  proprietor if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proprietor fails to maintain records required by this part  to substantiate the correctness of its tax returns; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proprietor fails to comply with any other provision of this  part; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the proprietor's withdrawal bond, or the withdrawal  coverage under its unit bond, is for less than the maximum penal sum.  The proprietor must prepay the tax to the extent that a withdrawal would  cause the outstanding tax liability to exceed the limits of coverage  under the bond. See also Sec. 19.231 if the bond is for less than the  maximum penal sum.  (26 U.S.C. 5213, 5555)</p>
