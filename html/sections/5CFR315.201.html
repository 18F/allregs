(A) Based on a finding made before March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation if he or she was eligible to receive retroactive pay under 5 U.S.C. 5591-93 (formerly Pub. L. 80-623) or 5 U.S.C. 5594 (formerly Pub. L. 81-733).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Based on a finding made before March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation if he or she was eligible to receive retroactive pay under 5 U.S.C. 5591-93 (formerly Pub. L. 80-623) or 5 U.S.C. 5594 (formerly Pub. L. 81-733).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Based on a finding made on or after March 30, 1966, that a furlough, suspension, or separation was unwarranted or improper, an employee restored to duty receives full calendar time credit for the period of furlough, suspension, or separation for which he or she is eligible to receive back pay. If the employee is restored to duty at a date later than the original adverse action, credit for intervening periods of nonpay status or breaks in service is given in accordance with other provisions of this subsection. If the employee had been properly separated from the rolls of the agency before a finding was made that the adverse action was unwarranted or improper, the correction and additional service credit given the employee may not extend beyond the date of the proper separation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Intervening service. Certain types of service that ordinarily are not creditable are counted when they intervene between two periods of creditable service without a single break in service in excess of 30 calendar days, excepted as provided in subparagraph (H) of his paragraph. Under these conditions, credit is given for periods of service:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> In the excepted service of the Federal executive branch, including employment in nonappropriated fund positions in or under any Federal agency;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Under temporary, term, or other nonpermanent employment in the Federal competitive service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the Senior Executive Service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> In the Federal legislative branch;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> In the Federal judicial branch;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> In the armed forces;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> In the District of Columbia Government through December 31, 1979. For an employee on the District rolls on December 31, 1979, who converted on January 1, 1980, to the District independent personnel system, credit also is given for service between January 1, 1980, and September 25, 1980. Otherwise, service in the District of Columbia Government on or after January 1, 1980, is not creditable as intervening service; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Performed overseas by family members, as defined by Sec. 315.608 of this chapter. Such service is creditable toward career tenure if it intervenes between two periods of creditable service without a single break in excess of 180 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions from service requirement. The service requirement for career tenure does not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An appointment to a position required by law to be filled on a permanent basis, or a conversion under this part while the employee is serving in such a position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An appointment from a register of a person who once completed the service requirement for career tenure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An appointment under Sec. 315.601 of a former Canal Zone Merit System employee who completed the service requirement for career tenure under that system; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The reinstatement of a person who once completed the service requirement for career tenure.
