                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Included services. Subject to the conditions and limitations set  forth in this subpart and subpart D of this part, ``posthospital SNF  care'' means the following services furnished to an inpatient of a  participating SNF, or of a participating hospital or critical access  hospital (CAH) that has a swing-bed approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a  registered professional nurse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bed and board in connection with the furnishing of that nursing  care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech-language  pathology services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Medical social services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Drugs, biologicals, supplies, appliances, and equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Services furnished by a hospital with which the SNF has a  transfer agreement in effect under Sec. 483.75(n) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Other services that are generally provided by (or under  arrangements made by) SNFs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excluded services--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Services that are not considered  inpatient hospital services.

Sec. 409.21 through  409.27, only those services generally provided by (or under arrangements  made by) SNFs are considered as posthospital SNF care. For example, a  type of medical or surgical procedure that is ordinarily performed only  on an inpatient basis in a hospital is not included as ``posthospital  SNF care,'' because such procedures are not generally provided by (or  under arrangements made by) SNFs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terminology. In Sec. 409.21 through Sec. 409.36--.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The terms SNF and swing-bed hospital are used when the context  applies to the particular facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term facility is used to mean both SNFs and swing-bed  hospitals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term swing-bed hospital includes a CAH with swing-bed  approval under subpart F of part 485 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term post-hospital SNF care includes SNF care that does not  follow a hospital stay when the beneficiary is enrolled in a plan, as  defined in Sec. 422.4 of this chapter, offered by a Medicare + Choice  (M + C) organization, that includes the benefits described in Sec.  422.101(c) of this chapter.
