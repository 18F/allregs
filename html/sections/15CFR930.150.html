Effective  coastal management is fostered by ensuring that activities having such  reasonably foreseeable interstate coastal effects are conducted  consistent with the enforceable policies of the management program of  each affected State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The application of the federal consistency requirement to  activities having interstate coastal effects is addressed by this  subpart in order to encourage cooperation among States in dealing with  activities having interstate coastal effects, and to provide States,  local governments, Federal agencies, and the public with a predictable  framework for evaluating the consistency of these federal activities  under the Act.</p>
