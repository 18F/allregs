Each other interference bond

must be checked at least once each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each component that is protected from atmospheric corrosion must be inspected at intervals not exceeding 3 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a component is protected from internal corrosion, monitoring devices designed to detect internal corrosion, such as coupons or probes, must be located where corrosion is most likely to occur. However, monitoring is not required for corrosion resistant materials if the operator can demonstrate that the component will not be adversely affected by internal corrosion during its service life. Internal corrosion control monitoring devices must be checked at least two times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 7\1/2\ months.</p>
