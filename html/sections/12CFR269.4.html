                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a labor organization asserts in writing to a Bank that it holds cards requesting a representation election signed by at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in a unit which that organization considers to be an appropriate bargaining unit, the labor organization and the Bank shall each designate a representative who together shall request the American Arbitration Association (hereinafter referred to as ``Association'') to submit to them from its National Panel of Professional Labor Arbitrators a list of seven (7) impartial, qualified professional arbitrators. The two designated representatives shall meet promptly and, by alternately striking names from the list, arrive at the remaining person who, together with the two representatives, shall constitute a Special Tribunal to rule on the labor organization's request for an election. The impartial arbitrator shall always act as the Chairperson of any Special Tribunal duly constituted under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the absence of an agreement between the labor organization and the Bank on the appropriate unit, the Tribunal shall investigate the facts, hold hearings if necessary, and issue a decision as to the appropriateness of the unit for the purposes of conducting a representation election for exclusive recognition and as to related issues submitted for consideration. The expenses for this proceeding, including the fees of the association and of the arbitrator, shall be borne equally by the labor organization and the Bank. If either the Bank or the labor organization should disagree with the Special Tribunal's decision, the party in disagreement may appeal within thirty (30) calendar days to the Federal Reserve System Labor Relations Panel referred to in Sec. 269.11, and the decision of the System Panel shall be final and binding on the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there is any dispute as to whether a labor organization holds cards signed by at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in a unit claimed by a labor organization as appropriate or subsequently determined by the Special Tribunal as appropriate, the dispute shall be resolved by the Chairperson of the Special Tribunal, acting as a single impartial arbitrator. The expenses of such procedure, including the impartial arbitrator's fee, shall be borne equally by the labor organization and the Bank. The decision of the Chairperson of the Special Tribunal shall be final and binding and shall not be subject to appeal to the Federal Reserve System Labor Relations Panel.</p>
