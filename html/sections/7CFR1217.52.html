                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board's programs and expenses shall be paid by assessments  on manufacturers for the U.S. market, other income of the Board, and  other funds available to the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to the exemptions specified in Sec. 1217.53, each  manufacturer for the U.S. market shall pay an assessment to the Board at  the rate of $0.35 per thousand board feet of softwood lumber except that  no person shall pay an assessment on the first 15 million board feet of  softwood lumber otherwise subject to assessment in a fiscal year.  Domestic manufacturers shall pay assessments based on the volume of  softwood lumber shipped within the United States and importers shall pay  assessments based on the volume of softwood lumber imported to the  United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At least 24 months after the Order becomes effective and  periodically thereafter, the Board shall review and may recommend to the  Secretary, upon an affirmative vote by at least two-thirds of the Board  members, a change in the assessment rate. In no event may the rate be  less than $0.35 per thousand board feet nor more than $0.50 per thousand  board feet. A change in the assessment rate is subject to rulemaking by  the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Domestic manufacturers shall remit to the Board the amount due  no later than the 30th calendar day of the month following the end of  the quarter in which the softwood lumber was shipped.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Domestic product that cannot be categorized in the Harmomized  Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS) numbers listed in paragraph  (h) of this section if it were an import is not covered under this  Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Softwood lumber originating in the United States that is  exported to another country and shipped back to the United States is  covered under this Order, provided that it can be categorized in the  HTSUS numbers listed in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each importer of softwood lumber shall pay through Customs to  the Board an assessment on softwood lumber imported into the United  States as described in section 804(a) of Title VIII of the Tariff Act of  1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1202-1683g), provided that it can be  categorized in the HTSUS numbers listed in paragraph (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The HTSUS categories and assessment rates on imported softwood  lumber are listed in the table below. A factor shall be used to  determine the equivalent volume of softwood lumber in thousand board  feet. The factor used to convert one cubic meter to one thousand board  feet is 0.423776001. Accordingly, the assessment rate per cubic meter is  as follows.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Assessment $/</p><p class="depth2">Softwood lumber                        cubic meter ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 4407.10.01..............................................         $0.1483 4409.10.05..............................................          0.1483 4409.10.10..............................................          0.1483 4409.10.20..............................................          0.1483 4409.10.90..............................................          0.1483 4418.90.25..............................................          0.1483 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the event that any HTSUS number subject to assessment is  changed and such change is merely a replacement of a previous number and  has no impact on the description of the softwood lumber involved,  assessments will continue to be collected based on the new number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> If Customs does not collect an assessment from an importer, the  importer is responsible for paying the assessment directly to the Board  no later than the 30th calendar day of the month following the end of  the quarter in which the softwood lumber was imported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Articles brought into the United States temporarily and for  which an exemption is claimed under subchapter XIII of chapter 98 of the  HTSUS are not covered under this Order. If assessments are collected by  Customs for these products, the importer may apply to the Board for a  refund of assessments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> When a domestic manufacturer or importer fails to pay the  assessment within 60 calendar days of the date it is due, the Board may  impose a late payment charge and interest. The late payment charge and  rate of interest shall be prescribed in regulations   issued by the Secretary. All late assessments shall be subject to the  specified late payment charge and interest. Persons failing to remit  total assessments due in a timely manner may also be subject to actions  under Federal debt collection procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The Board may accept advance payment of assessments from any  manufacturer for the U.S. market that will be credited toward any amount  for which that person may become liable. The Board may not pay interest  on any advance payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> If the Board is not in place by the date the first assessments  are to be collected, the Secretary shall receive assessments and shall  pay such assessments and any interest earned to the Board when it is  formed.</p>
