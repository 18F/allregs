All persons appearing in proceedings must act with integrity and in an ethical manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exclusion for misconduct. During the course of a proceeding, the judge may exclude any person--including a party or a party's attorney or non-attorney representative--for contumacious conduct such as refusal to comply with directions, continued use of dilatory tactics, refusal to adhere to reasonable standards of orderly or ethical conduct, failure to act in good faith, or violation of the prohibition against ex parte communications. The judge must state the basis for the exclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of representative's exclusion. Any representative excluded from a proceeding may appeal to the Chief Judge for reinstatement within 7 days of the exclusion. The exclusion order is reviewed for abuse of discretion. The proceeding from which the representative was excluded will not be delayed or suspended pending review by the Chief Judge, except for a reasonable delay to enable the party to obtain another representative.</p>
