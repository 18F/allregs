For reporting purposes, a multiple plaintiff suit for death or grievous  bodily injury is reportable if the suit involves three or more separate  incidents of injury. The reporting obligation arises when at least three  plaintiffs have settled their claims or when a combination of settled  claims and adjudications favorable to plaintiffs   reaches three. Multiple lawsuits arising from one incident involving the  same product only count as one lawsuit for the purposes of section 37.</p>
