Grinding mills include, but are not limited  to, the following types: Hammer, roller, rod, pebble and ball, and fluid  energy. The grinding mill includes the air conveying system, air  separator, or air classifier, where such systems are used.</p><p class="depth0">Initial crusher means any crusher into which nonmetallic minerals  can be fed without prior crushing in the plant.</p><p class="depth0">Nonmetallic mineral means any of the following minerals or any  mixture of which the majority is any of the following minerals:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Crushed and Broken Stone, including Limestone, Dolomite,  Granite, Traprock, Sandstone, Quartz, Quartzite, Marl, Marble, Slate,  Shale, Oil Shale, and Shell.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Sand and Gravel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Clay including Kaolin, Fireclay, Bentonite, Fuller's Earth, Ball  Clay, and Common Clay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Rock Salt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Gypsum (natural or synthetic).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Sodium Compounds, including Sodium Carbonate, Sodium Chloride,  and Sodium Sulfate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(7)</em> Pumice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(8)</em> Gilsonite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(9)</em> Talc and Pyrophyllite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(10)</em> Boron, including Borax, Kernite, and Colemanite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(11)</em> Barite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(12)</em> Fluorospar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(13)</em> Feldspar.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(14)</em> Diatomite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(15)</em> Perlite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(16)</em> Vermiculite.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(17)</em> Mica.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(18)</em> Kyanite, including Andalusite, Sillimanite, Topaz, and  Dumortierite.</p><p class="depth0">Nonmetallic mineral processing plant means any combination of  equipment that is used to crush or grind any nonmetallic mineral  wherever located, including lime plants, power plants, steel mills,  asphalt concrete plants, portland cement plants, or any other facility  processing nonmetallic minerals except as provided in Sec. 60.670 (b)  and (c).</p><p class="depth0">Portable plant means any nonmetallic mineral processing plant that  is mounted on any chassis or skids and may be moved by the application  of a lifting or pulling force. In addition, there shall be no cable,  chain, turnbuckle, bolt or other means (except electrical connections)  by which any piece of equipment is attached or clamped to any anchor,  slab, or structure, including bedrock that must be removed prior to the  application of a lifting or pulling force for the purpose of  transporting the unit.</p><p class="depth0">Production line means all affected facilities (crushers, grinding  mills, screening operations, bucket elevators, belt conveyors, bagging  operations, storage bins, and enclosed truck and railcar loading  stations) which are directly connected or are connected together by a  conveying system.</p><p class="depth0">Saturated material means, for purposes of this subpart, mineral  material with sufficient surface moisture such that particulate matter  emissions are not generated from processing of the material through  screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors. Material that  is wetted solely by wet suppression systems is not considered to be  ``saturated'' for purposes of this definition.</p><p class="depth0">Screening operation means a device for separating material according  to size by passing undersize material through one or more mesh surfaces  (screens) in series, and retaining oversize material on the mesh  surfaces (screens). Grizzly feeders associated with truck dumping and  static (non-moving) grizzlies used anywhere in the nonmetallic mineral  processing plant are not considered to be screening operations.</p><p class="depth0">Seasonal shut down means shut down of an affected facility for a  period of at least 45 consecutive days due to weather or seasonal market  conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Size means the rated capacity in tons per hour of a crusher,  grinding mill, bucket elevator, bagging operation, or enclosed truck or  railcar loading station; the total surface area of the top screen of a  screening operation; the width of a conveyor belt; and the rated  capacity in tons of a storage bin.</p><p class="depth0">Stack emission means the particulate matter that is released to the  atmosphere from a capture system.</p><p class="depth0">Storage bin means a facility for storage (including surge bins) of  nonmetallic minerals prior to further processing or loading.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer point means a point in a conveying operation where the  nonmetallic mineral is transferred to or from a belt conveyor except  where the nonmetallic mineral is being transferred to a stockpile.</p><p class="depth0">Truck dumping means the unloading of nonmetallic minerals from  movable vehicles designed to transport nonmetallic minerals from one  location to another. Movable vehicles include but are not limited to:  Trucks, front end loaders, skip hoists, and railcars.</p><p class="depth0">Vent means an opening through which there is mechanically induced  air flow for the purpose of exhausting from a building air carrying  particulate matter emissions from one or more affected facilities.</p><p class="depth0">Wet material processing operation(s) means any of the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Wet screening operations (as defined in this section) and  subsequent screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors in  the production line that process saturated materials (as defined in this  section) up to the first crusher, grinding mill or storage bin in the  production line; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Screening operations, bucket elevators and belt conveyors in the  production line downstream of wet mining operations (as defined in this  section) that process saturated materials (as defined in this section)  up to the first crusher, grinding mill or storage bin in the production  line.</p><p class="depth2">Wet mining operation means a mining or dredging operation designed  and operated to extract any nonmetallic mineral regulated under this  subpart from deposits existing at or below the water table, where the  nonmetallic mineral is saturated with water.</p><p class="depth2">Wet screening operation means a screening operation at a nonmetallic  mineral processing plant which removes unwanted material or which  separates marketable fines from the product by a washing process which  is designed and operated at all times such that the product is saturated  with water.</p>
