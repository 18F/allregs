Base burns,  used to establish a Class 3 fabric, are those burns resulting from  surface flash that occur on specimens in places other than the point of  impingement when the warp and fill yarns of a raised surface textile  fabric undergo combustion. Base burns can be identified by an opacity  change, scorching on the reverse side of the fabric, or when a physical  hole is evident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Burn time means the time elapsed from ignition until the stop  thread is severed as measured by the timing mechanism of the test  apparatus.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dry cleaning means the cleaning of samples in a commercial dry  cleaning machine under the conditions described in Sec. 1610.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Film means any non-rigid, unsupported plastic, rubber or other  synthetic or natural film or sheeting, subject to the Act, or any  combination thereof, including transparent, translucent, and opaque  material, whether plain, embossed, molded, or otherwise surface treated,  which is in a form or state ready for use in wearing apparel, and shall  include film or sheeting of any thickness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Flammability means those characteristics of a material that  pertain to its relative ease of ignition and relative ability to sustain  combustion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Flame application time means the 1 second during which the  ignition flame is applied to the test specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ignition means that there is a self-sustaining flame on the  specimen after the test flame is removed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Interlining means any textile which is intended for  incorporation into an article of wearing apparel as a layer between an  outer shell and an inner lining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Laundering means washing with an aqueous detergent solution and  includes rinsing, extraction and tumble drying as described in Sec.  1610.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Long dimension means the 150 mm (6 in) length of test specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Plain surface textile fabric means any textile fabric which does  not have an intentionally raised fiber or yarn surface such as a pile,  nap, or tuft, but shall include those fabrics that have fancy woven,  knitted or flock-printed surfaces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Raised surface textile fabric means any textile fabric with an  intentionally raised fiber or yarn surface, such as a pile, including  flocked pile, nap, or tufting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Refurbishing means dry cleaning and laundering in accordance  with Sec. 1610.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Sample means a portion of a lot of material which is taken for  testing or for record keeping purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Specimen means a 50 mm by 150 mm (2 in by 6 in) section of  sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Stop thread supply means No. 50, white, mercerized, 100% cotton  sewing thread.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Surface flash means a rapid burning of the pile fibers and yarns  on a raised fiber surface textile that may or may not result in base  burning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Textile fabric means any coated or uncoated material subject to  the Act, except film and fabrics having a nitro-cellulose fiber, finish,  or coating, which is woven, knitted, felted or otherwise produced from  any natural or manmade fiber, or substitute therefore, or combination  thereof, of 50 mm (2 in) or more in width, and which is in a form or  state ready for use in wearing apparel, including fabrics which have  undergone further processing, such as dyeing and finishing, in garment  form, for consumer use.</p>
