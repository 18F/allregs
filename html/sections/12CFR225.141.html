                                Sec. 225.141  Operations subsidiaries of a bank holding company.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In orders approving the retention by a bank holding company of a  4(c)(8) subsidiary, the Board has stated that it would permit, without  any specific regulatory approval, the formation of a wholly owned  subsidiary of an approved 4(c)(8) company to engage in activities that  such a company could itself engage in directly through a division or  department. (Northwestern Financial Corporation, 65 Federal Reserve  Bulletin 566 (1979).) Section 4(a)(2) of the Act provides generally that  a bank holding company may engage directly in the business of managing  and controlling banks and permissible nonbank activities, and in  furnishing services directly to its subsidiaries. Even though section 4  of the Act generally prohibits the acquisition of shares of nonbanking  organizations, the Board does not believe that such prohibition should  apply to the formation by a holding company of a wholly-owned subsidiary  to engage in activities that it could engage in directly. Accordingly,  as a general matter, the Board will permit without any regulatory  approval a bank holding company to form a wholly-owned subsidiary to  perform servicing activities for subsidiaries that the holding company  itself could perform directly or through a department or a division  under section 4(a)(2) of the Act. The Board believes that permitting  this type of subsidiary is not inconsistent with the nonbanking  prohibitions of section 4 of the Act, and is consistent with the  authority in section 4(c)(1)(C) of the Act, which permits a bank holding  company, without regulatory approval, to form a subsidiary to perform  services for its banking subsidiaries. The Board notes, however, that a  servicing subsidiary established by a bank holding company in reliance  on this interpretation will be an affiliate of the subsidiary bank of  the holding company for the purposes of the lending restrictions of  section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act.
