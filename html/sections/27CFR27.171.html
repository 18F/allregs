                            <p class="depth0">Imported distilled spirits in bulk containers may, under the  provisions of this subpart, be withdrawn by the proprietor of a  distilled spirits plant from customs custody and transferred in such  bulk containers or by pipeline to the bonded premises of his plant,  without payment of the internal revenue tax imposed on imported spirits  by 26 U.S.C. 5001. Imported spirits so withdrawn and transferred to a  distilled spirits plant (a) may be redistilled or denatured only if of  185 degrees or more of proof, and (b) may be withdrawn from internal  revenue bond for any purpose authorized by 26 U.S.C. chapter 51, in the  same manner as domestic distilled spirits. Imported distilled spirits  transferred from customs custody to the bonded premises of a distilled  spirits plant under the provisions of this subpart shall be received and  stored thereat, and withdrawn or transferred therefrom, subject to the  applicable provisions of 27 CFR part 19. However, distilled spirits  plant proprietors are not required to file application on TTB Form  5100.16 to receive imported spirits from customs custody. The person  operating the bonded premises of the distilled spirits plant to which  imported spirits are transferred shall become liable for the tax on  distilled spirits withdrawn from customs custody under 26 U.S.C. 5232,  upon release of the spirits from customs custody, and the importer shall  thereupon be relieved of his liability for such tax.  (Sec. 3, Pub. L. 90-630, 82 Stat. 1328, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5232))  [T.D. ATF-62, 44 FR 71719, Dec. 11, 1979, as amended by T.D. ATF-198, 50  FR 8558, Mar. 1, 1985]</p>
