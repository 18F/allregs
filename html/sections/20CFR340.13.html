                            <p class="depth0">The Board or its designee may compromise an amount recoverable, provided such amount does not exceed $100,000, excluding interest, or such higher amount as the Attorney General may from time to time prescribe. Compromise of an amount recoverable may not be considered in any case in which there is an indication of fraud, the presentation of a false claim or misrepresentation on the part of the debtor or his representative. Compromise is at all times within the discretionary authority of the Board or its designee.
