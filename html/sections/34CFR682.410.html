(i) If the guaranty agency uses in a substantial way for purposes other than the agency's guaranty activities any funds required to be credited to the reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or any assets derived from the reserve fund to develop an asset of any kind and does not in good faith allocate a portion of the cost of developing and maintaining the developed asset to funds other than the reserve fund, the Secretary may require the agency to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Correct this allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Correct the recorded ownership of the asset under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section so that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If, in a transaction with an unrelated third party, the agency sells or otherwise derives revenue from uses of the asset that are unrelated to the agency's guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a percentage of the sale proceeds or revenue equal to the fair percentage of the total development cost of the asset paid with the reserve fund monies or provided by assets derived from the reserve fund; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the agency otherwise converts the asset, in whole or in part, to a use unrelated to its guaranty activities, the agency promptly shall deposit into the reserve fund described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section a fair percentage of the fair market value or, in the case of a temporary conversion, the rental value of the portion of the asset employed for the unrelated use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the agency uses funds or assets described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section in the manner described in that paragraph and makes a cost and maintenance allocation erroneously and in good faith, it shall correct the allocation under paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Third-party claims. If the guaranty agency has any claim against any other party to recover funds or other assets for the reserve fund, the claim is the property of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Related-party transactions. All transactions between a guaranty agency and a related organization or other person that involve funds required to be credited to the agency's reserve fund under paragraph (a)(1) of this section or assets derived from the reserve fund must be on terms that are not less advantageous to the reserve fund than would have been negotiated on an arm's-length basis by unrelated parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Scope of definition. The provisions of this Sec. 682.410(a) define reserve funds and assets for purposes of sections 422 and 428 of the Act. These provisions do not, however, affect the Secretary's authority to use all funds and assets of the agency pursuant to section 428(c)(9)(F)(vi) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Minimum reserve fund level. The guaranty agency must maintain a current minimum reserve level of not less than--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> .5 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1993;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> .7 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1994;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> .9 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for the fiscal year of the agency that begins in calendar year 1995; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> 1.1 percent of the amount of loans outstanding, for each fiscal year of the agency that begins on or after January 1, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Definitions.

The burden of proof is upon the guaranty agency, as a fiduciary under its agreements with the Secretary, to establish that costs are reasonable. In determining reasonableness of a given cost, consideration must be given to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether the cost is of a type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for the proper and efficient performance and administration of the guaranty agency's responsibilities under the HEA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The restraints or requirements imposed by factors such as sound business practices, arms-length bargaining, Federal, State, and other laws and regulations, and the terms and conditions of the guaranty agency's agreements with the Secretary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Market prices of comparable goods or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Administrative requirements--(1) Independent audits.

These costs may include, but are not limited to, all attorney's fees, collection agency charges, and court costs. Except as provided in Sec. Sec. 682.401(b)(18)(i) and 682.405(b)(1)(iv)(B), the amount charged a borrower must equal the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of collection under the formula in 34 CFR 30.60; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount the same borrower would be charged for the cost of collection if the loan was held by the U.S. Department of Education.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Interest charged by guaranty agencies.

At the borrower's option, the hearing may be oral or written. The time and location of the hearing is established by the guaranty agency. An oral hearing may, at the borrower's option, be conducted either in-person or by telephone conference. The agency notifies the borrower of the process for arranging the time and location of an oral hearing. All telephonic charges are the responsibility of the agency. All travel expenses incurred by the borrower in connection with an in-person oral hearing are the responsibility of the borrower.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)(1)</em> If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on the existence, amount, or enforceability of the debt--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The guaranty agency must provide evidence of the existence of the debt. If the agency provides evidence of the existence of the debt, the borrower must prove by the preponderance of the evidence that no debt exists, the debt is not enforceable under applicable law, the amount the guaranty agency claims the borrower owes is incorrect, including that any amount of collection costs assessed to the borrower exceeds the limits established under Sec. 682.410(b)(2), or the debt is not delinquent; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower may raise any of the objections described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(1)(i) of this section not raised in the written request, but must do so before a hearing is completed. For purposes of this paragraph, a hearing is completed when the record is closed and the hearing official notifies the parties that no additional evidence or objections will be accepted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the borrower submits a written request for a hearing on an objection that withholding in the amount or at the rate that the agency proposed in its notice would cause financial hardship to the borrower and the borrower's spouse and dependents--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The borrower bears the burden of proving the claim of financial hardship by a preponderance of the credible evidence by providing credible documentation that the amount of wages proposed in the notice would leave the borrower unable to meet basic living expenses of the borrower, the borrower's spouse, and the borrower's dependents. The documentation must show the amount of the costs incurred for basic living expenses and the income available from any source to meet those expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The borrower's claim of financial hardship must be evaluated by comparing the amounts that the borrower proves are being incurred for basic living expenses against the amounts spent for basic living expenses by families of the same size as the borrower's. For the purposes of this section, the standards published by the Internal Revenue Service under 26 U.S.C. 7122(d)(2) (the ''Collection Financial Standards'') establish the average amounts spent for basic living expenses for families of the same size as the borrower's family;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The amount that the borrower proves is incurred for a type of basic living expense is considered to be reasonable to the extent that the amount

does not exceed the amount spent for that expense by families of the same size according to the Collection Financial Standards. If the borrower claims an amount for any basic living expense that exceeds the amount in the Collection Financial Standards, the borrower must prove that the amount claimed is reasonable and necessary;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If the borrower's objection to the rate or amount proposed in the notice is upheld in part, the garnishment must be ordered at a lesser rate or amount, that is determined will allow the borrower to meet basic living expenses proven to be reasonable and necessary. If this financial hardship determination is made after a garnishment order is already in effect, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower's employer of any change required by the determination in the amount to be withheld or the rate of withholding under that order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A determination by a hearing official that financial hardship would result from garnishment is effective for a period not longer than six months after the date of the finding. After this period, the guaranty agency may require the borrower to submit current information regarding the borrower's family income and living expenses. If the borrower fails to submit current information within 30 days of this request, or the guaranty agency concludes from a review of the available evidence that garnishment should now begin or the rate or the amount of an outstanding withholding should be increased, the guaranty agency must notify the borrower and provide the borrower with an opportunity to contest the determination and obtain a hearing on the objection under the procedures in paragraph (b)(9)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency on or before the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency may not issue a withholding order until the borrower has been provided the requested hearing and a decision has been rendered. The guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time to permit a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, to be rendered within 60 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> If the borrower's written request for a hearing is received by the guaranty agency after the 30th day following the date of the notice described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(B) of this section, the guaranty agency must provide a hearing to the borrower in sufficient time that a decision, in accordance with the procedures that the agency may prescribe, may be rendered within 60 days, but may not delay issuance of a withholding order unless the agency determines that the delay in filing the request was caused by factors over which the borrower had no control, or the agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order. If a decision is not rendered within 60 days following receipt of a borrower's written request for a hearing, the guaranty agency must suspend the order beginning on the 61st day after the hearing request was received until a hearing is provided and a decision is rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> The hearing official appointed by the agency to conduct the hearing may be any qualified individual, including an administrative law judge. Under no circumstance may the hearing official be under the supervision or control of the head of the guaranty agency or of a third-party servicer or collection contractor employed by the agency. Payment of compensation by the guaranty agency, third-party servicer, or collection contractor employed by the agency to the hearing official for service as a hearing official does not constitute impermissible supervision or control under this paragraph. The guaranty agency must ensure that, except as needed to arrange for administrative matters pertaining to the hearing, including the type of hearing requested by the borrower, the time, place, and manner of conducting an oral hearing, and post-hearing matters such as issuance of a hearing decision, all oral communications between the hearing official and any representative of the guaranty agency or with the borrower are made within the hearing of the other party, and that copies of any written communication with either party are promptly provided to the

other party. This paragraph does not preclude a hearing in the absence of one of the parties if the borrower is given proper notice of the hearing, both parties have agreed on the time, place, and manner of the hearing, and one of the parties fails to attend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(J)</em> The hearing official must conduct any hearing as an informal proceeding, require witnesses in an oral hearing to testify under oath or affirmation, and maintain a summary record of any hearing. The hearing official must issue a final written decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than 60 days after the guaranty agency's receipt of the borrower's hearing request. However--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The borrower may request an extension of that deadline for a reasonable period, as determined by the hearing official, for the purpose of submitting additional evidence or raising a new objection described in paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(1)(ii) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The agency may request, and the hearing official must grant, a reasonable extension of time sufficient to enable the guaranty agency to evaluate and respond to any such additional evidence or any objections raised pursuant to paragraph (b)(9)(i)(F)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(K)</em> An employer served with a garnishment order from the guaranty agency with respect to a borrower whose wages are not then subject to a withholding order of any kind must deduct and pay to the agency from a borrower's disposable pay an amount that does not exceed the smallest of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount specified in the guaranty agency order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount permitted by section 488A(a)(1) of the Act, which is 15 percent of the borrower's disposable pay; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673(a)(2), which is the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(L)</em> If a borrower's pay is subject to more than one garnishment order--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Unless other Federal law requires a different priority, the employer must pay the agency the amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(K) of this section before the employer complies with any later garnishment orders, except a family support withholding order;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If an employer is withholding from a borrower's pay based on a garnishment order served on the employer before the guaranty agency's order, or if a withholding order for family support is served on an employer at any time, the employer must comply with the agency's garnishment order by withholding an amount that is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount specified in the guaranty agency order; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount calculated under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(L)(3) of this section less the amount or amounts withheld under the garnishment order or orders that have priority over the agency's order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The cumulative withholding for all garnishment orders issued by guaranty agencies may not exceed, for an individual borrower, the amount permitted by 15 U.S.C. 1673, which is the lesser of 25 percent of the borrower's disposable pay or the amount by which the borrower's disposable pay exceeds 30 times the minimum wage. If a borrower owes debts to one or more guaranty agencies, each agency may issue a garnishment order to enforce each of those debts, but no single agency may order a total amount exceeding 15 percent of the disposable pay of a borrower to be withheld. The employer must honor these orders as provided in paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(L)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(K) and (L) of this section, an employer may withhold and pay a greater amount than required under the order if the borrower gives the employer written consent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(N)</em> A borrower may, at any time, raise an objection to the amount or the rate of withholding specified in the guaranty agency's order to the borrower's employer on the ground of financial hardship. However, the guaranty agency is not required to consider such an objection and provide the borrower with a hearing until at least six months after the agency issued the most recent garnishment order, either one for which the borrower did not request a hearing or one that was issued

after a hardship-related hearing determination. The agency may provide a hearing in extraordinary circumstances earlier than six months if the borrower's request for review shows that the borrower's financial circumstances have substantially changed after the garnishment notice because of an event such as injury, divorce, or catastrophic illness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> A garnishment order is effective until the guaranty agency rescinds the order or the agency has fully recovered the amounts owed by the borrower, including interest, late fees, and collections costs. If an employer is unable to honor a garnishment order because the amount available for garnishment is insufficient to pay any portion of the amount stated in the order, the employer must notify the agency and comply with the order when sufficient disposable pay is available. Upon full recovery of the debt, the agency must send the borrower's employer notification to stop wage withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> The guaranty agency must sue any employer for any amount that the employer, after receipt of the withholding order provided by the agency under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section, fails to withhold from wages owed and payable to an employee under the employer's normal pay and disbursement cycle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> The guaranty agency may not garnish the wages of a borrower whom it knows has been involuntarily separated from employment until the borrower has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. The borrower has the burden of informing the guaranty agency of the circumstances surrounding the borrower's involuntary separation from employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(R)</em> Unless the guaranty agency receives information that the agency believes justifies a delay or cancellation of the withholding order, it must send a withholding order to the employer within 20 days after the borrower fails to make a timely request for a hearing, or, if a timely request for a hearing is made by the borrower, within 20 days after a final decision is made by the agency to proceed with garnishment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(S)</em> The notice given to the employer under paragraph (b)(9)(i)(R) of this section must contain only the information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order and to ensure proper credit for payments received. At a minimum, the notice given to the employer includes the borrower's name, address, and Social Security Number, as well as instructions for withholding and information as to where the employer must send payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(T)(1)</em> A guaranty agency may use a third-party servicer or collection contractor to perform administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment, but may not allow such a party to conduct required hearings or to determine that a withholding order is to be issued. Subject to the limitations of paragraphs (b)(9)(i)(T)(2) and (3) of this section, administrative activities associated with administrative wage garnishment may include but are not limited to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identifying to the agency suitable candidates for wage garnishment pursuant to agency standards;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Obtaining employment information for the purposes of garnishment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sending candidates selected for garnishment by the agency notices prescribed by the agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Negotiating alternative repayment arrangements with borrowers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Responding to inquiries from notified borrowers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Receiving garnishment payments on behalf of the agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Arranging for the retention of hearing officials and for the conduct of hearings on behalf of the agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Providing information to borrowers or hearing officials on the process or conduct of hearings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Sending garnishment orders and other communications to employers on behalf of the agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Only an authorized official of the agency may determine that an individual withholding order is to be issued. The guarantor must record the official's determination for each order it issues, including any order which it causes to be prepared or mailed by a third-party servicer or collection contractor. The guarantor must evidence the official's approval, either by including the official's signature on the order or, if the agency uses a form of

withholding order that does not provide for execution by signature, by retaining in the agency's records the identity of the approving official, the date of the approval, the amount or rate of the order, the name and address of the employer to whom the order was issued, and the debt for which the order was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The withholding order must identify the guaranty agency as the holder of the debt, as the issuer of the order, and as the sole party legally authorized to issue the withholding order. If a guaranty agency uses a third-party servicer or collection contractor to prepare and mail a withholding order that includes the name of the servicer or contractor that prepared or mailed the order, the guaranty agency must also ensure that the order contains no captions or representations that the servicer or contractor is the party that issued, or was empowered by Federal law or by the agency to issue, the withholding order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(U)</em> As specified in section 488A(a)(8) of the Act, the borrower may seek judicial relief, including punitive damages, if the employer discharges, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against the borrower due to the issuance of a withholding order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(V)</em> A guaranty agency is required to suspend a garnishment order when the agency receives a borrower's fifth qualifying payment under a loan rehabilitation agreement with the agency, unless otherwise directed by the borrower, in accordance with Sec. 682.405(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b)(9) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> ``Borrower'' includes all endorsers on a loan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> ``Day'' means calendar day;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> ``Disposable pay'' means that part of a borrower's compensation for personal services, whether or not denominated as wages from an employer, that remains after the deduction of health insurance premiums and any amounts required by law to be withheld, and includes, but is not limited to, salary, bonuses, commissions, or vacation pay. ``Amounts required by law to be withheld'' include amounts for deductions such as Social Security taxes and withholding taxes, but do not include any amount withheld under a court order or other withholding order.

(i) A guaranty agency shall maintain and enforce written standards of conduct governing the performance of its employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents engaged in the selection, award, and administration of contracts or agreements. The standards of conduct must, at a minimum, require disclosure of financial or other interests and must mandate disinterested decision-making. The standards must provide for appropriate disciplinary actions to be applied for violations of the standards by employees, officers, directors, trustees, or agents of the guaranty agency, and must include provisions to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prohibit any employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent from participating in the selection, award, or decision-making related to the administration of a contract or agreement supported by the reserve fund described in paragraph (a) of this section, if that participation would create a conflict of interest. Such a conflict would arise if the employee, officer, director, trustee, or agent, or any member of his or her immediate family, his or her partner, or an organization that employs or is about to employ any of those parties has a financial or ownership interest in

the organization selected for an award or would benefit from the decision made in the administration of the contract or agreement. The prohibitions described in this paragraph do not apply to employees of a State agency covered by codes of conduct established under State law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ensure sufficient separation of responsibility and authority between its lender claims processing as a guaranty agency and its lending or loan servicing activities, or both, within the guaranty agency or between that agency and one or more affiliates, including independence in direct reporting requirements and such management and systems controls as may be necessary to demonstrate, in the independent audit required under Sec. 682.410(b)(1), that claims filed by another arm of the guaranty agency or by an affiliate of that agency receive no more favorable treatment than that accorded the claims filed by a lender or servicer that is not an affiliate or part of the guaranty agency; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Prohibit the employees, officers, directors, trustees, and agents of the guaranty agency, his or her partner, or any member of his or her immediate family, from soliciting or accepting gratuities, favors, or anything of monetary value from contractors or parties to agreements, except that nominal and unsolicited gratuities, favors, or items may be accepted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Guaranty agency restructuring. If the Secretary determines that action is necessary to protect the Federal fiscal interest because of an agency's failure to meet the requirements of Sec. 682.410(b)(10)(i), the Secretary may require the agency to comply with any additional measures that the Secretary believes are appropriate, including the total divestiture of the agency's non-FFEL functions and the agency's interests in any affiliated organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement requirements. A guaranty agency shall take such measures and establish such controls as are necessary to ensure its vigorous enforcement of all Federal, State, and guaranty agency requirements, including agreements, applicable to its loan guarantee program, including, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Conducting comprehensive biennial on-site program reviews, using statistically valid techniques to calculate liabilities to the Secretary that each review indicates may exist, of at least--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> Each participating lender whose dollar volume of FFEL loans held by the lender and guaranteed by the agency in the preceding year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Each participating lender whose dollar volume of FFEL loans held by the lender and guaranteed by the agency in the preceding year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Equaled or exceeded two percent of the total of all loans guaranteed by the agency;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Was one of the ten largest lenders whose loans were guaranteed by the agency; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Equaled or exceeded $10 million in the most recent fiscal year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each lender described in section 435(d)(1)(D) or (J) of the Act that is located in any State in which the agency is the principal guarantor, and, at the option of each guaranty agency, the Student Loan Marketing Association; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each school that participated in the guaranty agency's program, located in a State for which the guaranty agency is the principal guaranty agency, that has a cohort default rate, as described in subpart M of 34 CFR part 668, that includes FFEL Program loans, for either of the 2 immediately preceding fiscal years, as defined in 34 CFR 668.182, that exceeds 20 percent, unless the school is under a mandate from the Secretary under subpart M of 34 CFR part 668 to take specific default reduction measures or if the total dollar amount of loans entering repayment in each fiscal year on which the cohort default rate of over 20 percent is based does not exceed $100,000; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The schools and lenders selected by the agency as an alternative to the reviews required by paragraphs (c)(1)(i)(A)-(C) of this section if the Secretary approves the agency's proposed alternative selection methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Demanding prompt repayment by the responsible parties to lenders, borrowers, the agency, or the Secretary, as appropriate, of all funds found in those reviews to be owed by the participants with regard to loans guaranteed by the agency, whether or not the agency holds the loans, and monitoring the implementation by participants of
