Accessories, spare parts, or tools that are delivered with a good and that form part of the good's standard accessories, spare parts, or tools will be treated as originating goods if the good is an originating good, and will be disregarded in determining whether all the non-originating materials used in the production of the good undergo an applicable change in tariff classification specified in General Note 33, HTSUS, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The accessories, spare parts, or tools are classified with, and not invoiced separately from, the good; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The quantities and value of the accessories, spare parts, or tools are customary for the good.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regional value content. If the good is subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of the accessories, spare parts, or tools is taken into account as originating or non-originating materials, as the case may be, in calculating the regional value content of the good under Sec. 10.1015 of this subpart.</p>
