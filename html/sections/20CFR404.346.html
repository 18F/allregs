                                Sec. 404.346  Your relationship as wife, husband, widow, or widower
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. If your relationship as the insured's wife, husband,  widow, or widower cannot be established under State law as explained in  Sec. 404.345, you may be eligible for benefits based upon a deemed valid  marriage. You will be deemed to be the wife, husband, widow, or widower  of the insured if, in good faith, you went through a marriage ceremony  with the insured that would have resulted in a valid marriage except for  a legal impediment. A legal impediment includes only an impediment which  results because a previous marriage had not ended at the time of the  ceremony or because there was a defect in the procedure followed in  connection with the intended marriage. For example, a defect in the  procedure may be found where a marriage was performed through a  religious ceremony in a country that requires a civil ceremony for a  valid marriage. Good faith means that at the time of the ceremony you  did not know that a legal impediment existed, or if you did know, you  thought that it would not prevent a valid marriage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Entitlement based upon a deemed valid marriage. To be entitled  to benefits as a wife, husband, widow or widower as the result of a  deemed valid marriage, you and the insured must have been living in the  same household (see Sec. 404.347) at the time the insured died or, if  the insured is living, at the time you apply for benefits. However, a  marriage that had been deemed valid, shall continue to be deemed valid  if the insured individual and the person entitled to benefits as the  wife or husband of the insured individual are no longer living in the  same household at the time of death of the insured individual.  [44 FR 34481, June 15, 1979, as amended at 45 FR 65540, Oct. 3, 1980; 48  FR 21927, May 16, 1983; 58 FR 64892, Dec. 10, 1993]    Sec. 404.347  ``Living in the same household'' defined.</p><p class="depth0">Living in the same household means that you and the insured  customarily lived together as husband and wife in the same residence.  You may be considered to be living in the same household although one of  you is temporarily absent from the residence. An absence will be  considered temporary if:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It was due to service in the U.S. Armed Forces;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It was 6 months or less and neither you nor the insured were  outside of the United States during this time and the absence was due to  business, employment, or confinement in a hospital, nursing home, other  medical institution, or a penal institution;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It was for an extended separation, regardless of the duration,  due to the confinement of either you or the insured in a hospital,  nursing home, or other medical institution, if the evidence indicates  that you were separated solely for medical reasons and you otherwise  would have resided together; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It was based on other circumstances, and it is shown that you  and the insured reasonably could have expected to live together in the  near future.
