                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The HHS-certified laboratories performing services for licensees  and other entities under this part shall be secure at all times. Each  laboratory shall have in place sufficient security measures to control  access to the premises and to ensure that no unauthorized personnel  handle specimens or gain access to the laboratory processes or areas  where records are stored. Access to these secured areas must be limited  to specially authorized individuals whose authorization is documented.  All authorized visitors, and maintenance and service personnel, shall be  escorted at all times in the laboratory, except personnel who are  authorized to conduct inspections and audits on behalf of licensees,  other entities, the NRC, or the HHS Secretary, and emergency personnel  (including but not limited to firefighters and medical rescue teams).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a shipment of specimens is received, laboratory personnel  shall inspect each package for evidence of possible tampering and shall  compare information on specimen bottles within each package to the  information on the accompanying custody-and-control forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any direct evidence of tampering or discrepancies in the  information on the specimen bottles and the custody-and-control forms  attached to the shipment must be reported to the licensee or other  entity within 24 hours of the discovery and must be noted on the  custody-and-control forms for each specimen contained in the package.  When notified, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that an  investigation is initiated to determine whether tampering has occurred.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the investigation determines that tampering has occurred, the  licensee or other entity shall ensure that corrective actions are taken.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the licensee or other entity has reason to question the  integrity and identity of the specimens, the specimens may not be tested  and the licensee or other entity shall ensure that another collection  occurs as soon as reasonably practical, except if a split   specimen collection was performed, either the Bottle A or Bottle B seal  remains intact, and the intact specimen contains at least 15 mL of  urine. In this instance, if the licensee testing facility has retained  the specimen in Bottle B, the licensee testing facility shall forward  the intact specimen for testing to the HHS-certified laboratory and may  not conduct any testing at the licensee testing facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following are exclusive grounds requiring the MRO to cancel  the testing of a donor's urine specimen:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The custody-and-control form does not contain information to  identify the specimen collector and the collection site cannot provide  conclusive evidence of the collector's identity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The identification numbers on the specimen bottle seal(s) do  not match the identification numbers on the custody-and-control form;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A specimen bottle seal is broken or shows evidence of  tampering and an intact specimen, as specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii)  of this section, does not exist;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The specimen appears to have leaked out of its sealed bottle  and there is less than 15 mL remaining, and an intact specimen, as  specified in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, does not exist; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> As required under Sec. 26.165(f)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The HHS-certified laboratory shall retain specimen bottles  within the laboratory's accession area until all analyses have been  completed. Laboratory personnel shall use aliquots and laboratory  internal custody-and-control forms when conducting initial and  confirmatory tests. The original specimen and the original custody-and- control form must remain in secure storage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The laboratory's internal custody-and-control form must allow  for identification of the donor, and documentation of the testing  process and transfers of custody of the specimen.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each time a specimen is handled or transferred within the  laboratory, laboratory personnel shall document the date and purpose on  the custody-and-control form and every individual in the chain shall be  identified. Authorized technicians are responsible for each urine  specimen or aliquot in their possession and shall sign and complete  custody-and-control forms for those specimens or aliquots as they are  received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a specimen is to be transferred to a second HHS-certified  laboratory, laboratory personnel shall ensure that a copy of the  custody-and-control form is packaged with the aliquot of a single  specimen or Bottle B of a split specimen, as appropriate. Sealed and  labeled specimen bottles and aliquots, with their associated custody- and-control forms, being transferred from one laboratory to another must  be placed in a second, tamper-evident shipping container designed to  minimize the possibility of damage to the specimen during shipment  (e.g., specimen boxes, padded mailers, or bulk insulated shipping  containers with that capability) so that the contents of the shipping  containers are inaccessible without breaking a tamper-evident seal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Couriers, express carriers, and postal service personnel do not  have direct access to the custody-and-control forms or the specimen  bottles. Therefore, such personnel are not required to document chain of  custody on the custody-and-control forms during transit. Custody  accountability of the shipping containers during shipment must be  maintained by a tracking system provided by the courier, express  carrier, or postal service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Specimens that do not receive an initial test within 7 days of  arrival at the laboratory must be placed in secure refrigeration units  for short-term storage. Temperatures may not exceed 6 [deg]C (42.8  [deg]F). The laboratory shall ensure proper storage conditions in the  event of a prolonged power failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Long-term frozen storage at a temperature of -20 [deg]C (- 4[emsp14] [deg]F) or less ensures that positive, adulterated,  substituted, and invalid urine specimens and Bottle B of a split  specimen will be available for any necessary retests. Unless otherwise  authorized in writing by the licensee or other entity, laboratories  shall retain and place in properly secured long-term frozen storage all  specimens reported as positive, adulterated, substituted, or invalid. At  a minimum, such specimens must be stored for 1 year. Within this 1-year  period, a licensee, other entity, or the   NRC may ask the laboratory to retain the specimen for an additional  period of time. If no retention request is received, the laboratory may  discard the specimen at the end of 1 year. However, the laboratory shall  retain any specimens under review or legal challenge until they are no  longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The laboratory shall discard a valid specimen that tests  negative on initial or confirmatory drug tests or may pool such  specimens for use in the laboratory's internal quality control program  after certifying that the specimens are negative and valid. The  laboratory may not retain any information linking donors to specimens  that are pooled for use in the internal quality control program.
