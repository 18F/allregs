                                Sec. 75.521  Management decision.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. The management decision must clearly state whether or  not the audit finding is sustained, the reasons for the decision, and  the expected auditee action to repay disallowed costs, make financial  adjustments, or take other action. If the auditee has not completed  corrective action, a timetable for follow-up should be given. Prior to  issuing the management decision, the Federal agency or pass-through  entity may request additional information or documentation from the  auditee, including a request for auditor assurance related to the  documentation, as a way of mitigating disallowed costs. The management  decision should describe any appeal process available to the auditee.  While not required, the Federal agency or pass-through entity may also  issue a management decision on findings relating to the financial  statements which are required to be reported in accordance with GAGAS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Federal agency. As provided in Sec. 75.513(a)(3)(vii), the  cognizant agency for audit must be responsible for coordinating a  management decision for audit findings that affect the programs of more  than one Federal agency. As provided in Sec. 75.513(c)(3), a Federal  awarding agency is responsible for issuing a management decision for  findings that relate to Federal awards it makes to non-Federal entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Pass-through entity. As provided in Sec. 75.352(d), the pass- through entity   must be responsible for issuing a management decision for audit findings  that relate to Federal awards it makes to subrecipients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time requirements. The HHS awarding agency or pass-through  entity responsible for issuing a management decision must do so within  six months of acceptance of the audit report by the FAC. The auditee  must initiate and proceed with corrective action as rapidly as possible  and corrective action should begin no later than upon receipt of the  audit report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reference numbers. Management decisions must include the  reference numbers the auditor assigned to each audit finding in  accordance with Sec. 75.516(c).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix I to Part 75--Full Text of Notice of Funding Opportunity</p><p class="depth0">The full text of the notice of funding opportunity is organized in  sections. The required format outlined in this appendix indicates  immediately following the title of each section whether that section is  required in every announcement or is an HHS awarding agency option. The  format is designed so that similar types of information will appear in  the same sections in announcements of different Federal funding  opportunities. Toward that end, there is text in each of the following  sections to describe the types of information that an HHS awarding  agency would include in that section of an actual announcement.</p><p class="depth0">An HHS awarding agency that wishes to include information that the  format does not specifically discuss may address that subject in  whatever section(s) is most appropriate. For example, if an HHS awarding  agency chooses to address performance goals in the announcement, it  might do so in the funding opportunity description, the application  content, or the reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Similarly, when this format calls for a type of information to be in  a particular section, an HHS awarding agency wishing to address that  subject in other sections may elect to repeat the information in those  sections or use cross references between the sections (there should be  hyperlinks for cross-references in any electronic versions of the  announcement). For example, an HHS awarding agency may want to include  in Section A information about the types of non-Federal entities who are  eligible to apply. The format specifies a standard location for that  information in Section C.1 but that does not preclude repeating the  information in Section I or creating a cross reference between Sections  A and C.1, as long as a potential applicant can find the information  quickly and easily from the standard location.</p><p class="depth0">The sections of the full text of the announcement are described in  the following paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0">A. Program Description--Required</p><p class="depth0">This section contains the full program description of the funding  opportunity. It may be as long as needed to adequately communicate to  potential applicants the areas in which funding may be provided. It  describes the HHS awarding agency's funding priorities or the technical  or focus areas in which the HHS awarding agency intends to provide  assistance. As appropriate, it may include any program history (e.g.,  whether this is a new program or a new or changed area of program  emphasis). This section may communicate indicators of successful  projects (e.g., if the program encourages collaborative efforts) and may  include examples of projects that have been funded previously. This  section also may include other information the HHS awarding agency deems  necessary, and must at a minimum include citations for authorizing  statutes and regulations for the funding opportunity.</p><p class="depth0">B. Federal Award Information--Required</p><p class="depth0">This section provides sufficient information to help an applicant  make an informed decision about whether to submit a proposal. Relevant  information could include the total amount of funding that the HHS  awarding agency expects to award through the announcement; the  anticipated number of Federal awards; the expected amounts of individual  Federal awards (which may be a range); the amount of funding per Federal  award, on average, experienced in previous years; and the anticipated  start dates and periods of performance for new Federal awards. This  section also should address whether applications for renewal or  supplementation of existing projects are eligible to compete with  applications for new Federal awards.</p><p class="depth0">This section also must indicate the type(s) of assistance instrument  (e.g., grant, cooperative agreement) that may be awarded if applications  are successful. If cooperative agreements may be awarded, this section  either should describe the ``substantial involvement'' that the HHS  awarding agency expects to have or should reference where the potential  applicant can find that information (e.g., in the funding opportunity  description in section A. or Federal award administration information in  Section D. If procurement contracts also may be awarded, this must be  stated.</p><p class="depth0">C. Eligibility Information</p><p class="depth0">This section addresses the considerations or factors that determine  applicant or application eligibility. This includes the eligibility of  particular types of applicant organizations, any factors affecting the  eligibility of the principal investigator or project director, and any  criteria that make particular projects ineligible. HHS agencies should  make clear whether an applicant's failure to meet an eligibility  criterion by the time of an application deadline will result in the HHS  awarding agency returning the application without review or, even though  an application may be reviewed, will preclude the HHS awarding agency  from making a Federal award. Key elements to be addressed are:</p><p class="depth0">1. Eligible Applicants--Required. Announcements must clearly  identify the types of entities that are eligible to apply. If there are  no restrictions on eligibility, this section may simply indicate that  all potential applicants are eligible. If there are restrictions on  eligibility, it is important to be clear about the specific types of  entities that are eligible, not just the types that are ineligible. For  example, if the program is limited to nonprofit organizations subject to  26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3) of the tax code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)), the  announcement should say so. Similarly, it is better to state explicitly  that Native American tribal organizations are eligible than to assume  that they can unambiguously infer that from a statement that nonprofit  organizations may apply. Eligibility also can be expressed by exception,  (e.g., open to all types of domestic applicants other than individuals).  This section should refer to any portion of Section D. specifying  documentation that must be submitted to support an eligibility  determination (e.g., proof of 501(c)(3) status as determined by the  Internal Revenue Service or an authorizing tribal resolution). To the  extent that any funding restriction in Section D.6 could affect the  eligibility of an applicant or project, the announcement must either  restate that restriction in this section or provide a cross-reference to  its description in Section D.6.</p><p class="depth0">2. Cost Sharing or Matching--Required. Announcements must state  whether there is required cost sharing, matching, or cost participation  without which an application would be ineligible (if cost sharing is not  required, the announcement must explicitly say so). Required cost  sharing may be a certain percentage or amount, or may be in the form of  contributions of specified items or activities (e.g., provision of  equipment). It is important that the announcement be clear about any  restrictions on the types of cost (e.g., in-kind contributions) that are  acceptable as cost sharing. Cost sharing as an eligibility criterion  includes requirements based in statute or regulation, as described in  Sec. 75.306. This section should refer to the appropriate portion(s) of  section D. stating any pre-award requirements for submission of letters  or other documentation to verify commitments to meet cost-sharing  requirements if a Federal award is made.</p><p class="depth0">3. Other--Required, if applicable. If there are other eligibility  criteria (i.e., criteria that have the effect of making an application  or project ineligible for Federal awards, whether referred to as  ``responsiveness'' criteria, ``go-no go'' criteria, ``threshold''  criteria, or in other ways), must be clearly stated and must include a  reference to the regulation of requirement that describes the  restriction, as applicable. For example, if entities that have been  found to be in violation of a particular Federal statute are ineligible,  it is important to say so. This section must also state any limit on the  number of applications an applicant may submit under the announcement  and make clear whether the limitation is on the submitting organization,  individual investigator/program director, or both. This section should  also address any eligibility criteria for beneficiaries or for program  participants other than Federal award recipients.</p><p class="depth0">D. Application and Submission Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Address to Request Application Package--Required. Potential  applicants must be told how to get application forms, kits, or other  materials needed to apply (if this announcement contains everything  needed, this section need only say so). An Internet address where the  materials can be accessed is acceptable. However, since high-speed  Internet access is not yet universally available for downloading  documents, and applicants may have additional accessibility  requirements, there also should be a way for potential applicants to  request paper copies of materials, such as a U.S. Postal Service mailing  address, telephone or FAX number, Telephone Device for the Deaf (TDD),  Text Telephone (TTY) number, and/or Federal Information Relay Service  (FIRS) number.</p><p class="depth0">2. Content and Form of Application Submission--Required. This  section must identify the required content of an application and the  forms or formats that an applicant must use to submit it. If any  requirements are stated elsewhere because they are general requirements  that apply to multiple programs or funding opportunities, this section  should refer to where those requirements may be found. This section also  should include required forms or formats as part of the announcement or  state where the applicant may obtain them.</p><p class="depth0">This section should specifically address content and form or format  requirements for:</p><p class="depth0">i. Pre-applications, letters of intent, or white papers required or  encouraged (see Section D.4), including any limitations on   the number of pages or other formatting requirements similar to those  for full applications.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The application as a whole. For all submissions, this would  include any limitations on the number of pages, font size and typeface,  margins, paper size, number of copies, and sequence or assembly  requirements. If electronic submission is permitted or required, this  could include special requirements for formatting or signatures.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Component pieces of the application (e.g., if all copies of the  application must bear original signatures on the face page or the  program narrative may not exceed 10 pages). This includes any pieces  that may be submitted separately by third parties (e.g., references or  letters confirming commitments from third parties that will be  contributing a portion of any required cost sharing).</p><p class="depth0">iv. Information that successful applicants must submit after  notification of intent to make a Federal award, but prior to a Federal  award. This could include evidence of compliance with requirements  relating to human subjects or information needed to comply with the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321-4370h).</p><p class="depth0">3. Unique Entity Identifier and System for Award Management (SAM)-- Required.</p><p class="depth0">This paragraph must state clearly that each applicant (unless the  applicant is an individual or Federal awarding agency that is excepted  from those requirements under 2 CFR 25.110(b) or (c), or has an  exception approved by the Federal awarding agency under 2 CFR 25.110(d))  is required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be registered in SAM before submitting its application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> provide a valid unique entity identifier in its application;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> continue to maintain an active SAM registration with current  information at all times during which it has an active Federal award or  an application or plan under consideration by a Federal awarding agency.</p><p class="depth0">It also must state that the Federal awarding agency may not make a  Federal award to an applicant until the applicant has complied with all  applicable unique entity identifier and SAM requirements and, if an  applicant has not fully complied with the requirements by the time the  Federal awarding agency is ready to make a Federal award, the Federal  awarding agency may determine that the applicant is not qualified to  receive a Federal award and use that determination as a basis for making  a Federal award to another applicant.</p><p class="depth0">4. Submission Dates and Times--Required. Announcements must identify  due dates and times for all submissions. This includes not only the full  applications but also any preliminary submissions (e.g., letters of  intent, white papers, or pre-applications). It also includes any other  submissions of information before Federal award that are separate from  the full application. If the funding opportunity is a general  announcement that is open for a period of time with no specific due  dates for applications, this section should say so. Note that the  information on dates that is included in this section also must appear  with other overview information in a location preceding the full text of  the announcement (see Sec. 75.203).</p><p class="depth0">Each type of submission should be designated as encouraged or  required and, if required, any deadline date (or dates, if the Federal  awarding agency plans more than one cycle of application submission,  review, and Federal award under the announcement) should be specified.  The announcement must state (or provide a reference to another document  that states):</p><p class="depth0">i. Any deadline in terms of a date and local time. If the due date  falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the reporting package  is due the next business day.</p><p class="depth0">ii. What the deadline means (e.g., whether it is the date and time  by which the Federal awarding agency must receive the application, the  date by which the application must be postmarked, or something else) and  how that depends, if at all, on the submission method (e.g., mail,  electronic, or personal/courier delivery).</p><p class="depth0">iii. The effect of missing a deadline (e.g., whether late  applications are neither reviewed nor considered or are reviewed and  considered under some circumstances).</p><p class="depth0">iv. How the receiving Federal office determines whether an  application or pre-application has been submitted before the deadline.  This includes the form of acceptable proof of mailing or system- generated documentation of receipt date and time.</p><p class="depth0">This section also may indicate whether, when, and in what form the  applicant will receive an acknowledgement of receipt. This information  should be displayed in ways that will be easy to understand and use. It  can be difficult to extract all needed information from narrative  paragraphs, even when they are well written. A tabular form for  providing a summary of the information may help applicants for some  programs and give them what effectively could be a checklist to verify  the completeness of their application package before submission.</p><p class="depth0">5. Intergovernmental Review--Required, if applicable. If the funding  opportunity is subject to Executive Order 12372, ``Intergovernmental  Review of Federal Programs,'' the notice must say so. In alerting  applicants that they must contact their state's Single Point of Contact  (SPOC) to find out about and comply with the state's process under  Executive Order 12372, it may be useful to inform potential applicants  that the names and addresses of the SPOCs are listed in the Office of  Management and Budget's Web site. www.whitehouse.gov/omb/grants/ spoc.html.</p><p class="depth0">6. Funding Restrictions--Required. Notices must include information  on funding restrictions in order to allow an applicant to develop an  application and budget consistent with program requirements. Examples  are whether construction is an allowable activity, if there are any  limitations on direct costs such as foreign travel or equipment  purchases, and if there are any limits on indirect costs (or facilities  and administrative costs). Applicants must be advised if Federal awards  will not allow reimbursement of pre-Federal award costs.</p><p class="depth0">7. Other Submission Requirements-- Required. This section must  address any other submission requirements not included in the other  paragraphs of this section. This might include the format of submission,  i.e., paper or electronic, for each type of required submission.  Applicants should not be required to submit in more than one format and  this section should indicate whether they may choose whether to submit  applications in hard copy or electronically, may submit only in hard  copy, or may submit only electronically.</p><p class="depth0">This section also must indicate where applications (and any pre- applications) must be submitted if sent by postal mail, electronic  means, or hand-delivery. For postal mail submission, this must include  the name of an office, official, individual or function (e.g.,  application receipt center) and a complete mailing address. For  electronic submission, this must include the URL or email address;  whether a password(s) is required; whether particular software or other  electronic capabilities are required; what to do in the event of system  problems and a point of contact who will be available in the event the  applicant experiences technical difficulties.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\With respect to electronic methods for providing information  about funding opportunities or accepting applicants' submissions of  information, each HHS awarding agency is responsible for compliance with  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">E. Application Review Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Criteria--Required. This section must address the criteria that  the Federal awarding agency will use to evaluate applications. This  includes the merit and other review criteria that evaluators will use to  judge applications, including any statutory, regulatory, or other  preferences (e.g., minority status or Native American tribal  preferences) that will be applied in the review process. These criteria  are distinct from eligibility criteria that are addressed before an  application is accepted for review and any program policy or other  factors that are applied during the selection process, after the review  process is completed. The intent is to make the application process  transparent so applicants can make informed decisions when preparing  their applications to maximize fairness of the process. The announcement  should clearly describe all criteria, including any sub-criteria. If  criteria vary in importance, the announcement should specify the  relative percentages, weights, or other means used to distinguish among  them. For statutory, regulatory, or other preferences, the announcement  should provide a detailed explanation of those preferences with an  explicit indication of their effect (e.g., whether they result in  additional points being assigned).</p><p class="depth0">If an applicant's proposed cost sharing will be considered in the  review process (as opposed to being an eligibility criterion described  in Section C.2), the announcement must specifically address how it will  be considered (e.g., to assign a certain number of additional points to  applicants who offer cost sharing, or to break ties among applications  with equivalent scores after evaluation against all other factors). If  cost sharing will not be considered in the evaluation, the announcement  should say so, so that there is no ambiguity for potential applicants.  Vague statements that cost sharing is encouraged, without clarification  as to what that means, are unhelpful to applicants. It also is important  that the announcement be clear about any restrictions on the types of  cost (e.g., in-kind contributions) that are acceptable as cost sharing.</p><p class="depth0">2. Review and Selection Process--Required. This section may vary in  the level of detail provided. The announcement must list any program  policy or other factors or elements, other than merit criteria, that the  selecting official may use in selecting applications for Federal award  (e.g., geographical dispersion, program balance, or diversity). The HHS  awarding agency may also include other appropriate details. For example,  this section may indicate who is responsible for evaluation against the  merit criteria (e.g., peers external to the HHS awarding agency or HHS  awarding agency personnel) and/or who makes the final selections for  Federal awards. If there is a multi-phase review process (e.g., an  external panel advising internal HHS awarding agency personnel who make  final recommendations to the deciding official), the announcement may  describe the phases. It also may include: the number of people on an  evaluation panel and how it operates, the way reviewers are selected,  reviewer qualifications, and the way that conflicts of interest are  avoided. With respect to electronic methods for providing information  about funding opportunities or accepting applicants' submissions of  information, each HHS awarding agency is responsible for compliance with  Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 794d).</p><p class="depth0">In addition, if the HHS awarding agency permits applicants to  nominate suggested reviewers of their applications or suggest those they  feel may be inappropriate due to a conflict of interest, that  information should be included in this section.</p><p class="depth0">3. Anticipated Announcement and Federal Award Dates--Optional. This  section is intended to provide applicants with information they can use  for planning purposes. If there is a single application deadline  followed by the simultaneous review of all applications, the HHS  awarding agency can include in this section information about the  anticipated dates for announcing or notifying successful and  unsuccessful applicants and for having Federal awards in place. If  applications are received and evaluated on a ``rolling'' basis at  different times during an extended period, it may be appropriate to give  applicants an estimate of the time needed to process an application and  notify the applicant of the Federal awarding agency's decision.</p><p class="depth0">F. Federal Award Administration Information</p><p class="depth0">1. Federal Award Notices--Required. This section must address what a  successful applicant can expect to receive following selection. If the  HHS awarding agency's practice is to provide a separate notice stating  that an application has been selected before it actually makes the  Federal award, this section would be the place to indicate that the  letter is not an authorization to begin performance (to the extent that  it allows charging to Federal awards of pre-award costs at the non- Federal entity's own risk). This section should indicate that the notice  of Federal award signed by the grants officer (or equivalent) is the  authorizing document, and whether it is provided through postal mail or  by electronic means and to whom. It also may address the timing, form,  and content of notifications to unsuccessful applicants. See also Sec.  75.210.</p><p class="depth0">2. Administrative and National Policy Requirements--Required. This  section must identify the usual administrative and national policy  requirements the HHS awarding agency's Federal awards may include.  Providing this information lets a potential applicant identify any  requirements with which it would have difficulty complying if its  application is successful. In those cases, early notification about the  requirements allows the potential applicant to decide not to apply or to  take needed actions before receiving the Federal award. The announcement  need not include all of the terms and conditions of the Federal-award,  but may refer to a document (with information about how to obtain it) or  Internet site where applicants can see the terms and conditions. If this  funding opportunity will lead to Federal awards with some specific terms  and conditions that differ from the HHS awarding agency's usual  (sometimes called ``general'') terms and conditions, this section should  highlight those specific terms and conditions. Doing so will alert  applicants that have received Federal awards from the HHS awarding  agency previously and might not otherwise expect different terms and  conditions. For the same reason, the announcement should inform  potential applicants about special requirements that could apply to  particular Federal awards after the review of applications and other  information, based on the particular circumstances of the effort to be  supported (e.g., if human subjects were to be involved or if some  situations may justify special terms on intellectual property, data  sharing or security requirements).</p><p class="depth0">3. Reporting--Required. This section must include general  information about the type (e.g., financial or performance), frequency,  and means of submission (paper or electronic) of post-Federal award  reporting requirements. Highlight any special reporting requirements for  Federal awards under this funding opportunity that differ (e.g., by  report type, frequency, form/format, or circumstances for use) from what  the HHS awarding agency's Federal awards usually require.</p><p class="depth0">G. HHS Awarding Agency Contact(s)--Required</p><p class="depth0">The announcement must give potential applicants a point(s) of  contact for answering questions or helping with problems while the  funding opportunity is open. The intent of this requirement is to be as  helpful as possible to potential applicants, so the HHS awarding agency  should consider approaches such as giving:</p><p class="depth0">1. Points of contact who may be reached in multiple ways (e.g., by  telephone, FAX, and/or email, as well as regular mail).</p><p class="depth0">2. A fax or email address that multiple people access, so that  someone will respond even if others are unexpectedly absent during  critical periods.</p><p class="depth0">3. Different contacts for distinct kinds of help (e.g., one for  questions of programmatic content and a second for administrative  questions).</p><p class="depth0">H. Other Information--Optional</p><p class="depth0">This section may include any additional information that will assist  a potential applicant. For example, the section might:</p><p class="depth0">1. Indicate whether this is a new program or a one-time initiative.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mention related programs or other upcoming or ongoing HHS  awarding agency funding opportunities for similar activities.</p><p class="depth0">3. Include current Internet addresses for the HHS awarding agency  Web sites that   may be useful to an applicant in understanding the program.</p><p class="depth0">4. Alert applicants to the need to identify proprietary information  and inform them about the way the HHS awarding agency will handle it.</p><p class="depth0">5. Include certain routine notices to applicants (e.g., that the  Federal Government is not obligated to make any Federal award as a  result of the announcement or that only grants officers can bind the  Federal Government to the expenditure of funds).    Sec. Appendix II to Part 75--Contract Provisions for Non-Federal Entity</p><p class="depth0">Contracts Under Federal Awards</p><p class="depth0">In addition to other provisions required by the HHS agency or non- Federal entity, all contracts made by the non-Federal entity under the  Federal award must contain provisions covering the following, as  applicable.</p><p class="depth0">A. Contracts for more than the simplified acquisition threshold  currently set at $150,000, which is the inflation adjusted amount  determined by the Civilian Agency Acquisition Council and the Defense  Acquisition Regulations Council (Councils) as authorized by 41 U.S.C.  1908, must address administrative, contractual, or legal remedies in  instances where contractors violate or breach contract terms, and  provide for such sanctions and penalties as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">B. All contracts in excess of $10,000 must address termination for  cause and for convenience by the non-Federal entity including the manner  by which it will be effected and the basis for settlement.</p><p class="depth0">C. Equal Employment Opportunity. Except as otherwise provided under  41 CFR part 60, all contracts that meet the definition of ``federally  assisted construction contract'' in 41 CFR part 60-1.3 must include the  equal opportunity clause provided under 41 CFR 60-1.4(b), in accordance  with Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 11375, and  implementing regulations at 41 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth0">D. Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 3141-3148). When required  by Federal program legislation, all prime construction contracts in  excess of $2,000 awarded by non-Federal entities must include a  provision for compliance with the Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 3141-3144,  and 3146-3148) as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29  CFR part 5). In accordance with the statute, contractors must be  required to pay wages to laborers and mechanics at a rate not less than  the prevailing wages specified in a wage determination made by the  Secretary of Labor. In addition, contractors must be required to pay  wages not less than once a week. The non-Federal entity must place a  copy of the current prevailing wage determination issued by the  Department of Labor in each solicitation. The decision to award a  contract or subcontract must be conditioned upon the acceptance of the  wage determination. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or  reported violations to the Federal awarding agency. The contracts must  also include a provision for compliance with the Copeland ``Anti- Kickback'' Act (40 U.S.C. 3145), as supplemented by Department of Labor  regulations (29 CFR part 3). The Act provides that each contractor or  subrecipient must be prohibited from inducing, by any means, any person  employed in the construction, completion, or repair of public work, to  give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is otherwise  entitled. The non-Federal entity must report all suspected or reported  violations to the Federal awarding agency.</p><p class="depth0">E. Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (40 U.S.C. 3701- 3708). Where applicable, all contracts awarded by the non-Federal entity  in excess of $100,000 that involve the employment of mechanics or  laborers must include a provision for compliance with 40 U.S.C. 3702 and  3704, as supplemented by Department of Labor regulations (29 CFR part  5). Under 40 U.S.C. 3702 of the Act, each contractor must be required to  compute the wages of every mechanic and laborer on the basis of a  standard work week of 40 hours. Work in excess of the standard work week  is permissible provided that the worker is compensated at a rate of not  less than one and a half times the basic rate of pay for all hours  worked in excess of 40 hours in the work week. The requirements of 40  U.S.C. 3704 are applicable to construction work and provide that no  laborer or mechanic must be required to work in surroundings or under  working conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous. These  requirements do not apply to the purchases of supplies or materials or  articles ordinarily available on the open market, or contracts for  transportation or transmission of intelligence.</p><p class="depth0">F.

Appendix III to Part 75--Indirect (F&A;) Costs Identification and</p><p class="depth0">Assignment, and Rate Determination for Institutions of Higher Education</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">This appendix provides criteria for identifying and computing  indirect (or indirect (F&A;)) rates at IHEs (institutions). Indirect  (F&A;) costs are those that are incurred for common or joint objectives  and therefore cannot be identified readily and specifically with a  particular sponsored project, an instructional activity, or any other  institutional activity. See subsection B.1, for a discussion of the  components of indirect (F&A;) costs.</p><p class="depth0">1. Major Functions of an Institution</p><p class="depth0">Refers to instruction, organized research, other sponsored  activities and other institutional activities as defined in this  section:</p><p class="depth0">a. Instruction means the teaching and training activities of an  institution. Except for research training as provided in subsection b,  this term includes all teaching and training activities, whether they  are offered for credits toward a degree or certificate or on a non- credit basis, and whether they are offered through regular academic  departments or separate divisions, such as a summer school division or  an extension division. Also considered part of this major function are  departmental research, and, where agreed to, university research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sponsored instruction and training means specific instructional  or training activity established by grant, contract, or cooperative  agreement. For purposes of the cost principles, this activity may be  considered a major function even though an institution's accounting  treatment may include it in the instruction function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Departmental research means research, development and scholarly  activities that are not organized research and, consequently, are not  separately budgeted and accounted for. Departmental research, for  purposes of this document, is not considered as a major function, but as  a part of the instruction function of the institution.</p><p class="depth0">b. Organized research means all research and development activities  of an institution that are separately budgeted and accounted for. It  includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sponsored research means all research and development activities  that are sponsored by Federal and non-Federal agencies and  organizations. This term includes activities involving the training of  individuals in research techniques (commonly called research training)  where such activities utilize the same facilities as other research and  development activities and where such activities are not included in the  instruction function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> University research means all research and development  activities that are separately budgeted and accounted for by the  institution under an internal application of institutional funds.  University research, for purposes of this document, must be combined  with sponsored research under the function of organized research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Only mandatory cost sharing or cost sharing specifically  committed in the project budget must be included in the organized  research base for computing the indirect (F&A;) cost rate or reflected in  any allocation of indirect costs. Salary costs above statutory limits  are not considered cost sharing.</p><p class="depth0">c. Other sponsored activities means programs and projects financed  by Federal and non-   Federal agencies and organizations which involve the performance of work  other than instruction and organized research. Examples of such programs  and projects are health service projects and community service programs.  However, when any of these activities are undertaken by the institution  without outside support, they may be classified as other institutional  activities.</p><p class="depth0">d. Other institutional activities means all activities of an  institution except for instruction, departmental research, organized  research, and other sponsored activities, as defined in this section;  indirect (F&A;) cost activities identified in this Appendix paragraph B,  Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A;) costs; and specialized  services facilities described in Sec. 75.468 of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Examples of other institutional activities include operation of  residence halls, dining halls, hospitals and clinics, student unions,  intercollegiate athletics, bookstores, faculty housing, student  apartments, guest houses, chapels, theaters, public museums, and other  similar auxiliary enterprises. This definition also includes any other  categories of activities, costs of which are ``unallowable'' to Federal  awards, unless otherwise indicated in an award.</p><p class="depth0">2. Criteria for Distribution</p><p class="depth0">a. Base period. A base period for distribution of indirect (F&A;)  costs is the period during which the costs are incurred. The base period  normally should coincide with the fiscal year established by the  institution, but in any event the base period should be so selected as  to avoid inequities in the distribution of costs.</p><p class="depth0">b. Need for cost groupings. The overall objective of the indirect  (F&A;) cost allocation process is to distribute the indirect (F&A;) costs  described in Section B, Identification and assignment of indirect (F&A;)  costs, to the major functions of the institution in proportions  reasonably consistent with the nature and extent of their use of the  institution's resources. In order to achieve this objective, it may be  necessary to provide for selective distribution by establishing separate  groupings of cost within one or more of the indirect (F&A;) cost  categories referred to in subsection B.1. In general, the cost groupings  established within a category should constitute, in each case, a pool of  those items of expense that are considered to be of like nature in terms  of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from) the  particular cost objectives to which distribution is appropriate. Cost  groupings should be established considering the general guides provided  in subsection c of this section. Each such pool or cost grouping should  then be distributed individually to the related cost objectives, using  the distribution base or method most appropriate in light of the  guidelines set forth in subsection d of this section.</p><p class="depth0">c. General considerations on cost groupings. The extent to which  separate cost groupings and selective distribution would be appropriate  at an institution is a matter of judgment to be determined on a case-by- case basis. Typical situations which may warrant the establishment of  two or more separate cost groupings (based on account classification or  analysis) within an indirect (F&A;) cost category include but are not  limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If certain items or categories of expense relate solely to one  of the major functions of the institution or to less than all functions,  such expenses should be set aside as a separate cost grouping for direct  assignment or selective allocation in accordance with the guides  provided in subsections b and d.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If any types of expense ordinarily treated as general  administration or departmental administration are charged to Federal  awards as direct costs, expenses applicable to other activities of the  institution when incurred for the same purposes in like circumstances  must, through separate cost groupings, be excluded from the indirect  (F&A;) costs allocable to those Federal awards and included in the direct  cost of other activities for cost allocation purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If it is determined that certain expenses are for the support of  a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement on  a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set  aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to  organized research, instructional, and other activities at the  institution or within the department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If activities provide their own purchasing, personnel  administration, building maintenance or similar service, the  distribution of general administration and general expenses, or  operation and maintenance expenses to such activities should be  accomplished through cost groupings which include only that portion of  central indirect (F&A;) costs (such as for overall management) which are  properly allocable to such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the institution elects to treat fringe benefits as indirect  (F&A;) charges, such costs should be set aside as a separate cost  grouping for selective distribution to related cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The number of separate cost groupings within a category should  be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration the  materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision  attainable through less selective methods of distribution.</p><p class="depth0">d. Selection of distribution method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the  method or base to be used in distributing individual cost   groupings. The essential consideration in selecting a base is that it be  the one best suited for assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives  in accordance with benefits derived; with a traceable cause-and-effect  relationship; or with logic and reason, where neither benefit nor a  cause-and-effect relationship is determinable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a cost grouping can be identified directly with the cost  objective benefitted, it should be assigned to that cost objective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the expenses in a cost grouping are more general in nature,  the distribution may be based on a cost analysis study which results in  an equitable distribution of the costs. Such cost analysis studies may  take into consideration weighting factors, population, or space occupied  if appropriate. Cost analysis studies, however, must (a) be  appropriately documented in sufficient detail for subsequent review by  the cognizant agency for indirect costs, (b) distribute the costs to the  related cost objectives in accordance with the relative benefits  derived, (c) be statistically sound, (d) be performed specifically at  the institution at which the results are to be used, and (e) be reviewed  periodically, but not less frequently than rate negotiations, updated if  necessary, and used consistently. Any assumptions made in the study must  be stated and explained. The use of cost analysis studies and periodic  changes in the method of cost distribution must be fully justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a cost analysis study is not performed, or if the study does  not result in an equitable distribution of the costs, the distribution  must be made in accordance with the appropriate base cited in Section B,  unless one of the following conditions is met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It can be demonstrated that the use of a different base would  result in a more equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more  readily available base would not increase the costs charged to Federal  awards, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The institution qualifies for, and elects to use, the simplified  method for computing indirect (F&A;) cost rates described in Section D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding subsection (3), effective July 1, 1998, a cost  analysis or base other than that in Section B must not be used to  distribute utility or student services costs. Instead, subsections B.4.c  may be used in the recovery of utility costs.</p><p class="depth0">e. Order of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indirect (F&A;) costs are the broad categories of costs discussed  in Section B.1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation, interest expenses, operation and maintenance  expenses, and general administrative and general expenses should be  allocated in that order to the remaining indirect (F&A;) cost categories  as well as to the major functions and specialized service facilities of  the institution. Other cost categories may be allocated in the order  determined to be most appropriate by the institutions. When cross  allocation of costs is made as provided in subsection (3), this order of  allocation does not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Normally an indirect (F&A;) cost category will be considered  closed once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs  may not be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of  costs between two or more indirect (F&A;) cost categories may be used if  such allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If  a cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the  composition of the indirect (F&A;) cost categories described in Section B  is required.</p><p class="depth0">B. Identification and Assignment of Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition of Facilities and Administration</p><p class="depth0">See Sec. 75.414 which provides the basis for these indirect cost  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2. Depreciation</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are the portion of the costs of  the institution's buildings, capital improvements to land and buildings,  and equipment which are computed in accordance with Sec. 75.436.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the  following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a  single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such  buildings, must be assigned to that function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and  on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be  allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the  basis of usable square feet of space, excluding common areas such as  hallways, stairwells, and rest rooms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment  related to space (e.g., individual rooms, laboratories) used jointly by  more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be  treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be  allocated to benefitting functions on the basis of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The employee full-time equivalents (FTEs) or salaries and wages  of those individual functions benefitting from the use of that space; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Institution-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages applicable  to the benefitting major functions (see Section A.1) of the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as  paved parking   areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in the cost of  buildings, must be allocated to user categories of students and  employees on a full-time equivalent basis. The amount allocated to the  student category must be assigned to the instruction function of the  institution. The amount allocated to the employee category must be  further allocated to the major functions of the institution in  proportion to the salaries and wages of all employees applicable to  those functions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interest</p><p class="depth0">Interest on debt associated with certain buildings, equipment and  capital improvements, as defined in Sec. 75.449, must be classified as  an expenditure under the category Facilities. These costs must be  allocated in the same manner as the depreciation on the buildings,  equipment and capital improvements to which the interest relates.</p><p class="depth0">4. Operation and Maintenance Expenses</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for the administration, supervision, operation, maintenance,  preservation, and protection of the institution's physical plant. They  include expenses normally incurred for such items as janitorial and  utility services; repairs and ordinary or normal alterations of  buildings, furniture and equipment; care of grounds; maintenance and  operation of buildings and other plant facilities; security; earthquake  and disaster preparedness; environmental safety; hazardous waste  disposal; property, liability and all other insurance relating to  property; space and capital leasing; facility planning and management;  and central receiving. The operation and maintenance expense category  should also include its allocable share of fringe benefit costs,  depreciation, and interest costs.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be allocated in the same  manner as described in subsection 2.b for depreciation.</p><p class="depth0">c. A utility cost adjustment of up to 1.3 percentage points may be  included in the negotiated indirect cost rate of the IHE for organized  research, per the computation alternatives in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2)  of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where space is devoted to a single function and metering allows  unambiguous measurement of usage related to that space, costs must be  assigned to the function located in that space.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where space is allocated to different functions and metering  does not allow unambiguous measurement of usage by function, costs must  be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Utilities costs should be apportioned to functions in the same  manner as depreciation, based on the calculated difference between the  site or building actual square footage for monitored research laboratory  space (site, building, floor, or room), and a separate calculation  prepared by the IHE using the ``effective square footage'' described in  subsection (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Effective square footage'' allocated to research laboratory  space must be calculated as the actual square footage times the relative  energy utilization index (REUI) posted on the OMB Web site at the time  of a rate determination.</p><p class="depth0">A. This index is the ratio of a laboratory energy use index (lab  EUI) to the corresponding index for overall average college or  university space (college EUI).</p><p class="depth0">B. In July 2012, values for these two indices (taken respectively  from the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory ``Labs for the 21st Century''  benchmarking tool http://labs21benchmarking.lbl.gov/CompareData.php and  the US Department of Energy ``Buildings Energy Databook'' and http:// buildingsdatabook.eren.doe.gov/CBECS.aspx) were 310 kBtu/sq ft-yr. and  155 kBtu/sq ft-yr., so that the adjustment ratio is 2.0 by this  methodology. To retain currency, OMB will adjust the EUI numbers from  time to time (no more often than annually nor less often than every 5  years), using reliable and publicly disclosed data. Current values of  both the EUIs and the REUI will be posted on the OMB Web site.</p><p class="depth0">5. General Administration and General Expenses</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for the general executive and administrative offices of educational  institutions and other expenses of a general character which do not  relate solely to any major function of the institution; i.e., solely to  (1) instruction, (2) organized research, (3) other sponsored activities,  or (4) other institutional activities. The general administration and  general expense category should also include its allocable share of  fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance expense, depreciation,  and interest costs. Examples of general administration and general  expenses include: Those expenses incurred by administrative offices that  serve the entire university system of which the institution is a part;  central offices of the institution such as the President's or  Chancellor's office, the offices for institution-wide financial  management, business services, budget and planning, personnel  management, and safety and risk management; the office of the General  Counsel; and the operations of the central administrative management  information systems. General administration and general expenses must  not include expenses incurred within non-   university-wide deans' offices, academic departments, organized research  units, or similar organizational units. (See subsection 6.)</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be grouped first according  to common major functions of the institution to which they render  services or provide benefits. The aggregate expenses of each group must  then be allocated to serviced or benefitted functions on the modified  total cost basis. Modified total costs consist of the same elements as  those in Section C.2. When an activity included in this indirect (F&A;)  cost category provides a service or product to another institution or  organization, an appropriate adjustment must be made to either the  expenses or the basis of allocation or both, to assure a proper  allocation of costs.</p><p class="depth0">6. Departmental Administration Expenses</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for administrative and supporting services that benefit common or joint  departmental activities or objectives in academic deans' offices,  academic departments and divisions, and organized research units.  Organized research units include such units as institutes, study  centers, and research centers. Departmental administration expenses are  subject to the following limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Academic deans' offices. Salaries and operating expenses are  limited to those attributable to administrative functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Academic departments:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Salaries and fringe benefits attributable to the administrative  work (including bid and proposal preparation) of faculty (including  department heads) and other professional personnel conducting research  and/or instruction, must be allowed at a rate of 3.6 percent of modified  total direct costs. This category does not include professional business  or professional administrative officers. This allowance must be added to  the computation of the indirect (F&A;) cost rate for major functions in  Section C; the expenses covered by the allowance must be excluded from  the departmental administration cost pool. No documentation is required  to support this allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other administrative and supporting expenses incurred within  academic departments are allowable provided they are treated  consistently in like circumstances. This would include expenses such as  the salaries of secretarial and clerical staffs, the salaries of  administrative officers and assistants, travel, office supplies,  stockrooms, and the like.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages  included in subsections (1) and (2) are allowable, as well as an  appropriate share of general administration and general expenses,  operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Federal agencies may authorize reimbursement of additional costs  for department heads and faculty only in exceptional cases where an  institution can demonstrate undue hardship or detriment to project  performance.</p><p class="depth0">b. The following guidelines apply to the determination of  departmental administrative costs as direct or indirect (F&A;) costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In developing the departmental administration cost pool, special  care should be exercised to ensure that costs incurred for the same  purpose in like circumstances are treated consistently as either direct  or indirect (F&A;) costs. For example, salaries of technical staff,  laboratory supplies (e.g., chemicals), telephone toll charges, animals,  animal care costs, computer costs, travel costs, and specialized shop  costs must be treated as direct costs wherever identifiable to a  particular cost objective. Direct charging of these costs may be  accomplished through specific identification of individual costs to  benefitting cost objectives, or through recharge centers or specialized  service facilities, as appropriate under the circumstances. See  Sec. Sec. 75.413(c) and 75.468.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Items such as office supplies, postage, local telephone costs,  and memberships must normally be treated as indirect (F&A;) costs.</p><p class="depth0">c. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The administrative expenses of the dean's office of each college  and school must be allocated to the academic departments within that  college or school on the modified total cost basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The administrative expenses of each academic department, and the  department's share of the expenses allocated in subsection (1) must be  allocated to the appropriate functions of the department on the modified  total cost basis.</p><p class="depth0">7. Sponsored Projects Administration</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are limited to those incurred by  a separate organization(s) established primarily to administer sponsored  projects, including such functions as grant and contract administration  (Federal and non-Federal), special security, purchasing, personnel,  administration, and editing and publishing of research and other  reports. They include the salaries and expenses of the head of such  organization, assistants, and immediate staff, together with the  salaries and expenses of personnel engaged in supporting activities  maintained by the organization, such as stock rooms, print shops, and  the like. This category also includes an allocable share of fringe  benefit costs, general administration and general expenses,   operation and maintenance expenses, and depreciation. Appropriate  adjustments will be made for services provided to other functions or  organizations.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be allocated to the major  functions of the institution under which the sponsored projects are  conducted on the basis of the modified total cost of sponsored projects.</p><p class="depth0">c. An appropriate adjustment must be made to eliminate any duplicate  charges to Federal awards when this category includes similar or  identical activities as those included in the general administration and  general expense category or other indirect (F&A;) cost items, such as  accounting, procurement, or personnel administration.</p><p class="depth0">8. Library Expenses</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for the operation of the library, including the cost of books and  library materials purchased for the library, less any items of library  income that qualify as applicable credits under Sec. 75.406. The  library expense category should also include the fringe benefits  applicable to the salaries and wages included therein, an appropriate  share of general administration and general expense, operation and  maintenance expense, and depreciation. Costs incurred in the purchases  of rare books (museum-type books) with no value to Federal awards should  not be allocated to them.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses included in this category must be allocated first on the  basis of primary categories of users, including students, professional  employees, and other users.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The student category must consist of full-time equivalent  students enrolled at the institution, regardless of whether they earn  credits toward a degree or certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The professional employee category must consist of all faculty  members and other professional employees of the institution, on a full- time equivalent basis. This category may also include post-doctorate  fellows and graduate students.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The other users category must consist of a reasonable factor as  determined by institutional records to account for all other users of  library facilities.</p><p class="depth0">c. Amount allocated in paragraph b of this section must be assigned  further as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount in the student category must be assigned to the  instruction function of the institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount in the professional employee category must be  assigned to the major functions of the institution in proportion to the  salaries and wages of all faculty members and other professional  employees applicable to those functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount in the other users category must be assigned to the  other institutional activities function of the institution.</p><p class="depth0">9. Student Administration and Services</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for the administration of student affairs and for services to students,  including expenses of such activities as deans of students, admissions,  registrar, counseling and placement services, student advisers, student  health and infirmary services, catalogs, and commencements and  convocations. The salaries of members of the academic staff whose  responsibilities to the institution require administrative work that  benefits sponsored projects may also be included to the extent that the  portion charged to student administration is determined in accordance  with Subpart E of this part. This expense category also includes the  fringe benefit costs applicable to the salaries and wages included  therein, an appropriate share of general administration and general  expenses, operation and maintenance, interest expense, and depreciation.</p><p class="depth0">b. In the absence of the alternatives provided for in Section A.2.d,  the expenses in this category must be allocated to the instruction  function, and subsequently to Federal awards in that function.</p><p class="depth0">10. Offset for Indirect (F&A;) Expenses Otherwise Provided for by the</p><p class="depth0">Federal Government</p><p class="depth0">a. The items to be accumulated under this heading are the  reimbursements and other payments from the Federal Government which are  made to the institution to support solely, specifically, and directly,  in whole or in part, any of the administrative or service activities  described in subsections 2 through 9.</p><p class="depth0">b. The items in this group must be treated as a credit to the  affected individual indirect (F&A;) cost category before that category is  allocated to benefitting functions.</p><p class="depth0">C. Determination and Application of Indirect (F&A;) Cost Rate or Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect (F&A;) Cost Pools</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to subsection b, the separate categories of indirect  (F&A;) costs allocated to each major function of the institution as  prescribed in Section B of this paragraph C.1-, must be aggregated and  treated as a common pool for that function. The amount in each pool must  be divided by the distribution base described in subsection 2 to arrive  at a single indirect (F&A;) cost rate for each function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rate for each function is used to distribute indirect (F&A;)  costs to individual Federal awards of that function. Since a common pool  is established for each major   function of the institution, a separate indirect (F&A;) cost rate would  be established for each of the major functions described in Section A.1  under which Federal awards are carried out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each institution's indirect (F&A;) cost rate process must be  appropriately designed to ensure that Federal sponsors do not in any way  subsidize the indirect (F&A;) costs of other sponsors, specifically  activities sponsored by industry and foreign governments. Accordingly,  each allocation method used to identify and allocate the indirect (F&A;)  cost pools, as described in Sections A.2, and B.2 through B.9, must  contain the full amount of the institution's modified total costs or  other appropriate units of measurement used to make the computations. In  addition, the final rate distribution base (as defined in subsection 2)  for each major function (organized research, instruction, etc., as  described in Section A.1) must contain all the programs or activities  which utilize the indirect (F&A;) costs allocated to that major function.  At the time an indirect (F&A;) cost proposal is submitted to a cognizant  agency for indirect costs, each institution must describe the process it  uses to ensure that Federal funds are not used to subsidize industry and  foreign government funded programs.</p><p class="depth0">b. In some instances a single rate basis for use across the board on  all work within a major function at an institution may not be  appropriate. A single rate for research, for example, might not take  into account those different environmental factors and other conditions  which may affect substantially the indirect (F&A;) costs applicable to a  particular segment of research at the institution. A particular segment  of research may be that performed under a single sponsored agreement or  it may consist of research under a group of Federal awards performed in  a common environment. The environmental factors are not limited to the  physical location of the work. Other important factors are the level of  the administrative support required, the nature of the facilities or  other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or technical skills  involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any combination  thereof. If a particular segment of a sponsored agreement is performed  within an environment which appears to generate a significantly  different level of indirect (F&A;) costs, provisions should be made for a  separate indirect (F&A;) cost pool applicable to such work. The separate  indirect (F&A;) cost pool should be developed during the regular course  of the rate determination process and the separate indirect (F&A;) cost  rate resulting therefrom should be utilized; provided it is determined  that (1) such indirect (F&A;) cost rate differs significantly from that  which would have been obtained under subsection a, and (2) the volume of  work to which such rate would apply is material in relation to other  Federal awards at the institution.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Distribution Basis</p><p class="depth0">Indirect (F&A;) costs must be distributed to applicable Federal  awards and other benefitting activities within each major function (see  section A.1, Major functions of an institution) on the basis of modified  total direct costs (MTDC), consisting of all salaries and wages, fringe  benefits, materials and supplies, services, travel, and up to the first  $25,000 of each subaward (regardless of the period covered by the  subaward). MTDC is defined in Sec. 75.2. For this purpose, an indirect  (F&A;) cost rate should be determined for each of the separate indirect  (F&A;) cost pools developed pursuant to subsection 1. The rate in each  case should be stated as the percentage which the amount of the  particular indirect (F&A;) cost pool is of the modified total direct  costs identified with such pool.</p><p class="depth0">3. Negotiated Lump Sum for Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect (F&A;) costs may be  appropriate for self-contained, off-campus, or primarily subcontracted  activities where the benefits derived from an institution's indirect  (F&A;) services cannot be readily determined. Such negotiated indirect  (F&A;) costs will be treated as an offset before allocation to  instruction, organized research, other sponsored activities, and other  institutional activities. The base on which such remaining expenses are  allocated should be appropriately adjusted.</p><p class="depth0">4. Predetermined Rates for Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">Public Law 87-638 (76 Stat. 437) as amended (41 U.S.C. 4708)  authorizes the use of predetermined rates in determining the ``indirect  costs'' (indirect (F&A;) costs) applicable under research agreements with  educational institutions. The stated objectives of the law are to  simplify the administration of cost-type research and development  contracts (including grants) with educational institutions, to  facilitate the preparation of their budgets, and to permit more  expeditious closeout of such contracts when the work is completed. In  view of the potential advantages offered by this procedure, negotiation  of predetermined rates for indirect (F&A;) costs for a period of two to  four years should be the norm in those situations where the cost  experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed sufficient to  enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment as to the  probable level of indirect (F&A;) costs during the ensuing accounting  periods.</p><p class="depth0">5. Negotiated Fixed Rates and Carry-Forward Provisions</p><p class="depth0">When a fixed rate is negotiated in advance for a fiscal year (or  other time period), the over- or under-recovery for that year may be  included as an adjustment to the indirect (F&A;) cost for the next rate  negotiation. When the rate is negotiated before the carry-forward  adjustment is determined, the carry-forward amount may be applied to the  next subsequent rate negotiation. When such adjustments are to be made,  each fixed rate negotiated in advance for a given period will be  computed by applying the expected indirect (F&A;) costs allocable to  Federal awards for the forecast period plus or minus the carry-forward  adjustment (over- or under-recovery) from the prior period, to the  forecast distribution base. Unrecovered amounts under lump-sum  agreements or cost-sharing provisions of prior years must not be carried  forward for consideration in the new rate negotiation. There must,  however, be an advance understanding in each case between the  institution and the cognizant agency for indirect costs as to whether  these differences will be considered in the rate negotiation rather than  making the determination after the differences are known. Further,  institutions electing to use this carry-forward provision may not  subsequently change without prior approval of the cognizant agency for  indirect costs. In the event that an institution returns to a post- determined rate, any over- or under-recovery during the period in which  negotiated fixed rates and carry-forward provisions were followed will  be included in the subsequent post-determined rates. Where multiple  rates are used, the same procedure will be applicable for determining  each rate.</p><p class="depth0">6. Provisional and Final Rates for Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">Where the cognizant agency for indirect costs determines that cost  experience and other pertinent facts do not justify the use of  predetermined rates, or a fixed rate with a carry-forward, or if the  parties cannot agree on an equitable rate, a provisional rate must be  established. To prevent substantial overpayment or underpayment, the  provisional rate may be adjusted by the cognizant agency for indirect  costs during the institution's fiscal year. Predetermined or fixed rates  may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of the  institution's fiscal year. If a provisional rate is not replaced by a  predetermined or fixed rate prior to the end of the institution's fiscal  year, a final rate will be established and upward or downward  adjustments will be made based on the actual allowable costs incurred  for the period involved.</p><p class="depth0">7. Fixed Rates for the Life of the Sponsored Agreement</p><p class="depth0">a. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of Sec. 75.414 Federal  agencies must use the negotiated rates for indirect (F&A;) costs in  effect at the time of the initial award throughout the life of the  Federal award. Award levels for Federal awards may not be adjusted in  future years as a result of changes in negotiated rates. ``Negotiated  rates'' per the rate agreement include final, fixed, and predetermined  rates and exclude provisional rates. ``Life'' for the purpose of this  subsection means each competitive segment of a project. A competitive  segment is a period of years approved by the Federal awarding agency at  the time of the Federal award. If negotiated rate agreements do not  extend through the life of the Federal award at the time of the initial  award, then the negotiated rate for the last year of the Federal award  must be extended through the end of the life of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth0">b. Except as provided in Sec. 75.414, when an educational  institution does not have a negotiated rate with the Federal Government  at the time of an award (because the educational institution is a new  recipient or the parties cannot reach agreement on a rate), the  provisional rate used at the time of the award must be adjusted once a  rate is negotiated and approved by the cognizant agency for indirect  costs.</p><p class="depth0">8. Limitation on Reimbursement of Administrative Costs</p><p class="depth0">a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, the  administrative costs charged to Federal awards awarded or amended  (including continuation and renewal awards) with effective dates  beginning on or after the start of the institution's first fiscal year  which begins on or after October 1, 1991, must be limited to 26% of  modified total direct costs (as defined in subsection 2) for the total  of General Administration and General Expenses, Departmental  Administration, Sponsored Projects Administration, and Student  Administration and Services (including their allocable share of  depreciation, interest costs, operation and maintenance expenses, and  fringe benefits costs, as provided by Section B, Identification and  assignment of indirect (F&A;) costs, and all other types of expenditures  not listed specifically under one of the subcategories of facilities in  Section B.</p><p class="depth0">b. Institutions should not change their accounting or cost  allocation methods if the effect is to change the charging of a  particular type of cost from F&A; to direct, or to reclassify costs, or  increase allocations from the administrative pools identified in  paragraph B.1 of this Appendix to the other F&A; cost pools or fringe  benefits. Cognizant agencies for indirect cost are authorized to allow   changes where an institution's charging practices are at variance with  acceptable practices followed by a substantial majority of other  institutions.</p><p class="depth0">9. Alternative Method for Administrative Costs</p><p class="depth0">a. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection C.1.a, an  institution may elect to claim a fixed allowance for the  ``Administration'' portion of indirect (F&A;) costs. The allowance could  be either 24% of modified total direct costs or a percentage equal to  95% of the most recently negotiated fixed or predetermined rate for the  cost pools included under ``Administration'' as defined in Section B.1,  whichever is less. Under this alternative, no cost proposal need be  prepared for the ``Administration'' portion of the indirect (F&A;) cost  rate nor is further identification or documentation of these costs  required (see subsection c). Where a negotiated indirect (F&A;) cost  agreement includes this alternative, an institution must make no further  charges for the expenditure categories described in Section B.5, Section  B.6, Section B.7, and Section B.9.</p><p class="depth0">b. In negotiations of rates for subsequent periods, an institution  that has elected the option of subsection a may continue to exercise it  at the same rate without further identification or documentation of  costs.</p><p class="depth0">c. If an institution elects to accept a threshold rate as defined in  subsection a of this section, it is not required to perform a detailed  analysis of its administrative costs. However, in order to compute the  facilities components of its indirect (F&A;) cost rate, the institution  must reconcile its indirect (F&A;) cost proposal to its financial  statements and make appropriate adjustments and reclassifications to  identify the costs of each major function as defined in Section A.1, as  well as to identify and allocate the facilities components.  Administrative costs that are not identified as such by the  institution's accounting system (such as those incurred in academic  departments) will be classified as instructional costs for purposes of  reconciling indirect (F&A;) cost proposals to financial statements and  allocating facilities costs.</p><p class="depth0">10. Individual Rate Components</p><p class="depth0">In order to provide mutually agreed-upon information for management  purposes, each indirect (F&A;) cost rate negotiation or determination  must include development of a rate for each indirect (F&A;) cost pool as  well as the overall indirect (F&A;) cost rate.</p><p class="depth0">11. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect (F&A;) Rate</p><p class="depth0">a. Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in Sec. 75.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cost negotiation cognizance is assigned to the Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS) or the Department of Defense's Office of  Naval Research (DOD), normally depending on which of the two agencies  (HHS or DOD) provides more funds to the educational institution for the  most recent three years. Information on funding must be derived from  relevant data gathered by the National Science Foundation. In cases  where neither HHS nor DOD provides Federal funding to an educational  institution, the cognizant agency for indirect costs assignment must  default to HHS. Notwithstanding the method for cognizance determination  described in this section, other arrangements for cognizance of a  particular educational institution may also be based in part on the  types of research performed at the educational institution and must be  decided based on mutual agreement between HHS and DOD. Where a non- Federal entity only receives funds as a subrecipient, see the  requirements of Sec. 75.352.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After cognizance is established, it must continue for a five- year period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Acceptance of rates. See Sec. 75.414.</p><p class="depth0">c. Correcting deficiencies. The cognizant agency for indirect costs  must negotiate changes needed to correct systems deficiencies relating  to accountability for Federal awards. Cognizant agencies for indirect  costs must address the concerns of other affected agencies, as  appropriate, and must negotiate special rates for Federal agencies that  are required to limit recovery of indirect costs by statute.</p><p class="depth0">d. Resolving questioned costs. The cognizant agency for indirect  costs must conduct any necessary negotiations with an educational  institution regarding amounts questioned by audit that are due the  Federal Government related to costs covered by a negotiated agreement.</p><p class="depth0">e. Reimbursement. Reimbursement to cognizant agencies for indirect  costs for work performed under this Part may be made by reimbursement  billing under the Economy Act, 31 U.S.C. 1535.</p><p class="depth0">f. Procedure for establishing facilities and administrative rates  must be established by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect costs is  responsible for negotiating and approving rates for an educational  institution on behalf of all Federal agencies. Federal awarding agencies  that do not have cognizance for indirect costs must notify the cognizant  agency for indirect costs of specific concerns (i.e., a need to  establish special cost rates) which could affect the negotiation  process. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must address the  concerns of all interested agencies, as appropriate. A pre-negotiation  conference may be scheduled among all interested agencies, if necessary.  The cognizant agency for indirect   costs must then arrange a negotiation conference with the educational  institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other than formal negotiation. The cognizant agency for indirect  costs and educational institution may reach an agreement on rates  without a formal negotiation conference; for example, through  correspondence or use of the simplified method described in this section  D of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">g. Formalizing determinations and agreements. The cognizant agency  for indirect costs must formalize all determinations or agreements  reached with an educational institution and provide copies to other  agencies having an interest. Determinations should include a description  of any adjustments, the actual amount, both dollar and percentage  adjusted, and the reason for making adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">h. Disputes and disagreements. Where the cognizant agency for  indirect costs is unable to reach agreement with an educational  institution with regard to rates or audit resolution, the appeal system  of the cognizant agency for indirect costs must be followed for  resolution of the disagreement.</p><p class="depth0">12. Standard Format for Submission</p><p class="depth0">For facilities and administrative (indirect (F&A;)) rate proposals,  educational institutions must use the standard format, shown in section  E of this appendix, to submit their indirect (F&A;) rate proposal to the  cognizant agency for indirect costs. The cognizant agency for indirect  costs may, on an institution-by-institution basis, grant exceptions from  all or portions of Part II of the standard format requirement. This  requirement does not apply to educational institutions that use the  simplified method for calculating indirect (F&A;) rates, as described in  Section D of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">As provided in section C.10, each F&A; cost rate negotiation or  determination must include development of a rate for each F&A; cost pool  as well as the overall F&A; rate.</p><p class="depth0">D. Simplified Method for Small Institutions</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">a. Where the total direct cost of work covered by this part 75 at an  institution does not exceed $10 million in a fiscal year, the simplified  procedure described in subsections 2 or 3 may be used in determining  allowable indirect (F&A;) costs. Under this simplified procedure, the  institution's most recent annual financial report and immediately  available supporting information must be utilized as a basis for  determining the indirect (F&A;) cost rate applicable to all Federal  awards. The institution may use either the salaries and wages (see  subsection 2) or modified total direct costs (see subsection 3) as the  distribution basis.</p><p class="depth0">b. The simplified procedure should not be used where it produces  results which appear inequitable to the Federal Government or the  institution. In any such case, indirect (F&A;) costs should be determined  through use of the regular procedure.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simplified Procedure--Salaries and Wages Base</p><p class="depth0">a. Establish the total amount of salaries and wages paid to all  employees of the institution.</p><p class="depth0">b. Establish an indirect (F&A;) cost pool consisting of the  expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically  identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the  following titles or their equivalents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs  of student administration and services, student activities, student aid,  and scholarships).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation  (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other  institutional activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Library.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20  percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments.</p><p class="depth0">In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1)  have previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they  may be included in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool. The total amount of  salaries and wages included in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool must be  separately identified.</p><p class="depth0">c. Establish a salary and wage distribution base, determined by  deducting from the total of salaries and wages as established in  subsection a. from the amount of salaries and wages included under  subsection b.</p><p class="depth0">d. Establish the indirect (F&A;) cost rate, determined by dividing  the amount in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount  of the distribution base, subsection c.</p><p class="depth0">e. Apply the indirect (F&A;) cost rate to direct salaries and wages  for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect (F&A;)  costs allocable to such agreements.</p><p class="depth0">3. Simplified Procedure--Modified Total Direct Cost Base</p><p class="depth0">a. Establish the total costs incurred by the institution for the  base period.</p><p class="depth0">b. Establish an indirect (F&A;) cost pool consisting of the  expenditures (exclusive of capital items and other costs specifically  identified as unallowable) which customarily are classified under the  following titles or their equivalents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General administration and general expenses (exclusive of costs  of student administration and services, student activities, student aid,  and scholarships).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Operation and maintenance of physical plant and depreciation  (after appropriate adjustment for costs applicable to other  institutional activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Library.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Department administration expenses, which will be computed as 20  percent of the salaries and expenses of deans and heads of departments.  In those cases where expenditures classified under subsection (1) have  previously been allocated to other institutional activities, they may be  included in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool. The modified total direct  costs amount included in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool must be separately  identified.</p><p class="depth0">c. Establish a modified total direct cost distribution base, as  defined in Section C.2, that consists of all institution's direct  functions.</p><p class="depth0">d. Establish the indirect (F&A;) cost rate, determined by dividing  the amount in the indirect (F&A;) cost pool, subsection b, by the amount  of the distribution base, subsection c.</p><p class="depth0">e. Apply the indirect (F&A;) cost rate to the modified total direct  costs for individual agreements to determine the amount of indirect  (F&A;) costs allocable to such agreements.</p><p class="depth0">E. Documentation Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The standard format for documentation requirements for indirect  (indirect (F&A;)) rate proposals for claiming costs under the regular  method is available on the OMB Web site here: http://www.whitehouse.gov/ omb/grants_forms.</p><p class="depth0">F.

Appendix IV to Part 75--Indirect (F&A;) Costs Identification and</p><p class="depth0">Assignment, and Rate Determination for Nonprofit Organizations</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or  joint objectives and cannot be readily identified with a particular  final cost objective. Direct cost of minor amounts may be treated as  indirect costs under the conditions described in Sec. 75.413(d). After  direct costs have been determined and assigned directly to awards or  other work as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to be  allocated to benefitting cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated to  a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for the  same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal  award as a direct cost.</p><p class="depth0">``Major nonprofit organizations'' are defined in Sec. 75.414. See  indirect cost rate reporting requirements in sections B.2.e and B.3.g of  this Appendix.  B. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">a. If a nonprofit organization has only one major function, or where  all its major functions benefit from its indirect costs to approximately  the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs and the computation of  an indirect cost rate may be accomplished through simplified allocation  procedures, as described in section B.2 of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. If an organization has several major functions which benefit from  its indirect costs in varying degrees, allocation of indirect costs may  require the accumulation of such costs into separate cost groupings  which then are allocated individually to benefitting functions by means  of a base which best measures the relative degree of benefit. The  indirect costs allocated to each function are then distributed to  individual Federal awards and other activities included in that function  by means of an indirect cost rate(s).</p><p class="depth0">c. The determination of what constitutes an organization's major  functions will depend on its purpose in being; the types of services it  renders to the public, its clients, and its members; and the amount of  effort it devotes to such activities as fundraising, public information  and membership activities.</p><p class="depth0">d. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing  indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method  should be used are described in section B.2 through B.5 of this  Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">e. The base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the  period in which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation  to work performed in that period. The base period normally should  coincide with the organization's fiscal year but, in any event, must be  so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of the costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simplified Allocation Method</p><p class="depth0">a. Where an organization's major functions benefit from its indirect  costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of indirect costs  may be accomplished by (i) separating the organization's total costs for  the base period as either direct or indirect, and (ii) dividing the  total allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an  equitable distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect  cost rate which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual  Federal awards. The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the  total amount of allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected.  This method should also be used where an organization has only one major  function encompassing a number of individual projects or activities, and  may be used where the level of Federal awards to an organization is  relatively small.</p><p class="depth0">b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital  expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs which  represent activities must be included in the direct costs under the  conditions described in Sec. 75.413(e).</p><p class="depth0">c. The distribution base may be total direct costs (excluding  capital expenditures and other distorting items, such contracts or  subawards for $25,000 or more), direct salaries and wages, or other base  which results in an equitable distribution. The distribution base must  exclude participant support costs as defined in Sec. 75.2.</p><p class="depth0">d. Except where a special rate(s) is required in accordance with  section B.5 of this Appendix, the indirect cost rate developed under the  above principles is applicable to all Federal awards of the  organization. If a special rate(s) is required, appropriate  modifications must be made in order to develop the special rate(s).</p><p class="depth0">e. For an organization that receives more than $10 million in  Federal funding of direct costs in a fiscal year, a breakout of the  indirect cost component into two broad categories, Facilities and  Administration as defined in section A.3 of this Appendix, is required.  The rate in each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount  of the particular indirect cost category (i.e., Facilities or  Administration) is of the distribution base identified with that  category.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple Allocation Base Method</p><p class="depth0">a. General. Where an organization's indirect costs benefit its major  functions in varying degrees, indirect costs must be accumulated into  separate cost groupings, as described in subparagraph b. Each grouping  must then be allocated individually to benefitting functions by means of  a base which best measures the relative benefits. The default allocation  bases by cost pool are described in section B.3.c of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">b. Identification of indirect costs. Cost groupings must be  established so as to permit the allocation of each grouping on the basis  of benefits provided to the major functions. Each grouping must  constitute a pool of expenses that are of like character in terms of  functions they benefit and in terms of the allocation base which best  measures the relative benefits provided to each function. The groupings  are classified within the two broad categories: ``Facilities'' and  ``Administration,'' as described in section A.3 of this Appendix. The  indirect cost pools are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depreciation. The expenses under this heading are the portion of  the costs of the organization's buildings, capital improvements to land  and buildings, and equipment which are computed in accordance with Sec.  75.436 .</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest. Interest on debt associated with certain buildings,  equipment and capital improvements are computed in accordance with Sec.  75.449.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operation and maintenance expenses. The expenses under this  heading are those that have been incurred for the administration,  operation, maintenance, preservation, and protection of the  organization's physical plant. They include expenses normally incurred  for such items as: janitorial and utility services; repairs and ordinary  or normal alterations of buildings, furniture and equipment; care of  grounds; maintenance and operation of buildings and other plant  facilities; security; earthquake and disaster preparedness;  environmental safety; hazardous waste disposal; property, liability and  other insurance relating to property; space and capital leasing;  facility planning and management; and central receiving. The operation  and maintenance expenses category must also include its allocable share  of fringe benefit costs, depreciation, and interest costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General administration and general expenses. The expenses under  this heading are those that have been incurred for the overall general  executive and administrative offices of the organization and other  expenses of a general nature which do not relate solely to any major  function of the organization. This category must also include its  allocable share of fringe benefit costs, operation and maintenance  expense, depreciation, and interest costs. Examples of this category  include central offices, such as the director's office, the office of  finance, business services, budget and planning, personnel, safety and  risk management, general counsel, management information systems, and  library costs.</p><p class="depth0">In developing this cost pool, special care should be exercised to  ensure that costs incurred for the same purpose in like circumstances  are treated consistently as either direct or indirect costs. For  example, salaries of technical staff, project supplies, project  publication, telephone toll charges, computer costs, travel costs, and  specialized services costs must be treated as direct costs wherever  identifiable to a particular program. The salaries and wages of  administrative and pooled clerical staff should normally be treated as  indirect costs. Direct charging of these costs may be appropriate as  described in Sec. 75.413. Items such as office supplies, postage, local  telephone costs, periodicals and memberships should normally be treated  as indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">c. Allocation bases. Actual conditions must be taken into account in  selecting the base to be used in allocating the expenses in each  grouping to benefitting functions. The essential consideration in  selecting a method or a base is that it is the one best suited for  assigning the pool of costs to cost objectives in accordance with  benefits derived; a traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic  and reason, where neither the cause nor the effect of the relationship  is determinable. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a cost  grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must be  made in that manner. When the expenses in a cost grouping are more  general in nature, the allocation must be made through the use of a  selected base which produces results that are equitable to both the  Federal Government and the organization. The distribution must be made  in accordance with the bases described herein unless it can be  demonstrated that the use of a different base would result in a more  equitable allocation of the costs, or that a more readily available base  would not increase the costs charged to Federal awards. The results of  special cost studies (such as an engineering utility study) must not be  used to determine and allocate the indirect costs to Federal awards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depreciation. Depreciation expenses must be allocated in the  following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Depreciation on buildings used exclusively in the conduct of a  single function, and on capital improvements and equipment used in such  buildings, must be assigned to that function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Depreciation on buildings used for more than one function, and  on capital improvements and equipment used in such buildings, must be  allocated to the individual functions performed in each building on the  basis of   usable square feet of space, excluding common areas, such as hallways,  stairwells, and restrooms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Depreciation on buildings, capital improvements and equipment  related space (e.g., individual rooms, and laboratories) used jointly by  more than one function (as determined by the users of the space) must be  treated as follows. The cost of each jointly used unit of space must be  allocated to the benefitting functions on the basis of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the employees and other users on a full-time equivalent (FTE)  basis or salaries and wages of those individual functions benefitting  from the use of that space; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> organization-wide employee FTEs or salaries and wages  applicable to the benefitting functions of the organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Depreciation on certain capital improvements to land, such as  paved parking areas, fences, sidewalks, and the like, not included in  the cost of buildings, must be allocated to user categories on a FTE  basis and distributed to major functions in proportion to the salaries  and wages of all employees applicable to the functions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interest. Interest costs must be allocated in the same manner as  the depreciation on the buildings, equipment and capital equipment to  which the interest relates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Operation and maintenance expenses. Operation and maintenance  expenses must be allocated in the same manner as the depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> General administration and general expenses. General  administration and general expenses must be allocated to benefitting  functions based on modified total costs (MTC). The MTC is the modified  total direct costs (MTDC), as described in Sec. 75.2, plus the  allocated indirect cost proportion. The expenses included in this  category could be grouped first according to major functions of the  organization to which they render services or provide benefits. The  aggregate expenses of each group must then be allocated to benefitting  functions based on MTC.</p><p class="depth0">d. Order of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indirect cost categories consisting of depreciation, interest,  operation and maintenance, and general administration and general  expenses must be allocated in that order to the remaining indirect cost  categories as well as to the major functions of the organization. Other  cost categories should be allocated in the order determined to be most  appropriate by the organization. This order of allocation does not apply  if cross allocation of costs is made as provided in section B.3.d.2 of  this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Normally, an indirect cost category will be considered closed  once it has been allocated to other cost objectives, and costs must not  be subsequently allocated to it. However, a cross allocation of costs  between two or more indirect costs categories could be used if such  allocation will result in a more equitable allocation of costs. If a  cross allocation is used, an appropriate modification to the composition  of the indirect cost categories is required.</p><p class="depth0">e. Application of indirect cost rate or rates. Except where a  special indirect cost rate(s) is required in accordance with section B.5  of this Appendix, the separate groupings of indirect costs allocated to  each major function must be aggregated and treated as a common pool for  that function. The costs in the common pool must then be distributed to  individual Federal awards included in that function by use of a single  indirect cost rate.</p><p class="depth0">f. Distribution basis. Indirect costs must be distributed to  applicable Federal awards and other benefitting activities within each  major function on the basis of MTDC (see definition in Sec. 75.2).</p><p class="depth0">g. Individual Rate Components. An indirect cost rate must be  determined for each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in  each case must be stated as the percentage which the amount of the  particular indirect cost pool is of the distribution base identified  with that pool. Each indirect cost rate negotiation or determination  agreement must include development of the rate for each indirect cost  pool as well as the overall indirect cost rate. The indirect cost pools  must be classified within two broad categories: ``Facilities'' and  ``Administration,'' as described in section A.3 of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">4. Direct Allocation Method</p><p class="depth0">a. Some nonprofit organizations treat all costs as direct costs  except general administration and general expenses. These organizations  generally separate their costs into three basic categories: (i) General  administration and general expenses, (ii) fundraising, and (iii) other  direct functions (including projects performed under Federal awards).  Joint costs, such as depreciation, rental costs, operation and  maintenance of facilities, telephone expenses, and the like are prorated  individually as direct costs to each category and to each Federal award  or other activity using a base most appropriate to the particular cost  being prorated.</p><p class="depth0">b. This method is acceptable, provided each joint cost is prorated  using a base which accurately measures the benefits provided to each  Federal award or other activity. The bases must be established in  accordance with reasonable criteria, and be supported by current data.  This method is compatible with the Standards of Accounting and Financial  Reporting for Voluntary Health and Welfare Organizations issued jointly  by the National Health Council, Inc., the National Assembly of Voluntary  Health and Social Welfare Organizations, and the United Way of America.</p><p class="depth0">c. Under this method, indirect costs consist exclusively of general  administration and general expenses. In all other respects, the  organization's indirect cost rates must   be computed in the same manner as that described in section B.2 of this  Appendix.</p><p class="depth0">5. Special Indirect Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities of  an organization or for each major function of the organization may not  be appropriate, since it would not take into account those different  factors which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to  a particular segment of work. For this purpose, a particular segment of  work may be that performed under a single Federal award or it may  consist of work under a group of Federal awards performed in a common  environment. These factors may include the physical location of the  work, the level of administrative support required, the nature of the  facilities or other resources employed, the scientific disciplines or  technical skills involved, the organizational arrangements used, or any  combination thereof. When a particular segment of work is performed in  an environment which appears to generate a significantly different level  of indirect costs, provisions should be made for a separate indirect  cost pool applicable to such work. The separate indirect cost pool  should be developed during the course of the regular allocation process,  and the separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used,  provided it is determined that (i) the rate differs significantly from  that which would have been obtained under sections B.2, B.3, and B.4 of  this Appendix, and (ii) the volume of work to which the rate would apply  is material.</p><p class="depth0">C. Negotiation and Approval of Indirect Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">As used in this section, the following terms have the meanings set  forth in this section:</p><p class="depth0">a. Cognizant agency for indirect costs means the Federal agency  responsible for negotiating and approving indirect cost rates for a  nonprofit organization on behalf of all Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth0">b. Predetermined rate means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a  specified current or future period, usually the organization's fiscal  year. The rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be incurred  during the period. A predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">c. Fixed rate means an indirect cost rate which has the same  characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference  between the estimated costs and the actual costs of the period covered  by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the rate computation  of a subsequent period.</p><p class="depth0">d. Final rate means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified  past period which is based on the actual costs of the period. A final  rate is not subject to adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">e. Provisional rate or billing rate means a temporary indirect cost  rate applicable to a specified period which is used for funding, interim  reimbursement, and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending  the establishment of a final rate for the period.</p><p class="depth0">f. Indirect cost proposal means the documentation prepared by an  organization to substantiate its claim for the reimbursement of indirect  costs. This proposal provides the basis for the review and negotiation  leading to the establishment of an organization's indirect cost rate.</p><p class="depth0">g. Cost objective means a function, organizational subdivision,  contract, Federal award, or other work unit for which cost data are  desired and for which provision is made to accumulate and measure the  cost of processes, projects, jobs and capitalized projects.</p><p class="depth0">2. Negotiation and Approval of Rates</p><p class="depth0">a. Unless different arrangements are agreed to by the Federal  agencies concerned, the Federal agency with the largest dollar value of  Federal awards with an organization will be designated as the cognizant  agency for indirect costs for the negotiation and approval of the  indirect cost rates and, where necessary, other rates such as fringe  benefit and computer charge-out rates. Once an agency is assigned  cognizance for a particular nonprofit organization, the assignment will  not be changed unless there is a shift in the dollar volume of the  Federal awards to the organization for at least three years. All  concerned Federal agencies must be given the opportunity to participate  in the negotiation process but, after a rate has been agreed upon, it  will be accepted by all Federal agencies. When a Federal agency has  reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal  awards necessitate special indirect cost rates in accordance with  section B.5 of this Appendix, it will, prior to the time the rates are  negotiated, notify the cognizant agency for indirect costs. (See also  Sec. 75.414.) Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a  subrecipient, see the requirements of Sec. 75.352.</p><p class="depth0">b. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 75.414(e), a nonprofit  organization which has not previously established an indirect cost rate  with a Federal agency must submit its initial indirect cost proposal  immediately after the organization is advised that a Federal award will  be made and, in no event, later than three months after the effective  date of the Federal award.</p><p class="depth0">c. Unless approved by the cognizant agency for indirect costs in  accordance with Sec. 75.414(f), organizations that have previously  established indirect cost rates must submit a new indirect cost proposal  to the cognizant agency for indirect costs within six months after the  close of each fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">d. A predetermined rate may be negotiated for use on Federal awards  where there is reasonable assurance, based on past experience and  reliable projection of the organization's costs, that the rate is not  likely to exceed a rate based on the organization's actual costs.</p><p class="depth0">e. Fixed rates may be negotiated where predetermined rates are not  considered appropriate. A fixed rate, however, must not be negotiated if  (i) all or a substantial portion of the organization's Federal awards  are expected to expire before the carry-forward adjustment can be made;  (ii) the mix of Federal and non-Federal work at the organization is too  erratic to permit an equitable carry-forward adjustment; or (iii) the  organization's operations fluctuate significantly from year to year.</p><p class="depth0">f. Provisional and final rates must be negotiated where neither  predetermined nor fixed rates are appropriate. Predetermined or fixed  rates may replace provisional rates at any time prior to the close of  the organization's fiscal year. If that event does not occur, a final  rate will be established and upward or downward adjustments will be made  based on the actual allowable costs incurred for the period involved.</p><p class="depth0">g. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written  agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the  nonprofit organization. The cognizant agency for indirect costs must  make available copies of the agreement to all concerned Federal  agencies.</p><p class="depth0">h. If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate  between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the nonprofit  organization, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the  appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">i. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal  agencies in connection with the negotiation and approval process, OMB  will lend assistance as required to resolve such problems in a timely  manner.</p><p class="depth0">D. Certification of Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Required Certification. No proposal to establish indirect (F&A;)  cost rates must be acceptable unless such costs have been certified by  the non-profit organization using the Certificate of Indirect (F&A;)  Costs set forth in subsection b., below. The certificate must be signed  on behalf of the organization by an individual at a level no lower than  vice president or chief financial officer for the organization.</p><p class="depth0">2. Certificate. Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied  by a certification in the following form:</p><p class="depth0">Certificate of Indirect (F&A;) Costs</p><p class="depth0">This is to certify that to the best of my knowledge and belief:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> I have reviewed the indirect (F&A;) cost proposal submitted  herewith;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish  billing or final indirect (F&A;) costs rate for [identify period covered  by rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the  Federal awards to which they apply and with Subpart E of part 75.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> This proposal does not include any costs which are unallowable  under Subpart E of part 75 such as (without limitation): public  relations costs, contributions and donations, entertainment costs, fines  and penalties, lobbying costs, and defense of fraud proceedings; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to  Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship  between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are  allocated in accordance with applicable requirements.</p><p class="depth0">I declare that the foregoing is true and correct. Nonprofit Organization: Signature: Name of Official: Title: Date of Execution:</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix V to Part 75--State/Local Governmentwide Central Service</p><p class="depth0">Cost Allocation Plans</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">1. Most governmental units provide certain services, such as motor  pools, computer centers, purchasing, accounting, etc., to operating  agencies on a centralized basis. Since federally-supported awards are  performed within the individual operating agencies, there needs to be a  process whereby these central service costs can be identified and  assigned to benefitted activities on a reasonable and consistent basis.  The central service cost allocation plan provides that process. All  costs and other data used to distribute the costs included in the plan  should be supported by formal accounting and other records that will  support the propriety of the costs assigned to Federal awards.</p><p class="depth0">2. Guidelines and illustrations of central service cost allocation  plans are provided in a brochure published by the Department of Health  and Human Services entitled ``A Guide for State, Local and Indian Tribal  Governments: Cost Principles and Procedures for Developing Cost  Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost Rates for Agreements with the Federal  Government.'' A copy of this brochure may be obtained from the HHS' Cost  Allocation Services at https://rates.psc.gov.</p><p class="depth0">B. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. Agency or operating agency means an organizational unit or sub- division within a governmental unit that is responsible for the  performance or administration of Federal   awards or activities of the governmental unit.</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocated central services means central services that benefit  operating agencies but are not billed to the agencies on a fee-for- service or similar basis. These costs are allocated to benefitted  agencies on some reasonable basis. Examples of such services might  include general accounting, personnel administration, purchasing, etc.</p><p class="depth0">3. Billed central services means central services that are billed to  benefitted agencies or programs on an individual fee-for-service or  similar basis. Typical examples of billed central services include  computer services, transportation services, insurance, and fringe  benefits.</p><p class="depth0">4. Cognizant agency for indirect costs is defined in Sec. 75.2. The  determination of cognizant agency for indirect costs for states and  local governments is described in section F.1.</p><p class="depth0">5. Major local government means local government that receives more  than $100 million in direct Federal awards subject to this part.</p><p class="depth0">C. Scope of the Central Service Cost Allocation Plans</p><p class="depth0">The central service cost allocation plan will include all central  service costs that will be claimed (either as a billed or an allocated  cost) under Federal awards and will be documented as described in  section E. Costs of central services omitted from the plan will not be  reimbursed.</p><p class="depth0">D. Submission Requirements</p><p class="depth0">1. Each state will submit a plan to the Department of Health and  Human Services for each year in which it claims central service costs  under Federal awards. The plan should include (a) a projection of the  next year's allocated central service cost (based either on actual costs  for the most recently completed year or the budget projection for the  coming year), and (b) a reconciliation of actual allocated central  service costs to the estimated costs used for either the most recently  completed year or the year immediately preceding the most recently  completed year.</p><p class="depth0">2. Each major local government is also required to submit a plan to  its cognizant agency for indirect costs annually.</p><p class="depth0">3. All other local governments claiming central service costs must  develop a plan in accordance with the requirements described in this  Part and maintain the plan and related supporting documentation for  audit. These local governments are not required to submit their plans  for Federal approval unless they are specifically requested to do so by  the cognizant agency for indirect costs. Where a local government only  receives funds as a subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be  responsible for monitoring the subrecipient's plan.</p><p class="depth0">4. All central service cost allocation plans will be prepared and,  when required, submitted within six months prior to the beginning of  each of the governmental unit's fiscal years in which it proposes to  claim central service costs. Extensions may be granted by the cognizant  agency for indirect costs on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">E. Documentation Requirements for Submitted Plans</p><p class="depth0">The documentation requirements described in this section may be  modified, expanded, or reduced by the cognizant agency for indirect  costs on a case-by-case basis. For example, the requirements may be  reduced for those central services which have little or no impact on  Federal awards. Conversely, if a review of a plan indicates that certain  additional information is needed, and will likely be needed in future  years, it may be routinely requested in future plan submissions. Items  marked with an asterisk (*) should be submitted only once; subsequent  plans should merely indicate any changes since the last plan.</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">All proposed plans must be accompanied by the following: An  organization chart sufficiently detailed to show operations including  the central service activities of the state/local government whether or  not they are shown as benefitting from central service functions; a copy  of the Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (or a copy of the Executive  Budget if budgeted costs are being proposed) to support the allowable  costs of each central service activity included in the plan; and, a  certification (see subsection 4.) that the plan was prepared in  accordance with this Part, contains only allowable costs, and was  prepared in a manner that treated similar costs consistently among the  various Federal awards and between Federal and non-Federal awards/ activities.</p><p class="depth0">2. Allocated Central Services</p><p class="depth0">For each allocated central service, the plan must also include the  following: A brief description of the service,* an identification of the  unit rendering the service and the operating agencies receiving the  service, the items of expense included in the cost of the service, the  method used to distribute the cost of the service to benefitted  agencies, and a summary schedule showing the allocation of each service  to the specific benefitted agencies. If any self-insurance funds or  fringe benefits costs are treated as allocated (rather than billed)  central services, documentation discussed in subsections 3.b. and c.  must also be included.</p><p class="depth0">3. Billed Services</p><p class="depth0">a. General. The information described in this section must be  provided for all billed central services, including internal service  funds, self-insurance funds, and fringe benefit funds.</p><p class="depth0">b. Internal service funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For each internal service fund or similar activity with an  operating budget of $5 million or more, the plan must include: A brief  description of each service; a balance sheet for each fund based on  individual accounts contained in the governmental unit's accounting  system; a revenue/expenses statement, with revenues broken out by  source, e.g., regular billings, interest earned, etc.; a listing of all  non-operating transfers (as defined by Generally Accepted Accounting  Principles (GAAP)) into and out of the fund; a description of the  procedures (methodology) used to charge the costs of each service to  users, including how billing rates are determined; a schedule of current  rates; and, a schedule comparing total revenues (including imputed  revenues) generated by the service to the allowable costs of the  service, as determined under this Part, with an explanation of how  variances will be handled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Revenues must consist of all revenues generated by the service,  including unbilled and uncollected revenues. If some users were not  billed for the services (or were not billed at the full rate for that  class of users), a schedule showing the full imputed revenues associated  with these users must be provided. Expenses must be broken out by object  cost categories (e.g., salaries, supplies, etc.).</p><p class="depth0">c. Self-insurance funds. For each self-insurance fund, the plan must  include: The fund balance sheet; a statement of revenue and expenses  including a summary of billings and claims paid by agency; a listing of  all non-operating transfers into and out of the fund; the type(s) of  risk(s) covered by the fund (e.g., automobile liability, workers'  compensation, etc.); an explanation of how the level of fund  contributions are determined, including a copy of the current actuarial  report (with the actuarial assumptions used) if the contributions are  determined on an actuarial basis; and, a description of the procedures  used to charge or allocate fund contributions to benefitted activities.  Reserve levels in excess of claims (1) submitted and adjudicated but not  paid, (2) submitted but not adjudicated, and (3) incurred but not  submitted must be identified and explained.</p><p class="depth0">d. Fringe benefits. For fringe benefit costs, the plan must include:  A listing of fringe benefits provided to covered employees, and the  overall annual cost of each type of benefit; current fringe benefit  policies; and procedures used to charge or allocate the costs of the  benefits to benefitted activities. In addition, for pension and post- retirement health insurance plans, the following information must be  provided: the governmental unit's funding policies, e.g., legislative  bills, trust agreements, or state-mandated contribution rules, if  different from actuarially determined rates; the pension plan's costs  accrued for the year; the amount funded, and date(s) of funding; a copy  of the current actuarial report (including the actuarial assumptions);  the plan trustee's report; and, a schedule from the activity showing the  value of the interest cost associated with late funding.</p><p class="depth0">4. Required Certification</p><p class="depth0">Each central service cost allocation plan will be accompanied by a  certification in the following form:</p><p class="depth0">Certificate of Cost Allocation Plan</p><p class="depth0">This is to certify that I have reviewed the cost allocation plan  submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish  cost allocations or billings for [identify period covered by plan] are  allowable in accordance with the requirements of this Part and the  Federal award(s) to which they apply. Unallowable costs have been  adjusted for in allocating costs as indicated in the cost allocation  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to  Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship  between the expenses incurred and the Federal awards to which they are  allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same  costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as  direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for  consistently.</p><p class="depth0">I declare that the foregoing is true and correct. Governmental Unit: Signature: Name of Official: Title: Date of Execution:</p><p class="depth0">F. Negotiation and Approval of Central Service Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Federal Cognizant Agency for Indirect Costs Assignments for Cost</p><p class="depth0">Negotiation</p><p class="depth0">In general, unless different arrangements are agreed to by the  concerned Federal agencies, for central service cost allocation plans,  the cognizant agency responsible for review and approval is the Federal  agency with the largest dollar value of total Federal awards with a  governmental unit. For indirect cost rates and departmental indirect  cost allocation plans, the cognizant agency is the Federal agency with  the largest dollar value of direct Federal awards with a governmental  unit or component, as appropriate.   Once designated as the cognizant agency for indirect costs, the Federal  agency must remain so for a period of five years. In addition, the  following Federal agencies continue to be responsible for the indicated  governmental entities:</p><p class="depth0">Department of Health and Human Services--Public assistance and  state-wide cost allocation plans for all states (including the District  of Columbia and Puerto Rico), state and local hospitals, libraries and  health districts.</p><p class="depth0">Department of the Interior--Indian tribal governments, territorial  governments, and state and local park and recreational districts.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Labor--State and local labor departments.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Education--School districts and state and local  education agencies.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Agriculture--State and local agriculture departments.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Transportation--State and local airport and port  authorities and transit districts.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Commerce--State and local economic development  districts.</p><p class="depth0">Department of Housing and Urban Development--State and local housing  and development districts.</p><p class="depth0">Environmental Protection Agency--State and local water and sewer  districts.</p><p class="depth0">2. Review</p><p class="depth0">All proposed central service cost allocation plans that are required  to be submitted will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by the  cognizant agency for indirect costs on a timely basis. The cognizant  agency for indirect costs will review the proposal within six months of  receipt of the proposal and either negotiate/approve the proposal or  advise the governmental unit of the additional documentation needed to  support/evaluate the proposed plan or the changes required to make the  proposal acceptable. Once an agreement with the governmental unit has  been reached, the agreement will be accepted and used by all Federal  agencies, unless prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal  awarding agency has reason to believe that special operating factors  affecting its Federal awards necessitate special consideration, the  funding agency will, prior to the time the plans are negotiated, notify  the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">3. Agreement</p><p class="depth0">The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written  agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the  governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the  agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute or the information  upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially  incomplete or inaccurate. The results of the negotiation must be made  available to all Federal agencies for their use.</p><p class="depth0">4. Adjustments</p><p class="depth0">Negotiated cost allocation plans based on a proposal later found to  have included costs that: (a) Are unallowable (i) as specified by law or  regulation, (ii) as identified in subpart F, General Provisions for  selected Items of Cost of this Part, or (iii) by the terms and  conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable because they are  clearly not allocable to Federal awards, must be adjusted, or a refund  must be made at the option of the cognizant agency for indirect costs,  including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt  interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable  Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations. Adjustments or  cash refunds may include, at the option of the cognizant agency for  indirect costs, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure  and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance  with applicable cognizant agency claims collection regulations. These  adjustments or refunds are designed to correct the plans and do not  constitute a reopening of the negotiation.</p><p class="depth0">G. Other Policies</p><p class="depth0">1. Billed Central Service Activities</p><p class="depth0">Each billed central service activity must separately account for all  revenues (including imputed revenues) generated by the service, expenses  incurred to furnish the service, and profit/loss.</p><p class="depth0">2. Working Capital Reserves</p><p class="depth0">Internal service funds are dependent upon a reasonable level of  working capital reserve to operate from one billing cycle to the next.  Charges by an internal service activity to provide for the establishment  and maintenance of a reasonable level of working capital reserve, in  addition to the full recovery of costs, are allowable. A working capital  reserve as part of retained earnings of up to 60 calendar days cash  expenses for normal operating purposes is considered reasonable. A  working capital reserve exceeding 60 calendar days may be approved by  the cognizant agency for indirect costs in exceptional cases.</p><p class="depth0">3. Carry-Forward Adjustments of Allocated Central Service Costs</p><p class="depth0">Allocated central service costs are usually negotiated and approved  for a future fiscal year on a ``fixed with carry-forward'' basis. Under  this procedure, the fixed amounts for the future year covered by  agreement are not subject to adjustment for that year. However, when the  actual costs of the year   involved become known, the differences between the fixed amounts  previously approved and the actual costs will be carried forward and  used as an adjustment to the fixed amounts established for a later year.  This ``carry-forward'' procedure applies to all central services whose  costs were fixed in the approved plan. However, a carry-forward  adjustment is not permitted, for a central service activity that was not  included in the approved plan, or for unallowable costs that must be  reimbursed immediately.</p><p class="depth0">4. Adjustments of Billed Central Services</p><p class="depth0">Billing rates used to charge Federal awards must be based on the  estimated costs of providing the services, including an estimate of the  allocable central service costs. A comparison of the revenue generated  by each billed service (including total revenues whether or not billed  or collected) to the actual allowable costs of the service will be made  at least annually, and an adjustment will be made for the difference  between the revenue and the allowable costs. These adjustments will be  made through one of the following adjustment methods: (a) A cash refund  including earned or imputed interest from the date of transfer and debt  interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable  Federal cognizant agency for indirect costs regulations to the Federal  Government for the Federal share of the adjustment, (b) credits to the  amounts charged to the individual programs, (c) adjustments to future  billing rates, or (d) adjustments to allocated central service costs.  Adjustments to allocated central services will not be permitted where  the total amount of the adjustment for a particular service (Federal  share and non-Federal) share exceeds $500,000. Adjustment methods may  include, at the option of the cognizant agency, earned or imputed  interest from the date of expenditure and delinquent debt interest, if  applicable, chargeable in accordance with applicable cognizant agency  claims collection regulations.</p><p class="depth0">5. Records Retention</p><p class="depth0">All central service cost allocation plans and related documentation  used as a basis for claiming costs under Federal awards must be retained  for audit in accordance with the records retention requirements  contained in Subpart D of part 75.</p><p class="depth0">6. Appeals</p><p class="depth0">If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan between the  cognizant agency for indirect costs and the governmental unit, the  dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures of  the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">7. OMB Assistance</p><p class="depth0">To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal  agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and  approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such  problems in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix VI to Part 75--Public Assistance Cost Allocation Plans</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">Federally-financed programs administered by state public assistance  agencies are funded predominately by the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS). In support of its stewardship requirements, HHS has  published requirements for the development, documentation, submission,  negotiation, and approval of public assistance cost allocation plans in  Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. All administrative costs (direct and  indirect) are normally charged to Federal awards by implementing the  public assistance cost allocation plan. This Appendix extends these  requirements to all Federal awarding agencies whose programs are  administered by a state public assistance agency. Major federally- financed programs typically administered by state public assistance  agencies include: Temporary Aid for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid,  Food Stamps, Child Support Enforcement, Adoption Assistance and Foster  Care, and Social Services Block Grant.</p><p class="depth0">B. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. State public assistance agency means a state agency administering  or supervising the administration of one or more public assistance  programs operated by the state as identified in Subpart E of 45 CFR part  95. For the purpose of this Appendix, these programs include all  programs administered by the state public assistance agency.</p><p class="depth0">2. State public assistance agency costs means all costs incurred by,  or allocable to, the state public assistance agency, except expenditures  for financial assistance, medical contractor payments, food stamps, and  payments for services and goods provided directly to program recipients.</p><p class="depth0">C. Policy</p><p class="depth0">State public assistance agencies will develop, document and  implement, and the Federal Government will review, negotiate, and  approve, public assistance cost allocation plans in accordance with  Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95. The plan will include all programs  administered by the state public assistance agency. Where a letter of  approval or disapproval is transmitted to a state public assistance  agency in accordance with   Subpart E, the letter will apply to all Federal agencies and programs.  The remaining sections of this Appendix (except for the requirement for  certification) summarize the provisions of Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95.</p><p class="depth0">D. Submission, Documentation, and Approval of Public Assistance Cost</p><p class="depth0">Allocation Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. State public assistance agencies are required to promptly submit  amendments to the cost allocation plan to HHS for review and approval.</p><p class="depth0">2. Under the coordination process outlined in section E, Review of  Implementation of Approved Plans, affected Federal agencies will review  all new plans and plan amendments and provide comments, as appropriate,  to HHS. The effective date of the plan or plan amendment will be the  first day of the calendar quarter following the event that required the  amendment, unless another date is specifically approved by HHS. HHS, as  the cognizant agency for indirect costs acting on behalf of all affected  Federal agencies, will, as necessary, conduct negotiations with the  state public assistance agency and will inform the state agency of the  action taken on the plan or plan amendment.</p><p class="depth0">E. Review of Implementation of Approved Plans</p><p class="depth0">1. Since public assistance cost allocation plans are of a narrative  nature, the review during the plan approval process consists of  evaluating the appropriateness of the proposed groupings of costs (cost  centers) and the related allocation bases. As such, the Federal  Government needs some assurance that the cost allocation plan has been  implemented as approved. This is accomplished by reviews by the Federal  awarding agencies, single audits, or audits conducted by the cognizant  agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Where inappropriate charges affecting more than one Federal  awarding agency are identified, the cognizant HHS cost negotiation  office will be advised and will take the lead in resolving the issue(s)  as provided for in Subpart E of 45 CFR part 95.</p><p class="depth0">3. If a dispute arises in the negotiation of a plan or from a  disallowance involving two or more Federal awarding agencies, the  dispute must be resolved in accordance with the appeals procedures set  out in 45 CFR part 16. Disputes involving only one Federal awarding  agency will be resolved in accordance with the Federal awarding agency's  appeal process.</p><p class="depth0">4. To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal  awarding agencies or governmental units in connection with the  negotiation and approval process, the Office of Management and Budget  will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such problems in a timely  manner.</p><p class="depth0">F. Unallowable Costs</p><p class="depth0">Claims developed under approved cost allocation plans will be based  on allowable costs as identified in this Part. Where unallowable costs  have been claimed and reimbursed, they will be refunded to the program  that reimbursed the unallowable cost using one of the following methods:  (a) A cash refund, (b) offset to a subsequent claim, or (c) credits to  the amounts charged to individual Federal awards. Cash refunds, offsets,  and credits may include at the option of the cognizant agency for  indirect cost, earned or imputed interest from the date of expenditure  and delinquent debt interest, if applicable, chargeable in accordance  with applicable cognizant agency for indirect cost claims collection  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix VII to Part 75--States and Local Government and Indian</p><p class="depth0">Tribe Indirect Cost Proposals</p><p class="depth0">A. General</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or  joint purposes. These costs benefit more than one cost objective and  cannot be readily identified with a particular final cost objective  without effort disproportionate to the results achieved. After direct  costs have been determined and assigned directly to Federal awards and  other activities as appropriate, indirect costs are those remaining to  be allocated to benefitted cost objectives. A cost may not be allocated  to a Federal award as an indirect cost if any other cost incurred for  the same purpose, in like circumstances, has been assigned to a Federal  award as a direct cost.</p><p class="depth0">2. Indirect costs include (a) the indirect costs originating in each  department or agency of the governmental unit carrying out Federal  awards and (b) the costs of central governmental services distributed  through the central service cost allocation plan (as described in  Appendix V to part) and not otherwise treated as direct costs.</p><p class="depth0">3. Indirect costs are normally charged to Federal awards by the use  of an indirect cost rate. A separate indirect cost rate(s) is usually  necessary for each department or agency of the governmental unit  claiming indirect costs under Federal awards. Guidelines and  illustrations of indirect cost proposals are provided in a brochure  published by the Department of Health and Human Services entitled ``A  Guide for States and Local Government Agencies: Cost Principles and  Procedures for Establishing Cost Allocation Plans and Indirect Cost  Rates for Grants and Contracts with the Federal Government.'' A copy of  this brochure may be obtained from the HHS' Cost Allocation Services at  https://rates.psc.gov.</p><p class="depth0">4. Because of the diverse characteristics and accounting practices  of governmental   units, the types of costs which may be classified as indirect costs  cannot be specified in all situations. However, typical examples of  indirect costs may include certain state/local-wide central service  costs, general administration of the non-Federal entity accounting and  personnel services performed within the non-Federal entity, depreciation  on buildings and equipment, the costs of operating and maintaining  facilities.</p><p class="depth0">5. This Appendix does not apply to state public assistance agencies.  These agencies should refer instead to Appendix VI to part 75.</p><p class="depth0">B. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">1. Base means the accumulated direct costs (normally either total  direct salaries and wages or total direct costs exclusive of any  extraordinary or distorting expenditures) used to distribute indirect  costs to individual Federal awards. The direct cost base selected should  result in each Federal award bearing a fair share of the indirect costs  in reasonable relation to the benefits received from the costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Base period for the allocation of indirect costs is the period in  which such costs are incurred and accumulated for allocation to  activities performed in that period. The base period normally should  coincide with the governmental unit's fiscal year, but in any event,  must be so selected as to avoid inequities in the allocation of costs.</p><p class="depth0">3. Cognizant agency for indirect costs means the Federal agency  responsible for reviewing and approving the governmental unit's indirect  cost rate(s) on the behalf of the Federal Government. The cognizant  agency for indirect costs assignment is described in Appendix V, section  F.</p><p class="depth0">4. Final rate means an indirect cost rate applicable to a specified  past period which is based on the actual allowable costs of the period.  A final audited rate is not subject to adjustment.</p><p class="depth0">5. Fixed rate means an indirect cost rate which has the same  characteristics as a predetermined rate, except that the difference  between the estimated costs and the actual, allowable costs of the  period covered by the rate is carried forward as an adjustment to the  rate computation of a subsequent period.</p><p class="depth0">6. Indirect cost pool is the accumulated costs that jointly benefit  two or more programs or other cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0">7. Indirect cost rate is a device for determining in a reasonable  manner the proportion of indirect costs each program should bear. It is  the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the indirect costs to a direct  cost base.</p><p class="depth0">8. Indirect cost rate proposal means the documentation prepared by a  governmental unit or subdivision thereof to substantiate its request for  the establishment of an indirect cost rate.</p><p class="depth0">9. Predetermined rate means an indirect cost rate, applicable to a  specified current or future period, usually the governmental unit's  fiscal year. This rate is based on an estimate of the costs to be  incurred during the period. Except under very unusual circumstances, a  predetermined rate is not subject to adjustment. (Because of legal  constraints, predetermined rates are not permitted for Federal  contracts; they may, however, be used for grants or cooperative  agreements.) Predetermined rates may not be used by governmental units  that have not submitted and negotiated the rate with the cognizant  agency for indirect costs. In view of the potential advantages offered  by this procedure, negotiation of predetermined rates for indirect costs  for a period of two to four years should be the norm in those situations  where the cost experience and other pertinent facts available are deemed  sufficient to enable the parties involved to reach an informed judgment  as to the probable level of indirect costs during the ensuing accounting  periods.</p><p class="depth0">10. Provisional rate means a temporary indirect cost rate applicable  to a specified period which is used for funding, interim reimbursement,  and reporting indirect costs on Federal awards pending the establishment  of a ``final'' rate for that period.  C. Allocation of Indirect Costs and Determination of Indirect Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">a. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has only one  major function, or where all its major functions benefit from the  indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of  indirect costs and the computation of an indirect cost rate may be  accomplished through simplified allocation procedures as described in  subsection 2.</p><p class="depth0">b. Where a governmental unit's department or agency has several  major functions which benefit from its indirect costs in varying  degrees, the allocation of indirect costs may require the accumulation  of such costs into separate cost groupings which then are allocated  individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best  measures the relative degree of benefit. The indirect costs allocated to  each function are then distributed to individual Federal awards and  other activities included in that function by means of an indirect cost  rate(s).</p><p class="depth0">c. Specific methods for allocating indirect costs and computing  indirect cost rates along with the conditions under which each method  should be used are described in subsections 2, 3 and 4.</p><p class="depth0">2. Simplified Method</p><p class="depth0">a. Where a non-Federal entity's major functions benefit from its  indirect costs to approximately the same degree, the allocation of  indirect costs may be accomplished   by (1) classifying the non-Federal entity's total costs for the base  period as either direct or indirect, and (2) dividing the total  allowable indirect costs (net of applicable credits) by an equitable  distribution base. The result of this process is an indirect cost rate  which is used to distribute indirect costs to individual Federal awards.  The rate should be expressed as the percentage which the total amount of  allowable indirect costs bears to the base selected. This method should  also be used where a governmental unit's department or agency has only  one major function encompassing a number of individual projects or  activities, and may be used where the level of Federal awards to that  department or agency is relatively small.</p><p class="depth0">b. Both the direct costs and the indirect costs must exclude capital  expenditures and unallowable costs. However, unallowable costs must be  included in the direct costs if they represent activities to which  indirect costs are properly allocable.</p><p class="depth0">c. The distribution base may be (1) total direct costs (excluding  capital expenditures and other distorting items, such as pass-through  funds, subawards in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.),  (2) direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an  equitable distribution.</p><p class="depth0">3. Multiple Allocation Base Method</p><p class="depth0">a. Where a non-Federal entity's indirect costs benefit its major  functions in varying degrees, such costs must be accumulated into  separate cost groupings. Each grouping must then be allocated  individually to benefitted functions by means of a base which best  measures the relative benefits.</p><p class="depth0">b. The cost groupings should be established so as to permit the  allocation of each grouping on the basis of benefits provided to the  major functions. Each grouping should constitute a pool of expenses that  are of like character in terms of the functions they benefit and in  terms of the allocation base which best measures the relative benefits  provided to each function. The number of separate groupings should be  held within practical limits, taking into consideration the materiality  of the amounts involved and the degree of precision needed.</p><p class="depth0">c. Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the  base to be used in allocating the expenses in each grouping to  benefitted functions. When an allocation can be made by assignment of a  cost grouping directly to the function benefitted, the allocation must  be made in that manner. When the expenses in a grouping are more general  in nature, the allocation should be made through the use of a selected  base which produces results that are equitable to both the Federal  Government and the governmental unit. In general, any cost element or  related factor associated with the governmental unit's activities is  potentially adaptable for use as an allocation base provided that: (1)  It can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other quantitative  measures (total direct costs, direct salaries and wages, staff hours  applied, square feet used, hours of usage, number of documents  processed, population served, and the like), and (2) it is common to the  benefitted functions during the base period.</p><p class="depth0">d. Except where a special indirect cost rate(s) is required in  accordance with paragraph (C)(4) of this Appendix, the separate  groupings of indirect costs allocated to each major function must be  aggregated and treated as a common pool for that function. The costs in  the common pool must then be distributed to individual Federal awards  included in that function by use of a single indirect cost rate.</p><p class="depth0">e. The distribution base used in computing the indirect cost rate  for each function may be (1) total direct costs (excluding capital  expenditures and other distorting items such as pass-through funds,  subawards in excess of $25,000, participant support costs, etc.), (2)  direct salaries and wages, or (3) another base which results in an  equitable distribution. An indirect cost rate should be developed for  each separate indirect cost pool developed. The rate in each case should  be stated as the percentage relationship between the particular indirect  cost pool and the distribution base identified with that pool.</p><p class="depth0">4. Special Indirect Cost Rates</p><p class="depth0">a. In some instances, a single indirect cost rate for all activities  of a non-Federal entity or for each major function of the agency may not  be appropriate. It may not take into account those different factors  which may substantially affect the indirect costs applicable to a  particular program or group of programs. The factors may include the  physical location of the work, the level of administrative support  required, the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the  organizational arrangements used, or any combination thereof. When a  particular Federal award is carried out in an environment which appears  to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs,  provisions should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable  to that Federal award. The separate indirect cost pool should be  developed during the course of the regular allocation process, and the  separate indirect cost rate resulting therefrom should be used, provided  that: (1) The rate differs significantly from the rate which would have  been developed under paragraphs (C)(2) and (C)(3) of this Appendix, and  (2) the Federal award to which the rate would apply is material in  amount.</p><p class="depth0">b. Where Federal statutes restrict the reimbursement of certain  indirect costs, it may be necessary to develop a special rate   for the affected Federal award. Where a ``restricted rate'' is required,  the same procedure for developing a non-restricted rate will be used  except for the additional step of the elimination from the indirect cost  pool those costs for which the law prohibits reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0">D. Submission and Documentation of Proposals</p><p class="depth0">1. Submission of Indirect Cost Rate Proposals</p><p class="depth0">a. All departments or agencies of the governmental unit desiring to  claim indirect costs under Federal awards must prepare an indirect cost  rate proposal and related documentation to support those costs. The  proposal and related documentation must be retained for audit in  accordance with the records retention requirements contained in Sec.  75.361.</p><p class="depth0">b. A governmental department or agency unit that receives more than  $35 million in direct Federal funding must submit its indirect cost rate  proposal to its cognizant agency for indirect costs. Other governmental  department or agency must develop an indirect cost proposal in  accordance with the requirements of this Part and maintain the proposal  and related supporting documentation for audit. These governmental  departments or agencies are not required to submit their proposals  unless they are specifically requested to do so by the cognizant agency  for indirect costs. Where a non-Federal entity only receives funds as a  subrecipient, the pass-through entity will be responsible for  negotiating and/or monitoring the subrecipient's indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">c. Each Indian tribal government desiring reimbursement of indirect  costs must submit its indirect cost proposal to the Department of the  Interior (its cognizant agency for indirect costs).</p><p class="depth0">d. Indirect cost proposals must be developed (and, when required,  submitted) within six months after the close of the governmental unit's  fiscal year, unless an exception is approved by the cognizant agency for  indirect costs. If the proposed central service cost allocation plan for  the same period has not been approved by that time, the indirect cost  proposal may be prepared including an amount for central services that  is based on the latest federally-approved central service cost  allocation plan. The difference between these central service amounts  and the amounts ultimately approved will be compensated for by an  adjustment in a subsequent period.</p><p class="depth0">2. Documentation of Proposals</p><p class="depth0">The following must be included with each indirect cost proposal:</p><p class="depth0">a. The rates proposed, including subsidiary work sheets and other  relevant data, cross referenced and reconciled to the financial data  noted in subsection b. Allocated central service costs will be supported  by the summary table included in the approved central service cost  allocation plan. This summary table is not required to be submitted with  the indirect cost proposal if the central service cost allocation plan  for the same fiscal year has been approved by the cognizant agency for  indirect costs and is available to the funding agency.</p><p class="depth0">b. A copy of the financial data (financial statements, comprehensive  annual financial report, executive budgets, accounting reports, etc.)  upon which the rate is based. Adjustments resulting from the use of  unaudited data will be recognized, where appropriate, by the Federal  cognizant agency for indirect costs in a subsequent proposal.</p><p class="depth0">c. The approximate amount of direct base costs incurred under  Federal awards. These costs should be broken out between salaries and  wages and other direct costs.</p><p class="depth0">d. A chart showing the organizational structure of the agency during  the period for which the proposal applies, along with a functional  statement(s) noting the duties and/or responsibilities of all units that  comprise the agency. (Once this is submitted, only revisions need be  submitted with subsequent proposals.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Required Certification.</p><p class="depth0">Each indirect cost rate proposal must be accompanied by a  certification in the following form:</p><p class="depth0">Certificate of Indirect Costs</p><p class="depth0">This is to certify that I have reviewed the indirect cost rate  proposal submitted herewith and to the best of my knowledge and belief:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All costs included in this proposal [identify date] to establish  billing or final indirect costs rates for [identify period covered by  rate] are allowable in accordance with the requirements of the Federal  award(s) to which they apply and the provisions of this 45 CFR part 75.  Unallowable costs have been adjusted for in allocating costs as  indicated in the indirect cost proposal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All costs included in this proposal are properly allocable to  Federal awards on the basis of a beneficial or causal relationship  between the expenses incurred and the agreements to which they are  allocated in accordance with applicable requirements. Further, the same  costs that have been treated as indirect costs have not been claimed as  direct costs. Similar types of costs have been accounted for  consistently and the Federal Government will be notified of any  accounting changes that would affect the predetermined rate.</p><p class="depth0">I declare that the foregoing is true and correct.   Governmental Unit: Signature: Name of Official: Title: Date of Execution:</p><p class="depth0">E. Negotiation and Approval of Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect cost rates will be reviewed, negotiated, and approved by  the cognizant agency on a timely basis. Once a rate has been agreed  upon, it will be accepted and used by all Federal agencies unless  prohibited or limited by statute. Where a Federal awarding agency has  reason to believe that special operating factors affecting its Federal  awards necessitate special indirect cost rates, the funding agency will,  prior to the time the rates are negotiated, notify the cognizant agency  for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. The use of predetermined rates, if allowed, is encouraged where  the cognizant agency for indirect costs has reasonable assurance based  on past experience and reliable projection of the non-Federal entity's  costs, that the rate is not likely to exceed a rate based on actual  costs. Long-term agreements utilizing predetermined rates extending over  two or more years are encouraged, where appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">3. The results of each negotiation must be formalized in a written  agreement between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the  governmental unit. This agreement will be subject to re-opening if the  agreement is subsequently found to violate a statute, or the information  upon which the plan was negotiated is later found to be materially  incomplete or inaccurate. The agreed upon rates must be made available  to all Federal agencies for their use.</p><p class="depth0">4. Refunds must be made if proposals are later found to have  included costs that (a) are unallowable (i) as specified by law or  regulation, (ii) as identified in Sec. 75.420 of this part, or (iii) by  the terms and conditions of Federal awards, or (b) are unallowable  because they are clearly not allocable to Federal awards. These  adjustments or refunds will be made regardless of the type of rate  negotiated (predetermined, final, fixed, or provisional).</p><p class="depth0">F. Other Policies</p><p class="depth0">1. Fringe Benefit Rates</p><p class="depth0">If overall fringe benefit rates are not approved for the  governmental unit as part of the central service cost allocation plan,  these rates will be reviewed, negotiated and approved for individual  recipient agencies during the indirect cost negotiation process. In  these cases, a proposed fringe benefit rate computation should accompany  the indirect cost proposal. If fringe benefit rates are not used at the  recipient agency level (i.e., the agency specifically identifies fringe  benefit costs to individual employees), the governmental unit should so  advise the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">2. Billed Services Provided by the Recipient Agency</p><p class="depth0">In some cases, governmental departments or agencies (components of  the governmental unit) provide and bill for services similar to those  covered by central service cost allocation plans (e.g., computer  centers). Where this occurs, the governmental departments or agencies  (components of the governmental unit) should be guided by the  requirements in Appendix V relating to the development of billing rates  and documentation requirements, and should advise the cognizant agency  for indirect costs of any billed services. Reviews of these types of  services (including reviews of costing/billing methodology, profits or  losses, etc.) will be made on a case-by-case basis as warranted by the  circumstances involved.</p><p class="depth0">3. Indirect Cost Allocations Not Using Rates</p><p class="depth0">In certain situations, governmental departments or agencies  (components of the governmental unit), because of the nature of their  Federal awards, may be required to develop a cost allocation plan that  distributes indirect (and, in some cases, direct) costs to the specific  funding sources. In these cases, a narrative cost allocation methodology  should be developed, documented, maintained for audit, or submitted, as  appropriate, to the cognizant agency for indirect costs for review,  negotiation, and approval.</p><p class="depth0">4. Appeals</p><p class="depth0">If a dispute arises in a negotiation of an indirect cost rate (or  other rate) between the cognizant agency for indirect costs and the  governmental unit, the dispute must be resolved in accordance with the  appeals procedures of the cognizant agency for indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">5. Collection of Unallowable Costs and Erroneous Payments</p><p class="depth0">Costs specifically identified as unallowable and charged to Federal  awards either directly or indirectly will be refunded (including  interest chargeable in accordance with applicable Federal cognizant  agency for indirect costs regulations).</p><p class="depth0">6. OMB Assistance</p><p class="depth0">To the extent that problems are encountered among the Federal  agencies or governmental units in connection with the negotiation and  approval process, OMB will lend assistance, as required, to resolve such  problems in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Appendix IX to Part 75--Principles for Determining Costs Applicable</p><p class="depth0">to Research and Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals</p><p class="depth0">A. Purpose and Scope</p><p class="depth0">1. Objectives</p><p class="depth0">This appendix provides principles for determining the costs  applicable to research and development work performed by hospitals under  grants and contracts with the Department of Health and Human Services.  These principles are confined to the subject of cost determination and  make no attempt to identify the circumstances or dictate the extent of  hospital participation in the financing of a particular research or  development project. The principles are designed to provide recognition  of the full allocated costs of such research work under generally  accepted accounting principles. These principles will be applicable to  both proprietary and non-profit hospitals. No provision for profit or  other increment above cost is provided for in these principles. However,  this is not to be interpreted as precluding a negotiated fee between  contracting parties when a fee is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">2. Policy Guides</p><p class="depth0">The successful application of these principles requires development  of mutual understanding between representatives of hospitals and of the  Department of Health and Human Services as to their scope, applicability  and interpretation. It is recognized that:</p><p class="depth0">a. The arrangements for hospital participation in the financing of a  research and development project are properly subject to negotiation  between the agency and the hospital concerned in accordance with such  Government-wide criteria as may be applicable.</p><p class="depth0">b. Each hospital, possessing its own unique combination of staff,  facilities and experience, should be encouraged to conduct research in a  manner consonant with its own institutional philosophies and objectives.</p><p class="depth0">c. Each hospital in the fulfillment of its contractual obligations  should be expected to employ sound management practices.</p><p class="depth0">d. The application of the principles established herein shall be in  conformance with the generally accepted accounting practices of  hospitals.</p><p class="depth0">e. Hospitals receive reimbursements from the Federal Government for  differing types of services under various programs such as support of  Research and Development (including discrete clinical centers) Health  Services Projects, Medicare, etc. It is essential that consistent  procedures for determining reimbursable costs for similar services be  employed without regard to program   differences. Therefore, both the direct and indirect costs of research  programs must be identified as a cost center(s) for the cost finding and  step-down requirements of the Medicare program, or in its absence the  Medicaid program.</p><p class="depth0">3. Application</p><p class="depth0">All operating agencies within the Department of Health and Human  Services that sponsor research and development work in hospitals will  apply these principles and related policy guides in determining the  costs incurred for such work under grants and cost-reimbursement type  contracts and subcontracts. These principles will also be used as a  guide in the pricing of fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0">B. Definition of Terms</p><p class="depth0">1. Organized research means all research activities of a hospital  that may be identified whether the support for such research is from a  federal, non-federal or internal source.</p><p class="depth0">2. Departmental research means research activities that are not  separately budgeted and accounted for. Such work, which includes all  research activities not encompassed under the term organized research,  is regarded for purposes of this document as a part of the patient care  activities of the hospital.</p><p class="depth0">3. Research agreement means any valid arrangement to perform  federally-sponsored research or development including grants, cost- reimbursement type contracts, cost-reimbursement type subcontracts, and  fixed-price contracts and subcontracts.</p><p class="depth0">4. Instruction and training means the formal or informal programs of  educating and training technical and professional health services  personnel, primarily medical and nursing training. This activity, if  separately budgeted or identifiable with specific costs, should be  considered as a cost objective for purposes of indirect cost allocations  and the development of patient care costs.</p><p class="depth0">5. Other hospital activities means all organized activities of a  hospital not immediately related to the patient care, research, and  instructional and training functions which produce identifiable revenue  from the performance of these activities. If a non-related activity does  not produce identifiable revenue, it may be necessary to allocate this  expense using an appropriate basis. In such a case, the activity may be  included as an allocable cost (See paragraph C.4 below.) Also included  under this definition is any category of cost treated as  ``Unallowable,'' provided such category of cost identifies a function or  activity to which a portion of the institution's indirect cost (as  defined in paragraph E.1.) are properly allocable.</p><p class="depth0">6. Patient care means those departments or cost centers which render  routine or ancillary services to in-patients and/or out-patients. As  used in paragraph I.2.w, it means the cost of these services applicable  to patients involved in research programs.</p><p class="depth0">7. Allocation means the process by which the indirect costs are  assigned as between:</p><p class="depth0">a. Organized research,</p><p class="depth0">b. Patient care including departmental research.</p><p class="depth0">c. Instruction and training, and</p><p class="depth0">d. Other hospital activities.</p><p class="depth0">8. Cost center means an identifiable department or area (including  research) within the hospital which has been assigned an account number  in the hospital accounting system for the purpose of accumulating  expense by department or area.</p><p class="depth0">9. Cost finding is the process of recasting the data derived from  the accounts ordinarily kept by a hospital to ascertain costs of the  various types of services rendered. It is the determination of direct  costs by specific identification and the proration of indirect costs by  allocation.</p><p class="depth0">10. Step down is a cost finding method that recognizes that services  rendered by certain nonrevenue-producing departments or centers are  utilized by certain other nonrevenue producing centers as well as by the  revenue-producing centers. All costs of nonrevenue-producing centers are  allocated to all centers which they serve, regardless of whether or not  these centers produce revenue. Following the apportionment of the cost  of the nonrevenue-producing center, that center will be considered  closed and no further costs are apportioned to that center.</p><p class="depth0">11. Scatter bed is a bed assigned to a research patient based on  availability. Research patients occupying these beds are not physically  segregated from nonresearch patients occupying beds. Scatter beds are  geographically dispersed among all the beds available for use in the  hospital. There are no special features attendant to a scatter bed that  distinguishes it from others that could just as well have been occupied.</p><p class="depth0">12. Discrete bed is a bed or beds that have been set aside for  occupancy by research patients and are physically segregated from other  hospital beds in an environment that permits an easily ascertainable  allocation of costs associated with the space they occupy and the  services they generate.</p><p class="depth0">C. Basic Considerations</p><p class="depth0">1. Composition of Total Costs</p><p class="depth0">The cost of a research agreement is comprised of the allowable  direct costs incident to its performance plus the allocable portion of  the allowable indirect costs of the hospital less applicable credits.  (See paragraph C.5.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Factors Affecting Allowability of Costs</p><p class="depth0">The tests of allowability of costs under these principles are:</p><p class="depth0">a. They must be reasonable.</p><p class="depth0">b. They must be assigned to research agreements under the standards  and methods provided herein.</p><p class="depth0">c. They must be accorded consistent treatment through application of  those generally accepted accounting principles appropriate to the  circumstances (See paragraph A.2.e.) and</p><p class="depth0">d. They must conform to any limitations or exclusions set forth in  these principles or in the research agreement as to types or amounts of  cost items.</p><p class="depth0">3. Reasonable Costs</p><p class="depth0">A cost may be considered reasonable if the nature of the goods or  services acquired or applied, and the amount involved therefor reflect  the action that a prudent person would have taken under the  circumstances prevailing at the time the decision to incur the cost was  made. Major considerations involved in the determination of the  reasonableness of a cost are:</p><p class="depth0">a. Whether or not the cost is of a type generally recognized as  necessary for the operation of the hospital or the performance of the  research agreement,</p><p class="depth0">b. The restraints or requirements imposed by such factors as arm's  length bargaining, federal and state laws and regulations, and research  agreement terms and conditions,</p><p class="depth0">c. Whether or not the individuals concerned acted with due prudence  in the circumstances, considering their responsibilities to the  hospital, its patients, its employees, its students, the Government, and  the public at large, and</p><p class="depth0">d. The extent to which the actions taken with respect to the  incurrence of the cost are consistent with established hospital policies  and practices applicable to the work of the hospital generally,  including Government research.</p><p class="depth0">4. Allocable Costs</p><p class="depth0">a. A cost is allocable to a particular cost center (i.e., a specific  function, project, research agreement, department, or the like) if the  goods or services involved are chargeable or assignable to such cost  center in accordance with relative benefits received or other equitable  relationship. Subject to the foregoing, a cost is allocable to a  research agreement if it is incurred solely to advance the work under  the research agreement; or it benefits both the research agreement and  other work of the hospital in proportions that can be approximated  through use of reasonable methods; or it is necessary to the overall  operation of the hospital and, in light of the standards provided in  this chapter, is deemed to be assignable in part to organized research.  Where the purchase of equipment or other capital items are specifically  authorized under a research agreement, the amounts thus authorized for  such purchases are allocable to the research agreement regardless of the  use that may subsequently be made of the equipment or other capital  items involved.</p><p class="depth0">b. Any costs allocable to a particular research agreement under the  standards provided in these principles may not be shifted to other  research agreements in order to meet deficiencies caused by overruns or  other fund considerations, to avoid restrictions imposed by law or by  terms of the research agreement, or for other reasons of convenience.</p><p class="depth0">5. Applicable Credits</p><p class="depth0">a. The term applicable credits refers to those receipts or negative  expenditure types of transactions which operate to offset or reduce  expense items that are allocable to research agreements as direct or  indirect costs as outlined in paragraph E.1. Typical examples of such  transactions are: Purchase discounts, rebates, or allowances; recoveries  or indemnities on losses; sales of scrap or incidental services;  tuition; adjustments of overpayments or erroneous charges; and services  rendered to patients admitted to federally funded clinical research  centers, primarily for care though also participating in research  protocols.</p><p class="depth0">b. In some instances, the amounts received from the Federal  Government to finance hospital activities or service operations should  be treated as applicable credits. Specifically, the concept of netting  such credit items against related expenditures should be applied by the  hospital in determining the rates or amounts to be charged to government  research for services rendered whenever the facilities or other  resources used in providing such services have been financed directly,  in whole or in part, by federal funds. Thus, where such items are  provided for or benefit a particular hospital activity, i.e., patient  care, research, instruction and training, or other, they should be  treated as an offset to the indirect costs apportioned to that activity.  Where the benefits are common to all hospital activities they should be  treated as a credit to the total indirect cost pool before allocation to  the various cost objectives.</p><p class="depth0">D. Direct Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">Direct costs are those that can be identified specifically with a  particular cost center. For this purpose, the term cost center refers  not only to the ultimate centers against which costs are finally lodged  such as research agreements, but also to other established cost centers  such as the individual accounts for recording particular objects or  items of expense, and the separate account   groupings designed to record the expenses incurred by individual  organizational units, functions, projects and the like. In general, the  administrative functions and service activities described in paragraph  VI are identifiable as separate cost centers, and the expenses  associated with such centers become eligible in due course for  distribution as indirect costs of research agreements and other ultimate  cost centers.</p><p class="depth0">2. Application to Research Agreements</p><p class="depth0">Identifiable benefit to the research work rather than the nature of  the goods and services involved is the determining factor in  distinguishing direct from indirect costs of research agreements.  Typical of transactions chargeable to a research agreement as direct  costs are the compensation of employees for the time or effort devoted  to the performance of work under the research agreement, including  related staff benefit and pension plan costs to the extent that such  items are consistently accorded to all employees and treated by the  hospital as direct rather than indirect costs (see paragraph E.2.d(2));  the costs of materials consumed or expended in the performance of such  work; and other items of expense incurred for the research agreement,  such as extraordinary utility consumption. The cost of materials  supplied from stock or services rendered by specialized facilities or  other institutional service operations may be included as direct costs  of research agreements provided such items are consistently treated by  the institution as direct rather than indirect costs and are charged  under a recognized method of costing or pricing designed to recover only  the actual direct and indirect costs of such material or service and  conforming to generally accepted cost accounting practices consistently  followed by the institution.</p><p class="depth0">E. Indirect Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">Indirect costs are those that have been incurred for common or joint  objectives, and thus are not readily subject to treatment as direct  costs of research agreements or other ultimate or revenue producing cost  centers. In hospitals such costs normally are classified but not  necessarily restricted to the following functional categories:  Depreciation; Administrative and General (including fringe benefits if  not charged directly); Operation of Plant; Maintenance of Plant; Laundry  and Linen Service; Housekeeping; Dietary; Maintenance of Personnel; and  Medical Records and Library.</p><p class="depth0">2. Criteria for Distribution</p><p class="depth0">a. Base period.</p><p class="depth0">A base period for distribution of indirect costs is the period  during which such costs are incurred and accumulated for distribution to  work performed within that period. The base period normally should  coincide with the fiscal year established by the hospital, but in any  event the base period should be so selected as to avoid inequities in  the distribution of costs.</p><p class="depth0">b. Need for cost groupings.</p><p class="depth0">The overall objective of the allocation process is to distribute the  indirect costs described in paragraph F. to organized research, patient  care, instruction and training, and other hospital activities in  reasonable proportions consistent with the nature and extent of the use  of the hospital's resources by research personnel, medical staff,  patients, students, and other personnel or organizations. In order to  achieve this objective with reasonable precision, it may be necessary to  provide for selective distribution by establishing separate groupings of  cost within one or more of the functional categories of indirect costs  referred to in paragraph E.1. In general, the cost groupings established  within a functional category should constitute, in each case, a pool of  those items of expense that are considered to be of like character in  terms of their relative contribution to (or degree of remoteness from)  the particular cost centers to which distribution is appropriate. Each  such pool or cost grouping should then be distributed individually to  the related cost centers, using the distribution base or method most  appropriate in the light of the guides set out in 2.c. below. While this  paragraph places primary emphasis on a step-down method of indirect cost  computation, paragraph H. provides an alternate method which may be used  under certain conditions.</p><p class="depth0">c. Selection of distribution method.</p><p class="depth0">Actual conditions must be taken into account in selecting the method  or base to be used in distributing to related cost centers the expenses  assembled under each of the individual cost groups established as  indicated under 2.b. above. Where a distribution can be made by  assignment of a cost grouping directly to the area benefited, the  distribution should be made in that manner. Care should be given,  however, to eliminate similar or duplicative costs from any other  distribution made to this area. Where the expenses under a cost grouping  are more general in nature, the distribution to related cost centers  should be made through use of a selected base which will produce results  which are equitable to both the Government and the hospital. In general,  any cost element or cost-related factor associated with the hospital's  work is potentially adaptable for use as a distribution base provided:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It can readily be expressed in terms of dollars or other  quantitative measure (total direct expenditures, direct salaries, man- hours applied, square feet utilized, hours of   usage, number of documents processed, population served, and the like);  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It is common to the related cost centers during the base period.  The essential consideration in selection of the distribution base in  each instance is that it be the one best suited for assigning the pool  of costs to related cost centers in accord with the relative benefits  derived; the traceable cause and effect relationship; or logic and  reason, where neither benefit nor cause and effect relationship is  determinable.</p><p class="depth0">d. General consideration on cost groupings.</p><p class="depth0">The extent to which separate cost groupings and selective  distribution would be appropriate at a hospital is a matter of judgment  to be determined on a case-by-case basis. Typical situations which may  warrant the establishment of two or more separate cost groups (based on  account classification or analysis) within a functional category include  but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where certain items or categories of expense relate solely to  one of the major divisions of the hospital (patient care, sponsored  research, instruction and training, or other hospital activities) or to  any two but not all, such expenses should be set aside as a separate  cost grouping for direct assignment or selective distribution in  accordance with the guides provided in 2.b. and 2.c.above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where any types of expense ordinary treated as indirect cost as  outlined in paragraph are charged to research agreements as direct  costs, the similar type expenses applicable to other activities of the  institution must through separate cost grouping be excluded from the  indirect costs allocable to research agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where it is determined that certain expenses are for the support  of a service unit or facility whose output is susceptible of measurement  on a workload or other quantitative basis, such expenses should be set  aside as a separate cost grouping for distribution on such basis to  organized research and other hospital activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where organized activities (including identifiable segments of  organized research as well as the activities cited inB.5.) provide their  own purchasing, personnel administration, building maintenance, or  housekeeping or similar service, the distribution of such elements of  indirect cost to such activities should be accomplished through cost  grouping which includes only that portion of central indirect costs  (such as for overall management) which are properly allocable to such  activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Where the hospital elects to treat as indirect charges the costs  of pension plans and other staff benefits, such costs should be set  aside as a separate cost grouping for selective distribution to related  cost centers, including organized research.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Where the hospital is affiliated with a medical school or some  other institution which performs organized research on the hospital's  premises, every effort should be made to establish separate cost  groupings in the Administrative and General or other applicable category  which will reasonably reflect the use of services and facilities by such  research. (See also paragraph.)</p><p class="depth0">e. Materiality.</p><p class="depth0">Where it is determined that the use of separate cost groupings and  selective distribution are necessary to produce equitable results, the  number of such separate cost groupings within a functional category  should be held within practical limits, after taking into consideration  the materiality of the amounts involved and the degree of precision  attainable through less selective methods of distribution.</p><p class="depth0">3. Administration of Limitations on Allowances for Indirect Costs</p><p class="depth0">a. Research grants may be subject to laws and/or administrative  regulations that limit the allowance for indirect costs under each such  grant to a stated percentage of the direct costs allowed. Agencies that  sponsor such grants will establish procedures which will assure that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The terms and amount authorized in each case conform with the  provisions of paragraphs C, E, and I of these principles as they apply  to matters involving the consistent treatment and allowability of  individual items of cost; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount actually allowed for indirect costs under each such  research grant does not exceed the maximum allowable under the  limitation or the amount otherwise allowable under these principles,  whichever is the smaller.</p><p class="depth0">b. Where the actual allowance for indirect costs on any research  grant must be restricted to the smaller of the two alternative amounts  referred to in 3.a. above, such alternative amounts should be determined  in accordance with the following guides:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The maximum allowable under the limitation should be established  by applying the stated percentage to a direct cost base which shall  include all items of expenditure authorized by the sponsoring agency for  inclusion as part of the total cost for the direct benefit of the work  under the grant; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount otherwise allowable under these principles should be  established by applying the current institutional indirect cost rate to  those elements of direct cost which were included in the base on which  the rate was computed.</p><p class="depth0">c. When the maximum amount allowable under a statutory limitation or  the terms of a research agreement is less than the amount otherwise  allocable as indirect costs under these principles, the amount not  recoverable as indirect costs under the research agreement involved may  not be shifted to other research agreements.</p><p class="depth0">F. Identification and Assignment of Indirect Costs</p><p class="depth0">1. Depreciation or Use Charge</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include depreciation (as  defined in paragraph I.2.i(1)) on buildings, fixed equipment, and  movable equipment, except to the extent purchased through federal funds.  Where adequate records for the recording of depreciation are not  available, a use charge may be substituted for depreciation (See  paragraph I.2.)</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides set forth  in paragraph E.2., on a basis that gives primary emphasis to (a) space  utilization with respect to depreciation on buildings and fixed  equipment; and (b) specific identification of assets and their use with  respect to movable equipment as it relates to patient care, organized  research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities. Where  such records are not sufficient for the purpose of the foregoing,  reasonable estimates will suffice as a means for effecting distribution  of the amounts involved.</p><p class="depth0">2. Administration and General Expenses</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  for the administrative offices of the hospital including accounting,  personnel, purchasing, information centers, telephone expense, and the  like which do not relate solely to any major division of the  institution, i.e., solely to patient care, organized research,  instruction and training, or other hospital activities.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category may be allocated on the  basis of total expenditures exclusive of capital expenditures, or  salaries and wages in situations where the results of the distribution  made on this basis are deemed to be equitable both to the Government and  the hospital; otherwise the distribution of Administration and General  expenses should be made through use of selected bases, applied to  separate cost groupings established within this category of expenses in  accordance with the guides set out in paragraph E.2.</p><p class="depth0">3. Operation of Plant</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading are those that have been incurred  by a central service organization or at the departmental level for the  administration, supervision, and provision of utilities (exclusive of  telephone expense) and protective services to the physical plant. They  include expenses incurred for such items as power plant operations,  general utility costs, elevator operations, protection services, and  general parking lots.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided  in paragraph E.2., on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space  utilization. The allocations should be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where actual space and related cost records are available or can  readily be developed and maintained without significant change in the  accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such  records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the space and related cost records maintained are not  sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of the  proportion of total space assigned to the various costs centers normally  will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the amounts  involved; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where it can be demonstrated that an area or volume or space  basis of allocation is impractical or inequitable, other bases may be  used provided consideration is given to the use of facilities by  research personnel and others, including patients.</p><p class="depth0">4. Maintenance of Plant</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All salaries and wages pertaining to ordinary repair and  maintenance work performed by employees on the payroll of the hospital;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All supplies and parts used in the ordinary repairing and  maintaining of buildings and general equipment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts paid to outside concerns for the ordinary repairing and  maintaining of buildings and general equipment.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  applicable cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided  in paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space  utilization. The allocations and apportionments should be developed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where actual space and related cost records are available and  can readily be developed and maintained without significant change in  the accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such  records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the space and related cost records maintained are not  sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of the  proportion of total space assigned to the various cost centers normally  will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the amounts  involved; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where it can be demonstrated that an area or volume of space  basis of allocation is impractical or inequitable, other basis may be  used provided consideration is given to the use of facilities by  research personnel and others, including patients.</p><p class="depth0">5. Laundry and Linen</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Salaries and wages of laundry department employees,  seamstresses, clean linen handlers, linen delivery men, etc.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Supplies used in connection with the laundry operation and all  linens purchased; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts paid to outside concerns for purchased laundry and/or  linen service.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expense included in this category should be allocated to  related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in  paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to actual pounds  of linen used. The allocations should be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where actual poundage and related cost records are available or  can readily be developed and maintained without significant change in  the accounting practices, the amount distributed should be based on such  records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where it can be demonstrated that a poundage basis of allocation  is impractical or inequitable other bases may be used provided  consideration is given to the use of linen by research personnel and  others, including patients.</p><p class="depth0">6. Housekeeping</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All salaries and wages of the department head, foreman, maids,  porters, janitors, wall washers, and other housekeeping employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All supplies used in carrying out the housekeeping functions;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts paid to outside concerns for purchased services such as  window washing, insect extermination, etc.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in  paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to space actually  serviced by the housekeeping department. The allocations and  apportionments should be developed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where actual space serviced and related cost records are  available or can readily be developed and maintained without significant  change in the accounting practices, the amount distributed should be  based on such records;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the space serviced and related cost records maintained are  not sufficient for purposes of the foregoing, a reasonable estimate of  the proportion of total space assigned to the various cost centers  normally will suffice as a means for effecting distribution of the  amounts of housekeeping expenses involved; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where it can be demonstrated that the space serviced basis of  allocation is impractical or inequitable, other bases may be used  provided consideration is given to the use of housekeeping services by  research personnel and others, including patients.</p><p class="depth0">7. Dietary</p><p class="depth0">a. These expenses, as used herein, shall mean only the subsidy  provided by the hospital to its employees including research personnel  through its cafeteria operation. The hospital must be able to  demonstrate through the use of proper cost accounting techniques that  the cafeteria operates at a loss to the benefit of employees.</p><p class="depth0">b. The reasonable operating loss of a subsidized cafeteria operation  should be allocated to related cost centers in a manner consistent with  the guides provided in paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives primary  emphasis to number of employees.</p><p class="depth0">8. Maintenance (Housing) of Personnel</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The salaries and wages of matrons, clerks, and other employees  engaged in work in nurses' residences and other employees' quarters;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All supplies used in connection with the operation of such  dormitories; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments to outside agencies for the rental of houses,  apartments, or rooms used by hospital personnel.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in  paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives primary emphasis to employee  utilization of housing facilities. The allocation should be developed as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate credit should be given for all payments received  from employees or otherwise to reduce the expense to be allocated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A net cost per housed employee may then be computed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocation should be made on a departmental basis based on the  number of housed employees in each respective department.</p><p class="depth0">9. Medical Records and Library</p><p class="depth0">a. The expenses under this heading should include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The salaries and wages of the records librarian, medical  librarian, clerks, stenographers, etc.; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All supplies such as medical record forms, chart covers, filing  supplies, stationery, medical library books, periodicals, etc.</p><p class="depth0">b. The expenses included in this category should be allocated to  related cost centers in a manner consistent with the guides provided in  paragraph E.2. on a basis that gives   primary emphasis to a special time survey of medical records personnel.  If this appears to be impractical or inequitable, other bases may be  used provided consideration is given to the use of these facilities by  research personnel and others, including patients.</p><p class="depth0">G. Determination and Application of Indirect Cost Rate or Rates</p><p class="depth0">1. Indirect Cost Pools</p><p class="depth0">a. Subject to b. below, indirect costs allocated to organized  research should be treated as a common pool, and the costs in such  common pool should be distributed to individual research agreements  benefiting therefrom on a single rate basis.</p><p class="depth0">b. In some instances a single rate basis for use on all government  research at a hospital may not be appropriate since it would not take  into account those different environmental factors which may affect  substantially the indirect costs applicable to a particular segment of  government research at the institution. For this purpose, a particular  segment of government research may be that performed under a single  research agreement or it may consist of research under a group of  research agreements performed in a common environment. The environmental  factors are not limited to the physical location of the work. Other  important factors are the level of the administrative support required,  the nature of the facilities or other resources employed, the scientific  disciplines or technical skills involved, the organizational  arrangements used, or any combination thereof. Where a particular  segment of government research is performed within an environment which  appears to generate a significantly different level of indirect costs,  provision should be made for a separate indirect cost pool applicable to  such work. An example of this differential may be in the development of  a separate indirect cost pool for a clinical research center grant. The  separate indirect cost pool should be developed during the course of the  regular distribution process, and the separate indirect cost rate  resulting therefrom should be utilized provided it is determined that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such indirect cost rate differs significantly from that which  would have obtained under a. above; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The volume of research work to which such rate would apply is  material in relation to other government research at the institution.</p><p class="depth0">c. It is a common practice for grants or contracts awarded to other  institutions, typically University Schools of Medicine, to be performed  on hospital premises. In these cases the hospital should develop a  separate indirect cost pool applicable to the work under such grants or  contracts. This pool should be developed by a selective distribution of  only those indirect cost categories which benefit the work performed by  the other institution, within the practical limits dictated by available  data and the materiality of the amounts involved. Hospital costs  determined to be allocable to grants or contracts awarded to another  institution may not be recovered as a cost of grants or contracts  awarded directly to the hospital.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Distribution Base</p><p class="depth0">Preferably, indirect costs allocated to organized research should be  distributed to applicable research agreements on the basis of direct  salaries and wages. However, where the use of salaries and wages results  in an inequitable allocation of costs to the research agreements, total  direct costs or a variation thereof, may be used in lieu of salaries and  wages. Regardless of the base used, an indirect cost rate should be  determined for each of the separate indirect cost pools developed  pursuant to paragraph G.1. The rate in each case should be stated as the  percentage which the amount of the particular indirect cost pool is of  the total direct salaries and wages (or other base selected) for all  research agreements identified with such a pool.</p><p class="depth0">3. Negotiated Lump Sum for Overhead</p><p class="depth0">A negotiated fixed amount in lieu of indirect costs may be  appropriate for self-contained or off-campus research activities where  the benefits derived from a hospital's indirect services cannot be  readily determined. Such amount negotiated in lieu of indirect costs  will be treated as an offset to the appropriate indirect cost pool after  allocation to patient care, organized research, instruction and  training, and other hospital activities. The base on which such  remaining expenses are allocated should be appropriately adjusted.</p><p class="depth0">4. Predetermined Overhead Rates</p><p class="depth0">The utilization of predetermined fixed overhead rates may offer  potential advantages in the administration of research agreements by  facilitating the preparation of research budgets and permitting more  expeditious close out of the agreements when the work is completed.  Therefore, to the extent allowed by law, consideration may be given to  the negotiation of predetermined fixed rates in those situations where  the cost experience and other pertinent factors available are deemed  sufficient to enable the Government and the hospital to reach a  reasonable conclusion as to the probable level of the indirect cost rate  for the ensuing accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">H. Simplified Method for Small Institutions</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">a. Where the total direct cost of all government-sponsored research  and development work at a hospital in a year is minimal, the use of the  abbreviated procedure described in paragraph H.2. below may be  acceptable in the determination of allowable indirect costs. This method  may also be used to initially determine a provisional indirect cost rate  for hospitals that have not previously established a rate. Under this  abbreviated procedure, data taken directly from the institution's most  recent annual financial report and immediately available supporting  information will be utilized as a basis for determining the indirect  cost rate applicable to research agreements at the institution.</p><p class="depth0">b. The rigid formula approach provided under the abbreviated  procedure has limitations which may preclude its use at some hospitals  either because the minimum data required for this purpose are not  readily available or because the application of the abbreviated  procedure to the available data produces results which appear  inequitable to the Government or the hospital. In any such case,  indirect costs should be determined through use of the regular procedure  rather than the abbreviated procedure.</p><p class="depth0">c. In certain instances where the total direct cost of all  government-sponsored research and development work at the hospital is  more than minimal, the abbreviated procedure may be used if prior  permission is obtained. This alternative will be granted only in those  cases where it can be demonstrated that the step-down technique cannot  be followed.</p><p class="depth0">2. Abbreviated Procedure</p><p class="depth0">a. Total expenditures as taken from the most recent annual financial  report will be adjusted by eliminating from further consideration  expenditures for capital items as defined in paragraph I.2.d. and  unallowable costs as defined under various headings in paragraph I. and  paragraph C.5.</p><p class="depth0">b. Total expenditures as adjusted under the foregoing will then be  distributed among (1) expenditures applicable to administrative and  general overhead functions, (2) expenditures applicable to all other  overhead functions, and (3) expenditures for all other purposes. The  first group shall include amounts associated with the functional  categories, Administration and General, and Dietary, as defined in  paragraphs F.2. and 7. The second group shall include Depreciation,  Operation of Plant, Maintenance of Plant, and Housekeeping. The third  group--expenditures for all other purposes--shall include the amounts  applicable to all other activities, namely, patient care, organized  research, instruction and training, and other hospital activities as  defined under paragraph B.5. For the purposes of this section, the  functional categories of Laundry and Linen, Maintenance of Personnel,  and Medical Records and Library as defined in paragraph E. shall be  considered as expenditures for all other purposes.</p><p class="depth0">c. The expenditures distributed to the first two groups in paragraph  H.2.b. should then be adjusted by those receipts or negative expenditure  types of transactions which tend to reduce expense items allocable to  research agreements as indirect costs. Examples of such receipts or  negative expenditures are itemized in paragraph C.5.a.</p><p class="depth0">d. In applying the procedures in paragraphs H.2.a and 2.b, the cost  of unallowable activities such as Gift Shop, Investment Property  Management, Fund Raising, and Public Relations, when they benefit from  the hospital's indirect cost services, should be treated as expenditures  for all other purposes. Such activities are presumed to benefit from the  hospital's indirect cost services when they include salaries of  personnel working in the hospital. When they do not include such  salaries, they should be eliminated from the indirect cost rate  computation.</p><p class="depth0">e. The indirect cost rate will then be computed in two stages. The  first stage requires the computation of an Administrative and General  rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of research direct  costs over total direct costs to the Administrative and General pool  developed under paragraphs H.2.b and 2.c. above. The resultant amount-- that which is allocable to research--is divided by the direct research  cost base. The second stage requires the computation of an All Other  Indirect Cost rate component. This is done by applying a ratio of  research direct space over total direct space to All Other Indirect Cost  pool developed under paragraphs H.2.b. and 2.c. above. The resultant  amount--that which is allocable to research--is divided by the direct  research cost base.</p><p class="depth0">The total of the two rate components will be the institution's  indirect cost rate. For the purposes of this section, the research  direct cost or space and total direct cost or space will be that cost or  space identified with the functional categories classified under  Expenditures for all other purposes under paragraph H.2.b.</p><p class="depth0">I. General Standards for Selected Items of Cost</p><p class="depth0">1. General</p><p class="depth0">This section provides standards to be applied in establishing the  allowability of certain items involved in determining cost. These  standards should apply irrespective of whether a particular item of cost  is properly treated as direct cost or indirect cost. Failure to mention  a particular item of cost in the standards is not intended to imply that   it is either allowable or unallowable; rather, determination as to  allowability in each case should be based on the treatment or standards  provided for similar or related items of cost. In case of discrepancy  between the provisions of a specific research agreement and the  applicable standards provided, the provisions of the research agreement  should govern. However, in some cases advance understandings should be  reached on particular cost items in order that the full costs of  research be supported. The extent of allowability of the selected items  of cost covered in this section has been stated to apply broadly to many  accounting systems in varying environmental situations. Thus, as to any  given research agreement, the reasonableness and allocability of certain  items of costs may be difficult to determine, particularly in connection  with hospitals which have medical school or other affiliations. In order  to avoid possible subsequent disallowance or dispute based on  unreasonableness or nonallocability, it is important that prospective  recipients of federal funds, particularly those whose work is  predominantly or substantially with the Government, seek agreement with  the Government in advance of the incurrence of special or unusual costs  in categories where reasonableness or allocability are difficult to  determine. Such agreement may also be initiated by the Government. Any  such agreement should be incorporated in the research agreement itself.  However, the absence of such an advance agreement on any element of cost  will not in itself serve to make that element either allowable or  unallowable. Examples of costs on which advance agreements may be  particularly important are:</p><p class="depth0">a. Facilities costs, such as;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Depreciation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rental</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use charges for fully depreciated assets</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Idle facilities and idle capacity</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plant reconversion</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Extraordinary or deferred maintenance and repair</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Acquisition of automatic data processing equipment.</p><p class="depth0">b. Pre-award costs</p><p class="depth0">c. Non-hospital professional activities</p><p class="depth0">d. Self-insurance</p><p class="depth0">e. Support services charged directly (computer services, printing  and duplicating services, etc.)</p><p class="depth0">f. Employee compensation, travel, and other personnel costs,  including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for personal service, including wages and salaries,  bonuses and incentives, premium payments, pay for time not worked, and  supplementary compensation and benefits, such as pension and retirement,  group insurance, severance pay plans, and other forms of compensation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Morale, health, welfare, and food service and dormitory costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Training and education costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Relocation costs, including special or mass personnel movement.</p><p class="depth0">2. Selected Items</p><p class="depth0">a. Advertising costs. The term advertising costs means the costs of  advertising media and corollary administrative costs. Advertising media  include magazines, newspapers, radio and television programs, direct  mail, exhibits, and the like. The only advertising costs allowable are  those which are solely for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The recruitment of persons required for the performance by the  institution of obligations arising under the research agreement, when  considered in conjunction with all other recruitment costs as set forth  in paragraph I.2.hh;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The procurement of scarce items for the performance of the  research agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The disposal of scrap or surplus materials acquired in the  performance of the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Costs of this nature, if incurred for more than one research  agreement or for both research agreement work and other work of the  institution, are allowable to the extent that the principles in  paragraphs D. and E. are observed.</p><p class="depth0">b. Bad debts. Losses arising from uncollectible accounts and other  claims and related collection and legal costs are unallowable except  that a bad debt may be included as a direct cost of the research  agreement to the extent that it is caused by a research patient and  approved by the awarding agency. This inclusion is only intended to  cover the situation of the patient admitted for research purposes who  subsequently or in conjunction with the research receives clinical care  for which a charge is made to the patient. If, after exhausting all  means of collecting these charges, a bad debt results, it may be  considered an appropriate charge to the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">c. Bonding costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bonding costs arise when the Government requires assurance  against financial loss to itself or others by reason of the act or  default of the hospital. They arise also in instances where the hospital  requires similar assurance.</p><p class="depth0">Included are such types as bid, performance, payment, advance  payment, infringement, and fidelity bonds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs of bonding required pursuant to the terms of the research  agreement are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs of bonding required by the hospital in the general conduct  of its business are allowable to the extent that such bonding is in  accordance with sound business practice and the rates and premiums are  reasonable under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth0">d. Capital expenditures. The costs of equipment, buildings, and  repairs which materially increase the value or useful life of buildings  or equipment should be capitalized and are unallowable except as  provided for in the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">e. Civil defense costs. Civil defense costs are those incurred in  planning for, and the protection of life and property against the  possible effects of enemy attack. Reasonable costs of civil defense  measures (including costs in excess of normal plant protection costs,  first-aid training and supplies, fire-fighting training, posting of  additional exit notices and directions, and other approved civil defense  measures) undertaken on the institution's premises pursuant to  suggestions or requirements of civil defense authorities are allowable  when distributed to all activities of the institution. Capital  expenditures for civil defense purposes will not be allowed, but a use  allowance or depreciation may be permitted in accordance with provisions  set forth elsewhere. Costs of local civil defense projects not on the  institution's premises are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">f. Communication costs. Costs incurred for telephone services, local  and long distance telephone calls, telegrams, radiograms, postage, and  the like are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">g. Compensation for personal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General</p><p class="depth0">Compensation for personal services covers all remuneration paid  currently or accrued to employees of the hospital for services rendered  during the period of performance under government research agreements.  Such remuneration includes salaries, wages, staff benefits (see  paragraph I.2.j.), and pension plan costs (see paragraph I.2.y.). The  costs of such remuneration are allowable to the extent that the total  compensation to individual employees is reasonable for the services  rendered and conforms to the established policy of the institution  consistently applied, and provided that the charges for work performed  directly on government research agreements and for other work allocable  as indirect costs to sponsored research are determined and supported as  hereinafter provided. For non-profit, non-proprietary institutions,  where federally supported programs constitute less than a preponderance  of the activity at the institution the primary test of reasonableness  will be to require that the institution's compensation policies be  applied consistently both to federally-sponsored and non-sponsored  activities alike. However, where special circumstances so dictate a  contractual clause may be utilized which calls for application of the  test of comparability in determining the reasonableness of compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payroll Distribution</p><p class="depth0">Amounts charged to organized research for personal services,  regardless of whether treated as direct costs or allocated as indirect  costs, will be based on hospital payrolls which have been approved and  documented in accordance with generally accepted hospital practices. In  order to develop necessary direct and indirect allocations of cost,  supplementary data on time or effort as provided in paragraph (3) below,  normally need be required only for individuals whose compensation is  properly chargeable to two or more research agreements or to two or more  of the following broad functional categories: (i) Patient care; (ii)  organized research; (iii) instruction and training; (iv) indirect  activities as defined in paragraph E.1.; or (v) other hospital  activities as defined in paragraph B.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reporting Time or Effort</p><p class="depth0">Charges for salaries and wages of individuals other than members of  the professional staff will be supported by daily time and attendance  and payroll distribution records. For members of the professional staff,  current and reasonable estimates of the percentage distribution of their  total effort may be used as support in the absence of actual time  records. The term professional staff for purposes of this section  includes physicians, research associates, and other personnel performing  work at responsible levels of activities. These personnel normally  fulfill duties, the competent performance of which usually requires  persons possessing degrees from accredited institutions of higher  learning and/or state licensure. In order to qualify as current and  reasonable, estimates must be made no later than one month (though not  necessarily a calendar month) after the month in which the services were  performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Preparation of Estimates of Effort</p><p class="depth0">Where required under paragraph (3) above, estimates of effort spent  by a member of the professional staff on each research agreement should  be prepared by the individual who performed the services or by a  responsible individual such as a department head or supervisor having  first-hand knowledge of the services performed on each research  agreement. Estimates must show the allocation of effort between  organized research and all other hospital activities in terms of the  percentage of total effort devoted to each of the broad functional  categories referred to in (2) above. The estimate of effort spent on a  research agreement may include a reasonable amount of time spent in  activities contributing and intimately related to work under the  agreement, such as preparing and delivering special lectures about  specific aspects of the ongoing research, writing research reports and  articles, participating in   appropriate research seminars, consulting with colleagues with respect  to related research, and attending appropriate scientific meetings and  conferences. The term ``all other hospital activities'' would include  departmental research, administration, committee work, and public  services undertaken on behalf of the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Application of Budget Estimates</p><p class="depth0">Estimates determined before the performance of services, such as  budget estimates on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis do not qualify  as estimates of effort spent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Non-Hospital Professional Activities</p><p class="depth0">A hospital must not alter or waive hospital-wide policies and  practices dealing with the permissible extent of professional services  over and above those traditionally performed without extra hospital  compensation, unless such arrangements are specifically authorized by  the sponsoring agency. Where hospital-wide policies do not adequately  define the permissible extent of consultantships or other non-hospital  activities undertaken for extra pay, the Government may require that the  effort of professional staff working under research agreements be  allocated as between (i) hospital activities, and (ii) non-hospital  professional activities. If the sponsoring agency should consider the  extent of non-hospital professional effort excessive, appropriate  arrangements governing compensation will be negotiated on a case by case  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Salary Rates for Part-Time Appointments</p><p class="depth0">Charges for work performed on government research by staff members  having only part-time appointments will be determined at a rate not in  excess of that for which he is regularly paid for his part-time staff  assignment.</p><p class="depth0">h. Contingency provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Contributions to a contingency reserve or any similar provisions  made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with  certainty as to time, intensity, or with an assurance of their  happening, are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">i. Depreciation and use allowances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Hospitals may be compensated for the use of buildings, capital  improvements and usable equipment on hand through depreciation or use  allowances. Depreciation is a charge to current operations which  distributes the cost of a tangible capital asset, less estimated  residual value, over the estimated useful life of the asset in a  systematic and logical manner. It does not involve a process of  valuation. Useful life has reference to the prospective period of  economic usefulness in the particular hospital's operations as  distinguished from physical life. Use allowances are the means of  allowing compensation when depreciation or other equivalent costs are  not considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Due consideration will be given to government-furnished research  facilities utilized by the institution when computing use allowances  and/or depreciation if the government-furnished research facilities are  material in amount. Computation of the use allowance and/or depreciation  will exclude both the cost or any portion of the cost of grounds,  buildings and equipment borne by or donated by the Federal Government,  irrespective of where title was originally vested or where it presently  resides, and secondly, the cost of grounds. Capital expenditures for  land improvements (paved areas, fences, streets, sidewalks, utility  conduits, and similar improvements not already included in the cost of  buildings) are allowable provided the systematic amortization of such  capital expenditures has been provided in the institution's books of  accounts, based on reasonable determinations of the probable useful  lives of the individual items involved, and the share allocated to  organized research is developed from the amount thus amortized for the  base period involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Normal depreciation on a hospital's plant, equipment, and other  capital facilities, except as excluded by (4) below, is an allowable  element of research cost provided that the amount thereof is computed:</p><p class="depth0">i. Upon the property cost basis used by the hospital for Federal  Income Tax purposes (See section 167 of the Internal Revenue Code of  1954); or</p><p class="depth0">ii. In the case of non-profit or tax exempt organizations, upon a  property cost basis which could have been used by the hospital for  Federal Income Tax purposes, had such hospital been subject to the  payment of income tax; and in either case</p><p class="depth0">iii. By the consistent application to the assets concerned of any  generally accepted accounting method, and subject to the limitations of  the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as amended, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The straight line method;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The declining balance method, using a rate not exceeding twice  the rate which would have been used had the annual allowance been  computed under the method described in (a) above;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The sum of the years-digits method; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Any other consistent method productive of an annual allowance  which, when added to all allowances for the period commencing with the  use of the property and including the current year, does not during the  first two-thirds of the useful life of the property exceed the total of  such allowances which would have been used had such allowances been  computed under the method described in (b) above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the depreciation method is followed, adequate property  records must be   maintained. The period of useful service (service life) established in  each case for usable capital assets must be determined on a realistic  basis which takes into consideration such factors as type of  construction, nature of the equipment used, technological developments  in the particular research area, and the renewal and replacement  policies followed for the individual items or classes of assets  involved. Where the depreciation method is introduced for application to  assets acquired in prior years, the annual charges therefrom must not  exceed the amounts that would have resulted had the depreciation method  been in effect from the date of acquisition of such assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Depreciation on idle or excess facilities shall not be allowed  except on such facilities as are reasonably necessary for standby  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Where an institution elects to go on a depreciation basis for a  particular class of assets, no depreciation, rental or use charge may be  allowed on any such assets that would be viewed as fully depreciated;  provided, however, that reasonable use charges may be negotiated for any  such assets if warranted after taking into consideration the cost of the  facility or item involved, the estimated useful life remaining at time  of negotiation, the actual replacement policy followed in the light of  service lives used for calculating depreciation, the effect of any  increased maintenance charges or decreased efficiency due to age, and  any other factors pertinent to the utilization of the facility or item  for the purpose contemplated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Hospitals which choose a depreciation allowance for assets  purchased prior to 1966 based on a percentage of operating costs in lieu  of normal depreciation for purposes of reimbursement under Pub. L. 89-97  (Medicare) shall utilize that method for determining depreciation  applicable to organized research.</p><p class="depth0">The operating costs to be used are the lower of the hospital's 1965  operating costs or the hospital's current year's allowable costs. The  percent to be applied is 5 percent starting with the year 1966-67, with  such percentage being uniformity reduced by one-half percent each  succeeding year. The allowance based on operating costs is in addition  to regular depreciation on assets acquired after 1965. However, the  combined amount of such allowance on pre-1966 assets and the allowance  for actual depreciation on assets acquired after 1965 may not exceed 6  percent of the hospital's allowable cost for the current year. After  total depreciation has been computed, allocation methods are used to  determine the share attributable to organized research.</p><p class="depth0">For purposes of this section, Operating Costs means the total costs  incurred by the hospital in operating the institution, and includes  patient care, research, and other activities. Allowable Costs means  operating costs less unallowable costs as defined in these principles;  by the application of allocation methods to the total amount of such  allowable costs, the share attributable to Federally-sponsored research  is determined.</p><p class="depth0">A hospital which elects to use this procedure under Pub. L. 89-97  and subsequently changes to an actual depreciation basis on pre-1966  assets in accordance with the option afforded under the Medicare program  shall simultaneously change to an actual depreciation basis for  organized research.</p><p class="depth0">Where the hospital desires to change to actual depreciation but  either has no historical cost records or has incomplete records, the  determination of historical cost could be made through appropriate means  involving expert consultation with the determination being subject to  review and approval by the Department of Health and Human Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Where the use allowance method is followed, the use allowance  for buildings and improvements will be computed at an annual rate not  exceeding two percent of acquisition cost. The use allowance for  equipment will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding six and two- thirds percent of acquisition cost of usable equipment in those cases  where the institution maintains current records with respect to such  equipment on hand. Where the institution's records reflect only the cost  (actual or estimated) of the original complement of equipment, the use  allowance will be computed at an annual rate not exceeding ten percent  of such cost. Original complement for this purpose means the complement  of equipment initially placed in buildings to perform the functions  currently being performed in such buildings; however, where a permanent  change in the function of a building takes place, a redetermination of  the original complement of equipment may be made at that time to  establish a new original complement. In those cases where no equipment  records are maintained, the institution will justify a reasonable  estimate of the acquisition cost of usable equipment which may be used  to compute the use allowance at an annual rate not exceeding six and  two-thirds percent of such estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Depreciation and/or use charges should usually be allocated to  research and other activities as an indirect cost.</p><p class="depth0">j. Employee morale, health, and welfare costs and credits.</p><p class="depth0">The costs of house publications, health or first-aid benefits,  recreational activities, employees' counseling services, and other  expenses incurred in accordance with the hospital's established practice  or custom for the improvement of working conditions, employer-employee  relations, employee morale, and employee performance, are allowable.  Such costs will be equitably apportioned to all activities of the  hospital. Income generated from any of these activities will be   credited to the cost thereof unless such income has been irrevocably set  over to employee welfare organizations.</p><p class="depth0">k. Entertainment costs.</p><p class="depth0">Except as pertains to j. above, costs incurred for amusement, social  activities, entertainment, and any items relating thereto, such as  meals, lodging, rentals, transportation, and gratuities are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">l. Equipment and other facilities.</p><p class="depth0">The cost of equipment or other facilities are allowable on a direct  charge basis where such purchases are approved by the sponsoring agency  concerned or provided for by the terms of the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">m. Fines and penalties.</p><p class="depth0">Costs resulting from violations of, or failure of the institution to  comply with federal, state and local laws and regulations are  unallowable except when incurred as a result of compliance with specific  provisions of the research agreement, or instructions in writing from  the awarding agency.</p><p class="depth0">n. Insurance and indemnification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs of insurance required or approved and maintained pursuant  to the research agreement are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs of other insurance maintained by the hospital in  connection with the general conduct of its activities are allowable  subject to the following limitations: (i) Types and extent and cost of  coverage must be in accordance with sound institutional practice; (ii)  costs of insurance or of any contributions to any reserve covering the  risk of loss of or damage to government owned property are unallowable  except to the extent that the Government has specifically required or  approved such costs; and (iii) costs of insurance on the lives of  officers or trustees are unallowable except where such insurance is part  of an employee plan which is not unduly restricted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contributions to a reserve for an approved self-insurance  program are allowable to the extent that the types of coverage, extent  of coverage, and the rates and premiums would have been allowed had  insurance been purchased to cover the risks. Such contributions are  subject to prior approval of the Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Actual losses which could have been covered by permissible  insurance (through an approved self-insurance program or otherwise) are  unallowable unless expressly provided for in the research agreement,  except that costs incurred because of losses not covered under nominal  deductible insurance coverage provided in keeping with sound management  practice as well as minor losses not covered by insurance such as  spoilage, breakage and disappearance of small hand tools which occur in  the ordinary course of operations are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">o. Interest, fund raising and investment management costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs incurred for interest on borrowed capital or temporary use  of endowment funds, however represented, are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs of organized fund raising, including financial campaigns,  endowment drives, solicitation of gifts and bequests, and similar  expenses incurred solely to raise capital or obtain contributions are  not allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs of investment counsel and staff and similar expenses  incurred solely to enhance income from investments are not allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Costs related to the physical custody and control of monies and  securities are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">p. Labor relations costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred in maintaining satisfactory relations between the  hospital and its employees, including costs of labor management  committees, employees' publications, and other related activities are  allowable.</p><p class="depth0">q. Losses on research agreements or contracts.</p><p class="depth0">Any excess of costs over income under any agreement or contract of  any nature is unallowable. This includes, but is not limited to, the  hospital's contributed portion by reason of cost-sharing agreements,  under-recoveries through negotiation of flat amounts for overhead, or  legal or administrative limitations.</p><p class="depth0">r. Maintenance and repair costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs necessary for the upkeep of property (including government  property unless otherwise provided for), which neither add to the  permanent value of the property nor appreciably prolong its intended  life, but keep it in an efficient operating condition, are to be treated  as follows:</p><p class="depth0">i. Normal maintenance and repair costs are allowable;</p><p class="depth0">ii. Extraordinary maintenance and repair costs are allowable,  provided they are allocated to the periods to which applicable for  purposes of determining research costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expenditures for plant and equipment, including rehabilitation  thereof, which according to generally accepted accounting principles as  applied under the hospital's established policy, should be capitalized  and subjected to depreciation, are allowable only on a depreciation  basis.</p><p class="depth0">s. Material costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred for purchased materials, supplies and fabricated  parts directly or indirectly related to the research agreement, are  allowable. Purchases made specifically for the research agreement should  be charged thereto at their actual prices after deducting all cash  discounts, trade discounts, rebates, and allowances received by the  institution. Withdrawals from general stores or stockrooms should be  charged at their cost under any recognized method of pricing stores  withdrawals conforming to sound accounting practices consistently  followed by the hospital. Incoming transportation charges are a proper  part of material   cost. Direct material cost should include only the materials and  supplies actually used for the performance of the research agreement,  and due credit should be given for any excess materials retained or  returned to vendors. Due credit should be given for all proceeds or  value received for any scrap resulting from work under the research  agreement. Where government donated or furnished material is used in  performing the research agreement, such material will be used without  charge.</p><p class="depth0">t. Memberships, subscriptions and professional activity costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs of the hospital's membership in civic, business, technical  and professional organizations are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Costs of the hospital's subscriptions to civic, business,  professional and technical periodicals are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs of meetings and conferences, when the primary purpose is  the dissemination of technical information, are allowable. This includes  costs of meals, transportation, rental of facilities, and other items  incidental to such meetings or conferences.</p><p class="depth0">u. Organization costs.</p><p class="depth0">Expenditures such as incorporation fees, attorneys' fees,  accountants' fees, brokers' fees, fees to promoters and organizers in  connection with (1) organization or reorganization of a hospital, or (2)  raising capital, are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">v. Other business expenses.</p><p class="depth0">Included in this item are such recurring expenses as registry and  transfer charges resulting from changes in ownership of securities  issued by the hospital, cost of shareholders meetings preparation and  publication of reports to shareholders, preparation and submission of  required reports and forms to taxing and other regulatory bodies, and  incidental costs of directors and committee meetings. The above and  similar costs are allowable when allocated on an equitable basis.</p><p class="depth0">w. Patient care.</p><p class="depth0">The cost of routine and ancillary or special services to research  patients is an allowable direct cost of research agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Routine services shall include the costs of the regular room,  dietary and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and  the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not  customarily made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ancillary or special services are the services for which charges  are customarily made in addition to routine services, such as operating  rooms, anesthesia, laboratory, BMR-EKG, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Patient care, whether expressed as a rate or an amount, shall be  computed in a manner consistent with the procedures used to determine  reimbursable costs under Pub. L. 89-97 (Medicare Program) as defined  under the ``Principles of Reimbursement For Provider Costs'' published  by the Social Security Administration of the Department of Health and  Human Services. The allowability of specific categories of cost shall be  in accordance with those principles rather than the principles for  research contained herein. In the absence of participation in the  Medicare program by a hospital, all references to the Medicare program  in these principles shall be construed as meaning the Medicaid program.</p><p class="depth0">i. Once costs have been recognized as allowable, the indirect costs  or general service center's cost shall be allocated (stepped-down) to  special service centers, and all patient and nonpatient costs centers  based upon actual services received or benefiting these centers.</p><p class="depth0">ii. After allocation, routine and ancillary costs shall be  apportioned to scatter-bed research patients on the same basis as is  used to apportion costs to Medicare patients, i.e. using either the  departmental method or the combination method, as those methods are  defined by the Social Security Administration; except that final  settlement shall be on a grant-by-grant basis. However, to the extent  that the Social Security Administration has recognized any other method  of cost apportionment, that method generally shall also be recognized as  applicable to the determination of research patient care costs.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A cost center must be established on Medicare reimbursement  forms for each discrete-bed unit grant award received by a hospital.  Routine costs should be stepped-down to this line item(s) in the normal  course of stepping-down costs under Medicare/Medicaid requirements.  However, in stepping-down routine costs, consideration must be given to  preventing a step-down of those costs to discrete-bed unit line items  that have already been paid for directly by the grant, such as bedside  nursing costs. Ancillary costs allocable to research discrete-bed units  shall be determined and proposed in accordance with paragraph w.(3).ii.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where federally sponsored research programs provide specifically  for the direct reimbursement of nursing, dietary, and other services,  appropriate adjustment must be made to patient care costs to preclude  duplication and/or misallocation of costs.</p><p class="depth0">x. Patent costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs of preparing disclosures, reports and other documents required  by the research agreement and of searching the art to the extent  necessary to make such invention disclosures are allowable. In  accordance with the clauses of the research agreement relating to  patents, costs of preparing documents and any other patent costs, in  connection with the filing of a patent application where title is  conveyed to the Government, are allowable. (See also paragraph I.2.jj.)</p><p class="depth0">y. Pension plan costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs of the hospital's pension plan which are incurred in  accordance with the established policies of the institution are  allowable, provided such policies meet the test of reasonableness and  the methods of cost allocation are not discriminatory, and provided  appropriate adjustments are made for credits or gains arising out of  normal and abnormal employee turnover or any other contingencies that  can result in forfeitures by employees which inure to the benefit of the  hospital.</p><p class="depth0">z. Plan security costs.</p><p class="depth0">Necessary expenses incurred to comply with government security  requirements including wages, uniforms and equipment of personnel  engaged in plant protection are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">aa. Pre-research agreement costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred prior to the effective date of the research  agreement, whether or not they would have been allowable thereunder if  incurred after such date, are unallowable unless specifically set forth  and identified in the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">bb. Professional services costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs of professional services rendered by the members of a  particular profession who are not employees of the hospital are  allowable subject to (2) and (3) below when reasonable in relation to  the services rendered and when not contingent upon recovery of the costs  from the Government. Retainer fees to be allowable must be reasonably  supported by evidence of services rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Factors to be considered in determining the allowability of  costs in a particular case include (i) the past pattern of such costs,  particularly in the years prior to the award of government research  agreements on the institution's total activity; (ii) the nature and  scope of managerial services expected of the institution's own  organizations; and (iii) whether the proportion of government work to  the hospital's total activity is such as to influence the institution in  favor of incurring the cost, particularly where the services rendered  are not of a continuing nature and have little relationship to work  under government research agreements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs of legal, accounting and consulting services, and related  costs incurred in connection with organization and reorganization or the  prosecution of claims against the Government are unallowable. Costs of  legal, accounting and consulting services, and related costs incurred in  connection with patent infringement litigation are unallowable unless  otherwise provided for in the research agreement.</p><p class="depth0">cc. Profits and losses on disposition of plant equipment, or other  assets.</p><p class="depth0">Profits or losses of any nature arising from the sale or exchange of  plant, equipment, or other capital assets, including sales or exchange  of either short- or long-term investments, shall be excluded in  computing research agreement costs.</p><p class="depth0">dd. Proposal costs.</p><p class="depth0">Proposal costs are the costs of preparing bids or proposals on  potential government and non-government research agreements or projects,  including the development of technical data and cost data necessary to  support the institution's bids or proposals. Proposal costs of the  current accounting period of both successful and unsuccessful bids and  proposals normally should be treated as indirect costs and allocated  currently to all activities of the institution, and no proposal costs of  past accounting periods will be allocable in the current period to the  government research agreement. However, the institution's established  practices may be to treat proposal costs by some other recognized  method. Regardless of the methods used, the results obtained may be  accepted only if found to be reasonable and equitable.</p><p class="depth0">ee. Public information services costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs of news releases pertaining to specific research or scientific  accomplishment are unallowable unless specifically authorized by the  sponsoring agency.</p><p class="depth0">ff. Rearrangement and alteration costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred for ordinary or normal rearrangement and alteration  of facilities are allowable. Special rearrangement and alteration costs  incurred specifically for a project are allowable only as a direct  charge when such work has been approved in advance by the sponsoring  agency concerned.</p><p class="depth0">gg. Reconversion costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred in the restoration or rehabilitation of the  institution's facilities to approximately the same condition existing  immediately prior to commencement of government research agreement work,  fair wear and tear excepted, are allowable.</p><p class="depth0">hh. Recruiting costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Subject to (2), (3), and (4) below, and provided that the size  of the staff recruited and maintained is in keeping with workload  requirements, costs of ``help wanted'' advertising, operating costs of  an employment office necessary to secure and maintain an adequate staff,  costs of operating an aptitude and educational testing program, travel  costs of employees while engaged in recruiting personnel, travel costs  of applicants for interviews for prospective employment, and relocation  costs incurred incident to recruitment of new employees are allowable to  the extent that such costs are incurred pursuant to a well-managed  recruitment program. Where an institution uses employment agencies,  costs not in excess of standard commercial rates for such services are  allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In publications, costs of help wanted advertising that includes  color, includes advertising material for other than recruitment  purposes, or is excessive in size (taking into consideration recruitment  purposes for   which intended and normal institutional practices in this respect) are  unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Costs of help wanted advertising, special emoluments; fringe  benefits, and salary allowances incurred to attract professional  personnel from other institutions that do not meet the test of  reasonableness or do not conform with the established practices of the  institution are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where relocation costs incurred incident to recruitment of a new  employee have been allowed either as an allocable direct or indirect  cost, and the newly hired employee resigns for reasons within his  control within twelve months after hire, the institution will be  required to refund or credit such relocations costs as were charged to  the Government.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Rental costs (including sale and lease-back of facilities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rental costs of land, building, and equipment and other personal  property are allowable if the rates are reasonable in light of such  factors as rental costs of comparable facilities and market conditions  in the area, the type, life expectancy, condition, and value of the  facilities leased, options available, and other provisions of the rental  agreement. Application of these factors, in situations where rentals are  extensively used, may involve among other considerations comparison of  rental costs with the amount which the hospital would have received had  it owned the facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Charges in the nature of rent between organizations having a  legal or other affiliation or arrangement such as hospitals, medical  schools, foundations, etc., are allowable to the extent such charges do  not exceed the normal costs of ownership such as depreciation, taxes,  insurance, and maintenance, provided that no part of such costs shall  duplicate any other allowed costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise specifically provided in the agreement, rental  costs specified in sale and lease-back agreements incurred by hospitals  through selling plant facilities to investment organizations such as  insurance companies or to private investors, and concurrently leasing  back the same facilities are allowable only to the extent that such  rentals do not exceed the amount which the hospital would have received  had it retained legal title to the facilities.</p><p class="depth0">jj. Royalties and other costs for use of patents.</p><p class="depth0">Royalties on a patent or amortization of the cost of acquiring a  patent or invention or rights thereto necessary for the proper  performance of the research agreement and applicable to tasks or  processes thereunder are allowable unless the Government has a license  or the right to free use of the patent, the patent has been adjudicated  to be invalid, or has been administratively determined to be invalid,  the patent is considered to be unenforceable, or the patent has expired.</p><p class="depth0">kk. Severance pay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Severance pay is compensation in addition to regular salaries  and wages which is paid by a hospital to employees whose services are  being terminated. Costs of severance pay are allowable only to the  extent that such payments are required by law, by employer-employee  agreement, by established policy that constitutes in effect an implied  agreement on the institution's part, or by circumstances of the  particular employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Severance payments that are due to normal, recurring turnover,  and which otherwise meet the conditions of (a) above may be allowed  provided the actual costs of such severance payments are regarded as  expenses applicable to the current fiscal year and are equitably  distributed among the institution's activities during that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Severance payments that are due to abnormal or mass terminations  are of such conjectural nature that allowability must be determined on a  case-by-case basis. However, the Government recognizes its obligation to  participate to the extent of its fair share in any specific payment.</p><p class="depth0">ll. Specialized service facilities operated by a hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The costs of institutional services involving the use of highly  complex and specialized facilities such as electronic computers and  reactors are allowable provided the charges therefor meet the conditions  of (2) or (3) below, and otherwise take into account any items of income  or federal financing that qualify as applicable credits under paragraph  C.5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The costs of such hospital services normally will be charged  directly to applicable research agreements based on actual usage or  occupancy of the facilities at rates that (i) are designed to recover  only actual costs of providing such services, and (ii) are applied on a  nondiscriminatory basis as between organized research and other work of  the hospital including commercial or accommodation sales and usage by  the hospital for internal purposes. This would include use of such  facilities as radiology, laboratories, maintenance men used for a  special purpose, medical art, photography, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the absence of an acceptable arrangement for direct costing  as provided in (2) above, the costs incurred for such institutional  services may be assigned to research agreements as indirect costs,  provided the methods used achieve substantially the same results. Such  arrangements should be worked out in coordination with all government  users of the facilities in order to assure equitable distribution of the  indirect costs.</p><p class="depth0">mm. Special administrative costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred for general public relations activities, catalogs,  alumni activities, and similar services are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0">nn. Staff and/or employee benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Staff and/or employee benefits in the form of regular  compensation paid to employees during periods of authorized absences  from the job such as for annual leave, sick leave, military leave and  the like are allowable provided such costs are absorbed by all hospital  activities including organized research in proportion to the relative  amount of time or effort actually devoted to each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Staff benefits in the form of employer contributions or expenses  for Social Security taxes, employee insurance, Workmen's Compensation  insurance, the Pension Plan (see paragraph I.2.y.), hospital costs or  remission of hospital charges to the extent of costs for individual  employees or their families, and the like are allowable provided such  benefits are granted in accordance with established hospital policies,  and provided such contributions and other expenses whether treated as  indirect costs or an increment of direct labor costs are distributed to  particular research agreements and other activities in a manner  consistent with the pattern of benefits accruing to the individuals or  groups of employees whose salaries and wages are chargeable to such  research agreements and other activities.</p><p class="depth0">oo. Taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general, taxes which the hospital is required to pay and  which are paid or accrued in accordance with generally accepted  accounting principles, and payments made to local governments in lieu of  taxes which are commensurate with the local government services received  are allowable except for (i) taxes from which exemptions are available  to the hospital directly or which are available to the hospital based on  an exemption afforded the Government and in the latter case when the  sponsoring agency makes available the necessary exemption certificates,  (ii) special assessments on land which represent capital improvements,  and (iii) Federal Income Taxes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any refund of taxes, interest, or penalties, and any payment to  the hospital of interest thereon attributable to taxes, interest or  penalties, which were allowed as research agreement costs will be  credited or paid to the Government in the manner directed by the  Government provided any interest actually paid or credited to a hospital  incident to a refund of tax, interest, and penalty will be paid or  credited to the Government only to the extent that such interest accrued  over the period during which the hospital had been reimbursed by the  Government for the taxes, interest, and penalties.</p><p class="depth0">pp. Transportation costs.</p><p class="depth0">Costs incurred for inbound freight, express, cartage, postage and  other transportation services relating either to goods purchased, in  process, or delivered are allowable. When such costs can readily be  identified with the items involved, they may be charged directly as  transportation costs or added to the cost of such items. Where  identification with the material received cannot readily be made,  inbound transportation costs may be charged to the appropriate indirect  cost accounts if the institution follows a consistent equitable  procedure in this respect. Outbound freight, if reimbursable under the  terms of the research agreement, should be treated as a direct cost.</p><p class="depth0">qq. Travel costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Travel costs are the expenses for transportation, lodging,  subsistence, and related items incurred by employees who are in travel  status on official business of the hospital. Such costs may be charged  on an actual basis, on a per diem or mileage basis in lieu of actual  costs incurred, or on a combination of the two provided the method used  is applied to an entire trip and not to selected days of the trip, and  results in charges consistent with those normally allowed by the  institution in its regular operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Travel costs are allowable subject to (3) and (4) below when  they are directly attributable to specific work under a research  agreement or when they are incurred in the normal course of  administration of the hospital or a department or research program  thereof.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The difference in cost between first class air accommodations  and less than first class air accommodations is unallowable except when  less than first class air accommodations are not reasonably available to  meet necessary mission requirements such as where less than first class  accommodations would (i) require circuitous routing, (ii) require travel  during unreasonable hours, (iii) greatly increase the duration of the  flight, (iv) result in additional costs which would offset the  transportation savings, or (v) offer accommodations which are not  reasonably adequate for the medical needs of the traveler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Costs of personnel movements of a special or mass nature are  allowable only when authorized or approved in writing by the sponsoring  agency or its authorized representative.</p><p class="depth0">rr. Termination costs applicable to contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contract terminations generally give rise to the incurrence of  costs or to the need for special treatment of costs which would not have  arisen had the contract not been terminated. Items peculiar to  termination are set forth below. They are to be used in conjunction with  all other provisions of these principles in the case of contract  termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost of common items of material reasonably usable on the  hospital's other work will not be allowable unless the hospital submits  evidence that it could not retain such items at cost without sustaining  a   loss. In deciding whether such items are reasonably usable on other work  of the institution, consideration should be given to the hospital's  plans for current scheduled work or activities including other research  agreements. Contemporaneous purchases of common items by the hospital  will be regarded as evidence that such items are reasonably usable on  the hospital's other work. Any acceptance of common items as allowable  to the terminated portion of the contract should be limited to the  extent that the quantities of such items on hand, in transit, and on  order are in excess of the reasonable quantitative requirement of other  work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If in a particular case, despite all reasonable efforts by the  hospital, certain costs cannot be discontinued immediately after the  effective date of termination, such costs are generally allowable within  the limitations set forth in these principles, except that any such  costs continuing after termination due to the negligent or willful  failure of the hospital to discontinue such costs will be considered  unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Loss of useful value of special tooling and special machinery  and equipment is generally allowable, provided (i) such special tooling,  machinery or equipment is not reasonably capable of use in the other  work of the hospital; (ii) the interest of the Government is protected  by transfer of title or by other means deemed appropriate by the  contracting officer; and (iii) the loss of useful value as to any one  terminated contract is limited to that portion of the acquisition cost  which bears the same ratio to the total acquisition cost as the  terminated portion of the contract bears to the entire terminated  contract and other government contracts for which the special tooling,  special machinery or equipment was acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Rental costs under unexpired leases are generally allowable  where clearly shown to have been reasonably necessary for the  performance of the terminated contract, less the residual value of such  leases, if (i) the amount of such rental claimed does not exceed the  reasonable use value of the property leased for the period of the  contract and such further period as may be reasonable; and (ii) the  hospital makes all reasonable efforts to terminate, assign, settle, or  otherwise reduce the cost of such lease. There also may be included the  cost of alterations of such leased property, provided such alterations  were necessary for the performance of the contract and of reasonable  restoration required by the provisions of the lease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Settlement expenses including the following are generally  allowable: (i) Accounting, legal, clerical, and similar costs reasonably  necessary for the preparation and presentation to contracting officers  of settlement claims and supporting data with respect to the terminated  portion of the contract and the termination and settlement of  subcontracts; and (ii) reasonable costs for the storage, transportation,  protection, and disposition of property provided by the Government or  acquired or produced by the institution for the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Subcontractor claims including the allocable portion of claims  which are common to the contract and to other work of the contractor are  generally allowable.</p><p class="depth0">ss. Voluntary services.</p><p class="depth0">The value of voluntary services provided by sisters or other members  of religious orders is allowable provided that amounts do not exceed  that paid other employees for similar work. Such amounts must be  identifiable in the records of the hospital as a legal obligation of the  hospital. This may be reflected by an agreement between the religious  order and the hospital supported by evidence of payments to the order.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
