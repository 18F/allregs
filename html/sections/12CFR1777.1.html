                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority. This part is issued by the Office of Federal Housing  Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) pursuant to sections 1313, 1371, 1372, and  1376 of the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness  Act (1992 Act) (12 U.S.C. 4513, 4631, 4632, and 4636). These provisions  broadly authorize OFHEO to take such actions as are deemed appropriate  by the Director of OFHEO to ensure that the Federal National Mortgage  Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation  (collectively, the Enterprises) maintain adequate capital and operate in  a safe and sound manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority, purpose and scope of subpart A. In addition to the  authority set forth in paragraph (a) of this section, subpart A of this  part is also issued pursuant to section 1314 of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C.  4514), section 307(c) of the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation Act  (12 U.S.C. 1456(c)), and section 309(k) of the Federal National Mortgage  Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1723a(k)), requiring each Enterprise  to submit such reports to OFHEO as the Director of OFHEO determines, in  his or her judgment, are necessary to carry out the purposes of the 1992  Act. Subpart A of this part is also issued in reliance on section 1317  of the 1992 Act (12 U.S.C. 4517) authorizing OFHEO to conduct  examinations of the Enterprises. The purpose of subpart A of this part  is to set forth a framework of early intervention supervisory measures,  other than formal enforcement actions, that OFHEO may take to address  emerging developments that merit supervisory review to ensure they do  not pose a current or future threat to the safety and soundness of an  Enterprise. OFHEO's initiation of procedures under subpart A does not  necessarily indicate that any unsound condition exists. The supervisory  responses enumerated in Sec. 1777.11 do not constitute orders under the  1992 Act for purposes of sections 1371 and 1376 thereof (12 U.S.C. 4631  and 4636).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2))</em>. These provisions authorize OFHEO to administer certain  capital requirements for the Enterprises, to classify the capital of the  Enterprises based on capital levels specified in the 1992 Act, and, in  appropriate circumstances, to exercise discretion to reclassify an  Enterprise into a lower   capital category. Under these provisions, there are also automatic  consequences for an Enterprise that is not classified as adequately  capitalized, as well as discretionary authority for OFHEO to require an  Enterprise to take remedial actions. Subpart B implements the provisions  of sections 1364 through 1368, 1369(b) through (e), 1369C, and 1369D of  the 1992 Act as they apply to the Enterprises (12 U.S.C. 4614 through  4618, 4619(b) through (e), 4622 and 4623). The principal purposes of  subpart B are to identify the capital measures and capital levels that  OFHEO uses in determining the capital classification of an Enterprise;  to set out the procedures OFHEO uses in determining such capital  classifications; to establish procedures for submission and review of  capital restoration plans of an Enterprise that is not classified as  adequately capitalized; and to establish procedures under which OFHEO  issues orders pursuant to section 1366(b)(1) through (4) of the 1992 Act  (12 U.S.C. 4616(b)(1) through (4)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> provides that an Enterprise  is to be classified as adequately capitalized so long as it meets the  minimum capital level. Subpart B contains a currently effective set of  capital classifications omitting consideration of the risk-based capital  level, as well as another set of capital classifications which will take  effect, and displace the current set of capital classifications, on  September 13, 2002 that is, one year after the effective date of OFHEO's  risk-based capital rule published at 66 FR 47730, September 13, 2001.</p>
