                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RECOVER (Restoration Coordination and Verification) is an  interagency and interdisciplinary scientific and technical team  described in the ``Final Integrated Feasibility Report and Programmatic  Environmental Impact Statement,'' dated April 1, 1999. RECOVER was  established by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District to conduct assessment, evaluation, and planning and  integration activities using the best available science that support  implementation of the Plan with the   overall goal of ensuring that the goals and purposes of the Plan are  achieved. RECOVER has been organized into a Leadership Group that  provides management and coordination for the activities of RECOVER and  teams that accomplish activities such as: developing system-wide  performance measures; developing and implementing the monitoring and  assessment program; evaluating alternatives developed by Project  Delivery Teams to achieve the goals and purposes of the Plan; conducting  system-wide water quality analyses; developing, refining, and applying  system-wide models and tools; and evaluating modifications to the Plan.  RECOVER is not a policy making body, but has technical and scientific  responsibilities that support implementation of the Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Documents or work products prepared or developed by RECOVER  shall not be self-executing, but shall be provided as information for  consideration by the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District, in consultation with the Department of the  Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of  Commerce, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, the Seminole Tribe  of Florida, the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and  other Federal, State, and local agencies. Technical information  developed by RECOVER shall be available to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall encourage the participation of other Federal, State, and  local agencies and the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida and the  Seminole Tribe of Florida on RECOVER, to use their expertise, to ensure  that information developed by RECOVER is shared at the earliest possible  time with agencies, tribes, and the public, and to ensure that matters  of concern are addressed as early as possible. The Corps of Engineers  and the South Florida Water Management District recognize the special  role of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of the  Department of Commerce, the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation  Commission, the Department of the Interior and the Florida Fish and  Wildlife Conservation Commission as stewards of the natural system and  for their technical and scientific activities in support of restoration.  The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  recognize the special role of the Environmental Protection Agency and  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection in water quality  issues. Accordingly, the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water  Management District have used and will continue to use the Department of  the Interior, the Department of Commerce, the Florida Fish and Wildlife  Conservation Commission, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the  Florida Department of Environmental Protection as co-chairs along with  the Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  on the appropriate technical teams that have been established to date as  part of RECOVER.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general, participation on RECOVER shall be the financial  responsibility of the participating agency or tribe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Participation by an agency or tribe on RECOVER shall not be  considered or construed to be a substitute for consultation,  coordination, or other activities required by applicable law, policy, or  regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Assign program managers from the Corps of Engineers and the  South Florida Water Management District to be responsible for carrying  out the activities of RECOVER; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish a RECOVER Leadership Group to assist the program  managers in coordinating and managing the activities of RECOVER,  including the establishment of sub-teams or other entities, and in  reporting on the activities of RECOVER.
