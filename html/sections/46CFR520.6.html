                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Tariffs systems shall present retrievers with the  ability to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Search for commonly understood tariff objects (e.g.,  commodities, origins, destinations, etc.) without restricting such  search to a specific tariff;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Search a tariff for a rate on the basis of origin, destination  and commodity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employ a tariff selection option; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Select an object group (e.g., rules, locations, groups, etc.)  within a particular tariff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Search capability. Tariffs shall provide the capability to  search for tariff matter by non-case sensitive text search. Text search  matches for commodity descriptions should result in a commodity or  commodity index list.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commodities and TRIs. Retriever selection of a specific  commodity from a commodity index list shall display the commodity  description and provide an option for searching for a rate (e.g., on the  basis of origin/destination) or a TRI list, if multiple TRIs are in  effect for the commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Object groups. Retriever selection of a specific object group  shall result in a list of the objects within the group or present a text  search mechanism to allow location of an object within the group. For  example, selection of the rules object group would present a list of the  rules or a text search mechanism for locating specific terms or phrases  within the rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Basic ocean freight. The minimum rate display for tariffs shall  consist of the basic ocean freight rate and a list of all assessorial  charges that apply for the retriever-entered shipment parameters. If  other rules or charges may be applicable to a shipment under certain  circumstances, the tariff shall so indicate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Displays. All displays of individual tariff matter shall include  the publication date, effective date, amendment code (as contained in  appendix A of this part) and object name or number. When applicable, a  thru date or expiration date shall also be displayed. Use of ``S'' as an  amendment code shall be accompanied by a Commission issued special use  number.</p>
