                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The parties are encouraged to engage in voluntary  discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the  subject matter of the pending proceeding. The provisions of the Federal  Rules of Civil Procedure relating to discovery apply to the extent  consistent with this part and except as otherwise provided by the ALJ or  by waiver or agreement of the parties. The ALJ may make any order which  justice requires to protect a party or person from annoyance,  embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense. These orders may  include limitations on the scope, method, time and place of discovery,  and provisions for protecting the confidentiality of classified or  otherwise sensitive information, including Confidential Business  Information (CBI) as defined by the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Interrogatories and requests for admission or production of  documents. A party may serve on any party interrogatories, requests for  admission, or requests for production of documents for inspection and  copying, and a party concerned may apply to the ALJ for such enforcement  or protective order as that party deems warranted with respect to such  discovery. The service of   a discovery request shall be made at least 20 days before the scheduled  date of the hearing unless the ALJ specifies a shorter time period.  Copies of interrogatories, requests for admission and requests for  production of documents and responses thereto shall be served on all  parties and a copy of the certificate of service shall be filed with the  ALJ. Matters of fact or law of which admission is requested shall be  deemed admitted unless, within a period designated in the request (at  least 10 days after service, or within such additional time as the ALJ  may allow), the party to whom the request is directed serves upon the  requesting party a sworn statement either denying specifically the  matters of which admission is requested or setting forth in detail the  reasons why the party to whom the request is directed cannot truthfully  either admit or deny such matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Depositions. Upon application of a party and for good cause  shown, the ALJ may order the taking of the testimony of any person by  deposition and the production of specified documents or materials by the  person at the deposition. The application shall state the purpose of the  deposition and set forth the facts sought to be established through the  deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Enforcement. The ALJ may order a party to answer designated  questions, to produce specified documents or things or to take any other  action in response to a proper discovery request. If a party does not  comply with such an order, the ALJ may make a determination or enter any  order in the proceeding as the ALJ deems reasonable and appropriate. The  ALJ may strike related charges or defenses in whole or in part or may  take particular facts relating to the discovery request to which the  party failed or refused to respond as being established for purposes of  the proceeding in accordance with the contentions of the party seeking  discovery. In addition, enforcement by any district court of the United  States in which venue is proper may be sought as appropriate.</p>
