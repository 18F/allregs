                            <p class="depth0">Federal and interim Federal specifications, their associated Federal  qualified products lists (QPL's), Federal and interim Federal standards  and Commercial item descriptions (CID's) are referred to collectively as  Federal product descriptions. They are developed by GSA or other Federal  agencies under the Assigned Agency Plan described in the ``Federal  Standardization Handbook'' issued by the Assistant Administrator for  Federal Supply and Services (FSS). Product descriptions are coordinated  with other Federal agencies having technical, statutory, or regulatory  interest in the commodity or other subject matter covered. Generally,  before they are issued, Federal product descriptions are reviewed by  technical societies, individual industrial producers, and organizations  representing industrial producers and consumers.</p>
