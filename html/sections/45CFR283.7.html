Sec. 283.1 through 283.6, we will calculate the   rate of abortions for calendar year 1995 and for the most recent year  for which abortion data are available as defined in Sec. 283.2. These  rates will equal the number of abortions reported by the State to ACF  for the applicable year, divided by total live births among women living  in the State reported by NCHS for the same year. We will calculate the  rates to three decimal places.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If ACF determines that the State's rate of abortions for the  most recent year for which abortion data are available is less than the  rate for 1995, and, if the State has met all the requirements listed  elsewhere under this part, the State will receive the bonus.</p>
