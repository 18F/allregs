                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining the adequacy of the evidence to support the  suspension, the suspending official considers how much information is  available, how credible it is given the circumstances, whether or not  important allegations are corroborated, and what inferences can  reasonably be drawn as a result. During this assessment, the suspending  official may examine the basic documents, including grants, cooperative  agreements, loan authorizations, contracts, and other relevant  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An indictment, conviction, civil judgment, or other official  findings by Federal, State, or local bodies that determine factual and/ or legal matters, constitutes adequate evidence for purposes of  suspension actions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In deciding whether immediate action is needed to protect the  public interest, the suspending official has wide discretion. For  example, the suspending official may infer the necessity for immediate  action to protect the public interest either from the nature of the  circumstances giving rise to a cause for suspension or from potential  business relationships or involvement with a program of the Federal  Government.</p>
