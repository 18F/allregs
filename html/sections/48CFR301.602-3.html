                            <p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Policy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Government is not bound by agreements with, or contractual  commitments made to, prospective contractors by individuals who do not  have delegated contracting authority. However, an authorized official  may later ratify and execute otherwise proper contracts that were made  by individuals without contracting authority or by Contracting Officers  in excess of their delegated authority. The ratification shall be in the  form of a written document that clearly states that ratification of a  previously unauthorized act is intended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The HCA is the official authorized to ratify an unauthorized  commitment--but see paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The HCA may redelegate ratification authority for actions up to  $100,000 to the Chief of the Contracting Office (CCO). No other  redelegations are authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Limitations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The concurrence of legal counsel concerning an unauthorized  commitment is optional. If a contracting activity determines that a  legal review is necessary, the HCA or CCO shall coordinate the request  for ratification with the Office of General Counsel (OGC), General Law  Division (GLD).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual who is responsible for the unauthorized  commitment shall provide the reviewing Contracting Officer all records  and documents concerning the commitment and a complete written statement  of facts, including a description of the requirement; the estimated or  agreed upon price; the funds citation; an explanation of why the  contracting office was not used and why the proposed contractor was  selected; a list of other sources considered; and a statement as to  whether the contractor has commenced work or an item has been delivered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Contracting Officer shall review the submitted material and,  if the Contracting Officer determines that the ratification request has  merit, prepare it for ratification. The Contracting Officer shall  forward the ratification document and related materials to the HCA or  CCO, as appropriate, with any comments or information which the  approving official should consider in evaluating the ratification  request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the HCA or CCO approves the ratification request, the  Contracting Officer shall issue a purchase order or contract, as  appropriate, upon return of the approved ratification document and file.</p>
