of the proposed project and/or the financial capability of the Project Sponsor and to assess other aspects of the Pre-Application. DOE may ask for additional information from the Project Sponsor during the review process and may request one or more meetings with the Project Sponsor.

Neither the Pre-Application nor any written or other feedback that DOE may provide in response to the Pre-Application eliminates the requirement for an Application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No response by DOE to, or communication by DOE with, a Project Sponsor, or an Applicant submitting a Pre-Application or subsequent Application shall impose any obligation on DOE to enter into a Loan Guarantee Agreement.
