                            <p class="depth0">An alien who is already in immigration proceedings and believes that  he or she may have become eligible to apply for V nonimmigrant status  should request before the immigration judge or the Board of Immigration  Appeals, as appropriate, that the proceedings be administratively closed  (or before the Board that a previously-filed motion for reopening or  reconsideration be indefinitely continued) in order to allow the alien  to pursue an application for V nonimmigrant status with the Service. If  the alien appears eligible for V nonimmigrant status, the immigration  judge or the Board, whichever has jurisdiction, shall administratively  close the proceeding or continue the motion indefinitely. In the event  that the Service finds an alien eligible for V nonimmigrant status, the  Service can adjudicate the change of status under this section. In the  event that the Service finds an alien ineligible for V nonimmigrant  status, the Service shall recommence proceedings by filing a motion to  re-calendar.</p>
