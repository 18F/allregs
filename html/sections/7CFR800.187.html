                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Warehouse samplers are exempt from the conflict-of- interest provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What constitutes a gratuity. For the purposes of these  regulations, the term ``gratuity'' shall include any favor,  entertainment, gift, tip, loan, payment for unauthorized or fictitious  work, unusual discount, or anything of monetary value. The term shall  not include (1) the occasional exchange of a cup of coffee or similar  social courtesies of nominal value in a business or work relationship if  the exchange is wholly free of any embarrassing or improper  implications; (2) the acceptance of unsolicited advertising material  such as pencils, pens, and note pads of nominal value if the material is  wholly free of any embarrassing or improper implications; and (3) the  exchange of the usual courtesies in an obvious family or personal  relationship (including those between official personnel and their  parents, spouses, children, or close personal friends) when the  circumstances make it clear that the exchange is the result of the  family or personal relationship, rather than a business or work  relationship.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Conflicts. In addition to the conflicts of interest prohibited  by section 11 of the Act, the activities specified in this paragraph  shall also be considered to be a conflict of interest. Accordingly, no  official personnel shall, during the term of their license or  authorization (including any period of suspension):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Accept any gratuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accept any fee or charge or other thing of monetary value, in  addition to the published fee or charge, for the performance of official  inspection or weighing services under circumstances in which the  acceptance could result, or create the appearance of resulting, in (i)  the use of their office or position for undue private gain, (ii) an  undertaking to give undue preferential treatment to any group or any  person, or (iii) any other loss of independence or impartiality in the  performance of official inspection or Class X or Class Y weighing  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Knowingly perform, or participate in performing, an inspection  or weighing service on grain in which they have a direct or indirect  financial interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engage in the business by buying, selling, transporting,  cleaning, elevating, storing, binning, mixing, blending, drying,  treating, fumigating, or other preparation of grain (other than a grower  of grain, or in the disposition of inspection samples); or in the  business of cleaning, treating, or fitting carriers or containers for  transporting or storing grain; the merchandising for nonfarm use of  equipment for cleaning,   drying, treating, fumigating, or otherwise processing, handling, or  storing grain; or the merchandising of grain inspection or weighing  equipment (other than buying or selling by official personnel of the  equipment for use in the performance of their official services).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Seek or hold any appointive or elective office in a grain  industry organization or association. This provision does not apply to  organizations of official inspectors or official weighers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Participate in any transaction involving the purchase or sale of  corporate stocks or bonds, grain or grain-related commodities, or other  property for speculative or income purposes if the transaction could  reasonably be construed to interfere with the proper and impartial  performance of official inspection for Class X or Class Y weighing  services. Official personnel are not prohibited from (i) producing grain  as a grower and selling the grain; (ii) making bona fide investments in  governmental obligations, banking institutions, savings and loan  associations, and other tangibles and intangibles that are clearly not  involved in the production, transportation, storage, marketing, or  processing of grain; or (iii) borrowing money from banks or other  financial institutions on customary terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reports of interests. Official personnel shall report  information regarding their employment or other business or financial  interests which may be required by the Service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Avoiding conflicts of interest. Official personnel shall not  acquire any financial interest or engage in any activity that would  result in a violation of this Sec. 800.187, or Sec. 800.186, or  section 11 of the Act and shall not permit their spouses, minor  children, or blood relatives who reside in their immediate households to  acquire any such interest or engage in any such activity. For the  purpose of this section, the interest of a spouse, minor child, or blood  relative who is a resident of the immediate household of official  personnel shall be considered to be an interest of the official  personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disposing of a conflict of interest--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remedial action. Upon  being informed that a conflict of interest exists and that remedial  action is required, an applicant for a license and official personnel  shall take immediate action to end the conflict of interest and inform  the Service of the action taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Hardship cases. Applicants and official personnel who believe  that remedial action will cause undue personal hardship may request an  exception by forwarding to the Service a written statement setting forth  the facts, circumstances, and reasons for requesting an exception.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to terminate. If a final determination is made by the  Service that a conflict of interest does exist and should not be  excepted, failure to terminate the conflict of interest shall subject:  (i) An applicant for a license to a dismissal of the application; (ii)  An employee of the Service to disciplinary action; and (iii) A licensee  to license revocation.
