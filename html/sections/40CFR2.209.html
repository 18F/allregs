(This section shall not be construed to restrict the disclosure of information which has been determined to be available to the public.

At the discretion of the office, subject to any restrictions by the court, such notice may be given by notice in the Federal Register, letter sent by certified mail return receipt requested, or telegram.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure within EPA.
