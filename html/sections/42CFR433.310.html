                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of  this section, the provisions of this subpart apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Overpayments made to providers that are discovered by the State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Overpayments made to providers that are initially discovered by  the provider and made known to the State agency; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Overpayments that are discovered through Federal reviews.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Third party payments and probate collections. The requirements  of this subpart do not apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Cases involving third party liability because, in these  situations, recovery is sought for a Medicaid payment that would have  been made had another party not been legally responsible for payment;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Probate collections from the estates of deceased Medicaid  beneficiaries, as they represent the recovery of payments properly made  from resources later determined to be available to the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Unallowable costs paid under rate-setting systems. (1)  Unallowable costs for a prior year paid to an institutional provider  under a rate-setting system that a State recovers through an adjustment  to the per diem rate for a subsequent period do not constitute  overpayments that are subject to the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">In such cases, the State is not required to refund the Federal share  explicitly related to the original overpayment in accordance with the  regulations in this subpart. Refund of the   Federal share occurs when the State claims future expenditures made to  the provider at a reduced rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Unallowable costs for a prior year paid to an institutional  provider under a rate-setting system that a State seeks to recover in a  lump sum, by an installment repayment plan, or through reduction of  future payments to which the provider would otherwise be entitled  constitute overpayments that are subject to the requirements of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recapture of depreciation upon gain on the sale of assets.  Depreciation payments are considered overpayments for purposes of this  subpart if a State requires their recapture in a discrete amount(s) upon  gain on the sale of assets.</p>
