                                Sec. 779.249  Goods which move or have moved across State lines.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In order to be included in the annual dollar volume for purposes of this test, the goods which the enterprise purchases or receives for resale must be goods that ``move or have moved across the State lines.'' Goods which have not moved across State lines before they are resold by the enterprise will not be included. The movement to which the phrase ``move or have moved'' has reference is that movement which the goods follow in their journey to the enterprise or within the enterprise to the establishment which sells the goods. Thus, if goods have moved across State lines at some stage in the flow of trade before they are actually sold by the enterprise, they will be considered to have moved across State lines. It is not material that the goods may have ``come to rest'' at some time before they are purchased or received and sold by the enterprise; nor is it material that some time may have elapsed between the time the goods have moved across State lines and the time they are purchased or received and sold by the enterprise. It is sufficient if at any time such goods have moved across State lines in the ordinary course of trade before resale by the enterprise. Much of the goods purchased by retailers are produced from a local intrastate supplier. In many instances these goods may have been stored at the supplier's establishment for some time. However, as long as the particular goods purchased have moved across State lines at some stage in the flow of trade to the retailer, they would have to be included in determining whether or not the enterprise has purchased or received for resale such out-of-State goods amounting to $250,000.</p>
