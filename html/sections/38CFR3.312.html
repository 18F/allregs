                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The death of a veteran will be considered as having  been due to a service-connected disability when the evidence establishes  that such disability was either the principal or a contributory cause of  death. The issue involved will be determined by exercise of sound  judgment, without recourse to speculation, after a careful analysis has  been made of all the facts and circumstances surrounding the death of  the veteran, including, particularly, autopsy reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Principal cause of death. The service-connected disability will  be considered as the principal (primary) cause of death when such  disability, singly or jointly with some other condition, was the  immediate or underlying cause of death or was etiologically related  thereto.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contributory cause of death. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contributory cause of death is  inherently one not related to the principal cause. In determining  whether the service-connected disability contributed to death, it must  be shown that it contributed substantially or materially; that it  combined to cause death; that it aided or lent assistance to the  production of death. It is not sufficient to show that it casually  shared in producing death, but rather it must be shown that there was a  causal connection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Generally, minor service-connected disabilities, particularly  those of a static nature or not materially affecting a vital organ,  would not be held   to have contributed to death primarily due to unrelated disability. In  the same category there would be included service-connected disease or  injuries of any evaluation (even though evaluated as 100 percent  disabling) but of a quiescent or static nature involving muscular or  skeletal functions and not materially affecting other vital body  functions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service-connected diseases or injuries involving active  processes affecting vital organs should receive careful consideration as  a contributory cause of death, the primary cause being unrelated, from  the viewpoint of whether there were resulting debilitating effects and  general impairment of health to an extent that would render the person  materially less capable of resisting the effects of other disease or  injury primarily causing death. Where the service-connected condition  affects vital organs as distinguished from muscular or skeletal  functions and is evaluated as 100 percent disabling, debilitation may be  assumed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> There are primary causes of death which by their very nature are  so overwhelming that eventual death can be anticipated irrespective of  coexisting conditions, but, even in such cases, there is for  consideration whether there may be a reasonable basis for holding that a  service-connected condition was of such severity as to have a material  influence in accelerating death. In this situation, however, it would  not generally be reasonable to hold that a service-connected condition  accelerated death unless such condition affected a vital organ and was  of itself of a progressive or debilitating nature.</p><p class="depth3">Cross References: Reasonable doubt.
