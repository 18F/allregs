                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Application for registration. (1) Application for registration as a floor broker or floor trader must be on Form 8-R, if as an individual, or Form 7-R, if as a non-natural person, and must be completed and filed with the National Futures Association in accordance with the instructions thereto. Each Form 7-R filed in accordance with this paragraph (a) must be accompanied by a Form 8-R, completed in accordance with the instructions thereto and executed by each individual who is a principal of the applicant, and each individual responsible for entry of orders from that applicant's own account. Each Form 8-R filed in accordance with this paragraph (a) must be accompanied by the fingerprints of the applicant on a fingerprint card provided for that purpose by the National Futures Association, except that a fingerprint card need not be filed by any applicant who has a current Form 8-R on file with the Commission or the National Futures Association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An applicant for registration as a floor broker or floor trader will not be registered or issued a temporary license as a floor broker or floor trader unless the applicant has been granted trading privileges by a board of trade designated as a contract market or registered as a swap execution facility by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When the Commission or the National Futures Association determines that an applicant for registration as a floor broker or floor trader is not disqualified from such registration or temporary license, the National Futures Association will notify the applicant and any contract market or swap execution facility that has granted the applicant trading privileges that the applicant's registration or temporary license as a floor broker or floor trader is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Duration of registration. A person registered as a floor broker or floor trader in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, and whose registration has neither been revoked nor withdrawn, will continue to be so registered unless such person's trading privileges on all contract markets and swap execution facilities have ceased: provided, that if a floor broker or floor trader whose trading privileges on all contract markets and swap execution facilities have ceased for reasons unrelated to any Commission action or any contract market or swap execution facility disciplinary proceeding and whose registration is not revoked, suspended or withdrawn is granted trading

privileges as a floor broker or floor trader, respectively, by any contract market or swap execution facility where such person held such privileges within the preceding sixty days, such registration as a floor broker or floor trader, respectively, shall be deemed to continue and no new Form 7-R, Form 8-R or Form 3-R record of a change to Form 7-R or Form 8-R need be filed solely on the basis of the resumption of trading privileges. A floor broker or floor trader is prohibited from engaging in activities requiring registration under the Act or from representing such person to be a registrant under the Act or the representative or agent of any registrant during the pendency of any suspension of such registration or of all such trading privileges. Each contract market and swap execution facility that has granted trading privileges to a person who is registered, or has applied for registration, as a floor broker or floor trader, must provide notice in accordance with Sec. 3.31(d) after such person's trading privileges on such contract market or swap execution facility have ceased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. A registered floor broker need not also register as a floor trader in order to engage in activity as a floor trader.
