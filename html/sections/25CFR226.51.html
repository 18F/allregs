                                Sec. 226.51  What are the requirements for using gas for operating
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">All gas used in accordance with this section must first be odorized and treated in accordance with industry standards for safe use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gas to be furnished to oil lessee. The lessee of a producing gas lease must furnish the oil lessee sufficient gas for operating purposes at a rate to be agreed upon, or on failure to agree, the rate will be determined by the Superintendent: Provided, that the oil lessee must at his/her own expense and risk, furnish and install the necessary connections to the gas lessee's well or pipeline. All such connections must be reported in writing to the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Use of gas by Osage Tribe. (1) Gas from any well or wells must be furnished to any Tribal-owned building or enterprise at a rate not to exceed the price being received or offered by a gas purchaser, less royalty. This requirement is subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser, the rate to be paid by the Osage Nation will be determined by the Superintendent based on prices being paid by purchasers in the Osage mineral estate. The Osage Nation is to furnish all necessary materials and labor for such connection with the lessee's gas system. The use of such gas is at the risk of the Osage Nation at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any member of the Osage Nation residing in Osage County and outside a corporate city is entitled to the use at his/her own expense of not to exceed 400,000 cubic feet of gas per calendar year for his/her principal residence at a rate not to exceed the amount paid by a gas purchaser plus 10 percent. This requirement is subject to the determination by the Superintendent that gas in sufficient quantities is available above that needed for lease operation and that no waste would result. In the absence of a gas purchaser, the amount to be paid by the Tribal member will be determined by the Superintendent. Gas delivered to Tribal members is not royalty free. The Tribal member is to furnish all necessary material and labor for such connection to the lessee's gas system, and must maintain his/her own lines. The use of such gas is at the risk of the Tribal member at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gas furnished by the lessee under paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section may be terminated only with the approval of the Superintendent. A written application for termination must be made to the Superintendent showing justification.</p>
