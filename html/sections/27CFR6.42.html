                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The furnishing, giving, renting, lending, or selling of  equipment, fixtures, signs, supplies, money, services, or other thing of  value by an industry member to a third party, where the benefits  resulting from such things of value flow to individual retailers, is the  indirect furnishing of a thing of value within the meaning of the Act.  Indirect furnishing of a thing of value includes, but is not limited to,  making payments for advertising to a retailer association or a display  company where the resulting benefits flow to individual retailers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. An indirect inducement will not arise where the  thing of value was furnished to a retailer by the third party without  the knowledge or intent of the industry member, or the industry member  did not reasonably foresee that the thing of value would have been  furnished to a retailer. Things which may lawfully be furnished, given,  rented, lent, or sold by industry members to retailers under subpart D  may also be furnished directly by a third party to a retailer.  [T.D. ATF-364, 60 FR 20421, Apr. 26, 1995]</p>
