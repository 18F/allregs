Unless otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, the nonmoving party is not required to file a response to a motion. If the Administrative Law Judge does not order the nonmoving party to file a response, and the nonmoving party files no response, the nonmoving party is deemed to oppose the motion. If a nonmoving party does not respond within 30 days of the filing of a motion for decision by default for failure to file a timely answer or for failure to prosecute, the nonmoving party is deemed not to oppose the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral motions; oral argument--(1) The Administrative Law Judge may, for good cause and with notice to the parties, permit oral motions and oral opposition to motions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may, for good cause and with notice to the parties, permit oral motions and oral opposition to motions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may, within his or her discretion, permit oral argument on any motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Orders.
