                            <p class="depth0">Each swap subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall be identified in all recordkeeping and all swap data reporting pursuant to this part by the use of a unique swap identifier, which shall be created, transmitted, and used for each swap as provided in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Swaps executed on a swap execution facility or designated contract market. For each swap executed on a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap execution facility or designated contract market shall create and transmit a unique swap identifier as provided in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creation. The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall generate and assign a unique swap identifier at, or as soon as technologically practicable following, the time of execution of the swap, and prior to the reporting of required swap creation data. The unique swap identifier shall consist of a single data field that contains two components:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unique alphanumeric code assigned to the swap execution facility or designated contract market by the Commission for the purpose of identifying the swap execution facility or designated contract market with respect to unique swap identifier creation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap execution facility or designated contract market, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap execution facility or designated contract market.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmission. The swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit the unique swap identifier electronically as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the swap data repository to which the swap execution facility or designated contract market reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To each counterparty to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Off-facility swaps with a swap dealer or major swap participant reporting counterparty. For each off-facility swap where the reporting counterparty is a swap dealer or major swap participant, the reporting counterparty shall create and transmit a unique swap identifier as provided in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creation. The reporting counterparty shall generate and assign a unique swap identifier as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap and prior to both the reporting of required swap creation data and the transmission of data to a derivatives clearing organization if the swap is to be cleared. The unique swap identifier shall consist of a single data field that contains two components:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unique alphanumeric code assigned to the swap dealer or major swap participant by the Commission at the time of its registration as such, for the purpose of identifying the swap dealer or major swap participant with respect to unique swap identifier creation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap dealer or major swap participant, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap dealer or major swap participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmission. The reporting counterparty shall transmit the unique swap identifier electronically as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the swap data repository to which the reporting counterparty reports required swap creation data for the swap, as part of that report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the non-reporting counterparty to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable after execution of the swap; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Off-facility swaps with a non-SD/MSP reporting counterparty. For each off-facility swap for which the reporting counterparty is a non-SD/MSP counterparty, the swap data repository to which primary economic terms data is reported shall create and transmit a unique swap identifier as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Creation. The swap data repository shall generate and assign a unique swap identifier as soon as technologically practicable following receipt of the first report of required swap creation data concerning the swap. The unique swap identifier shall consist of a single data field that contains two components:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The unique alphanumeric code assigned to the swap data repository by the Commission at the time of its registration as such, for the purpose of identifying the swap data repository with respect to unique swap identifier creation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An alphanumeric code generated and assigned to that swap by the automated systems of the swap data repository, which shall be unique with respect to all such codes generated and assigned by that swap data repository.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Transmission. The swap data repository shall transmit the unique swap identifier electronically as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To the counterparties to the swap, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique swap identifier; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as soon as technologically practicable following creation of the unique swap identifier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Allocations. For swaps involving allocation, unique swap identifiers shall be created and transmitted as follows.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial swap between reporting counterparty and agent. The unique swap identifier for the initial swap transaction between the reporting counterparty and the agent shall be created as required by paragraph (a) through (c) of this section, and shall be transmitted as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the unique swap identifier is created by a swap execution facility or designated contract market, the swap

execution facility or designated contract market must include the unique swap identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the reporting counterparty and to the agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the unique swap identifier is created by the reporting counterparty, the reporting counterparty must include the unique swap identifier in its swap creation data report to the swap data repository, and must transmit the unique identifier to the agent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Post-allocation swaps. The reporting counterparty must create a unique swap identifier for each of the individual swaps resulting from allocation, as soon as technologically practicable after it is informed by the agent of the identities of its actual counterparties, and must transmit each such unique swap identifier to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The non-reporting counterparty for the swap in question.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The derivatives clearing organization, if any, to which the swap is submitted for clearing, as part of the required swap creation data transmitted to the derivatives clearing organization for clearing purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The same swap data repository to which the initial swap transaction is reported, as part of the report of required swap creation data to the swap data repository.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Use. Each registered entity or swap counterparty subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission shall include the unique swap identifier for a swap in all of its records and all of its swap data reporting concerning that swap, from the time it creates or receives the unique swap identifier as provided in this section, throughout the existence of the swap and for as long as any records are required by the CEA or Commission regulations to be kept by that registered entity or counterparty concerning the swap, regardless of any life cycle events or any changes to state data concerning the swap, including, without limitation, any changes with respect to the counterparties to or the ownership of the swap. This requirement shall not prohibit the use by a registered entity or swap counterparty in its own records of any additional identifier or identifiers internally generated by the automated systems of the registered entity or swap counterparty, or the reporting to a swap data repository, the Commission, or another regulator of such internally generated identifiers in addition to the reporting of the unique swap identifier.</p>
