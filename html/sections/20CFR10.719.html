If such an attribution is both  practicable and equitable, as determined by OWCP or SOL, in its  discretion, the conditions will be treated as separate injuries for  purposes of calculating the refund and credit owed to the United States  under section 8132.</p><p class="depth2">Federal Grand and Petit Jurors</p>
