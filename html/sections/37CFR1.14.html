The  file of an application that has issued as a patent or published as a  statutory invention registration is available to the public as set forth  in Sec.  1.11(a).

The Office will not  provide access to the paper file of a pending application that has been  published, except as provided in paragraph (c) or (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Unpublished abandoned applications (including provisional  applications) that are identified or relied upon. The file contents of  an unpublished, abandoned application may be made available to the  public if the application is identified in a U.S. patent, a statutory  invention registration, a U.S. patent application publication, an  international publication of an international application under PCT  Article 21(2), or a publication of an international registration under  Hague Agreement Article 10(3) of an international design application  designating the United States. An application is considered to have been  identified in a document, such as a patent, when the application number  or serial number and filing date, first named inventor, title, and  filing date or other application specific information are provided in  the text of the patent, but not when the same identification is made in  a paper in the file contents of the patent and is not included in the  printed patent. Also, the file contents may be made available to the  public, upon a written request, if benefit of the abandoned application  is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(e), 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c) in an  application that has issued as a U.S. patent, or has published as a  statutory invention registration, a U.S. patent application publication,  an international publication of an international application under PCT  Article 21(2), or a publication of an international registration under  Hague Agreement Article 10(3).

An applicant or  party will be given time, not less than twenty days, to request  reconsideration and seek court review before any portions of a decision  are made public under this paragraph over his or her objection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notice to inventor of the filing of an application.
