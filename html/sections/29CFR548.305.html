                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of the Act) in the  period for which such additional payments are made.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 548.3(e) permits the employer, upon agreement or  understanding with the employee, to omit from the computation of  overtime certain incidental payments which have a trivial effect on the  overtime compensation due. Examples of payments which may be excluded  are: modest housing, bonuses or prizes of various sorts, tuition paid by  the employer for the employee's attendance at a school, and cash  payments or merchandise awards for soliciting or obtaining new business.  It may also include such things as payment by the employer of the  employee's social security tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The exclusion of one or more additional payments under Sec.  548.3(e) must not affect the overtime compensation of the employee by  more than 50 cents a week on the average for the overtime weeks.</p><p class="depth2">Example. An employee, who normally would come within the 40-hour  provision of section 7(a) of the Act, is paid a cost-of-living bonus of  $260 each calendar quarter, or $20 per week. The employee works overtime  in only 2 weeks in the 13-week period, and in each of these overtime  weeks he works 50 hours. He is therefore entitled to $2 as overtime  compensation on the bonus for each week in which overtime was worked  (i.e., $20 bonus divided by 50 hours equals 40 cents an hour; 10  overtime hours, times one-half, times 40 cents an hour, equals $2 per  week). Since the overtime on the bonus is more than 50 cents on the  average for the 2 overtime weeks, this cost-of-living bonus would not be  excluded from the overtime computation under Sec. 548.3(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> It is not always necessary to make elaborate computations to  determine whether the effect of the exclusion of a bonus or other  incidental payment on the employee's total compensation will exceed 50  cents a week on the average. Frequently the addition to regular wages is  so small or the number of overtime hours is so limited that under any  conceivable circumstances exclusion of the additional payments from the  rate used to compute the employee's overtime compensation would not  affect the employee's total earnings by more than 50 cents a week. The  determination that this is so may be made by inspection of the payroll  records or knowledge of the normal working hours.</p><p class="depth2">Example. An employer has a policy of giving employees who have a  perfect attendance record during a 4-week period a bonus of $10. The  employee never works more than 50 hours a week. It is obvious that  exclusion of this attendance bonus from the rate of pay used to compute  overtime compensation could not affect the employee's total earnings by  more than 50 cents a week. \14\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\14\ For a 50-hour week, an employee's bonus would have to amount to  $5 a week to affect his overtime compensation by 50 cents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> There are many situations in which the employer and employee  cannot predict with any degree of certainty the amount of bonus to be  paid at the end of the bonus period. They may not be able to anticipate  with any degree of certainty the number of hours an employee might work  each week during the bonus period. In such situations the employer and  employee may agree prior to the performance of the work that a bonus  will be disregarded in the computation of overtime pay if the employee's  total earnings are not affected by more than 50 cents a week on the  average for all overtime weeks during the bonus period. If it turns out  at the end of the bonus period that the effect on the employee's total  compensation would not exceed 50 cents a week on the average, then  additional overtime compensation must be paid on the bonus. (See Sec.  778.209 of this chapter, for an explanation of how to compute overtime  on the bonus.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In order to determine whether the exclusion of a bonus or other  incidental payment would affect the total compensation of the employee  by not more than 50 cents a week on the average, a comparison is made  between his total compensation computed under the employment agreement  and his total compensation computed in accordance with the applicable  overtime provisions of the Act.</p><p class="depth2">Example. An employee, who normally would come within the 40-hour  provision of section 7(a) of the Act, is paid at piece rates and at one  and one-half times the applicable piece rates for work performed during  hours in excess of 40 in the workweek. The employee is also paid a  bonus, which when apportioned over the bonus period, amounts to $2 a  week. He never works more than 50 hours a week. The piece rates could be  established as basic rates under the employment agreement and no  additional overtime compensation paid on the bonus. The employee's total  compensation computed in accordance with the applicable overtime  provision of the Act, section 7(g)(1) \15\ would be affected by not more  than 20 cents in any week by not paying overtime compensation on the  bonus. \16\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\15\ Section 7(g)(1) of the Act provides that overtime compensation  may be paid at one and one-half times the applicable piece rate but  extra overtime compensation must be properly computed and paid on  additional pay required to be included in computing the regular rate.</p><p class="depth2">\16\ Bonus of $2 divided by fifty hours equals 4 cents an hour. Half  of this hourly rate multiplied by ten overtime hours equals 20 cents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Section 548.3(e) is not applicable to employees employed at  subminimum wage rates under learner certificates, or special  certificates for handicapped workers, or in the case of employees in  Puerto Rico or the Virgin Islands employed at special minimum rates  --------------------------------------------------------------------------- authorized by wage orders issued pursuant to the Act.
