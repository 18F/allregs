                                Sec. 76.128  What is a consolidated grant?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">A consolidated grant is a grant to an Insular Area for any two or more of the programs listed in Sec. 76.125(c). The amount of the consolidated grant is the sum of the allocations the Insular Area receives under each of the programs included in the consolidated grant if there had been no consolidation.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume the Virgin Islands applies for a consolidated grant that includes programs under the Adult Education Act, Vocational Education Act, and Chapter 1 of the Education Consolidation and Improvement Act. If the Virgin Islands' allocation under the formula for each of these three programs is $150,000; the total consolidated grant to the Virgin Islands would be $450,000.
