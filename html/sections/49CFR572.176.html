The test procedure for the knee assembly is as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soak the knee assembly in a controlled environment at any  temperature between 20.6 and 22.2 [deg]C (69 and 72 [deg]F) and a  relative humidity between 10 and 70 percent for at least four hours  prior to a test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mount the test material and secure it to a rigid test fixture as  shown in Figure T6. No part of the foot or tibia may contact any  exterior surface.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Align the test probe so that throughout its stroke and at  contact with the knee it is within 2 degrees of horizontal and collinear  with the longitudinal centerline of the femur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guide the pendulum so that there is no significant lateral,  vertical, or rotational movement at the time of initial contact between  the impactor and the knee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The test probe velocity at the time of contact shall be 2.1  0.03 m/s (6.9 0.1 ft/s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No suspension hardware, suspension cables, or any other  attachments to the probe, including the velocity vane, shall make  contact with the dummy during the test.</p>
