                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for an award of attorney fees and other expenses under the Act, the applicant must be a party to the adversary adjudication for which it seeks it seeks an award. The term party is defined in 5 U.S.C. 551(3). The applicant must show that it meets all conditions of eligibility set out in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The types of eligible applicants are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual with a net worth of not more than $2 million;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sole owner of an unincorporated business who has a net worth of not more than $7 million, including both personal and business interests, and not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A charitable or other tax-exempt organization described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) with not more than 500 employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A cooperative association as defined in section 15(a) of the Agricultural Marketing Act (12 U.S.C. 1141j(a)) with more than 500 employees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any other partnership, corporation, association, unit of local government, or public or private organization with a new worth of not more than $7 million and not more than 500 employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purpose of eligibility, the net worth and number of employees of an applicant shall be determined as of the date the proceeding was initiated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An applicant who owns an unincorporated business will be considered as an individual rather than a sole owner of an unincorporated business if the issues on which the applicant prevails are related primarily to personal interests rather than to business interests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The employees of an applicant include all persons who regularly perform services for remuneration for the applicant, under the applicant's direction and control. Part-time employees shall be included on a proportional basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The net worth and number of employees of the applicant and all of its affiliates shall be aggregated to determine eligibility. Any individual, corporation or other entity that directly or indirectly controls or owns a majority of the voting shares or other interest of the applicant, or any corporation or entity of which the applicant directly or indirectly owns or controls a majority of the voting shares or other interest, will be considered an affiliate for purposes of this subpart, unless the administrative law judge determines that such treatment would be unjust and contrary to the purposes of the Act in light of the actual relationship between the affiliated entities. In addition, the administrative law judge may determine that financial relationships of the applicant other than those described in this paragraph constitute special circumstances that would make an award unjust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An applicant that participates in a proceeding primarily on behalf of one or more other persons or entities that would be ineligible is not itself eligible for an award.
