                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Background. UPARR policy prohibits discrimination on the basis  of residence (refer to Sec. 72.65(b)) including preferential  reservation or membership systems on properties improved with UPARR  assistance. This prohibition applies to both regularly scheduled and  special events. The general provisions regarding non-discrimination at  sites assisted under Interior programs and, thereby, all other  recreation facilities managed by the recipient, are covered in 43 CFR  part 17 which implements the provisions of title VI of the Civil Rights  Act of 1964 for the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. There shall be no discrimination for UPARR assisted  programs or services on the basis of residence, except in reasonable fee  differentials. Post-completion compliance responsibilities of the  recipient should continue to ensure that discrimination on the basis of  residency is not occurring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fees. For parks or recreation properties or programs funded with  UPARR assistance, fees charged to nonresidents cannot exceed twice that  charged to residents. Where there is no charge for residents but a fee  is charged to nonresidents, the nonresident fees cannot exceed fees  charged at comparable State or local public facilities having fee  systems. These fee provisions apply only to the approved 1010 areas  applicable to the recipient. Reservation, membership, or annual permit  systems available to residents must also be available to nonresidents  and the period of availability must be the same for both residents and  nonresidents. Recipients are prohibited from providing residents the  option of purchasing annual or daily permits while at the same time  restricting nonresidents to the purchase of annual permits only.    Sec. Sec. 72.74-72.75  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Sec. Appendix A to Part 72--Criteria for Eligibility</p><p class="depth2">Jurisdictions were considered for eligibility if they were  functioning general purpose local governments in one of three  categories:</p><p class="depth2">1. Central cities of Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas in  either 1970 or 1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census,  Census of Population: 1970, 1976 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the  Census, 1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates File).</p><p class="depth2">2. Cities and townships with Populations of 40,000 or more in either  1970 or 1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census  of Population: 1970, 1976 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census,  1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates File).</p><p class="depth2">3. Counties with populations of 250,000 or more in either 1970 or  1976 (1970 data derived from U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census of  Population: 1970; 1976 data derived from 1976 Revenue Sharing Estimates  File).</p><p class="depth2">Indicators (variables) of distress and need were selected to  determine eligibility for the program and were chosen for timeliness,  reliability, and relevance to the Act. Certain variables were not used  due to duplication, others because they were not available for all  jurisdictions, and some because they were unrelated to the purposes of  the Act. (Section 1002 of the Act states that the Congress finds that  (a) the quality of life in urban areas is closely related to the  availability of fully functional park and recreation systems including  land, facilities, and service programs; (b) residents of cities need  close-to-home recreational opportunities that are adequate to  specialized urban demands, with parks and facilities properly located,  developed, and well maintained; (c) the greatest recreational  deficiencies with respect to land, facilities, and programs are found in  many large cities, especially at the neighborhood level; (d) inadequate  financing of urban recreation programs due to fiscal difficulties in  many large cities has led to the deterioration of facilities,  nonavailability of recreation services, and an inability to adapt  recreational programs to changing circumstances; and (e) there is no  existing Federal assistance program which fully addresses the needs for  physical rehabilitation and   revitalization of these park and recreation systems.)</p><p class="depth2">The National Park Service asked the Bureau of the Census to assist  in the analysis of national data in order to ensure that reliable,  timely and applicable indicators of distress were used in determining  eligibility for the program. NPS received comments from a number of  interested individuals on what they considered, in their best judgment,  to be the criteria that should be used in the program. NPS also received  numerous position papers from national interest groups on what they  thought were suitable indicators for the program. NPS then began a  narrowing process intended to select the most appropriate criteria for  eligibility in the program.</p><p class="depth2">Listed below are the six variables selected for eligibility  criteria:</p><p class="depth2">Population Per Square Mile</p><p class="depth2">This variable is commonly termed population density, and it is  defined as the number of persons per square mile of land. It provides an  indication of the extent to which an area is urbanized. Highly urbanized  areas are most lacking in land set aside for recreation and park  facilities and are experiencing difficulty in maintaining existing  facilities. Highly dense areas tend to have the greatest need for  assistance in revitalization of their neighborhood park and recreation  facilities. Therefore, jurisdictions having high values for density  would be favored by this variable, based on 1975 data of the U.S. Bureau  of the Census.</p><p class="depth2">Net Change in Per Capita Income 1969-75</p><p class="depth2">Per capita income is the estimated average amount of total money  income per person. It is derived by dividing the total income of a  particular group by the total population in that group. Comparison of  change in per capita income between urban jurisdictions provides an  indication of each jurisdiction's economic growth. If the income of a  city is growing more slowly than another city, the city with slower  growth is in a relatively weaker economic position. As cited in the  ``Report on the Fiscal Impact of the Economic Stimulus Package on 48  Large Urban Governments (1978),'' income growth is a determinant of  taxable wealth and level of economic activity, and indicates a  jurisdiction's capability to finance its own recreation and other  projects. This measure of financial capacity is related to the Act which  stipulates that the Secretary of the Interior consider factors related  to economic distress. Therefore, jurisdictions with either negative or  low relative growth in per capita income would be favored by this  variable, based on 1976 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</p><p class="depth2">Percent Unemployed, 1977</p><p class="depth2">Percent unemployed, commonly termed the unemployment rate is defined  as the number of people unemployed as a percent of the civilian labor  force. The unemployment data are the product of a Federal/State  cooperative program in which State Employment Security agencies prepare  labor force and unemployment estimates using concepts, definitions, and  technical procedures established by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The  National Urban Recreation Study found that recreation and leisure time  opportunities are most limited for the economically disadvantaged,  including the unemployed. The 17 field studies of the National Urban  Recreation Study reveal that low-income neighborhoods have less program  diversity, little, if any, commercial recreation opportunities, and  fewer year-round programs than higher income neighborhoods.  Consideration of this variable is consistent with the mandate of the Act  which requires that criteria be considered related to physical and  economic distress. Therefore, this variable would tend to favor  jurisdictions having high unemployment rates.</p><p class="depth2">Percent of Households Without Automobiles Available, 1970</p><p class="depth2">Automobile availability, as defined by the Bureau of the Census,  represents the number of passenger automobiles, including station  wagons, which are owned or regularly used by any member of the household  and which are ordinarily kept at home. Taxicabs, pickups, or larger  trucks were not counted. Lack of automobile availability is closely  related to lack of recreation opportunity. The Recreation Access Study  (U.S. Department of Transportation, 1975) found that access to a  diversity of recreation opportunities is generally assured for those who  have automobiles and are willing to travel reasonable distances, but  such opportunities are often severely limited for people without cars.  In addition, the 17 field studies of the National Urban Recreation Study  concluded that most recreation opportunities for those without access to  a personal auto is limited to immediate neighborhoods or place of  residence. This variable is relevant to the Act in that the  transportation disadvantaged households are the group that has the  greatest need for expanded opportunities to enjoy their close to home  resources.</p><p class="depth2">Therefore, jurisdictions having a high proportion of households  without automobiles would be favored by this variable, based on 1970  data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</p><p class="depth2">Total Population Under 18 Years of Age, and 60 Years and Over, 1970</p><p class="depth2">This variable identifies those persons most likely to be the most  frequent users of public park and recreation facilities. While many   senior citizens have adequate incomes, they tend to be considerably less  affluent and less mobile than the general population. Younger and older  children also need public recreation facilities, especially in highly  urbanized areas, where recreation facilities are most lacking. This  variable was selected to favor areas with greater concentrations of the  dependent population where need for recreation would be the greatest,  and where rehabilitation of existing facilities the most pressing, in  accordance with the Act. The variable was used in its absolute rate to  give an indication of the size of the client populations in each  jurisdiction, based on 1970 data of the U.S. Bureau of the Census.</p><p class="depth2">Percent Persons With Income Below 125 Percent Poverty Level, 1970</p><p class="depth2">In 1970, percent of population below poverty level was calculated by  the Bureau of the Census as the proportion of the total population which  reported income below the poverty level. This variable is the most  current available indicator of poverty status for the jurisdictions in  question. To accommodate the needs of economically disadvantaged people  whose incomes are somewhat above the poverty level, such as those  employed part-time, or those in very low-paid jobs, persons with incomes  up to 125% of poverty are included in this variable. The poor and near- poor have the greatest need for public recreation opportunities and  services in proximity to their homes. This variable is also related to  that part of the Act which stipulates that the Secretary of the Interior  consider ``deficiencies in access to neighborhood recreation facilities,  particularly for . . . low- and moderate-income residents,'' and the  extent to which park and recreation recovery efforts would provide  employment opportunities for low- and moderate-income residents.  Rehabilitation of parks is a relatively labor intensive activity having  the potential for providing short-term jobs with low-skill requirements.  Persons with poverty level incomes tend to lack skills and jobs.  Therefore, this variable was selected to favor jurisdictions having a  large percentage of its population in poverty. The poverty level of  income is based on an index developed by the Social Security  Administration in 1964 and subsequently modified by a Federal  Interagency Committee. In 1969, the poverty thresholds ranged from  $1,487 for a female unrelated individual 65 years old and over living on  a farm to $6,116 for a nonfarm family with a male head and with seven or  more persons. The average poverty threshold for a nonfarm family of four  headed by a male was $3,745.</p><p class="depth2">Determination of Eligibility</p><p class="depth2">The method used to combine the variables had four steps. First, all  values for each of the six variables were expressed in common or  standard units. Second, for each jurisdiction, the standardized values  for the six variables were added to produce a score. Third, the scores  were ranked from high values (most eligible) to low values (least  eligible). Fourth jurisdictions having scores above the median score for  all jurisdictions were designated ``eligible.''</p><p class="depth2">County Eligibility</p><p class="depth2">The Administration stated before the Senate Subcommittee on Parks  and Recreation on June 27, 1978, that it would ensure fair consideration  of urban counties for eligibility under the Urban Park and Recreation  Recovery Program. The Administration has kept this commitment by  subjecting urban county data to the same eligibility standards as cities  and including urban counties which meet those standards on the  eligibility list. All urban counties with a population over 250,000 were  considered under the same criteria (indicators of distress and need) as  the city counterparts. Counties within and SMSA not on the eligibility  list may compete for assistance as discretionary applicants.</p><p class="depth2">The history of the Administration's UPARR proposal clearly indicates  that this program is part of an overall national urban policy.  Therefore, in accordance with the legislative mandate, project selection  criteria will require that county projects be justified in terms of  direct service to identifiable urban neighborhoods (residential areas),  and that there must be evidence of cooperation between a county and its  major city.</p><p class="depth2">Discretionary Grants</p><p class="depth2">Section 1005(b) of the Bill states that at the Secretary's  discretion, up to 15 percent of the program funds annually may be  granted to local governments which do not meet eligibility criteria, but  are located in Standard Metropolitan Statistical Areas, provided that  these grants to general purpose governments are in accord with the  intent of the program. These governments may apply for grants under the  program regardless of whether or not they are included on the list of  eligible jurisdictions.  [44 FR 58091, Oct. 9, 1979.
