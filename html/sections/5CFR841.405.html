When an agency's case  is based in whole or in part on the pattern of merit salary increases  specific to the agency or to a category of employees within the agency,  the Board may require modification of the economic assumptions  concerning salary and wage growth to take into account the combined  effect of merit and general wage and salary increases.</p>
