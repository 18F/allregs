The complaint shall be in writing, and should contain: The complainant's name, address, telephone number and e-mail address (if the complainant has one); the name of both the allegedly unauthorized carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(d) of this chapter, and authorized carrier, as defined by Sec. 64.1100(c) of this chapter; a complete statement of the facts (including any documentation) tending to show that such carrier engaged in an unauthorized change of the subscriber's preferred carrier; a statement of whether the complainant has paid any disputed charges to the allegedly unauthorized carrier; and the specific relief sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure.

If the complainant is unsatisfied with the resolution of a complaint under this section, the complainant may file a formal complaint with the Commission in the form specified in Sec. 1.721. Such filing will be deemed to relate back to the filing date of the informal complaint filed under this section, so long as the informal complaint complied with the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section and provided that: The formal complaint is filed within 45 days from the date an order resolving the informal complaint filed under this section is mailed or delivered electronically to the complainant; makes reference to both the informal complaint number assigned to and the initial date of filing the informal complaint filed under this section; and is based on the same cause of action as the informal complaint filed under this section.
