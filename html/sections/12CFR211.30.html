                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Development and publication of criteria. Pursuant to the Foreign  Bank Supervision Enhancement Act, Pub. L. 102-242, 105 Stat. 2286  (1991), the Board shall develop and publish criteria to be used in  evaluating the operations of any foreign bank in the United States that  the Board has determined is not subject to comprehensive consolidated  supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria considered by Board. Following a determination by the  Board that, having taken into account the standards set forth in Sec.  211.24(c)(1), a foreign bank is not subject to CCS, the Board shall  consider the following criteria in determining whether the foreign  bank's U.S. operations should be permitted to continue and, if so,  whether any supervisory constraints should be placed upon the bank in  connection with those operations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proportion of the foreign bank's total assets and total  liabilities that are located or booked in its home country, as well as  the distribution and location of its assets and liabilities that are  located or booked elsewhere;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The extent to which the operations and assets of the foreign  bank and any affiliates are subject to supervision by its home country  supervisor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whether the home country supervisor of such foreign bank is  actively working to establish arrangements for comprehensive  consolidated supervision of the bank, and whether demonstrable progress  is being made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whether the foreign bank has effective and reliable systems of  internal controls and management information and reporting, which enable  its management properly to oversee its worldwide operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor has any  objection to the bank continuing to operate in the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Whether the foreign bank's home country supervisor and the home  country supervisor of any parent of the foreign bank share material  information regarding the operations of the foreign bank with other  supervisory authorities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The relationship of the U.S. operations to the other operations  of the foreign bank, including whether the foreign bank maintains funds  in its U.S. offices that are in excess of amounts due to its U.S.  offices from the foreign bank's non-U.S. offices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The soundness of the foreign bank's overall financial condition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The managerial resources of the foreign bank, including the  competence, experience, and integrity of the officers and directors, and  the integrity of its principal shareholders;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The scope and frequency of external audits of the foreign bank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The operating record of the foreign bank generally and its role  in the banking system in its home country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The foreign bank's record of compliance with relevant laws, as  well as the adequacy of its anti-money-laundering controls and  procedures, in respect of its worldwide operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The operating record of the U.S. offices of the foreign bank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The views and recommendations of the Comptroller or the  relevant state supervisors in those states in which the foreign bank has  operations, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Whether the foreign bank, if requested, has provided the Board  with adequate assurances that such information will be made available on  the operations or activities of the foreign bank and any of its  affiliates as the Board deems necessary to determine and enforce  compliance with the IBA, the BHC Act, and other U.S. banking statutes;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Any other information relevant to the safety and soundness of  the U.S. operations of the foreign bank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restrictions on U.S. operations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Terms of agreement. Any  foreign bank that the Board determines is not subject to CCS may be  required to enter into an agreement to conduct its U.S. operations  subject to such restrictions as the Board, having considered the  criteria set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, determines to be  appropriate in order to ensure the safety and soundness of its U.S.  operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to enter into or comply with agreement. A foreign bank  that is required by the Board to enter into an agreement pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1) of this section and either fails to do so, or fails to  comply with the terms of such agreement, may be subject to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enforcement action, in order to ensure safe and sound banking  operations, under 12 U.S.C. 1818; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Termination or a recommendation for termination of its U.S.  operations, under Sec. 211.25(a) and (e) and section (7)(e) of the IBA  (12 U.S.C. 3105(e)).</p>
