                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A State with a program approved under this part (or, in the case of a sewage sludge management program, 40 CFR part 501) may voluntarily transfer program responsibilities required by Federal law to EPA by taking the following actions, or in such other manner as may be agreed upon with the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State shall give the Administrator 180 days notice of the proposed transfer and shall submit a plan for the orderly transfer of all relevant program information not in the possession of EPA (such as permits, permit files, compliance files, reports, permit applications) which are necessary for EPA to administer the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within 60 days of receiving the notice and transfer plan, the Administrator shall evaluate the State's transfer plan and shall identify any additional information needed by the Federal government for program administration and/or identify any other deficiencies in the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At least 30 days before the transfer is to occur the Administrator shall publish notice of the transfer in the Federal Register and in enough of the largest newspapers in the State to provide Statewide coverage, and shall mail notice to all permit holders, permit applicants, other regulated persons and other interested persons on appropriate EPA and State mailing lists.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following procedures apply when the Administrator orders the commencement of proceedings to determine whether to withdraw approval of a State program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Order. The Administrator may order the commencement of withdrawal proceedings on his or her own initiative or in response to a petition from an interested person alleging failure of the State to comply with the requirements of this part as set forth in Sec. 123.63 (or, in the case of a sewage sludge management program, Sec. 501.33 of this chapter). The Administrator will respond in writing to any petition to commence withdrawal proceedings. He may conduct an informal investigation of the allegations in the petition to determine whether cause exists to commence proceedings under this paragraph. The Administrator's order commencing proceedings under this paragraph will fix a time and place for the commencement of the hearing and will specify the allegations against the State which are to be considered at the hearing. Within 30 days the State must admit or deny these allegations in a written answer. The party seeking

withdrawal of the State's program will have the burden of coming forward with the evidence in a hearing under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this paragraph the definitions of ``Act,'' ``Administrative Law Judge,'' ``Hearing Clerk,'' and ``Presiding Officer'' in 40 CFR 22.03 apply in addition to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Party means the petitioner, the State, the Agency, and any other person whose request to participate as a party is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Person means the Agency, the State and any individual or organization having an interest in the subject matter of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Petitioner means any person whose petition for commencement of withdrawal proceedings has been granted by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Procedures. (i) The following provisions of 40 CFR part 22 (Consolidated Rules of Practice) are applicable to proceedings under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following provisions of 40 CFR part 22 (Consolidated Rules of Practice) are applicable to proceedings under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Sec. 22.02--(use of number/gender);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sec. 22.04(c)--(authorities of Presiding Officer);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sec. 22.06--(filing/service of rulings and orders);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Sec. 22.09--(examination of filed documents);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Sec. 22.19(a), (b) and (c)--(prehearing conference);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Sec. 22.22--(evidence);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Sec. 22.23--(objections/offers of proof);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Sec. 22.25--(filing the transcript); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> Sec. 22.26--(findings/conclusions).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following provisions are also applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Computation and extension of time--(1) Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed or allowed in these rules of practice, except as otherwise provided, the day of the event from which the designated period begins to run shall not be included. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays shall be included. When a stated time expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the stated time period shall be extended to include the next business day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extensions of time. The Administrator, Regional Administrator, or Presiding Officer, as appropriate, may grant an extension of time for the filing of any pleading, document, or motion (i) upon timely motion of a party to the proceeding, for good cause shown, and after consideration of prejudice to other parties, or (ii) upon his own motion. Such a motion by a party may only be made after notice to all other parties, unless the movant can show good cause why serving notice is impracticable. The motion shall be filed in advance of the date on which the pleading, document or motion is due to be filed, unless the failure of a party to make timely motion for extension of time was the result of excusable neglect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The time for commencement of the hearing shall not be extended beyond the date set in the Administrator's order without approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Ex parte discussion of proceedings. At no time after the issuance of the order commencing proceedings shall the Administrator, the Regional Administrator, the Regional Judicial Officer, the Presiding Officer, or any other person who is likely to advise these officials in the decision on the case, discuss ex parte the merits of the proceeding with any interested person outside the Agency, with any Agency staff member who performs a prosecutorial or investigative function in such proceeding or a factually related proceeding, or with any representative of such person. Any ex parte memorandum or other communication addressed to the Administrator, the Regional Administrator, the Regional Judicial Officer, or the Presiding Officer during the pendency of the proceeding and relating to the merits thereof, by or on behalf of any party, shall be regarded as argument made in the proceeding and shall be served upon all other parties. The other parties shall be given an opportunity to reply to such memorandum or communication.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Intervention--(1) Motion. A motion for leave to intervene in any proceeding conducted under these rules of practice must set forth the grounds for the proposed intervention, the position and interest of the movant and the likely impact that intervention will have on the expeditious progress of the proceeding. Any person already a party to the proceeding may file an answer to

a motion to intervene, making specific reference to the factors set forth in the foregoing sentence and paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C)(3) of this section, within ten (10) days after service of the motion for leave to intervene.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> However, motions to intervene must be filed within 15 days from the date the notice of the Administrator's order is first published.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Disposition. Leave to intervene may be granted only if the movant demonstrates that (i) his presence in the proceeding would not unduly prolong or otherwise prejudice that adjudication of the rights of the original parties; (ii) the movant will be adversely affected by a final order; and (iii) the interests of the movant are not being adequately represented by the original parties. The intervenor shall become a full party to the proceeding upon the granting of leave to intervene.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amicus curiae. Persons not parties to the proceeding who wish to file briefs may so move. The motion shall identify the interest of the applicant and shall state the reasons why the proposed amicus brief is desirable. If the motion is granted, the Presiding Officer or Administrator shall issue an order setting the time for filing such brief. An amicus curiae is eligible to participate in any briefing after his motion is granted, and shall be served with all briefs, reply briefs, motions, and orders relating to issues to be briefed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Motions--(1) General. All motions, except those made orally on the record during a hearing, shall (i) be in writing; (ii) state the grounds therefor with particularity; (iii) set forth the relief or order sought; and (iv) be accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other evidence, or legal memorandum relied upon. Such motions shall be served as provided by paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Response to motions. A party's response to any written motion must be filed within ten (10) days after service of such motion, unless additional time is allowed for such response. The response shall be accompanied by any affidavit, certificate, other evidence, or legal memorandum relied upon. If no response is filed within the designated period, the parties may be deemed to have waived any objection to the granting of the motion. The Presiding Officer, Regional Administrator, or Administrator, as appropriate, may set a shorter time for response, or make such other orders concerning the disposition of motions as they deem appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Decision. The Administrator shall rule on all motions filed or made after service of the recommended decision upon the parties. The Presiding Officer shall rule on all other motions. Oral argument on motions will be permitted where the Presiding Officer, Regional Administrator, or the Administrator considers it necessary or desirable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Record of proceedings. (i) The hearing shall be either stenographically reported verbatim or tape recorded, and thereupon transcribed by an official reporter designated by the Presiding Officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The hearing shall be either stenographically reported verbatim or tape recorded, and thereupon transcribed by an official reporter designated by the Presiding Officer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All orders issued by the Presiding Officer, transcripts of testimony, written statements of position, stipulations, exhibits, motions, briefs, and other written material of any kind submitted in the hearing shall be a part of the record and shall be available for inspection or copying in the Office of the Hearing Clerk, upon payment of costs.

A person who is not a party may, in the discretion of the Presiding Officer, be permitted to make a limited appearance by making oral or written statement of his/her position on the issues within such limits and on such conditions as may be fixed by the Presiding Officer, but he/she may not otherwise participate in the proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Rights of parties. (i) All parties to the proceeding may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All parties to the proceeding may:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Appear by counsel or other representative in all hearing and pre-hearing proceedings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Agree to stipulations of facts which shall be made a part of the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Recommended decision.
