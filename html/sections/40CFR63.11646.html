                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must conduct a mercury compliance emission test within 180 days of the compliance date for all process units at new and existing affected sources according to the requirements in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(13) of this section. This compliance testing must be repeated annually thereafter, with no two consecutive annual compliance tests occurring less than 3 months apart or more than 15 months apart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must determine the concentration of mercury and the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas according to the following test methods and procedures:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Method 1 or 1A (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1) to select sampling port locations and the number of traverse points in each stack or duct. Sampling sites must be located at the outlet of the control device (or at the outlet of the emissions source if no control device is present) and prior to any releases to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, 2D, 2F (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1), or Method 2G (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to determine the volumetric flow rate of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Method 3, 3A, or 3B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2) to determine the dry molecular weight of the stack gas. You may use ANSI/ASME PTC 19.10, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses'' (incorporated by reference-see Sec. 63.14) as an alternative to EPA Method 3B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Method 4 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3) to determine the moisture content of the stack gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Method 29 (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8) to determine the concentration of mercury, except as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(vi) and (vii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Upon approval by the permitting authority, ASTM D6784; ``Standard Test Method for Elemental, Oxidized, Particle-Bound and Total Mercury in Flue Gas Generated from Coal-Fired Stationary Sources (Ontario Hydro Method)'' (incorporated by reference--see Sec. 63.14) may be used as an alternative to Method 29 to determine the concentration of mercury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Upon approval by the permitting authority, Method 30B (40 CFR part 60, appendix A-8) may be used as an alternative to Method 29 to determine the concentration of mercury for those process units with relatively low particulate-bound mercury as specified in Section 1.2 of Method 30B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A minimum of three test runs must be conducted for each performance test of each process unit. Each test run conducted with Method 29 must collect a minimum sample volume of 0.85 dry standard cubic meters (30 dry standard cubic feet). If conducted with Method 30B or ASTM D6784, determine sample time and volume according to the testing criteria set forth in the relevant method. If the emission testing results for any of the emission points yields a non-detect value, then the minimum detection limit (MDL) must be used to calculate the mass emissions rate (lb/hr) used to calculate the emissions factor (lb/ton) for that emission point and, in turn, for calculating the sum of the emissions (in units of pounds of mercury per ton of concentrate, or pounds of mercury per million tons of ore) for all emission points subject to the emission standard for determining compliance. If the resulting mercury emissions are greater than the MACT emission standard, the owner or operator may use procedures that produce lower MDL results and repeat the mercury emissions testing one additional time for any emission point for which the measured result was below the MDL. If this additional testing is performed, the results from that testing must be used to determine compliance (i.e., there are no additional opportunities allowed to lower the MDL).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted under such conditions as the Administrator specifies to the owner or operator based on representative performance of the affected source for the period being tested. Upon request, the owner or operator shall make available to the Administrator such records as may be necessary to determine the conditions of performance tests. Performance tests must be conducted under operating conditions (including process or production throughputs) that are based on representative performance. Record and report to the permit authority the process throughput for each test run. For sources with multiple emission units (e.g., two roasters, or a furnace, electrowinning circuit and a mercury retort) ducted to a common control device and stack, compliance testing must be performed either by conducting a single compliance test with all affected emissions units in operation or by conducting a separate compliance test on each emissions unit. Alternatively, the owner or operator may request approval from the permit authority for an alternative

testing approach. If the units are tested separately, any emissions unit that is not tested initially must be tested as soon as is practicable. If the performance test is conducted when all affected units are operating, then the number of hours of operation used for calculating emissions pursuant to paragraphs (a)(6) and (7) of this section must be the total number of hours for the unit that has the greatest total operating hours for that period of time, or based on an appropriate alternative method approved by the permit authority to account for the hours of operation for each separate unit in these calculations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Calculate the mercury emission rate (lb/hr), based on the average of 3 test run values, for each process unit (or combination of units that are ducted to a common stack and are tested when all affected sources are operating pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) using Equation (1) of this section:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17FE11.003
Where:
E = mercury emissions in lb/hr;Cs = concentration of mercury in the stack gas, in grains per dry</p><p class="depth3">standard cubic foot (gr/dscf);Qs = volumetric flow rate of the stack gas, in dry standard cubic feet</p><p class="depth3">per hour; andK = conversion factor for grains (gr) to pounds (lb), 1.43 x</p><p class="depth3">10-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitor and record the number of one-hour periods each process unit operates during each month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For the initial compliance determination for both new and existing sources, determine the total mercury emissions for all the full calendar months between the compliance date and the date of the initial compliance test by multiplying the emission rate in lb/hr for each process unit (or combination of units ducted to a common stack that are tested together) by the number of one-hour periods each process unit (or the unit that had the greatest total operating hours among the combination of multiple units with one stack that are tested together, or an alternative method approved by the permit authority, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) operated during those full calendar months prior to the initial compliance test. This initial period must include at least 1 full month of operations. After the initial compliance test, for subsequent compliance tests, determine the mercury mass emissions for the 12 full calendar months prior to the compliance test in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (a)(7) of this section. Existing sources may use a previous emission test for their initial compliance determination in lieu of conducting a new test if the test was conducted within one year of the compliance date using the methods specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section, and the tests were representative of current operating processes and conditions. If a previous test is used for their initial compliance determination, 3 to 12 full months of data on hours of operation and production (i.e., million tons of ore or tons of concentrate), including the month the test was conducted, must be used to calculate the emissions rate (in units of pounds of mercury per million tons of ore for the ore pretreatment affected sources, or in units of pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate for the other affected sources).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For compliance determinations following the initial compliance test for new and existing sources, determine the total mercury mass emissions for each process unit for the 12 full calendar months preceding the performance test by multiplying the emission rate in lb/hr for each process unit (or combination of units ducted to a common stack that are tested together) by the number of one-hour periods each process unit (or the unit that had the greatest total operating hours among the combination of multiple units with one stack that are tested together, or an alternative method approved by the permit authority, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section) operated

during the 12 full calendar months preceding the completion of the performance tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> You must install, calibrate, maintain and operate an appropriate weight measurement device, mass flow meter, or densitometer and volumetric flow meter to measure ore throughput for each roasting operation and autoclave and calculate hourly, daily and monthly totals in tons of ore according to paragraphs (a)(8)(i) and (a)(8)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Measure the weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of the oxidized ore slurry as it exits the roaster oxidation circuit(s) and before the carbon-in-leach tanks. Alternatively, the weight of the ore can be measured ``as fed'' if approved by the permit authority as an acceptable equivalent method to measure amount of ore processed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Measure the weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of the ore slurry as it is fed to the autoclave(s). Alternatively, the weight or the density and volumetric flow rate of the oxidized ore slurry can be measured as it exits the autoclave and before the carbon-in-leach tanks if approved by the permit authority as an acceptable equivalent method to measure amount of ore processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Measure the weight of concentrate (produced by electrowinning, Merrill Crowe process, gravity feed, or other methods) using weigh scales for each batch prior to processing in mercury retorts or melt furnaces. For facilities with mercury retorts, the concentrate must be weighed in the same state and condition as it is when fed to the mercury retort. For facilities without mercury retorts, the concentrate must be weighed prior to being fed to the melt furnace before drying in any ovens. For facilities that ship concentrate offsite, measure the weight of concentrate as shipped offsite. You must keep accurate records of the weights of each batch of concentrate processed and calculate, and record the total weight of concentrate processed each month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> You must maintain the systems for measuring density, volumetric flow rate, and weight within [5 percent accuracy. You must describe the specific equipment used to make measurements at your facility and how that equipment is periodically calibrated. You must also explain, document, and maintain written procedures for determining the accuracy of the measurements and make these written procedures available to your permitting authority upon request. You must determine, record, and maintain a record of the accuracy of the measuring systems before the beginning of your initial compliance test and during each subsequent quarter of affected source operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Record the weight in tons of ore for ore pretreatment processes and concentrate for carbon processes with mercury retorts, carbon processes without mercury retorts, and for non-carbon concentrate processes on a daily and monthly basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source for the sum of all full months between the compliance date and the date of the initial compliance test in pounds of mercury per ton of process input using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(12)(i) through (a)(12)(iv) of this section to determine initial compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 63.11645. This must include at least 1 full month of data. Or, if a previous test is used pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section for the initial compliance test, use a period of time pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section to calculate the emissions for the affected source. After this initial compliance test period, determine annual compliance using the procedures in paragraph (a)(13) of this section for existing sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves during the number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance test by the sum of the total amount of gold mine ore processed (in million tons) in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. Or, if a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., million tons of ore) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of

this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per million tons of ore.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces during the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For carbon processes without mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, and melt furnaces during the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces during the initial number of full months between the compliance date and the initial compliance tests by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units during those same full months following the compliance date. If a previous test is used to determine initial compliance, pursuant to paragraph (a)(6) of this section, then the same 3 to 12 full months of production data (i.e., tons of concentrate) and hours of operation referred to in paragraph (a)(6) of this section, must be used to determine the emissions in pounds of mercury per tons of concentrate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> After the initial compliance test, calculate the emissions from each new and existing affected source for each 12-month period preceding each subsequent compliance test in pounds of mercury per ton of process input using the procedures in paragraphs (a)(13)(i) through (iv) of this section to determine compliance with the emission standards in Sec. 63.11645.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For ore pretreatment processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all roasting operations and autoclaves in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the sum of the total amount of gold mine ore processed (in million tons) in that 12-month period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For carbon processes with mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, mercury retorts, and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For carbon processes without mercury retorts, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from all carbon kilns, preg tanks, electrowinning, and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For non-carbon concentrate processes, divide the sum of mercury mass emissions (in pounds) from mercury retorts and melt furnaces in the 12-month period preceding a compliance test by the total amount of concentrate (in tons) processed in these process units in that 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At all times, you must operate and maintain any affected source, including associated air pollution control equipment and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with safety and good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions. Determination

of whether such operation and maintenance procedures are being used will be based on information available to the Administrator which may include, but is not limited to, monitoring results, review of operation and maintenance procedures, review of operation and maintenance records, and inspection of the source.</p>
