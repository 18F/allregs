Carriers and conferences shall publish in their tariffs any rule that affects the application of the tariff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Commodity descriptions. (1) For each separate commodity in a tariff, a distinct numeric code may be used. Tariff publishers are not required to use any numeric code to identify commodities, but should they choose to do so, they are encouraged to use the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``U.S. HTS'') for both the commodity coding and associated terminology (definitions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each separate commodity in a tariff, a distinct numeric code may be used. Tariff publishers are not required to use any numeric code to identify commodities, but should they choose to do so, they are encouraged to use the U.S. Harmonized Tariff Schedule (``U.S. HTS'') for both the commodity coding and associated terminology (definitions).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a tariff publisher uses a numeric code to identify commodities, the following commodity types shall be preceded by their associated 2-digit prefixes, with the remaining digits at the publisher's option:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mixed commodities--``99'';</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Projects--``98''; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> non-commodities, e.g., ``cargo, n.o.s.,'' ``general cargo,'' or ``freight-all kinds''--``00''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commodity index. (i) Each commodity description created under this section shall have at least one similar index entry which will logically represent the commodity within the alphabetical index. Publishers are encouraged, however, to create multiple entries in the index for articles with equally valid common use names, such as, ``Sodium Chloride,'' ``Salt, common,'' etc.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each commodity description created under this section shall have at least one similar index entry which will logically represent the commodity within the alphabetical index. Publishers are encouraged, however, to create multiple entries in the index for articles with equally valid common use names, such as, ``Sodium Chloride,'' ``Salt, common,'' etc.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a commodity description includes two or more commodities, each included commodity shall be shown in the index.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Items, such as ``mixed commodities,'' ``projects'' or ``project rates,'' ``n.o.s.'' descriptions, and ``FAK,'' shall be included in the commodity index.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tariff rate items. A tariff rate item (``TRI'') is the single freight rate in effect for the transportation of cargo under a specified set of transportation conditions. TRIs must contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Brief commodity description;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> TRI number (optional);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Publication date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Origin and destination locations or location groups;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rate and rate basis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Service code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Location groups. In the primary tariff, or in a governing tariff, a publisher may define and create groups of cities, states, provinces and countries (e.g., location groups) or groups of ports (e.g., port groups), which may be used in the construction of TRIs and other tariff objects, in lieu of specifying particular place names in each tariff item, or creating multiple tariff items which are identical in all ways except for place names.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Inland rate tables. If a carrier or conference desires to provide intermodal transportation to or from named points/postal regions at combination rates, it shall clearly and accurately set forth the applicable charges in an ``Inland Rate Tables'' section. An inland rate table may be constructed to provide an inland distance which is applied to a per mile rate to calculate the inland rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Shipper requests. Conference tariffs shall contain clear and complete instructions, in accordance with the agreement's provisions, stating where and by what method shippers may file requests and complaints and how they may engage in consultation pursuant to section 5(b)(6) of the Act (46 U.S.C. 40303(b)(6)), together with a sample rate request form or a description of the information necessary for processing the request or complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Inland divisions. Common carriers are not required to state separately or

otherwise reveal in tariffs the inland division of a through rate.
