The request shall be made in writing, addressed to the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division, P.O. Box 65808, Washington, DC 20035-5808. Both the envelope and the letter of appeal itself must be clearly marked: ``Redress Appeal.'' A request not so addressed and marked shall be forwarded to the Office of the Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, or the official designated to act on his behalf, as soon as it is identified as an appeal of eligibility. An appeal that is improperly addressed shall be deemed not to have been received by the Department until the Office receives the appeal, or until the appeal would have been so received with the exercise of due diligence by Department personnel.</p>
