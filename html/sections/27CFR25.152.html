                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of Title 26 U.S.C. provides for a  reduced rate of tax on the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed for  consumption or sale by a brewer during a calendar year. To be eligible  to pay the reduced rate of tax, a brewer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Shall brew or produce the beer at a qualified brewery in the  United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May not produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per calendar  year; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> May not be a member of a ``controlled group'' of brewers whose  members together produce more than 2,000,000 barrels of beer per  calendar year.  The appropriate TTB officer shall deny use of the reduced rate of tax  provided by 26 U.S.C. 5051(a)(2) where it is determined that the  allowance of such a reduced rate would benefit a person who would  otherwise fail to qualify for use of such rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purpose of determining eligibility for  payment of   the reduced rate of tax on beer, terms have the following meanings:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Controlled group. A related group of brewers as defined in 26  U.S.C. 5051(a)(2)(B). Controlled groups include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Parent-subsidiary controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563- 1(a)(2);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Brother-sister controlled groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563- 1(a)(3); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Combined groups as defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-1(a)(4). Stock  ownership in a corporation need not be direct and 51% constructive  ownership, defined in 26 CFR 1.1563-3, may be acquired through:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An option to purchase stock;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Attribution from partnerships;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Attribution from estate or trusts;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Attribution from corporations; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Ownership by spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, and  grandparents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Production of beer. The production of beer as recorded in the  brewer's daily records and reported in the Brewer's Report of  Operations, Form 5130.9. For the purpose of determining compliance with  the 2,000,000 barrel limitation, production of beer by a brewer or a  controlled group of brewers includes both beer produced at qualified  breweries within the United States and beer produced outside the United  States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Brewers operating more than one brewery. Brewers who operate  more than one brewery shall include the combined production of beer at  all their breweries when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000  barrel limitation. The reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000  barrels of beer removed for consumption or sale in a calendar year by  the brewer; the brewer shall apportion the 60,000 barrels among the  breweries in the manner described in the notice as provided by Sec.  25.167(b)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Controlled groups of brewers. Members of a controlled group of  brewers shall include the combined production of beer by all member  brewers when determining eligibility under the 2,000,000 limitation. The  reduced rate of tax applies to the first 60,000 barrels of beer removed  for consumption or sale in a calendar year by the controlled group of  brewers; the controlled group of brewers shall apportion the 60,000  barrels among member brewers in the manner described in each brewer's  notice as provided by Sec. 25.167(b)(3).
