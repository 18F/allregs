printed, graphic, or other material accompanying such containers to the consumer, must not contain:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any statement that is false or untrue in any particular, or that, irrespective of falsity, directly, or by ambiguity, omission, or inference, or by the addition of irrelevant, scientific or technical matter, tends to create a misleading impression.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any statement that is disparaging of a competitor's products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation which is obscene or indecent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to analyses, standards, or tests, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any statement, design, device, or representation of or relating to any guarantee, irrespective of falsity, which the appropriate TTB officer finds to be likely to mislead the consumer.

No label shall be of such design as to resemble or simulate a stamp of the United States Government or of any State or foreign government. No label, other than stamps authorized or required by the United States Government or any State or foreign government, shall state or indicate that the malt beverage contained in the labeled container is brewed, made, bottled, packed, labeled, or sold under, or in accordance with, any municipal, State, Federal, or foreign government authorization, law, or regulation, unless such statement is required or specifically authorized by Federal, State, or municipal, law or regulation, or is required or specifically authorized by the laws or regulations of the foreign country in which such malt beverages were produced. If the municipal or State government permit number is stated upon a label, it shall not be accompanied by an additional statement relating thereto, unless required by State law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of word ``bonded'', etc. The words ``bonded'', ``bottled in bond'', ``aged in bond'', ``bonded age'', ``bottled under customs supervision'', or phrases containing these or synonymous terms which imply governmental supervision over production, bottling, or packing, shall not be used on any label for malt beverages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Flags, seals, coats of arms, crests, and other insignia.

The term includes both specific health claims and general references to alleged health benefits or effects on health associated with the consumption of alcohol, malt beverages, or any substance found within the malt beverage, as well as health-related directional statements. The term also includes statements and claims that imply that a physical or psychological sensation results from consuming the malt beverage, as well as statements and claims of nutritional value (e.g., statements of vitamin content). Statements concerning caloric, carbohydrate, protein, and fat content do not constitute nutritional claims about the product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specific health claim is a type of health-related statement that, expressly or by implication, characterizes the relationship of the malt beverage, alcohol, or any substance found within the malt beverage, to a disease or health-related condition.

In general, labels may not contain any health-related statement that is untrue in any particular or tends to create a misleading impression as to the effects on health of alcohol consumption.

(A) TTB will consult with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), as needed, on the use of a specific health claim on a malt beverage label.

This information must appear as part of the specific health claim.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Health-related directional statements. A statement that directs consumers to a third party or other source for information regarding the effects

on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption is presumed misleading unless it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Directs consumers in a neutral or other non-misleading manner to a third party or other source for balanced information regarding the effects on health of malt beverage or alcohol consumption; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> Includes as part of the health-related directional statement the following disclaimer: ``This statement should not encourage you to drink or to increase your alcohol consumption for health reasons;'' or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Includes as part of the health-related directional statement some other qualifying statement that the appropriate TTB officer finds is sufficient to dispel any misleading impression conveyed by the health-related directional statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Use of words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' and similar words. Labels shall not contain the words ``strong,'' ``full strength,'' ``extra strength,'' ``high test,'' ``high proof,'' ``pre-war strength,'' ``full oldtime alcoholic strength,'' or similar words or statements, likely to be considered as statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State law. This does not preclude use of the terms ``low alcohol,'' ``reduced alcohol,'' ``non-alcoholic,'' and ``alcohol-free,'' in accordance with Sec. 7.71 (d), (e), and (f), nor does it preclude labeling with the alcohol content in accordance with Sec. 7.71.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Use of numerals. Labels shall not contain any statements, designs, or devices, whether in the form of numerals, letters, characters, figures, or otherwise, which are likely to be considered as statements of alcoholic content, unless required by State law, or as permitted by Sec. 7.71.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Coverings, cartons, or cases.
