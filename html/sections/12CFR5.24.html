A state bank (including a ``state bank'' as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a)) or a Federal savings association shall submit an application and obtain prior OCC approval to convert to a national bank charter. A national bank shall give notice to the OCC before converting to a state bank (including a ``state bank'' as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a)) or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope. This section describes procedures and standards governing OCC review and approval of an application by a state bank or Federal savings association to convert to a national bank charter. This section also describes notice procedures for a national bank seeking to convert to a state bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conversion of a state bank or Federal savings association to a national bank--(1) Policy. Consistent with the OCC's chartering policy, it is OCC policy to allow conversion to a national bank charter by another financial institution that can operate safely and soundly as a national bank in compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and policies. The OCC may deny an application by any state bank (including a ``state bank'' as defined in 12 U.S.C. 214(a)) and any Federal savings association to convert to a national bank charter on the basis of the standards for denial set forth in Sec. 5.13(b), or when conversion would permit the applicant to escape supervisory action by its current regulator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Policy.

(i) Prefiling communications. The applicant should consult with the appropriate district office prior to filing if it anticipates that its application will raise unusual or complex issues. If a prefiling meeting is appropriate, it will normally be held in the district office where the application will be filed, but may be held at another location at the request of the applicant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prefiling communications.

The application must:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Be signed by the president or other duly authorized officer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Identify each branch that the resulting bank expects to operate after conversion;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Include the institution's most recent audited financial statements (if any);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Include the latest report of condition and report of income (the most recent daily statement of condition will suffice if the institution does not file these reports);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Unless otherwise advised by the OCC in a prefiling communication, include an opinion of counsel that, in the case of a state bank, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable state law, or in the case of a Federal savings association, the conversion is not in contravention of applicable Federal law;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> State whether the institution wishes to exercise fiduciary powers after the conversion;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Identify all subsidiaries that will be retained following the conversion, and provide the information and analysis of the subsidiaries' activities that would be required if the converting bank or savings association were a national bank establishing each subsidiary pursuant to Secs. 5.34 or 5.39; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(H)</em> Identify any nonconforming assets (including nonconforming subsidiaries) and nonconforming activities

that the institution engages in, and describe the plans to retain or divest those assets.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The OCC may permit a national bank to retain such nonconforming assets of a state bank, subject to conditions and an OCC determination of the carrying value of the retained assets, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 35.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Approval for an institution to convert to a national bank expires if the conversion has not occurred within six months of the OCC's preliminary approval of the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When the OCC determines that the applicant has satisfied all statutory and regulatory requirements, including those set forth in 12 U.S.C. 35, and any other conditions, the OCC issues a charter certificate. The certificate provides that the institution is authorized to begin conducting business as a national bank as of a specified date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions to rules of general applicability. Sections 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 do not apply to this section. However, if the OCC concludes that an application presents significant and novel policy, supervisory, or legal issues, the OCC may determine that any or all parts of Secs. 5.8, 5.10, and 5.11 apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Expedited review. An application by an eligible depository institution to convert to a national bank charter is deemed approved by the OCC as of the 30th day after the filing is received by the OCC, unless the OCC notifies the applicant prior to that date that the filing is not eligible for expedited review under Sec. 5.13(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Conversion of a national bank to a state bank--(1) Procedure. A national bank may convert to a state bank, in accordance with 12 U.S.C. 214c, without prior OCC approval.

A national bank that desires to convert to a state bank shall submit to the appropriate district office a notice of its intent to convert. The national bank shall file this notice when it first submits a request to convert to the appropriate state authorities. The appropriate district office then provides instructions to the national bank for terminating its status as a national bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions to the rules of general applicability.
