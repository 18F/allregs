Composite samples consist of more than one sample gauze extracted and chemically analyzed together resulting in a single measurement. The composite measurement represents an arithmetic mean of the composited samples.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compositing samples from surfaces to be used or reused.
