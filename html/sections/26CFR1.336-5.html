If paragraph (a)(1) of this section applies to a loss subject to deferral or disallowance under any other provision of the Code or the regulations, the other provision applies to the loss only to the extent it is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The definitions in Sec. 1.1502-1 apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional subsidiary means any corporation that became a subsidiary of the group (whether or not the group was a consolidated group) after January 6, 1987. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a subsidiary is not a transitional subsidiary if the subsidiary (and each predecessor) was a member of the group at all times after

the subsidiary's (and each predecessor's) organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Built-in gain of a transitional subsidiary means gain attributable, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to any excess of value over basis, determined immediately before the transitional subsidiary became a subsidiary, with respect to any asset owned directly or indirectly by the transitional subsidiary at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Disposition means any event in which gain or loss is recognized, in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Value means fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the group files consolidated returns on a calendar year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and all sales and purchases are with unrelated buyers or sellers. The basis of each asset is the same determining earnings and profits adjustments and taxable income. Tax liability and its effect on basis, value, and earnings and profits are disregarded. Investment adjustment system means the rules of Sec. 1.1502-32. The principles of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P buys all the stock of T for $100 on February 1, 1987, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a value of $100 and basis of $0. T sells the asset in 1989 and recognizes $100 of built-in gain on the sale (i.e., the asset's value exceeded its basis by $100 at the time T became a member of the P group). Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increases to $200. P sells all the stock of T on December 31, 1989, and recognizes a loss of $100. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no deduction is allowed to P for the $100 loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Assume that, after T sells its asset but before P sells the T stock, T issues additional stock to unrelated persons and ceases to be a member of the P group. P then sells all its stock of T in 1997. Although T ceases to be a subsidiary within the meaning of Sec. 1.1502-1, T continues to be a transitional subsidiary within the meaning of this section. Consequently, under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no deduction is allowed to P for its $100 loss.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Loss attributable to post-acquisition loss. P buys all the stock of T for $100 on February 1, 1987, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has $50 cash and an asset with $50 of built-in gain. During 1988, T retains the asset but loses $40 of the cash. The P group is unable to use the loss, and the loss becomes a net operating loss carryover attributable to T. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the stock of T remains $100. P sells all the stock of T on December 31, 1988, for $60 and recognizes a $40 loss. Under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, P establishes that it did not dispose of the built-in gain asset. None of P's loss is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) if P satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P buys all the stock of T for $100 on February 1, 1987, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has 2 assets. Asset 1 has a basis and value of $50, and asset 2 has a basis of $0 and a value of $50. During 1989, asset 1 declines in value to $0, and T sells asset 2 for $50, and reinvests the proceeds in asset 3. The value of asset 3 appreciates to $90. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the stock of T increases from $100 to $150 as a result of the gain recognized on the sale of asset 2 but is unaffected by the unrealized post-acquisition decline in the value of asset 1. On December 31, 1989, P sells all the stock of T for $90 and recognizes a $60 loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although T incurred a $50 post-acquisition loss of built-in gain because of the decline in the value of asset 1, T also recognized $50 of built-in gain. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, any loss on the sale of stock is treated first as attributable to recognized built-in gain. Thus, for purposes of determining under paragraph (a)(2) of this section whether P's $60 loss on the disposition of the T stock is attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of an asset, T's unrealized post-acquisition gain of $40 offsets $40 of the $50 of unrealized post-acquisition loss. Therefore, $50 of the $60 loss is attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of an asset and is disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P buys all the stock of T for $50 on February 1, 1987, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has 2 assets. Asset 1 has a basis of $50 and a value of $0, and asset 2 has a basis of $0 and a value of $50. During 1989, T sells asset 1 for $0 and asset 2 for $50, and reinvests the $50 proceeds in asset 3. The value of asset 3 declines to $40. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the stock of T remains $50 as a result of the offsetting gain and loss recognized on the sale of assets 1 and 2 and is unaffected by the unrealized post-acquisition decline in the value of asset 3. On December 31, 1989, P sells all the stock of T for $40 and recognizes a $10 loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although T recognized a $50 built-in gain on the sale of asset 2, T also recognized

a $50 built-in loss on the sale of asset 1. For purposes of determining under paragraph (a)(2) of this section whether P's $10 loss on the disposition of the T stock is attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of an asset, T's recognized built-in gain is offset by its recognized built-in loss. Thus none of P's $10 loss is attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of an asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The result would be the same if, instead of a $50 built-in loss in asset 2, T has a $50 net operating loss carryover when P buys the T stock, and the net operating loss carryover is used to offset the built-in gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Individual A owns all the stock of T, for which A has a basis of $60. On February 1, 1987, T owns 1 asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100, P acquires all the stock of T from A in an exchange to which section 351(a) applies, and T becomes a member of the P group. P has a carryover basis of $60 in the T stock. During 1988, T sells the asset and recognizes $100 of gain. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increases from $60 to $160. T reinvests the $100 proceeds in another asset, which declines in value to $90. On January 1, 1989, P sells all the stock of T for $90 and recognizes a loss of $70.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although P's basis in the T stock was increased by $100 as a result of the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of T's asset, only $60 of the $70 loss on the sale of the stock is attributable under paragraph (a)(2) of this section to the recognition of built-in gain from the disposition of the asset. (Had T's asset not declined in value to $90, the T stock would have been sold for $100, and a $60 loss would have been attributable to the recognition of the built-in gain.) Therefore, $60 of the $70 loss is disallowed under paragraph (a)(2), and $10 is not disallowed if P satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(2). If P had sold the stock of T for $95 because T's other assets had unrealized appreciation of $5, $60 of the $65 loss would still be attributable to T's recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Creeping acquisition. P owns 60 percent of the stock of S on January 6, 1987. On February 1, 1987, P buys an additional 20 percent of the stock of S, and S becomes a member of the P group. P sells all the S stock on March 1, 1989 and recognizes a loss of $100. All 80 percent of the stock of S owned by P is subject to the rules of this section and, under paragraph (a) (1) and (2) of this section, P is not allowed to deduct the $100 loss, except to the extent P establishes the loss is not attributable to the recognition by S of built-in gain on the disposition of assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Effect of post-acquisition appreciation. P buys all the stock of T for $100, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has an asset with a basis of $0 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increases to $200. T reinvests the proceeds of the sale in an asset that appreciates in value to $180. Five years after the sale, P sells all the stock of T for $180 and recognizes a $20 loss. Under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, no deduction is allowed to P for the $20 loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P is the common parent of a consolidated group, S is a wholly owned subsidiary of P, and T is a wholly owned subsidiary of S. S purchased all of the T stock on February 1, 1987 for $100, and T has an asset with a basis of $40 and a value of $100. T sells the asset for $100, recognizing $60 of gain. Under the investment adjustment system, S's basis in the T stock increases from $100 to $160. S sells its T stock to P for $100 in a deferred intercompany transaction, recognizing a $60 loss that is deferred under section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. P subsequently sells all the stock of T for $100 to X, a member of the same controlled group (as defined in section 267(f)) as P but not a member of the P consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the application of paragraph (a)(1) of this section to S's $60 loss is deferred, because S's loss is deferred under section 267(f) and Sec. 1.1502-13. Although P's sale of the T stock to X would cause S's deferred loss to be taken into account under Sec. 1.1502-13, Sec. 1.267(f)-1 provides that the loss is not taken into account because X is a member of the same controlled group as P and S. Nevertheless, under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, because the T stock ceases to be owned by a member of the P consolidated group, S's deferred loss is disallowed immediately before the sale and is never taken into account under section 267(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Indirect disposition of transitional subsidiary--(1) Loss limitation rule for transitional parent. No deduction is allowed for any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of stock of a transitional parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Loss limitation rule for transitional parent. No deduction is allowed for any loss recognized by a member of a consolidated group with respect to the disposition of stock of a transitional parent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allowable loss--(i) In general. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the loss exceeds the amount that would be disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section if each highest tier transitional subsidiary's stock in which the transitional parent has a direct or indirect interest had been sold immediately before the disposition of the transitional parent's stock. In applying the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account circumstances where

less than all the stock of a transitional parent owned by members of a consolidated group is disposed of in the same transaction, or the stock of a transitional subsidiary or a transitional parent is directly owned by more than 1 member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the loss exceeds the amount that would be disallowed under paragraph (a) of this section if each highest tier transitional subsidiary's stock in which the transitional parent has a direct or indirect interest had been sold immediately before the disposition of the transitional parent's stock. In applying the preceding sentence, appropriate adjustments shall be made to take into account circumstances where

Paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section applies only if a separate statement entitled ``Allowable Loss Under Section 1.337(d)-1(b)'' is filed with the taxpayer's return for the year of the stock disposition. If the separate statement is required to be filed with a return the due date (including extensions) of which is before January 16, 1991, or with a return due (including extensions) after January 15, 1991 but filed before that date, the statement may be filed with an amended return for the year of the disposition or with the taxpayer's first subsequent return the due date (including extensions) of which is after January 15, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Contents of statement.

For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transitional parent means any subsidiary, other than a transitional subsidiary, that owned at any time after January 6, 1987, a direct or indirect interest in the stock of a corporation that is a transitional subsidiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Highest tier transitional subsidiary means the transitional subsidiary (or subsidiaries) in which the transitional parent has a direct or indirect interest and that is the highest transitional subsidiary (or subsidiaries) in a chain of members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The principles of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P forms S with $200 on January 1, 1985, and S becomes a member of the P group. On February 1, 1987, S buys all the stock of T, and T buys all the stock of T1, and both T and T1 become members of the P group. On January 1, 1988, P sells all the stock of S and recognizes a $90 loss on the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section, both T and T1 are transitional subsidiaries, because they became members of the P group after January 6, 1987.

Assume all the T stock would have been sold for a $90 loss and that all the loss would be attributable to the recognition of built-in gain from the disposition of assets.

Assume that all the

T stock would have been sold for a $50 loss, all the T1 stock of a $40 loss, and that the entire amount of each loss would be attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of assets.

P, the common parent of a group, owns all the stock of T, a transitional subsidiary. On January 1, 1989, T merges into S, a wholly owned subsidiary of P that is not a transitional subsidiary.

Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to loss with respect to the disposition of stock of a subsidiary, to the extent that, as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement, gain is taken into account by members with respect to stock of the same subsidiary having the same material terms. If the gain to which this paragraph applies is less than the amount of the loss with respect to the

disposition of the subsidiary's stock, the gain is applied to offset loss with respect to each share disposed of as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement in proportion to the amount of the loss deduction that would have been disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section with respect to such share before the application of this paragraph (a)(4). If the same item of gain could be taken into account more than once in limiting the application of paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of this section, the item is taken into account only once.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Basis reduction on deconsolidation--(1) General rule. If the basis of a member of a consolidated group in a share of stock of a subsidiary exceeds its value immediately before a deconsolidation of the share, the basis of the share is reduced at that time to an amount equal to its value. If both a disposition and a deconsolidation occur with respect to a share in the same transaction, paragraph (a) of this section applies and, to the extent necessary to effectuate the purposes of this section, this paragraph (b) applies following the application of paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule.

Value means fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Netting. Paragraph (b)(1) of this section does not apply to reduce the basis of stock of a subsidiary, to the extent that, as a consequence of the same plan or arrangement, gain is taken into account by members with respect to stock of the same subsidiary having the same material terms.

This paragraph (c) applies with respect to stock of a subsidiary only if a separate statement entitled Sec. 1.337(d)-2(c) statement is included with the return in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> General rule. Loss is not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section and basis is not reduced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section to the extent the taxpayer establishes that the loss or basis is not attributable to the recognition of built-in gain, net of directly related expenses, on the disposition of an asset (including stock and securities). Loss or basis may be attributable to the recognition of built-in gain on the disposition of an asset by a prior group. For purposes of this section, gain recognized on the disposition of an asset is built-in gain to the extent attributable, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, to any excess of value over basis that is reflected, before the disposition of the asset, in the basis of the share, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, after applying section 1503(e) and other applicable provisions of the Internal Revenue Code and regulations. Federal income taxes may be directly related to built-in gain recognized on the disposition of an asset only to the extent of the excess (if any) of the group's income tax liability actually imposed under Subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code for the taxable year of the disposition of the asset over the group's income tax liability for the taxable year redetermined by not taking into account the built-in gain recognized on the disposition of the asset. For this purpose, the group's income tax liability actually imposed and its redetermined income tax liability are determined without taking into account the foreign tax credit under section 27(a) of the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contents of statement and time of filing. The statement required under paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be included with or as part of the taxpayer's return for the year of the disposition or deconsolidation and must contain--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and employer identification number (E.I.N.) of the subsidiary; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of the loss not disallowed under paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of this paragraph (c) and the amount of basis not reduced under paragraph (b)(1) of this section by reason of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The principles of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section are illustrated by the examples in Sec. Sec. 1.337(d)-1(a)(5) and 1.1502-20(a)(5) (other than Examples 3, 4, and 5) and (b), with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of Sec. 1.1502-20, and by the following example. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, the group files consolidated returns on a calendar year basis, the facts set forth the only corporate activity, and all sales and purchases are with unrelated buyers or sellers. The basis of each asset is the same for determining earnings and profits adjustments and taxable income. Tax liability and its effect on basis, value, and earnings and profits are disregarded. Investment adjustment system means the rules of Sec. 1.1502-32. The example reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P buys all the stock of T for $50 in Year 1, and T becomes a member of the P group. T has 2 assets. Asset 1 has a basis of $50 and a value of $0, and asset 2 has a basis of $0 and a value of $50. T sells asset 2 during Year 3 for $50 and recognizes a $50 gain. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock increased to $100 as a result of the recognition of gain. In Year 5, all of the stock of P is acquired by the P1 group, and the former members of the P group become members of the P1 group. T then sells asset 1 for $0, and recognizes a $50 loss. Under the investment adjustment system, P's basis in the T stock decreases to $50 as a result of the loss. T's assets decline in value from $50 to $40. P then sells all the stock of T for $40 and recognizes a $10 loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> P's basis in the T stock reflects both T's unrecognized gain and unrecognized loss with respect to its assets. The gain T recognizes on the disposition of asset 2 is built-in gain with respect to both the P and P1 groups for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In addition, the loss T recognizes on the disposition of asset 1 is built-in loss with respect to the P and P1 groups for purposes of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. T's recognition of the built-in loss while a member of the P1 group offsets the effect on T's stock basis of T's recognition of the built-in gain while a member of the P group. Thus, P's $10 loss on the sale of the T stock is not attributable to the recognition of built-in gain, and the loss is therefore not disallowed under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The result would be the same if, instead of having a $50 built-in loss in asset 1 when it becomes a member of the P group, T has a $50 net operating loss carryover and the carryover is used by the P group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Successors. For purposes of this section, the rules and examples of Sec. 1.1502-20(d) apply, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of Sec. 1.1502-20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Anti-avoidance rules. For purposes of this section, the rules and examples of Sec. 1.1502-20(e) apply, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of Sec. 1.1502-20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Investment adjustments. For purposes of this section, the rules and examples of Sec. 1.1502-20(f) apply, with appropriate adjustments to reflect differences between the approach of this section and that of Sec. 1.1502-20.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective dates. This section applies with respect to dispositions and deconsolidations on or after March 3, 2005. In addition, this section applies to dispositions and deconsolidations for which an election is made under Sec. 1.1502-20(i)(2) to determine allowable loss under this section. If loss is recognized because stock of a subsidiary became worthless, the disposition with respect to the stock is treated as occurring on the date the stock became worthless. For dispositions and deconsolidations after March 6, 2002 and before March 3, 2005, see Sec. 1.337(d)-2T as contained in the 26 CFR part 1 in effect on March 2, 2005.

For example, if a State, a political subdivision thereof, or an entity any portion of whose income is excluded from gross income under section 115, acquires the stock of a taxable corporation and thereafter any of the taxable corporation's income is excluded from gross income under section 115, the taxable corporation will be treated as if it transferred all of its assets to a tax-exempt entity immediately before the stock acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exceptions for certain changes in status--(i) To whom available.

Sec. 1.337(d)-5  Old transitional rules imposing tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Treatment of C corporations--(1) Scope. This section applies to the net built-in gain of C corporation assets that become assets of a RIC or REIT by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This section applies to the net built-in gain of C corporation assets that become assets of a RIC or REIT by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transfer of assets of a C corporation to a RIC or REIT in a transaction in which the basis of such assets are determined by reference to the C corporation's basis (a carryover basis).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Net built-in gain. Net built-in gain is the excess of aggregate gains (including items of income) over aggregate losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> General rule. Unless an election is made pursuant to paragraph (b) of this

section, the C corporation will be treated, for all purposes including recognition of net built-in gain, as if it had sold all of its assets at their respective fair market values on the deemed liquidation date described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section and immediately liquidated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Loss. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall not apply if its application would result in the recognition of net built-in loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Basis adjustment. If a corporation is subject to corporate-level tax under paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the bases of the assets in the hands of the RIC or REIT will be adjusted to reflect the recognized net built-in gain. This adjustment is made by taking the C corporation's basis in each asset, and, as appropriate, increasing it by the amount of any built-in gain attributable to that asset, or decreasing it by the amount of any built-in loss attributable to that asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exception--(i) In general. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply to any C corporation that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (a)(3) of this section does not apply to any C corporation that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Immediately prior to qualifying to be taxed as a RIC was subject to tax as a C corporation for a period not exceeding one taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Immediately prior to being subject to tax as a C corporation was subject to the RIC tax provisions for a period of at least one taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Additional requirement. The exception described in paragraph (a)(6)(i) of this section applies only to assets acquired by the corporation during the year when it was subject to tax as a C corporation in a transaction that does not result in its basis in the asset being determined by reference to a corporate transferor's basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Deemed liquidation date--(i) Conversions. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the deemed liquidation date is the last day of its last taxable year before the taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conversions. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the deemed liquidation date is the last day of its last taxable year before the taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover basis transfers. In the case of a C corporation that transfers property to a RIC or REIT in a carryover basis transaction, the deemed liquidation date is the day before the date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 1374 treatment--(1) In general. Paragraph (a) of this section will not apply if the transferee RIC or REIT elects (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to be subject to the rules of section 1374, and the regulations thereunder. The electing RIC or REIT will be subject to corporate-level taxation on the built-in gain recognized during the 10-year period on assets formerly held by the transferor C corporation. The built-in gains of electing RICs and REITs, and the corporate-level tax imposed on such gains, are subject to rules similar to the rules relating to net income from foreclosure property of REITs. See sections 857(a)(1)(A)(ii), and 857(b)(2)(B), (D), and (E). An election made under this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Paragraph (a) of this section will not apply if the transferee RIC or REIT elects (as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section) to be subject to the rules of section 1374, and the regulations thereunder. The electing RIC or REIT will be subject to corporate-level taxation on the built-in gain recognized during the 10-year period on assets formerly held by the transferor C corporation. The built-in gains of electing RICs and REITs, and the corporate-level tax imposed on such gains, are subject to rules similar to the rules relating to net income from foreclosure property of REITs. See sections 857(a)(1)(A)(ii), and 857(b)(2)(B), (D), and (E). An election made under this paragraph (b) shall be irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ten-year recognition period. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the 10-year recognition period described in section 1374(d)(7) begins on the first day of the RIC's or REIT's taxable year for which the corporation qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT. In the case of a C corporation that transfers property to a RIC or REIT in a carryover basis transaction, the 10-year recognition period begins on the day the assets are acquired by the RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Making the election. A RIC or REIT validly makes a section 1374 election with the following statement: ``[Insert name and employer identification number of electing RIC or REIT] elects under paragraph (b) of this section to be subject to the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder with respect to its assets which formerly were held by a C corporation, [insert name and employer identification number of the C corporation, if different from name and employer identification number of RIC or REIT].'' This statement must be signed by an official authorized to sign the income tax return of the RIC or REIT and attached to the RIC's or REIT's Federal income tax return for the first taxable year in which the assets of the C corporation become assets of the RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rule. In cases where the first taxable year in which the assets of the C corporation become assets of the RIC or REIT ends after June 10, 1987 but before March 8, 2000, the section

1374 election may be filed with the first Federal income tax return filed by the RIC or REIT after March 8, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. In the case of carryover basis transactions involving the transfer of property of a C corporation to a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to transactions occurring on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. In the case of a C corporation that qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT, the regulations apply to such qualifications that are effective for taxable years beginning on or after June 10, 1987, and before January 2, 2002. However, RICs and REITs that are subject to section 1374 treatment under this section may not rely on paragraph (b)(1) of this section, but must apply paragraphs (c)(1)(i), (c)(2)(i), (c)(2)(ii), and (c)(3) of Sec. 1.337(d)-6, with respect to built-in gains and losses recognized in taxable years beginning on or after January 2, 2002. In lieu of applying this section, taxpayers may rely on Sec. 1.337(d)-6 to determine the tax consequences (for all taxable years) of any conversion transaction. For transactions and qualifications that occur on or after January 2, 2002, see Sec. 1.337(d)-7.

Sec. 1.337(d)-6  New transitional rules imposing tax on property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule--(1) Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. If property owned by a C corporation (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) becomes the property of a RIC or REIT (the converted property) in a conversion transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), then deemed sale treatment will apply as described in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the RIC or REIT elects section 1374 treatment with respect to the conversion transaction as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for exceptions to this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. If property owned by a C corporation (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) becomes the property of a RIC or REIT (the converted property) in a conversion transaction (as defined in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section), then deemed sale treatment will apply as described in paragraph (b) of this section, unless the RIC or REIT elects section 1374 treatment with respect to the conversion transaction as provided in paragraph (c) of this section. See paragraph (d) of this section for exceptions to this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions--(i) C corporation. For purposes of this section, the term C corporation has the meaning provided in section 1361(a)(2) except that the term does not include a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C corporation. For purposes of this section, the term C corporation has the meaning provided in section 1361(a)(2) except that the term does not include a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conversion transaction. For purposes of this section, the term conversion transaction means the qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT or the transfer of property owned by a C corporation to a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Deemed sale treatment--(1) In general. If property owned by a C corporation becomes the property of a RIC or REIT in a conversion transaction, then the C corporation recognizes gain and loss as if it sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). This paragraph (b) does not apply if its application would result in the recognition of a net loss. For this purpose, net loss is the excess of aggregate losses over aggregate gains (including items of income), without regard to character.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If property owned by a C corporation becomes the property of a RIC or REIT in a conversion transaction, then the C corporation recognizes gain and loss as if it sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section). This paragraph (b) does not apply if its application would result in the recognition of a net loss. For this purpose, net loss is the excess of aggregate losses over aggregate gains (including items of income), without regard to character.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Basis adjustment. If a corporation recognizes a net gain under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, then the converted property has a basis in the hands of the RIC or REIT equal to the fair market value of such property on the deemed sale date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deemed sale date--(i) RIC or REIT qualifications. If the conversion transaction is a qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT, then the deemed sale date is the end of the last day of the C corporation's last taxable year before the first taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> RIC or REIT qualifications. If the conversion transaction is a qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT, then the deemed sale date is the end of the last day of the C corporation's last taxable year before the first taxable year in which it qualifies to be taxed as a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other conversion transactions. If the conversion transaction is a transfer of property owned by a C corporation to a RIC or REIT, then the deemed sale date is the end of the day before the day of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar-year taxpayer, has qualified as a RIC since January 1, 1991. On May 31, 1994, Y, a C corporation and calendar-year taxpayer, transfers all of its property to X in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C). X does not elect section 1374 treatment under paragraph (c) of this section and chooses not to rely on Sec. 1.337(d)-5. As a result of the

transfer, Y is subject to deemed sale treatment under this paragraph (b) on its tax return for the short taxable year ending May 31, 1994. On May 31, 1994, Y's only assets are Capital Asset, which has a fair market value of $100,000 and a basis of $40,000 as of the end of May 30, 1994, and $50,000 cash. Y also has an unrestricted net operating loss carryforward of $12,000 and accumulated earnings and profits of $50,000. Y has no taxable income for the short taxable year ending May 31, 1994, other than gain recognized under this paragraph (b). In 1997, X sells Capital Asset for $110,000. Assume the applicable corporate tax rate is 35%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under this paragraph (b), Y is treated as if it sold the converted property (Capital Asset and $50,000 cash) at fair market value on May 30, 1994, recognizing $60,000 of gain ($150,000 amount realized--$90,000 basis). Y must report the gain on its tax return for the short taxable year ending May 31, 1994. Y may offset this gain with its $12,000 net operating loss carryforward and will pay tax of $16,800 (35% of $48,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under section 381, X succeeds to Y's accumulated earnings and profits. Y's accumulated earnings and profits of $50,000 increase by $60,000 and decrease by $16,800 as a result of the deemed sale. Thus, the aggregate amount of subchapter C earnings and profits that must be distributed to satisfy section 852(a)(2)(B) is $93,200 ($50,000 + $60,000 - $16,800). X's basis in Capital Asset is $100,000. On X's sale of Capital Asset in 1997, X recognizes $10,000 of gain, which is taken into account in computing X's net capital gain for purposes of section 852(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election of section 1374 treatment--(1) In general--(i) Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the RIC or REIT that was formerly a C corporation or that acquired property from a C corporation makes the election described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A RIC or REIT that makes such an election will be subject to tax on the net built-in gain in the converted property under the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by this paragraph (c), as if the RIC or REIT were an S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general--(i) Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the RIC or REIT that was formerly a C corporation or that acquired property from a C corporation makes the election described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A RIC or REIT that makes such an election will be subject to tax on the net built-in gain in the converted property under the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by this paragraph (c), as if the RIC or REIT were an S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Property owned by a C corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the RIC or REIT that was formerly a C corporation or that acquired property from a C corporation makes the election described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section. A RIC or REIT that makes such an election will be subject to tax on the net built-in gain in the converted property under the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder, as modified by this paragraph (c), as if the RIC or REIT were an S corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, REIT, or S corporation that becomes property of a RIC or REIT. If property subject to the rules of section 1374 owned by a RIC, a REIT, or an S corporation (the predecessor) becomes the property of a RIC or REIT (the successor) in a continuation transaction, the rules of section 1374 apply to the successor to the same extent that the predecessor was subject to the rules of section 1374 with respect to such property, and the 10-year recognition period of the successor with respect to such property is reduced by the portion of the 10-year recognition period of the predecessor that expired before the date of the continuation transaction. For this purpose, a continuation transaction means the qualification of the predecessor as a RIC or REIT or the transfer of property from the predecessor to the successor in a transaction in which the successor's basis in the transferred property is determined, in whole or in part, by reference to the predecessor's basis in that property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Modification of section 1374 treatment--(i) Net recognized built-in gain for REITs--(A) Prelimitation amount. The prelimitation amount determined as provided in Sec. 1.1374-2(a)(1) is reduced by the portion of such amount, if any, that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(4), (5), (6), or (7). For this purpose, the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Net recognized built-in gain for REITs--(A) Prelimitation amount. The prelimitation amount determined as provided in Sec. 1.1374-2(a)(1) is reduced by the portion of such amount, if any, that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(4), (5), (6), or (7). For this purpose, the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Where the tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed by reference to section 857(b)(5)(A), the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is the tax imposed by section 857(b)(5) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of recognized built-in gain (without regard to recognized built-in loss and recognized built-in gain from prohibited transactions) that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2) and the denominator of which is the gross income (without regard to gross income from prohibited transactions) of the REIT that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where the tax under section 857(b)(5) is computed by reference to section 857(b)(5)(B), the amount of a REIT's recognized built-in gain that is subject to tax under section 857(b)(5) is the tax imposed by section 857(b)(5) multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the amount of recognized built-in gain (without regard to recognized built-in loss and recognized built-

in gain from prohibited transactions) that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3) and the denominator of which is the gross income (without regard to gross income from prohibited transactions) of the REIT that is not derived from sources referred to in section 856(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Taxable income limitation. The taxable income limitation determined as provided in Sec. 1.1374-2(a)(2) is reduced by an amount equal to the tax imposed under sections 857(b)(5), (6), and (7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Loss carryforwards, credits and credit carryforwards--(A) Loss carryforwards. Consistent with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards arising in taxable years for which the corporation that generated the loss was not subject to subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain to the extent allowed under section 1374 and the regulations thereunder. Such loss carryforwards must be used as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year to the greatest extent possible before such losses can be used to reduce other investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b) or other real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b) for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Loss carryforwards. Consistent with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, net operating loss carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards arising in taxable years for which the corporation that generated the loss was not subject to subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain to the extent allowed under section 1374 and the regulations thereunder. Such loss carryforwards must be used as a deduction against net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year to the greatest extent possible before such losses can be used to reduce other investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b) or other real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b) for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Credits and credit carryforwards. Consistent with paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, minimum tax credits and business credit carryforwards arising in taxable years for which the corporation that generated the credit was not subject to subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code are allowed to reduce the tax imposed on net recognized built-in gain under this paragraph (c) to the extent allowed under section 1374 and the regulations thereunder. Such credits and credit carryforwards must be used to reduce the tax imposed under this paragraph (c) on net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year to the greatest extent possible before such credits and credit carryforwards can be used to reduce the tax, if any, on other investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b) or on other real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b) for that taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 10-year recognition period. In the case of a conversion transaction that is a qualification of a C corporation as a RIC or REIT, the 10-year recognition period described in section 1374(d)(7) begins on the first day of the RIC's or REIT's first taxable year. In the case of other conversion transactions, the 10-year recognition period begins on the day the property is acquired by the RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coordination with subchapter M rules--(i) Recognized built-in gains and losses subject to subchapter M. Recognized built-in gains and losses of a RIC or REIT are included in computing investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b)(2), real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b)(2), capital gains for purposes of sections 852(b)(3) and 857(b)(3), gross income derived from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States for purposes of section 853, and the dividends paid deduction for purposes of sections 852(b)(2)(D), 852(b)(3)(A), 857(b)(2)(B), and 857(b)(3)(A). In computing such income and deduction items, capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards that are used by the RIC or REIT to reduce recognized built-in gains are allowed as a deduction, but only to the extent that they are otherwise allowable as a deduction against such income under the Internal Revenue Code (including section 852(b)(2)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Recognized built-in gains and losses subject to subchapter M. Recognized built-in gains and losses of a RIC or REIT are included in computing investment company taxable income for purposes of section 852(b)(2), real estate investment trust taxable income for purposes of section 857(b)(2), capital gains for purposes of sections 852(b)(3) and 857(b)(3), gross income derived from sources within any foreign country or possession of the United States for purposes of section 853, and the dividends paid deduction for purposes of sections 852(b)(2)(D), 852(b)(3)(A), 857(b)(2)(B), and 857(b)(3)(A). In computing such income and deduction items, capital loss carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards that are used by the RIC or REIT to reduce recognized built-in gains are allowed as a deduction, but only to the extent that they are otherwise allowable as a deduction against such income under the Internal Revenue Code (including section 852(b)(2)(B)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of tax imposed. The amount of tax imposed under this paragraph (c) on net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year is treated as a loss sustained by the RIC or the REIT during such taxable year. The character of the loss is determined by allocating the tax proportionately (based on recognized built-in gain) among the items of recognized built-in gain included in net recognized built-in gain. With respect to RICs, the tax imposed under this paragraph (c) on net recognized built-in gain is treated as attributable to the portion of the RIC's taxable year occurring after October 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Making the section 1374 election--(i) In general. A RIC or REIT makes a section 1374 election with the following

statement: ``[Insert name and employer identification number of electing RIC or REIT] elects under Sec. 1.337-6(c) to be subject to the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder with respect to its property that formerly was held by a C corporation, [insert name and employer identification number of the C corporation, if different from name and employer identification number of the RIC or REIT].'' However, a RIC or REIT need not file an election under this paragraph (c), but will be deemed to have made such an election if it can demonstrate that it informed the Internal Revenue Service prior to January 2, 2002 of its intent to make a section 1374 election. An election under this paragraph (c) is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A RIC or REIT makes a section 1374 election with the following

statement: ``[Insert name and employer identification number of electing RIC or REIT] elects under Sec. 1.337-6(c) to be subject to the rules of section 1374 and the regulations thereunder with respect to its property that formerly was held by a C corporation, [insert name and employer identification number of the C corporation, if different from name and employer identification number of the RIC or REIT].'' However, a RIC or REIT need not file an election under this paragraph (c), but will be deemed to have made such an election if it can demonstrate that it informed the Internal Revenue Service prior to January 2, 2002 of its intent to make a section 1374 election. An election under this paragraph (c) is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time for making the election. An election under this paragraph (c) may be filed by the RIC or REIT with any Federal income tax return filed by the RIC or REIT on or before September 15, 2003, provided that the RIC or REIT has reported consistently with such election for all periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a C corporation that is a calendar-year taxpayer, elects to be taxed as a REIT on its 1994 tax return, which it files on March 15, 1995. As a result, X is a REIT for its 1994 taxable year and would be subject to deemed sale treatment under paragraph (b) of this section but for X's timely election of section 1374 treatment under this paragraph (c). X chooses not to rely on Sec. 1.337(d)-5. As of the beginning of the 1994 taxable year, X's property consisted of Real Property, which is not section 1221(a)(1) property and which had a fair market value of $100,000 and an adjusted basis of $80,000, and $25,000 cash. X also had accumulated earnings and profits of $25,000, unrestricted capital loss carryforwards of $3,000, and unrestricted business credit carryforwards of $2,000. On July 1, 1997, X sells Real Property for $110,000. For its 1997 taxable year, X has no other income or deduction items. Assume the highest corporate tax rate is 35%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon its election to be taxed as a REIT, X retains its $80,000 basis in Real Property and its $25,000 accumulated earnings and profits. X retains its $3,000 of capital loss carryforwards and its $2,000 of business credit carryforwards. To satisfy section 857(a)(2)(B), X must distribute $25,000, an amount equal to its earnings and profits accumulated in non-REIT years, to its shareholders by the end of its 1994 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon X's sale of Real Property in 1997, X recognizes gain of $30,000 ($110,000--$80,000). X's recognized built-in gain for purposes of applying section 1374 is $20,000 ($100,000 fair market value as of the beginning of X's first taxable year as a REIT--$80,000 basis). Because X's $30,000 of net income for the 1997 taxable year exceeds the net recognized built-in gain of $20,000, the taxable income limitation does not apply. X, therefore, has $20,000 net recognized built-in gain for the year. Assuming that X has not used its $3,000 of capital loss carryforwards in a prior taxable year and that their use is allowed under section 1374(b)(2) and Sec. 1.1374-5, X is allowed a $3,000 deduction against the $20,000 net recognized built-in gain. X would owe tax of $5,950 (35% of $17,000) on its net recognized built-in gain, except that X may use its $2,000 of business credit carryforwards to reduce this tax, assuming that X has not used the credit carryforwards in a prior taxable year and that their use is allowed under section 1374(b)(3) and Sec. 1.1374-6.

The amount of tax imposed under this paragraph (b) on net recognized built-in gain for a taxable year is treated as a loss sustained by the RIC or the REIT during such taxable year. The character of the loss is determined by allocating the tax proportionately (based on recognized built-in gain) among the items of recognized built-in gain included in net recognized built-in gain. With respect to RICs, the tax imposed under this paragraph (b) on net recognized built-in gain is treated as attributable to the portion of the RIC's taxable year occurring after October 31.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a C corporation that is a calendar-year taxpayer, elects to be taxed as a REIT on its 2004 tax return, which it files on March 15, 2005. As a result, X is a REIT for its 2004 taxable year and is subject to section 1374 treatment under this paragraph (b). X does not elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section. As of the beginning of the 2004 taxable year, X's property consisted of Real Property, which is not section 1221(a)(1) property and which had a fair market value of $100,000 and an adjusted basis of $80,000, and $25,000 cash. X also had accumulated earnings and profits of $25,000, unrestricted capital loss carryforwards of $3,000, and unrestricted business credit carryforwards of $2,000. On July 1, 2007, X sells Real Property for $110,000. For its 2007 taxable year, X has no other income or deduction items. Assume the highest corporate tax rate is 35%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon its election to be taxed as a REIT, X retains its $80,000 basis in Real Property and its $25,000 accumulated earnings and profits. X retains its $3,000 of capital loss carryforwards and its $2,000 of business credit carryforwards. To satisfy section 857(a)(2)(B), X must distribute $25,000, an amount equal to its earnings and profits accumulated in non-REIT years, to its shareholders by the end of its 2004 taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Upon X's sale of Real Property in 2007, X recognizes gain of $30,000 ($110,000--$80,000). X's recognized built-in gain for purposes of applying section 1374 is $20,000 ($100,000 fair market value as of the beginning of X's first taxable year as a REIT--$80,000 basis). Because X's $30,000 of net income for the 2007 taxable year exceeds the net recognized built-in gain of $20,000, the taxable income limitation does not apply. X, therefore, has $20,000 net recognized built-in gain for the year. Assuming that X has not used its $3,000 of capital loss carryforwards in a prior taxable year and that their use is allowed under section 1374(b)(2) and Sec. 1.1374-5, X is allowed a $3,000 deduction against the $20,000 net recognized built-in gain. X would owe tax of $5,950 (35% of $17,000) on its net recognized built-in gain, except that X may use its $2,000 of business credit carryforwards to reduce the tax, assuming that X has not used the credit carryforwards in a prior taxable year and that their use is allowed under section 1374(b)(3) and Sec. 1.1374-6. Thus, X owes tax of $3,950 under this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of subchapter M of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code, X's earnings and profits for the year increase by $26,050 ($30,000 capital gain on the sale of

Real Property--$3,950 tax under this paragraph (b)). For purposes of section 857(b)(2) and (b)(3), X's net capital gain for the year is $23,050 ($30,000 capital gain reduced by $3,000 capital loss carryforward and further reduced by $3,950 tax).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election of deemed sale treatment--(1) In general. Paragraph (b) of this section does not apply if the C corporation that qualifies as a RIC or REIT or transfers property to a RIC or REIT makes the election described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A C corporation that makes such an election recognizes gain and loss as if it sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). See paragraph (c)(4) of this section concerning limitations on the use of loss in computing gain. This paragraph (c) does not apply if its application would result in the recognition of a net loss.

This statement must be attached to the Federal income tax return of the C corporation or partnership for the taxable year in which the deemed sale occurs. An election under this paragraph (c) is irrevocable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X, a calendar-year taxpayer, has qualified as a RIC since January 1, 2001. On May 31, 2004, Y, a C corporation and calendar-year taxpayer, transfers all of its property to X in a transaction that qualifies as a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(C). As a result of the transfer, Y would be subject to section 1374 treatment under paragraph (b) of this section but for its timely election of deemed sale treatment under this paragraph (c). As a result of such election, Y is subject to deemed sale treatment on its tax return for the short taxable year ending May 31, 2004. On May 31, 2004, Y's only assets are Capital Asset, which has a fair market value of $100,000 and a basis of $40,000 as of the end of May 30, 2004, and $50,000 cash. Y also has an unrestricted net operating loss carryforward of $12,000 and accumulated

earnings and profits of $50,000. Y has no taxable income for the short taxable year ending May 31, 2004, other than gain recognized under this paragraph (c). In 2007, X sells Capital Asset for $110,000. Assume the applicable corporate tax rate is 35%.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under this paragraph (c), Y is treated as if it sold the converted property (Capital Asset and $50,000 cash) at fair market value on May 30, 2004, recognizing $60,000 of gain ($150,000 amount realized--$90,000 basis). Y must report the gain on its tax return for the short taxable year ending May 31, 2004. Y may offset this gain with its $12,000 net operating loss carryforward and will pay tax of $16,800 (35% of $48,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under section 381, X succeeds to Y's accumulated earnings and profits. Y's accumulated earnings and profits of $50,000 increase by $60,000 and decrease by $16,800 as a result of the deemed sale. Thus, the aggregate amount of subchapter C earnings and profits that must be distributed to satisfy section 852(a)(2)(B) is $93,200 ($50,000 + $60,000-$16,800). X's basis in Capital Asset is $100,000.

Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii) and (iii) of this section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to any corporation that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Immediately prior to qualifying to be taxed as a RIC or REIT was subject to tax as a C corporation for a period not exceeding two taxable years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Immediately prior to being subject to tax as a C corporation was subject to tax as a RIC or REIT for a period of at least one taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Property acquired from another corporation while a C corporation. The exception described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply to property acquired by the corporation while it was subject to tax as a C corporation from any person in a transaction that results in the acquirer's basis in the property being determined by reference to a C corporation's basis in the property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> RICs and REITs previously subject to section 1374 treatment. If the RIC or REIT had property subject to paragraph (b) of this section before the RIC or REIT became subject to tax as a C corporation as described in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, then paragraph (b) of this section applies to the RIC or REIT upon its requalification as a RIC or REIT, except that the 10-year recognition period with respect to such property is reduced by the portion of the 10-year recognition period that expired before the RIC or REIT became subject to tax as a C corporation and by the period of time that the corporation was subject to tax as a C corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rules for like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions--(i) In general. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a conversion transaction to the extent that a C corporation transfers property with a built-in gain to a RIC or REIT, and the C corporation's gain is not recognized by reason of either section 1031 or 1033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a conversion transaction to the extent that a C corporation transfers property with a built-in gain to a RIC or REIT, and the C corporation's gain is not recognized by reason of either section 1031 or 1033.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clarification regarding exchanged property previously subject to section 1374 treatment. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, if, in a transaction described in paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section, a RIC or REIT surrenders property that was subject to section 1374 treatment immediately prior to the transaction, the rules of section 1374(d)(6) will apply to continue section 1374 treatment to the replacement property acquired by the RIC or REIT in the transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The rules of this paragraph (d)(3) are illustrated by the following examples. In each of the examples, X is a REIT, Y is a C corporation, and X and Y are not related.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X owned a building that it leased for commercial use (Property A). Y owned a building leased for commercial use (Property B). On January 1, Year 3, Y transferred Property B to X in exchange for Property A in a nonrecognition transaction under section 1031(a). Immediately before the exchange, Properties A and B each had a value of $100, X had an adjusted basis of $60 in Property A, Y had an adjusted basis of $70 in Property B, and X was not subject to section 1374 treatment with respect to Property A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The transfer of property (Property B) by Y (a C corporation) to X (a REIT) is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The conversion transaction is a nonrecognition transaction under section 1031(a) as to Y; thus, Y does not recognize any of its $30 gain. Therefore, the conversion transaction is not subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that X had acquired Property A in a conversion transaction in Year 2, and immediately before the Year 3 exchange X was subject to section 1374 treatment with respect to $25 of net built-in gain in Property A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The Year 3 transfer of Property B by Y to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The conversion transaction is a nonrecognition transaction under section 1031(a) as to Y; thus, Y does not recognize any of its $30 gain. Therefore, the Year 3 transfer is not subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section. However, X had been subject to section 1374 treatment with respect to $25 of net built-in gain in Property A immediately before the Year 3 transfer, and X's basis in Property B is determined (in whole or in part) by reference to its adjusted basis in Property A. Accordingly, the rules of section 1374(d)(6) apply and X is subject to section 1374 treatment on Property B with respect to the $25 net built-in gain. See paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that immediately before the Year 3 exchange Property A had a value of $92, and X transferred Property A and $8 to Y in exchange for Property B in a nonrecognition transaction under section 1031(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The transfer of Property B by Y to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. Pursuant to section 1031(b), Y recognizes $8 of its gain. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to the transaction to the extent of the $8 gain recognized by Y by reason of paragraph (d)(1) of this section, or to the extent of the $22 gain realized but not recognized by Y by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Y owned uninsured, improved property (Property 1) that was involuntarily converted (within the meaning of section 1033(a)) in a fire. Y sold Property 1 for $100 to X, which owned an adjacent property and wanted Property 1 for use as a parking lot. Y had a $70 basis in Property 1 immediately before the sale. Y elected to defer gain recognition under section 1033(a)(2), and purchased qualifying replacement property (Property 2) for $100 from an unrelated party prior to the expiration of the period described in section 1033(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The transfer of Property 1 by Y to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The conversion transaction (combined with Y's purchase of Property 2) is a nonrecognition transaction under section 1033(a) as to Y; thus, Y does not recognize any of its $30 gain. Therefore, the conversion transaction is not subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. X owned property (Property 1). On January 1, Year 2, Property 1 had a fair market value of $100 and a basis of $70, and X was not subject to section 1374 treatment with respect to Property 1. On that date, when Property 1 was under a threat of condemnation, X sold Property 1 to an unrelated party for $100 (First Transaction). X elected to defer gain recognition under section 1033(a)(2), and purchased qualifying replacement property (Property 2) for $100 from Y (Second Transaction) prior to the expiration of the period described in section 1033(a)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The transfer of Property 2 by Y to X in the Second Transaction is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section. The Second Transaction (combined with the First Transaction) is a nonrecognition transaction under section 1033(a) as to X, but not as to Y. Assume no nonrecognition provision applied to Y; thus, Y recognized gain or loss on its sale of Property 2 in the Second Transaction, and the Second Transaction is not subject to paragraph (a)(1) of this section by reason of paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule if C corporation is a tax-exempt entity. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to a conversion

transaction in which the C corporation that owned the converted property is a tax-exempt entity described in Sec. 1.337(d)-4(c)(2) to the extent that gain (if any) would not be subject to tax under Title 26 of the United States Code if a deemed sale election under paragraph (c)(5) of this section were made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for partnerships--(1) In general. The principles of this section apply to property transferred by a partnership to a RIC or REIT to the extent of any gain or loss in the converted property that would be allocated directly or indirectly, through one or more partnerships, to a C corporation if the partnership sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). If the partnership were to elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section in lieu of section 1374 treatment under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such transfer, then any net gain recognized by the partnership on the deemed sale must be allocated to the C corporation partner, but does not increase the capital account of any partner. Any adjustment to the partnership's basis in the RIC or REIT stock as a result of deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of that stock with respect to the C corporation partner only. The principles of section 743 apply to such basis adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The principles of this section apply to property transferred by a partnership to a RIC or REIT to the extent of any gain or loss in the converted property that would be allocated directly or indirectly, through one or more partnerships, to a C corporation if the partnership sold the converted property to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date (as defined in paragraph (c)(3) of this section). If the partnership were to elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section in lieu of section 1374 treatment under paragraph (b) of this section with respect to such transfer, then any net gain recognized by the partnership on the deemed sale must be allocated to the C corporation partner, but does not increase the capital account of any partner. Any adjustment to the partnership's basis in the RIC or REIT stock as a result of deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section shall constitute an adjustment to the basis of that stock with respect to the C corporation partner only. The principles of section 743 apply to such basis adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example; Transfer by partnership of property to REIT. (i) Facts. PRS, a partnership for Federal income tax purposes, has three partners: TE, a C corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section) that is also a tax-exempt entity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.337(d)-4(c)(2)), owns 50 percent of the capital and profits of PRS; A, an individual, owns 30 percent of the capital and profits of PRS; and Y, a C corporation (within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section), owns the remaining 20 percent. PRS owns a building that it leases for commercial use (Property 1). On January 1, Year 2, when PRS has an adjusted basis in Property 1 of $100 and Property 1 has a fair market value of $500, PRS transfers Property 1 to X, a REIT, in exchange for stock of X in an exchange described in section 351. PRS does not elect deemed sale treatment under paragraph (c) of this section. TE would not be subject to tax with respect to any gain that would be allocated to it if PRS had sold Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

The transfer of Property 1 by PRS to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of any gain or loss that would be allocated to any C corporation partner if PRS sold Property 1 at fair market value to an unrelated party on the deemed sale date. TE and Y are C corporations, but A is not a C corporation within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, the transfer of Property 1 by PRS to X is a conversion transaction within the meaning of paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section to the extent of the gain in Property 1 that would be allocated to TE and Y. Pursuant to paragraph (d)(4) of this section, paragraph (a)(1) of this section does not apply to the extent of the gain that would be allocated to TE if PRS had sold Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date. If PRS were to sell Property 1 to an unrelated party at fair market value on the deemed sale date, PRS would allocate $80 of built-in gain to Y. Thus, X is subject to section 1374 treatment on Property 1 with respect to $80 of built-in gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/Applicability date--(1) In general.
