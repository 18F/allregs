Sec. 303.6(c)(2) and 303.100;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of the timeframe at Sec. 303.101(b)(2)(i), in cases where the IV-D agency uses long-arm jurisdiction and disposition occurs within 12 months of service of process on the alleged father or noncustodial parent, the case may be counted as a success within the 6 month tier of the timeframe, regardless of when disposition occurs in the 12 month period following service of process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disposition, as used in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, means the date on which a support order is officially established and/or recorded or the action is dismissed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Safeguards. Under expedited processes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Paternities and orders established by means other than full judicial process must have the same force and effect under State law as paternities and orders established by full judicial process within the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The due process rights of the parties involved must be protected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The parties must be provided a copy of the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity, paternity determination, and/or support order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Action taken may be reviewed under the State's generally applicable administrative or judicial procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Functions.

A State may request an exemption from any of the requirements of this section for a political subdivision on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of paternity establishment, support order issuance or enforcement within the political subdivision in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 302.70(d) of this chapter.
