Alternatively, if the  article is destined for commercial sale in a box or container, the  statement may be printed on the box or container, or printed on a label  permanently affixed to the box or container, provided that, in either  case, the statement is prominently and legibly displayed. The operator  of the site of propagation of the nursery stock and the person offering  the plants for commercial sale are jointly responsible for all such  labeling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nursery stock produced within a quarantined area for planting in  a commercial citrus grove within that same area and moved directly to  that grove, without movement outside of the quarantined area, may be  moved without being labeled in accordance with paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nursery stock that will be moved interstate in accordance with  Sec. 301.76-7 may be moved without being labeled in accordance with  paragraph (a) of this section.
