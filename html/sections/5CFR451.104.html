For an employee receiving a  retained rate under 5 CFR part 536, subpart C (or similar authority,  such as 5 CFR 359.705), the rate of basic pay is the maximum payable  rate for the employee's grade or level, rather than the retained rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Programs for granting performance-based cash awards on the basis  of a rating of record at the fully successful level (or equivalent) or  above, as designed and applied, must make meaningful distinctions based  on levels of performance.
