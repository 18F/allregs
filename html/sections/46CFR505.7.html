The Chairman or  his or her designee may request that funds due and payable to a debtor  by another Federal agency be administratively offset in order to collect  a debt owed to the Commission by that debtor. In requesting  administrative offset, the Commission, as creditor, will certify in  writing to the Federal agency holding funds of the debtor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the debtor owes the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount and basis of the debt; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That the agency has complied with the requirements of 31 U.S.C.  3716, its own administrative offset regulations and the applicable  provisions of 4 CFR part 102 with respect to providing the debtor with  due process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requests for offset from other Federal agencies. Any Federal  agency may request that funds due and payable to its debtor by the  Commission be administratively offset in order to collect a debt owed to  such Federal agency by the debtor.
