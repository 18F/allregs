                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. The standards set forth in this subpart apply to the  suspension or termination of collection activity pursuant to 31 U.S.C.  3711 on debts that do not exceed $100,000, or such other amount as the  Attorney General may direct, exclusive of interest, penalties, and  administrative costs, after deducting the amount of partial payments or  collections, if any. Prior to referring a debt to Justice for  litigation, the Secretary may suspend or terminate collection under this  subpart with respect to debts arising out of activities of, or referred  or transferred for collection services to, the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, after deducting the amount of partial  payments or collections, the principal amount of the debt exceeds  $100,000, or such other amount as the Attorney General may direct,  exclusive of interest, penalties, and administrative costs, the  authority to suspend or terminate rests solely with Justice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Secretary believes that suspension or termination of any  debt in excess of $100,000 may be appropriate, the Secretary shall refer  the debt to the Civil Division or other appropriate litigating division  in Justice, using the CCLR. The referral will specify the reasons for  the Secretary's recommendation. If, prior to referral to Justice, the  Secretary determines that a debt is plainly erroneous or clearly without  merit, the Secretary may terminate collection activity regardless of the  amount involved without obtaining Justice concurrence.</p>
