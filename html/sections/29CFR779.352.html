Co. v. McComb 165 F. 2d. 65 (CA-6), certiorari denied, 333 U.S. 362); and (d) the exemption applies only where the telegraphic message revenue

does not exceed $500 a month. For purposes of this exemption only, in determining whether a retail or service establishment meets the percentage tests contained in section 13(a)(2) of the Act, the receipts from the telegraphic message agency will not be included.</p><p class="depth0">Classification of Sales and Establishments in Certain Industries</p>
