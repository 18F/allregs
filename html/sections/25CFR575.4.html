                            <p class="depth0">The Chairman may assess a civil fine, not to exceed $25,000 per violation, against a tribe, management contractor, or individual operating Indian gaming for each notice of violation issued under Sec. 573.3 of this chapter after considering the following factors:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Economic benefit of noncompliance. The Chairman shall consider the extent to which the respondent obtained an economic benefit from the noncompliance that gave rise to a notice of violation, as well as the likelihood of escaping detection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Chairman may consider the documented benefits derived from the noncompliance, or may rely on reasonable assumptions regarding such benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If noncompliance continues for more than one day, the Chairman may treat each daily illegal act or omission as a separate violation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Seriousness of the violation. The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine to reflect the seriousness of the violation. In doing so, the Chairman shall consider the extent to which the violation threatens the integrity of Indian gaming.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> History of violations. The Chairman may adjust a civil fine by an amount that reflects the respondent's history of violations over the preceding five (5) years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A violation cited by the Chairman shall not be considered unless the associated notice of violation is the subject of a final order of the Commission and has not been vacated; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each violation shall be considered whether or not it led to a civil fine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Negligence or willfulness. The Chairman may adjust the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of fault of the respondent in causing or failing to correct the violation, either through act or omission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Good faith. The Chairman may reduce the amount of a civil fine based on the degree of good faith of the respondent in attempting to achieve rapid compliance after notification of the violation.</p>
