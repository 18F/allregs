                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The certification averaging, banking, and trading provisions for  HC+NOX and NMHC+NOX emissions from eligible  engines are described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An engine family may use the averaging, banking and trading  provisions for HC+NOX and NMHC+NOX emissions if it  is subject to regulation under this part with certain exceptions  specified in paragraph (c) of this section. HC+NOX and  NMHC+NOX credits shall be interchangeable subject to the  limitations on credit generation, credit usage, and other provisions  described in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A manufacturer shall not include in its calculation of credit  generation and may exclude from its calculation of credit usage, any new  engines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Which are intended to be exported, unless the manufacturer has  reason or should have reason to believe that such engines have been or  will be imported in a piece of equipment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Which are subject to state engine emission standards pursuant to  a waiver granted by EPA under section 209(e) of the Act, unless the  manufacturer demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that  inclusion of these engines in averaging, banking and trading is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For an engine family using credits, a manufacturer may, at its  option, include its entire production of that engine family in its  calculation of credit usage for a given model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A manufacturer may certify engine families at Family  Emission Limits (FELs) above or below the applicable emission standard  subject to the limitation in paragraph (f) of this   section, provided the summation of the manufacturer's projected balance  of credits from all calculations and credit transactions for all engine  classes in a given model year is greater than or equal to zero, as  determined under Sec. 90.207. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, a  manufacturer may project a negative balance of credits as allowed under  Sec. 90.207(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A manufacturer of an engine family with an FEL exceeding the  applicable emission standard must obtain positive emission credits  sufficient to address the associated credit shortfall via averaging,  banking, or trading.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A nonhandheld engine family with an FEL below the applicable  emission standard may generate positive emission credits for averaging,  banking, or trading, or a combination thereof. A handheld engine family  with an FEL below the applicable emission standard may generate positive  emission credits for averaging or trading. A handheld engine family  meeting the requirements of Sec. 90.205(a)(4) or (5), whichever is  applicable, may generate positive emission credits for banking.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the case of a Selective Enforcement Audit (SEA) failure,  credits may be used to cover subsequent production of engines for the  family in question if the manufacturer elects to recertify to a higher  FEL. Credits may not be used to remedy a nonconformity determined by an  SEA, except that the Administrator may permit the use of credits to  address a nonconformity determined by an SEA where the use of such  credits is one component of a multi-part remedy for the previously  produced engines and the remedy, including the use of credits and the  quantity of credits being used, is such that the Administrator is  satisfied that the manufacturer has strong and lasting incentive to  accurately verify its new engine emission levels and will set or reset  its FELs for current and future model years so that production line  compliance is assured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In the case of a production line testing (PLT) failure pursuant  to subpart H of this part, a manufacturer may revise the FEL based upon  production line testing results obtained under subpart H of this part  and upon Administrator approval pursuant to Sec. 90.122(d). The  manufacturer may use credits to cover both past production and  subsequent production of the engines as needed as allowed under  Sec. 90.207(c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No Phase 2 engine family may have a HC + NOX FEL that  is greater than 32.2 g/kW-hr for Class I engines, 94 g/kW-hr for Class  I-A engines, 50 g/kW-hr for Class I-B engines, 26.8 g/kW-hr for Class II  engines, 336 g/kW-hr for Class III engines, 275 g/kW-hr for Class IV  engines, or 186 g/kW-hr for Class V engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credits generated in a given model year by an engine family  subject to the Phase 2 emission requirements may only be used in  averaging, banking or trading, as appropriate, for any other engine  family for which the Phase 2 requirements are applicable. Credits  generated in one model year may not be used for prior model years,  except as allowed under Sec. 90.207(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the 2005 model year and for each subsequent model year,  manufacturers of Class II engines must provide a demonstration that the  production weighted average FEL for HC+NOX (including  NMHC+NOX FELs), for all of the manufacturer's Class II  engines, will not exceed 13.6 g/kW-hr for the 2005 model year, 13.1 g/ kW-hr for the 2006 model year and 12.6 g/kW-hr for the 2007 and each  subsequent Phase 2 model year. Such demonstration shall be subject to  the review and approval of the Administrator, shall be provided at the  time of the first Class II certification of that model year and shall be  based on projected eligible production for that model year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Manufacturers must demonstrate compliance under the averaging,  banking, and trading provisions for a particular model year by 270 days  after the end of the model year. Except as provided in Sec. 90.207(c),  an engine family generating negative credits for which the manufacturer  does not obtain or generate an adequate number of positive credits by  that date from the same or previous model year engines will violate the  conditions of the certificate   of conformity. The certificate of conformity may be voided ab initio  pursuant to Sec. 90.123 for this engine family.
