                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. For return periods after September 30, 1992, any  taxpayer liable for firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under  this part may elect to remit payments and deposits of the taxes  (taxpayments) by electronic fund transfer (EFT). A taxpayer who elects  to make remittance by EFT must use that method of remitting excise taxes  on firearms and ammunition for a minimum of four consecutive calendar  quarters. A taxpayer who makes remittance by EFT for a calendar quarter  may not use any other method of remitting and ammunition excise taxes  for that quarter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On or before the 10th day of the calendar  quarter preceding the calendar quarter in which the taxpayer will begin  remitting taxes by EFT, each taxpayer who elects to make remittances by  EFT of firearms and ammunition excise taxes incurred under this part  shall give written notice to the appropriate TTB officer, indicating  that remittances will be paid by EFT. Taxpayers who gave written  notification in a previous calendar quarter electing to make remittances  of tax by EFT are not required to give additional written notifications  to continue remitting tax by EFT for succeeding calendar quarters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each deposit made or return filed in accordance with this  subpart, the taxpayer shall direct the taxpayer's financial institution  to make an EFT in the amount of the taxpayment to the Treasury Account  as provided in paragraph (e) of this section. The request will be made  to the financial institution early enough for the transfer of funds to  be made to the Treasury Account no later than the close of business on  the last day for making the deposit or filing the return as prescribed  in Sec. Sec. 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.153. The request will take into  account any time limit established by the financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Taxpayers who elect to discontinue making remittances by EFT of  firearms and ammunition excise taxes may make such election at any time  following four consecutive calendar quarters in which tax is remitted by  EFT. Taxpayers electing to discontinue making remittances by EFT shall  remit the tax with the next deposit or return as prescribed in  Sec. Sec. 53.157 or 53.159, and 53.151 for remittances not made by EFT  and notify the appropriate TTB officer by attaching a written  notification to the tax deposit form or return stating that remittance  of firearms and ammunition excise taxes will no longer be made by EFT.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Remittance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taxpayers who elect to make firearms and  ammunition excise taxpayments by EFT shall file the deposit form and/or  return with TTB in accordance with the applicable instructions on the  forms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remittances will be considered as made when the taxpayment by  EFT is received by the Treasury Account when it is paid to a Federal  Reserve Bank.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the taxpayer directs the financial institution to effect an  electronic fund transfer message as required by paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, the transfer data record furnished to the taxpayer through  normal banking procedures will serve as the record of payment and will  be retained as part of the required records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to make a taxpayment by EFT. The taxpayer is subject to  penalties imposed by 26 U.S.C. 6651 and 6656, as applicable, for failure  to make a payment or deposit of tax by EFT on or before the close of  business on the prescribed last day for making such payment or deposit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedure. Upon the notification required under paragraph (b)(1)  of this section, the appropriate TTB officer will issue to the taxpayer  an TTB Procedure entitled Payment of Tax by Electronic Fund Transfer.  This publication outlines the procedure a taxpayer follows when  preparing deposits,   returns and EFT remittances in accordance with this subpart.  [T.D. ATF-330, 57 FR 40326, Sept. 3, 1992, as amended by T.D. ATF-365,  60 FR 33671, June 28, 1995; T.D. ATF-447, 66 FR 19088, Apr. 13, 2001]</p>
