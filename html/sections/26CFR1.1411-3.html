The Federal income tax rate of the item of net investment income, to be used to determine the proper classification of that item within the appropriate income category as described in Sec. 1.664-1(d)(1)(i)(b), is the sum of the income tax rate applicable to that item under chapter 1 and the tax rate under section 1411.

See Sec. 1.1411-10(c) for special rules regarding CFCs, PFICs, and estates and trusts holding interests in such entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Undistributed net investment income. An estate's or trust's undistributed net investment income is the estate's or trust's net investment income reduced by distributions of net investment income to beneficiaries and by deductions under section 642(c) in the manner described in paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributions of net investment income to beneficiaries. (i) In computing the estate's or trust's undistributed net investment income, net investment income is reduced by distributions of net investment income made to beneficiaries. The deduction allowed under this paragraph (e)(3) is limited to the lesser of the amount deductible to the estate or trust under section 651 or section 661, as applicable, or the net investment income of the estate or trust. In the case of a deduction under section 651 or section 661 that consists of both net investment income and excluded income (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-1(d)(4)), the distribution must be allocated between net investment income and excluded income in a manner similar to Sec. 1.661(b)-1 as if net investment income constituted gross income and excluded income constituted amounts not includible in gross income. See Sec. 1.661(c)-1 and Example 1 in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In computing the estate's or trust's undistributed net investment income, net investment income is reduced by distributions of net investment income made to beneficiaries. The deduction allowed under this paragraph (e)(3) is limited to the lesser of the amount deductible to the estate or trust under section 651 or section 661, as applicable, or the net investment income of the estate or trust.

See Sec. 1.661(c)-1 and Example 1 in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If one or more items of net investment income comprise all or part of a distribution for which a deduction is allowed under paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section, such items retain their character as net investment income under section 652(b) or section 662(b), as applicable, for purposes of computing net investment income of the recipient of the distribution who is subject to tax under section 1411. The provisions of this paragraph (e)(3)(ii) also apply to distributions to United States beneficiaries of current year income described in section 652 or section 662, as applicable, from foreign estates and foreign nongrantor trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Deduction for amounts paid or permanently set aside for a charitable purpose. In computing the estate's or trust's undistributed net investment income, the estate or trust is allowed a deduction for amounts of net investment income that are allocated to amounts allowable under section 642(c). In the case of an estate or trust that has items of income consisting of both net investment income and excluded income, the allowable deduction under this paragraph (e)(4) must be allocated between net investment income and excluded income in accordance with Sec. 1.642(c)-2(b) as if net investment income constituted gross income and excluded income constituted amounts not includible in gross income. For an estate or trust with deductions under both sections 642(c) and 661, see Sec. 1.662(b)-2 and Example 2 in paragraph (e)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of this paragraph (e). In each example, Year 1 is a year in which section 1411 is in effect and the taxpayer is not a foreign estate or trust:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In Year 1, Trust has dividend income of $15,000, interest income of $10,000, capital gain of $5,000, and $75,000 of taxable income relating to a distribution from an individual retirement account (as defined under section 408). Trust has no expenses. Trust distributes $10,000 of its current year trust accounting income to A, a beneficiary of Trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Trust's distributable net income is $100,000 ($15,000 in dividends plus $10,000 in interest plus $75,000 of taxable income from an individual retirement account), from which the $10,000 distribution to A is paid. Trust's deduction under section 661 is $10,000. Under Sec. 1.662(b)-1, the deduction reduces each class of income comprising distributable net income on a proportional basis. The $10,000 distribution equals 10% of distributable net income ($10,000 divided by $100,000). Therefore, the distribution consists of dividend income

of $1,500, interest income of $1,000, and ordinary income attributable to the individual retirement account of $7,500. Because the $5,000 of capital gain allocated to principal for trust accounting purposes did not enter into distributable net income, no portion of that amount is included in the $10,000 distribution, nor does it qualify for the deduction under section 661.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trust's net investment income is $30,000 ($15,000 in dividends plus $10,000 in interest plus $5,000 in capital gain). Trust's $75,000 of taxable income attributable to the individual retirement account is excluded income under Sec. 1.1411-1(d)(4). Trust's undistributed net investment income under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is $27,500, which is Trust's net investment income ($30,000) less the amount of dividend income ($1,500) and interest income ($1,000) distributed to A. The $27,500 of undistributed net investment income is comprised of the capital gain allocated to principal ($5,000), the remaining undistributed dividend income ($13,500), and the remaining undistributed interest income ($9,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section and pursuant to Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1), A's net investment income includes dividend income of $1,500 and interest income of $1,000, but does not include the $7,500 of ordinary income attributable to the individual retirement account because it is excluded from net investment income under Sec. 1.1411-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as Example 1, except Trust is required to distribute $30,000 to A. In addition, Trust has a $10,000 deduction under section 642(c) (deduction for amounts paid for a charitable purpose). Trust also makes an additional discretionary distribution of $20,000 to B, a beneficiary of Trust. As in Example 1, Trust's net investment income is $30,000 ($15,000 in dividends plus $10,000 in interest plus $5,000 in capital gain). In accordance with Secs. 1.661(b)-2 and 1.662(b)-2, the items of income must be allocated between the mandatory distribution to A, the discretionary distribution to B, and the $10,000 distribution to a charity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of the mandatory distribution to A, Trust's distributable net income is $100,000. See Sec. 1.662(b)-2, Example 1(b). Trust's deduction under section 661 for the distribution to A is $30,000. Under Sec. 1.662(b)-1, the deduction reduces each class of income comprising distributable net income on a proportional basis. The $30,000 distribution equals 30% of distributable net income ($30,000 divided by $100,000). Therefore, the distribution consists of dividend income of $4,500, interest income of $3,000, and ordinary income attributable to the individual retirement account of $22,500. A's mandatory distribution thus consists of $7,500 of net investment income and $22,500 of excluded income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trust's remaining distributable net income is $70,000. Trust's remaining undistributed net investment income is $22,500. The $10,000 deduction under section 642(c) is allocated in the same manner as the distribution to A, where the $10,000 distribution equals 10% of distributable net income ($10,000 divided by $100,000). For purposes of determining undistributed net investment income, Trust's net investment income is reduced by $2,500 under paragraph (e)(4) of this section (dividend income of $1,500, interest income of $1,000, but with no reduction for amounts attributable to the individual retirement account of $7,500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to the discretionary distribution to B, Trust's remaining distributable net income is $60,000. Trust's remaining undistributed net investment income is $20,000. Trust's deduction under section 661 for the distribution to B is $20,000. The $20,000 distribution equals 20% of distributable net income ($20,000 divided by $100,000). Therefore, the distribution consists of dividend income of $3,000, interest income of $2,000, and ordinary income attributable to the individual retirement account of $15,000. B's distribution consists of $5,000 of net investment income and $15,000 of excluded income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Trust's undistributed net investment income is $15,000 after taking into account distribution deductions and section 642(c) in accordance with paragraphs (e)(3) and (e)(4) of this section, respectively. To arrive at Trust's undistributed net investment income of $15,000, Trust's net investment income of $30,000 is reduced by $7,500 of the mandatory distribution to A, $2,500 of the section 642(c) deduction, and $5,000 of the discretionary distribution to B. The undistributed net investment income consists of the remaining dividend income of $6,000 ($15,000 less $4,500 less $1,500 less $3,000), interest income of $4,000 ($10,000 less $1,000 less $3,000 less $2,000), and the $5,000 of undistributed capital gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D died in 2011. D's estate (Estate) filed its first return that established its fiscal year ending October 31, 2011. During Estate's fiscal year ending October 31, 2013, it earned $10,000 of interest, $1,000 of dividends, and $15,000 of short-term gains. The Estate distributed its interest and dividends to S, D's spouse and sole beneficiary, on a quarterly basis; the last quarter's payment for that taxable year was made to S on December 5, 2013. Pursuant to Sec. 1.662(c)-1, S is deemed to have received the first three payments for that taxable year, regardless of the actual payment dates, on October 31, 2013, the last day of Estate's taxable year. Estate makes a timely section 663(b) election to treat the fourth quarter distribution to S as having been made on October 31, 2013, the last day of Estate's preceding taxable year. Accordingly, S is

deemed to have received $10,000 of interest and $1,000 of dividends on October 31, 2013.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because Estate's fiscal year ending October 31, 2013, began on November 1, 2012, the Estate is not subject to section 1411 on income received during that taxable year. Therefore, none of the income received by Estate during its fiscal year ending October 31, 2013, is net investment income. Pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, because none of the distributed interest or dividend income constituted net investment income to Estate, the $10,000 of interest and $1,000 of dividends that Estate distributed to S does not constitute net investment income to S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2013, except that paragraph (d) of this section applies to taxable years of CRTs that begin after December 31, 2012. However, taxpayers other than CRTs may apply this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, in accordance with Sec. 1.1411-1(f).
