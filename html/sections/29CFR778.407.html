                            <p class="depth0">Payment must be made ``pursuant to a bona fide individual contract  or pursuant to an agreement made as a result   of collective bargaining by representatives of employees.'' It cannot be  a onesided affair determinable only by examination of the employer's  books. The employee must not only be aware of but must have agreed to  the method of compensation in advance of performing the work. Collective  bargaining agreements in general are formal agreements which have been  reduced to writing, but an individual employment contract may be either  oral or written. While there is no requirement in section 7(f) that the  agreement or contract be in writing, it is certainly desirable to reduce  the agreement to writing, since a contract of this character is rather  complicated and proof both of its existence and of its compliance with  the various requirements of the section may be difficult if it is not in  written form. Furthermore, the contract must be ``bona fide.'' This  implies that both the making of the contract and the settlement of its  terms were done in good faith.</p>
