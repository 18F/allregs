Indexing does not constitute a determination that all of the material listed is within the category that is required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Most of OPM's publications may be found in OPM's Library in room 5H27 at the address listed in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), OPM has determined that it is unnecessary and impractical to publish the ``Handbook of Publications, Periodicals, and Issuances'' and addendum more frequently than annually because of the small number of revisions that occur.
