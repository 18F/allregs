Such prospective contractors are  ineligible for contract awards resulting from such procurements  regardless of the procurement method used. However, prospective  contractors may provide States with specification information related to  a State procurement under the USDA entitlement programs specified in 2  CFR 200.101(e)(4) through (6) and still compete for the procurement if  the State, and not the prospective contractor, develops or drafts the  specifications, requirements, statements of work, invitations for bid,  and/or requests for proposals used to conduct the procurement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p>
