                            <p class="depth0">Upon written application by an adult Indian, the superintendent may  disburse not to exceed $1,000 during any one fiscal year from the  surplus funds of such Indian to make repairs and improvements to  restricted real property and in addition not to exceed $300 for new  construction. When such expenditures are being made on property  producing an income, reimbursement shall be required from such income  unless otherwise directed by the Commissioner. When an Indian refuses to  make application for funds to defray the cost of repairs necessary to  preserve restricted property, the superintendent may, when authorized by  the Commissioner, expend the surplus funds of the Indian for such  repairs.</p>
