Minor localized deformations to the outer side skin of the  passenger car or power car is allowed provided such deformations in no  way intrude upon the occupied volume of each car.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each passenger car and power car shall also be designed to rest  on its roof so that any damage in occupied areas is limited to roof  sheathing and framing. The allowable stress in the structural members of  the occupied volumes for this condition shall be one-half yield or one- half the critical buckling stress, whichever is less. Deformation to the  roof sheathing and framing is allowed to the extent necessary to permit  the vehicle to be supported directly on the top chords of the side  frames and end frames.</p>
