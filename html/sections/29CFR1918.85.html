                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Container markings. Every intermodal container shall be legibly  and permanently marked with:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The weight of the container when empty, in pounds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The maximum cargo weight the container is designed to carry, in  pounds; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The sum of the weight of the container and the maximum cargo  weight, in pounds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Container weight. No container shall be hoisted by any lifting  appliance unless the following conditions have been met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The employer shall determine from the carrier whether a  container to be hoisted is loaded or empty. Before loading or  discharging, empty containers shall be identified in a manner that will  inform every supervisor and job boss on the site and in charge of  loading or discharging, or every crane or other hoisting equipment  operator and signalman, that such container is empty. Methods of  identification may include cargo plans, manifests, or markings on the  container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a loaded container:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The actual gross weight shall be plainly marked and visible to  the crane or other hoisting equipment operator or signalman, or to every  supervisor or job boss on site and in charge of the operation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The cargo stowage plan or equivalent permanently recorded  display serving the same purpose, containing the actual gross weight and  the serial number or other positive identification of that specific  container, shall be provided to the crane or other hoisting   equipment operator and signalman, and to every supervisor and job boss  on site and in charge of the operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Every outbound container received at a marine terminal ready to  load aboard a vessel without further consolidation or loading shall be  weighed to obtain the actual gross weight, either at the terminal or  elsewhere, before being hoisted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When container weighing scales are found at a marine  terminal, any outbound container with a load consolidated at that  terminal shall be weighed to obtain the actual weight before being  hoisted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the terminal has no scales, the actual gross weight may be  calculated from the container's contents and the container's empty  weight. The weights used in the calculation shall be posted  conspicuously on the container, with the name of the person making the  calculation, and the date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Open top vehicle-carrying containers, and those built  specifically and used solely for the carriage of compressed gases, are  excepted from paragraphs (b)(3) and (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Closed dry van containers carrying vehicles are exempted from  paragraph (b)(4) of this section if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The container carries only completely assembled vehicles and no  other cargo;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The container is marked on the outside so that an employee can  readily discern that the container is carrying vehicles; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The vehicles were loaded into the container at the marine  terminal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The weight of loaded inbound containers from foreign ports shall  be determined by weighing, by the method of calculation described in  paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section or by shipping documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Any scale used within the United States to weigh containers for  the requirements of this section shall meet the accuracy standards of  the state or local public authority in which the scale is found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Overloaded containers. No container shall be hoisted if its  actual gross weight exceeds the weight marked as required in paragraph  (a)(3) of this section, or it exceeds the capacity of the lifting  appliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Container inspection. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prior to hoisting, each container  shall be inspected for any visible defects in structural members and  fittings that would make the handling of such container unsafe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any container found to have such a defect shall either be  handled by a special means to ensure safe handling or shall be emptied  before handling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Suspended containers. The employer shall prohibit employees from  working beneath a suspended container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(2)</em> of this section, unless damage  to an intermodal container makes special means of handling necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Loaded intermodal containers. Loaded intermodal containers of 20  feet (6.1 m) or more shall be hoisted as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When hoisting containers by the top fittings, the lifting forces  shall be applied vertically from at least four such fittings. A less  than vertical lift is permitted only under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The container being lifted is an ISO ``closed box container'';</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The condition of the box is sound;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The speed of hoisting and lowering is moderated when heavily  ladened containers \5\ are encountered; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ A heavily laden container is one that is loaded to within 20  percent of its rated capacity. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The lift angle is at 80 to 90 degrees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The distance between the lifting beam and the load is at least 8  feet, 2.4 inches (2.5 m); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The length of the spreader beam is at least 16.3 feet (5 m) for  a 20-foot container, and at least 36.4 feet (11.1 m) for a 40-foot  container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When hoisting containers from bottom fittings, the hoisting  connections shall bear on the fittings only, making no other contact  with the container. The angles of the four bridle legs shall not be less  than 30 degrees to the horizontal for 40-foot (12.19 m) containers; 37  degrees for 30-foot (9.14 m)   containers; and 45 degrees for 20-foot (6.1 m) containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Lifting containers by fork lift trucks or grappling arms from  above or from one side may be done only if the container is designed for  this type of handling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other means of hoisting may be used only if the containers and  hoisting means are designed for such use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Intermodal container spreaders. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When using intermodal  container spreaders that employ lanyards for activation and load  disengagement, all possible precautions shall be taken to prevent  accidental release of the load.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Intermodal container spreaders that utilize automatic twist  lock systems shall be designed and used so that a suspended load cannot  accidentally be released.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Safe container top access. A safe means of access shall be  provided for each employee required to work on the top of an intermodal  container. Unless ladders are used for access, such means shall comply  with the requirements of Sec. 1917.45(j) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Employee hoisting prohibition. Employees shall not be hoisted on  intermodal container spreaders while a load is engaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Portable ladder access. When other safer means are available,  portable ladders shall not be used in gaining access to container stacks  more than two containers high.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Fall protection--(1) Containers being handled by container  gantry cranes. (i) After July 26, 1999, where a container gantry crane  is being used to handle containers, the employer shall ensure that no  employee is on top of a container. Exception: An employee may be on top  of a container only to perform a necessary function that cannot be  eliminated by the use of positive container securing devices. \6\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Examples of work that may not be eliminated by positive  container securing devices and that may require employees to work on top  of containers include, but are not limited to: installing or removing  bridge clamps; hooking up or detaching over-height containers; or  freeing a jammed semi-automatic twist lock. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After July 26, 1999, the employer shall ensure that positive  container securing devices, such as semi-automatic twist locks and above  deck cell guides, are used wherever container gantry cranes are used to  hoist containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The employer shall ensure that each employee on top of a  container is protected from fall hazards by a fall protection system  meeting the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Containers being handled by other hoisting devices. Where  containers are being handled by hoisting devices other than container  gantry cranes, the employer shall ensure that each employee on top of a  container is protected by a fall protection system meeting the  requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other exposure to fall hazards. The employer shall ensure that  each employee exposed to a fall hazard is protected by a fall protection  system meeting the requirements of paragraph (k) of this section.  Exception: Where the employer can demonstrate that fall protection for  an employee would be infeasible or create a greater hazard due to vessel  design, container design, container storage, other cargo stowage,  container handling equipment, lifting gear, or port conditions, the  employer shall alert the affected employee about the fall hazard and  instruct the employee in ways to minimize exposure to that hazard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Fall protection systems. When fall protection systems required  by paragraph (j) of this section are employed, the following shall  apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each fall protection system component, except anchorages, shall  have fall arrest/restraint as its only use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each fall protection system subjected to impact loading shall be  immediately withdrawn from service and not be used again until inspected  and determined by a designated person to be undamaged and suitable for  use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Each fall protection system shall be rigged so that a falling  employee cannot contact any lower level stowage or vessel structure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Each fall protection system adopted for use shall have an energy  absorbing mechanism that will produce an arresting force on an employee  of not greater than 1800 pounds (8 kN).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Each component of a fall protection system shall be designed and  used to prevent accidental disengagement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each fall protection system's fixed anchorages shall be capable  of sustaining a force of 5,000 pounds (22.2 kN) or be certified as  capable of sustaining at least twice the potential impact load of an  employee's fall. Such certification must be made by a qualified person.  \7\ When more than one employee is attached to an anchorage, these  limits shall be multiplied by the number of employees attached. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ For the purposes of this paragraph, qualified person means one  with a recognized degree or professional certificate and extensive  knowledge and experience in the subject field who is capable of design,  analysis, evaluation and specifications in the subject work, project, or  product. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> When ``live'' (activated) container gantry crane lifting beams  or attached devices are used as anchorage points, the following  requirements apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The crane shall be placed into a ``slow'' speed mode;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The crane shall be equipped with a remote shut-off switch that  can stop trolley, gantry, and hoist functions and that is in the control  of the employee(s) attached to the beam; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A visible or audible indicator shall be present to alert the  exposed employee(s) when the remote shut-off is operational.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Fall protection system components, other than the anchorages,  shall be certified as a unit of being capable of sustaining at least  twice the potential impact load of an employee's fall. Such  certification shall be made by a qualified person. \8\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ For the purposes of this paragraph, qualified person means one  with a recognized degree or professional certificate and extensive  knowledge and experience in the subject field who is capable of design,  analysis, evaluation and specifications in the subject work, project, or  product. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Each fall protection system shall incorporate the use of a full  body harness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Each device, such as a safety cage, used to transport an  employee(s) by being attached to a container gantry crane spreader,  shall have a secondary means to prevent accidental disengagement and the  secondary means shall be engaged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Each fall protection system shall be inspected before each  day's use by a designated person. Any defective components shall be  removed from service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Before using any fall protection system, the employee shall be  trained in the use and application limits of the equipment, proper  hookup, anchoring and tie-off techniques, methods of use, and proper  methods of equipment inspection and storage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> The employer shall establish and implement a procedure to  retrieve personnel safely in case of a fall.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Working along unguarded edges. The employer shall provide, and  ensure that the employee use, fall protection meeting the requirements  of paragraph (k) of this section whenever the employee works along an  unguarded edge where a fall hazard exists (see Sec. 1918.2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Vertical tandem lifts. Operations involving the lifting of two  or more intermodal containers by the top container shall be performed  following Sec. 1917.71(i) and (k)(1) of this chapter.
