                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General--(1) Dividends included in gross income. Gross income from sources within the United States includes a dividend described in subparagraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this paragraph. For purposes of subparagraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this paragraph, the term ``dividend'' shall have the same meaning as set forth in section 316 and the regulations thereunder. See subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for special rules with respect to certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC. See also paragraph (a)(6) of this section for special rules concerning substitute dividend payments received pursuant to a securities lending transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Dividends included in gross income.

See also paragraph (a)(6) of this section for special rules concerning substitute dividend payments received pursuant to a securities lending transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividend from a domestic corporation. A dividend described in this paragraph (a)(2) is a dividend from a domestic corporation other than a corporation that has an election in effect under section 936. See paragraph (a)(5) of this section for the treatment of certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dividend from a foreign corporation--(i) In general.(a) A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a foreign corporation (other than a dividend to which subparagraph (4) of this paragraph applies) unless less than 50 percent of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for the 3-year period ending with the close of its taxable year preceding the taxable year in which occurs the declaration of such dividend (or for such part of such period as the corporation has been in existence) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, as determined under section 864(c) and Sec. 1.864-3. Thus, no portion of a dividend from a foreign corporation shall be treated as income from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(2)(B) if less than 50 percent of the gross income of such foreign corporation from all sources for such 3-year period (or part thereof) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States or if such foreign corporation had gross income for such 3-year period (or part thereof) but none was effectively connected with

the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If 50 percent or more of the gross income from all sources of such foreign corporation for such 3-year period (or part thereof) was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States, the amount of the dividend which is to be treated as income from sources within the United States under section 861(a)(2)(B) shall be the amount that bears the same ratio to such dividend as the gross income of such foreign corporation for such 3-year period (or part thereof) which was effectively connected with the conduct by such corporation of a trade or business in the United States bears to its gross income from all sources for such period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this subdivision (i), the gross income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States includes the gross income which, pursuant to section 882 (d) or (e), is treated as income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rule applicable in applying limitation on amount of foreign tax credit. For purposes of determining under section 904 the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> So much of a dividend from a foreign corporation as exceeds (and only to the extent it so exceeds) the amount which is 100/85ths of the amount of the deduction allowable under section 245(a) in respect of such dividend, plus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An amount which bears the same proportion to any section 78 dividend to which the dividend from the foreign corporation gives rise as the amount of the excess determined under (a) of this subdivision bears to the total amount of the dividend from the foreign corporation, shall, notwithstanding subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, be treated as income from sources without the United States. This subdivision applies to a dividend for which no dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245 or for which the 85 percent dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245(a) but does not apply to a dividend for which a deduction is allowable under section 245(b). All of a dividend for which the 100 percent dividends-received deduction is allowed under section 245(b) shall be treated as income from sources within the United States for purposes of determining under section 904 the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit. If the amount of a distribution of property other than money (constituting a dividend under section 316) is determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C), such amount must be used as the dividend for purposes of applying (a) of this subdivision even though the amount used for purposes of section 245(a) is determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(D). In making determinations under this subdivision, a dividend (other than a section 78 dividend referred to in (b) of this subdivision) shall be determined without regard to section 78.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D, a domestic corporation, owns 80 percent of the outstanding stock of M, a foreign manufacturing corporation. M, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, has earnings and profits of $200,000 for 1971 and 60 percent of its gross income for that year is effectively connected for 1971 with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For an uninterrupted period of 36 months ending on December 31, 1970, M has been engaged in trade or business in the United States and has received gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States amounting to 60 percent of its gross income from all sources for such period. The only distribution by M to D for 1971 is a cash dividend of $100,000; of this amount, $60,000 ($100,000x60%) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States, and $40,000 ($100,000-$60,000) is treated under Sec. 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. Accordingly, under section 245(a), D is entitled to a dividends-received deduction of $51,000 ($60,000x85%), and under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph $40,000 ($100,000-[$51,000x100/85]) is treated as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in example (1) except that the distribution for 1971 consists of property which has a fair market value of $100,000 and an adjusted

basis of $30,000 in M's hands immediately before the distribution. The amount of the dividend under section 316 is $58,000, determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C) as follows:
Portion of adjusted basis of property attributable to gross      $18,000</p><p class="depth0">income of M effectively connected for 1971 with conduct of</p><p class="depth0">trade or business in United States ($30,000x60%).............Portion of fair market value of property attributable to gross    40,000</p><p class="depth0">income of M not effectively connected for 1971 with conduct</p><p class="depth0">of trade or business in United States ($100,000x40%).........</p><p class="depth0">---------</p><p class="depth0">Total dividend...............................................    58,000</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Of the total dividend, $34,800 ($58,000x60% (percentage applicable to 3-year period)) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States, and $23,200 ($58,000x40%) is treated under Sec. 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. However, by reason of section 245(c) the adjusted basis of the property ($30,000) is used under section 245(a) in determining the dividends-received deduction. Thus, under section 245(a), D is entitled to a dividends-received deduction of $15,300 ($30,000x60%x85%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, the amount of the dividend for purposes of applying (a) of that subdivision is the amount ($58,000) determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(C) rather than the amount ($30,000) determined by applying section 301(b)(1)(B). Accordingly, under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph $40,000 ($58,000-[$15,300x100/85]) is treated as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> D, a domestic corporation which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of N, a foreign corporation which is not a less developed country corporation under section 902(d). N, which makes its returns on the basis of the calendar year, has total gross income for 1971 of $100,000, of which $80,000 (including $60,000 from sources within foreign country X) is effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States. For 1971 N is assumed to have paid $27,000 of income taxes to country X and to have accumulated profits of $81,000 for purposes of section 902(c)(1)(A). N's accumulated profits in excess of foreign income taxes amount to $54,000. For 1971 D receives a cash dividend of $42,000 from N, which is D's only income for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For 1971 D chooses the benefits of the foreign tax credit under section 901, and as a result is required under section 78 to include in gross income an amount equal to the foreign income taxes of $21,000 ($27,000x$42,000/$54,000) it is deemed to have paid under section 902(a)(1). Thus, assuming no other deductions for the taxable year, D has gross income of $63,000 ($42,000+$21,000) for 1971 less a dividends-received deduction under section 245(a) of $28,560 ([$42,000x$80,000/$100,000]x85%), or taxable income for 1971 of $34,440.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph, for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit, $12,600 is treated as income from sources without the United States, determined as follows:

A, an individual citizen of the United States who makes his return on the basis of the calendar year, receives in 1971 a cash dividend of $10,000 from M, a foreign corporation, which makes its return on the basis of the calendar year. For the 3-year period ending with 1970 M has been engaged in trade or business in the United States and has received gross income effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States amounting to 80 percent of its gross income from all sources for such period. Of the total dividend, $8,000 ($10,000x80%) is treated under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as income from sources within the United States and $2,000 ($10,000-$8,000) is treated under Sec. 1.862-1(a)(2) as income from sources without the United States. Since under section 245 no dividends received-deduction is allowable to an individual, A is entitled under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph to treat the entire dividend of $10,000 ($10,000-[$0x100/85]) as income from sources without the United States for purposes of determining under section 904(a) (1) or (2) the limitation upon the amount of the foreign tax credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dividend from a foreign corporation succeeding to earnings of a domestic corporation. A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a foreign corporation, if such dividend is received by a corporation after December 31, 1959, but only to the extent that such dividend is treated by such recipient corporation under the provisions of Sec. 1.243-3 as a dividend from a domestic corporation subject to taxation under chapter 1 of the Code. To the extent that this subparagraph applies to a dividend received from a foreign corporation, subparagraph (3) of this paragraph shall not apply to such dividend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC--(i) General rule. A dividend described in this subparagraph is a dividend from a corporation that is a DISC or former DISC (as defined in section 992(a)) other than a dividend that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Is deemed paid by a DISC, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) to the extent provided in subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reduces under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income (as defined in subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph) to the extend provided in subdivision (iv) of this subparagraph.
Thus, a dividend deemed paid under section 995(b)(1) (A), (B), or (C) (relating to certain deemed distributions in qualified years) will be treated in full as gross income from sources within the United States. To the extent that a dividend from a DISC or former DISC is paid out of other earnings and profits (as defined in Sec. 1.996-3(d)), subparagraph (2) of this paragraph shall apply. To the extent that a dividend from a DISC or former DISC is paid out of previously taxed income (as defined in Sec. 1.996-3(c)), see section 996(a)(3) (relating to the exclusion from gross income of amounts distributed out of previously taxed income). In determining the source of income of certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC, the source of income from any transaction which gives rise to gross receipts (as defined in Sec. 1.993-6), in the hands of the DISC or former DISC, is immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> ``Dividend from'' means any amount actually distributed which is a dividend within the meaning of section 316 (including distributions to meet qualification requirements under section 992(c)) and any amount treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend pursuant to section 995(b) (relating to deemed distributions in qualified years or upon disqualification) or included in gross income as a dividend pursuant to section 995(c) (relating to gain on certain dispositions of stock in a DISC or former DISC), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> ``Accumulated DISC income'' means the amount of accumulated DISC income as of the close of the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the dividend was made increased by the amount of DISC income for the taxable year in which the dividend was made (as determined under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> ``Nonqualified export taxable income'' means the taxable income of a DISC from any transaction which gives rise to gross receipts (as defined in Sec. 1.993-6) which are not qualified export receipts (as defined in Sec. 1.993-1) other than a transaction giving rise to gain described in section 995(b)(1) (B) or (C).
For purposes of subdivisions (i)(b) and (iv) of this subparagraph, if by reason of section 995(c), gain is included in the shareholder's gross income as a dividend, accumulated DISC income shall be treated as if it were reduced under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determination of source of income for deemed distributions, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F). (a) If for its taxable year a DISC does not have any nonqualified export taxable income, then for such year the entire amount treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If for its taxable year a DISC has any nonqualified export taxable income, then for such year the portion of the amount treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend that will be treated as income from sources

within the United States shall be equal to the amount of such nonqualified export taxable income multiplied by the following fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the sum of the amounts treated, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1) (D), (E), and (F) as deemed distributions taxable as dividends. The denominator of the fraction is the taxable income of the DISC for the taxable year, reduced by the amounts treated under section 995(b)(1) (A), (B), and (C) as deemed distributions taxable as dividends. However, in no event shall the numerator exceed the denominator. The remainder of such dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Determination of source of income for dividends that reduce accumulated DISC income. (a) If no portion of the accumulated DISC income of a DISC or former DISC is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income from any transaction during a year for which it is (or is treated as) a DISC, then the entire amount of any dividend that reduces under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income will be treated as income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If any portion of the accumulated DISC income of a DISC or former DISC is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income from any transaction during a year for which it is (or is treated as) a DISC, then the portion of any dividend during its taxable year that reduces under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3) accumulated DISC income that will be treated as income from sources within the United States shall be equal to the amount of such dividend multiplied by a fraction (determined as of the close of such year) the numerator of which is the amount of accumulated DISC income attributable to nonqualified export taxable income, and the denominator of which is the total amount of accumulated DISC income. The remainder of such dividend will be treated as gross income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special rules. For purposes of subdivisions (iii) and (iv) of this subparagraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Taxable income shall be determined under Sec. 1.992-3(b)(2)(i) (relating to the computation of deficiency distribution), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The portion of any deemed distribution taxable as a dividend, for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, and for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, under section 995(b)(1)(D), (E), and (F) or amount under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3) (i) through (iv) that is treated as gross income from sources within the United States during the taxable year shall be considered to reduce the amount of nonqualified export taxable income as of the close of such year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Illustrations. This subparagraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Y is a corporation which uses the calendar year as its taxable year and which elects to be treated as a DISC beginning with 1972. X is its sole shareholder. In 1973, Y has $18,000 of taxable income from qualified export receipts (none of which are interest and gains described in section 995(b)(1)(A), (B), and (C)) and $1,000 of nonqualified export taxable income. Under these facts, X is deemed to have received a distribution under section 995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, of $9,500, i.e., $19,000 X \1/2\. X is treated under subdivision (iii)(b) of this subparagraph as having $500, i.e., $1,000 X $9,500/$19,000, from sources within the United States and $9,000 from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For 1972, assume that Y did not have any nonqualified export taxable income. Pursuant to subdivision (v)(b) of this subparagraph, at the beginning of 1974, $500 of Y's accumulated DISC income is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income (iii)(a) of this subparagraph), i.e., $1,000--$500.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example (1) except that in 1973, in addition to the taxable income described in such example, Y has $450 of taxable income from gross interest from producer's loans described in section 995(b)(1)(A). Under these facts, the deemed distribution of $450 under section 995(b)(1)(A) is treated in full under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as gross income from sources within the United States. The deemed distribution under section

995(b)(1)(D) as in effect for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1976, of $9,500 will be treated in the same manner as in example (1), i.e., $1,000 X $9,500/($19,450-$450).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in example (1) except that in 1973, in addition to the distribution described in such example, Y makes a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $100 under section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans) and actual distributions of all of its previously taxed income and of $2,000 taxable as a dividend which reduces accumulated DISC income (as defined in subdivision (ii)(b) of this subparagraph). Under Sec. 1.996-3(b)(3), accumulated DISC income is first reduced by the deemed distribution of $100 and then by the actual distribution taxable as a dividend of $2,000. As indicated in example (1), for 1972 Y did not have any nonqualified export taxable income. Assume that Y had accumulated DISC income of $12,000 at the end of 1973, $500 of which under example (1) is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The distribution from previously taxed income is excluded from gross income pursuant to section 996(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Of the deemed distribution of $100, X is treated under subdivision (iv)(b) as having $4.17, i.e., $100x500/12,000, from sources within the United States and $95.83, i.e., $100--$4.17, from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Of the actual distribution taxable as a dividend of $2,000, X is treated under subdivision (iv)(b) as having $83.33, i.e., $2,000x500/12,000, from sources within the United States and $1,916.67, i.e., $2,000--$83.33, from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The sum of the amounts deemed and actually distributed as dividends for 1973 that are treated as gross income from sources within the United States is as follows:

W is its sole shareholder. At the end of the 1976 Z has previously taxed income of $12,000 and accumulated DISC income of $4,000, $900 of which is attributable to nonqualified export taxable income. In 1977, Z has $20,050 of taxable income from qualified export receipts, of which $550 is from gross income from producer's loans described in section 995(b)(1)(A); Z has $950 of taxable income giving rise to gross receipts which are not qualified export receipts, of which $450 is gain described in section 995(b)(1)(B). Of its total taxable income of $21,000 (which is equal to its earnings and profits for 1977), $1,000 is attributable to sales of military property. Z has an international boycott factor (determined under section 999) of .10, and made an illegal bribe (within the meaning of section 162(c)) of $1,265. The proportion which the amount of Z's adjusted base period export receipts bears to Z's export gross receipts for 1977 is .40 (see section 995(e)(1)). Z makes a deemed distribution taxable as a dividend of $1,000 under section 995(b)(1)(G) (relating to foreign investment attributable to producer's loans) and actual distributions of $32,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The deemed distributions of $550 under section 995(b)(1)(A) and $450 under section 995(b)(1)(B) are treated in full under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph as gross income from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Under these facts, Z has also made the following deemed distributions taxable as dividends to W under the following subdivisions of section 995(b)(1):

A substitute dividend payment is a payment, made to the transferor of a security in a securities lending transaction or a sale-repurchase transaction, of an amount equivalent to a dividend distribution which the owner of the transferred security is entitled to receive during the term of the transaction. A securities lending transaction is a transfer of one or more securities that is described in section 1058(a) or a substantially similar transaction. A sale-repurchase transaction is an agreement under which a person transfers a security in exchange for cash and simultaneously agrees to receive substantially identical securities from the transferee in the future in exchange for cash. A substitute dividend payment shall be sourced in the same manner as the distributions with respect to the transferred security for purposes of this section and Sec. 1.862-1. See also Sec. Sec. 1.864-5(b)(2)(iii), 1.871-7(b)(2) and 1.881-2(b)(2) for the character of such payments and Sec. 1.894-1(c) for the application of tax treaties to these transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules--(1) Foreign corporation having no gross income for period preceding declaration of dividend.

Any taxpayer who is required to file a return and applies any provision of this section to exclude any dividend from his gross income must file with his return a statement setting forth the amount so excluded, the date of its receipt, the name and address of the corporation paying the dividend, and, if known, the location of the records which substantiate the amount of the exclusion. A statement from the paying corporation setting forth such information and indicating the amount of the dividend to be treated as income from sources within the United States may be used for this purpose. See Sec. Sec. 1.6012-1(b)(1)(i) and 1.6012-2 (g)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph this section applies with respect to dividends received or accrued after December 31, 1966. Paragraph (a)(5) of this section applies to certain dividends from a DISC or former DISC in taxable years ending after December 31, 1971. Paragraph (a)(6) of this section is applicable to payments made after November 13, 1997. For purposes of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, any reference to a distribution taxable as a dividend under section 995(b)(1)(F) (ii) and (iii) for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1975, shall also constitute a reference to any distribution taxable as a dividend under section 995(b)(1)(F) (ii) and (iii) for taxable years beginning after November 30, 1975, but before January 1, 1976. For corresponding rules applicable with respect to dividends received or accrued before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR 1.861-3 (Revised as of January 1, 1972). Paragraph (a)(2) of this section applies to taxable years ending after April 9, 2008.
