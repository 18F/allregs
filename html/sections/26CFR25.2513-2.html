If both spouses file gift tax returns within the time for signifying consent, it is sufficient if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Consent to the application of the provisions of section 2513 with respect to a ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)) shall, in order to be effective, be signified by both spouses. If both spouses file gift tax returns within the time for signifying consent, it is sufficient if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consent of the husband is signified on the wife's return, and the consent of the wife is signified on the husband's return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consent of each spouse is signified on his own return; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The consent of both spouses is signified on one of the returns.
If only one spouse files a gift tax return within the time provided for signifying consent, the consent of both spouses shall be signified on that return. However, whereover possible, the notice of the consent is to be shown on both returns and it is preferred that the notice be executed in the manner described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph. The consent may be revoked only as provided in Sec. 25.2513-3. If one spouse files more than one gift tax return for a calendar period on or before the due date of the return, the last return so filed shall, for the purpose of determining whether a consent has been signified, be considered as the return. (See Sec. Sec. 25.6075-1 and 25.6075-2 for the due date of a gift tax return.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For gifts made after December 31, 1970, and before January 1, 1982 subject to the limitations of paragraph (b) of this section, the consent signified on a return filed for a calendar quarter will be effective for a previous calendar quarter of the same calendar year for which no return was filed because the gifts made during such previous calendar quarter did not exceed the annual exclusion provided by section 2503(b), if the gifts in such previous calendar quarter are listed on that return. Thus, for example, if A gave $2,000 to his son in the first quarter of 1972 (and filed no return because of section 2503(b)) and gave a further $4,000 to such son in the last quarter of the year, A and his spouse could signify consent to the application of section 2513 on the return filed for the fourth quarter and have it apply to the first quarter as well, provided that the $2,000 gift is listed on such return.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> With respect to gifts made after December 31, 1981, or before January 1, 1971, the consent may be signified at any time following the close of the calendar year, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> With respect to gifts made after December 31, 1981, or before January 1, 1971, the consent may be signified at any time following the close of the calendar year, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consent may not be signified after the 15th day of April following the close of the calendar year, unless before such 15th day no return has been filed for the year by either spouse, in which case the consent may not be signified after a return for the year is filed by either spouse; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consent may not be signified for a calendar year after a notice of deficiency in gift tax for that year has been sent to either spouse in accordance with the provisions of section 6212(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With respect to gifts made after December 31, 1970 and before January 1, 1982, the consent may be signified at any time following the close of the calendar quarter in which the gift was made, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The consent may not be signified after the 15th day of the second month following the close of such calendar quarter, unless before such 15th day, no return has been filed for such calendar quarter by either spouse, in which case the consent may not be signified after a return for such calendar quarter is filed by either spouse; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consent may not be signified after a notice of deficiency with respect to the tax for such calendar quarter has been sent to either spouse in accordance with section 6212(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The executor or administrator of a deceased spouse, or the guardian or committee of a legally incompetent spouse, as the case may be, may signify the consent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the donor and spouse consent to the application of section 2513, the return or returns for the ``calendar period'' (as defined in Sec. 25.2502-1(c)(1)) must set forth, to the extent provided
