A formal complaint may be amended at any time before  service of an answer to the complaint. After service of an answer but  before institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be  amended with the permission of the Assistant General Counsel. After  institution of an enforcement proceeding, the complaint may be amended  only on grant of a motion filed under Sec. 302.11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Insufficiency of formal complaint. In any case where the  Assistant General Counsel is of the opinion that a complaint does not  sufficiently set forth matters required by any applicable rule,  regulation or order of the Department, or is otherwise insufficient, he  or she may advise the complainant of the deficiency and require that any  additional information be supplied by amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joinder of complaints or complainants. Two or more grounds of  complaints involving substantially the same purposes, subject or state  of facts may be included in one complaint even though they involve more  than one respondent. Two or more complainants may join in one complaint  if their respective causes of complaint are against the same party or  parties and involve substantially the same purposes, subject or state of  facts. The Assistant General Counsel may separate or split complaints if  he or she finds that the joinder of complaints, complainants, or  respondents will not be conducive to the proper dispatch of the  Department's business or the ends of justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Service. A formal complaint, and any amendments thereto, shall  be served by the person filing such documents upon each party complained  of, upon the Deputy General Counsel, and upon the Assistant General  Counsel.</p>
