Appropriate entries indicating reasons why any  tests were not received must be made in the broadcast station log as  specified in Secs. 73.1820 and 73.1840 of this chapter for all broadcast  streams and cable system records as specified in Secs. 76.1700, 76.1708,  and 76.1711 of this chapter. All other EAS Participants must also keep  records indicating reasons why any tests were not received and these  records must be retained for two years, maintained at the EAS  Participant's headquarters, and made available for public inspection  upon reasonable request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If an EAS Encoder, EAS Decoder or Intermediary Device used as  part of the EAS to decode and/or encode messages formatted in the EAS  Protocol and/or the Common Alerting Protocol becomes defective, the EAS  Participant may operate without the defective equipment pending its  repair or replacement for 60 days without further FCC authority. Entries  shall be made in the broadcast station log, cable system records, and  records of other EAS Participants, as specified in paragraph (a) of this  section, showing the date and time the equipment was removed and  restored to service. For personnel training purposes, the required  monthly test script must still be transmitted even though the equipment  for generating the EAS message codes, Attention Signal and EOM code is  not functioning.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If repair or replacement of defective equipment is not completed  within 60 days, an informal request shall be submitted to the Regional  Director of the FCC field office serving the area in which the EAS  Participant is located, or in the case of DBS and SDARS providers to the  Regional Director of the FCC field office serving the area where their  headquarters is located, for additional time to repair the defective  equipment. This request must explain what steps have been taken to  repair or replace the defective equipment, the alternative procedures  being used while the defective equipment is out of service, and when the  defective equipment will be repaired or replaced.
