                            <p class="depth0">A review of any classification or comparison made pursuant to this subpart may be requested by the owner or custodian of the cotton from which the sample was drawn within 30 days after the issuance of the original memorandum. Such request, accompanied by the original memorandum, may be filed with either the Classing Office which issued the original memorandum or the Quality Control Section. Redrawn samples shall be required except in cases where the original samples have remained, identity preserved, in the custody of the Classing Office which issued the original memorandum. As evidence of any review determination, a classification memorandum marked to indicate that it represents a review determination shall be issued to the applicant requesting the review.
