                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A motion to proceed in forma pauperis may be filed by an  individual, a corporation, and unincorporated entity, an association or  other similar group, if the moving party is either of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A respondent in a revocation proceeding, or a renewal applicant,  who cannot carry on his livelihood without the radio license at stake in  the proceeding; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An intervenor in a hearing proceeding who is in a position to  introduce testimony which is of probable decisional significance, on a  matter of substantial public interest importance, which cannot, or  apparently will not, be introduced by other parties to the proceeding,  and who is not seeking personal financial gain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a licensee, the motion to proceed in forma  pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to show  that the moving party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this section  and that he cannot, because of his poverty, pay the expenses of  litigation and still be able to provide himself and his dependents with  the necessities of life. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by  affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge thereof. The  information submitted shall detail the income and assets of the  individual and his financial obligations and responsibilities, and shall  contain an estimate of the cost of participation in the proceeding.  Personal financial information may be submitted to the presiding officer  in confidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an individual intervenor, the motion to  proceed in forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact  sufficient to show that he is eligible under paragraph (a) of this  section and that he has dedicated financial resources to sustain his  participation which are reasonable in light of his personal resources  and other demands upon them but are inadequate for effective  participation in the proceeding. Such allegations of fact shall be  supported by affidavit of a person or persons with personal knowledge  thereof. The information submitted shall detail the income and assets of  the individual and his immediate family and his financial obligations  and responsibilities, and shall contain an estimate of the cost of  participation. Personal financial information may be submitted to the  presiding officer in confidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an intervening group, the motion to proceed in  forma pauperis shall contain specific allegations of fact sufficient to  show that the moving party is eligible under paragraph (a) of this  section and that it cannot pay the expenses of litigation and still be  able to carry out the activities and purposes for which it was  organized. Such allegations of fact shall be supported by affidavit of  the President and Treasurer of the group,   and/or by other persons having personal knowledge thereof. The  information submitted shall include a copy of the corporate charter or  other documents that describe the activities and purposes of the  organization; a current balance sheet and profit and loss statement;  facts showing, under all the circumstances, that it would not be  reasonable to expect added resources of individuals composing the group  to be pooled to meet the expenses of participating in the proceeding;  and an estimate of the cost of participation. Personal financial  information pertaining to members of the group may be submitted to the  presiding officer in confidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the motion is granted, the presiding officer may direct that  a free copy of the transcript of testimony be made available to the  moving party and may relax the rules of procedure in any manner which  will ease his financial burden, is fair to other parties to the  proceeding, and does not involve the payment of appropriated funds to a  party.
