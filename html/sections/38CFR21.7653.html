If this occurs, the interruption or termination shall be reported in accordance with Sec. 21.7656(a). If the reservist continues in

training despite making unsatisfactory progress, the fact of his or her unsatisfactory progress must be reported to VA within the time allowed by paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(2), and (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reservist's progress may become unsatisfactory as a result of the grades he or she receives.
