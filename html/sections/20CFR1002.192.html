                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In all cases, the starting point for determining the proper  reemployment position is the escalator position, which is the job  position that the employee would have attained if his or her continuous  employment had not been interrupted due to uniformed service. Once this  position is determined, the employer may have to consider several  factors before determining the appropriate reemployment position in any  particular case. Such factors may include the employee's length of  service, qualifications, and disability, if any. The reemployment  position may be either the escalator position; the pre-service position;  a position comparable to the escalator or pre-service position; or, the  nearest approximation to one of these positions.</p>
