(1) The Director of the CCC Operations Division (Director, CCCOD) and the exporter will attempt to resolve any disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising under the EEP, this subpart, the applicable Invitation, or the Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the CCC Operations Division (Director, CCCOD) and the exporter will attempt to resolve any disputes, including any adverse determinations made by CCC, arising under the EEP, this subpart, the applicable Invitation, or the Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exporter may seek reconsideration of a determination by the Director, CCCOD relating to the Agreement by submitting a letter requesting reconsideration to the Director, CCCOD, within 30 days of the date of the determination. For the purposes of this section, the date of a determination will be the date of the letter or other means of notification to the exporter of the determination. The exporter may include with the letter requesting reconsideration any additional information which it wishes the Director, CCCOD, to consider in reviewing its request. The Director, CCCOD, will respond to the request for reconsideration within 30 days of the date on which the request or the final documentary evidence submitted by the exporter is received by him, whichever is later, unless the GSM extends the time permitted for response. If the exporter fails to request reconsideration of a determination by the Director, CCCOD, that the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting such a request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the exporter requested a reconsideration of a determination by the Director, CCCOD, pursuant to subparagraph (a)(2) of this section, and the Director, CCCOD, upheld the original determination, then the exporter may appeal the determination to the GSM in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. If

the exporter fails to appeal the determination to the GSM, then any funds owed to CCC will become a debt of the exporter to CCC at the expiration of the 30-day period for submitting an appeal to the GSM.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appeal procedures. (1) An exporter which has exhausted the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the GSM a determination of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement between the exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the date of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal to the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that it desires such a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An exporter which has exhausted the procedures set forth in paragraph (a) of this section may appeal to the GSM a determination of the Director, CCCOD, relating to the Agreement between the exporter and CCC. An appeal to the GSM must be in writing and filed with the office of the GSM no later than 30 days following the date of the final determination by the Director, CCCOD. In this appeal to the GSM, the exporter shall be entitled to an administrative hearing before the GSM, if the exporter indicates in its appeal letter that it desires such a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the exporter does not desire an administrative hearing, the exporter may submit any additional written information or documentation which it desires the GSM to consider in acting upon its appeal. This information or documentation may be submitted to the GSM up until the time that a decision is made by the GSM. The GSM will base the determination upon information contained in the administrative record. The GSM will endeavor to make a decision on an appeal not involving a hearing within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the appeal or the date that final documentary evidence is submitted by the exporter to the GSM, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the exporter has indicated that it desires an administrative hearing, the GSM will set a date and time for the hearing which is mutually convenient for the GSM and the exporter. This date will ordinarily be within 60 days of the date on which the GSM receives the request for hearing. The hearing will be an informal procedure. The exporter and/or its counsel may present any administrative or documentary evidence to the GSM which it desires to have the GSM consider in making a determination. A transcript of the hearing will not ordinarily be prepared unless the exporter bears the costs involved in preparing the transcript, although the GSM may arrange to have a transcript prepared at the expense of the Government if it is determined to be appropriate. The exporter may provide additional written information to the GSM up until the time that the GSM makes a determination. The GSM will base the determination upon the information contained in the administrative record and will endeavor to make a decision within 60 days of the date of the hearing or the date of receipt of the transcript, if one is to be prepared, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The decision of the GSM will be the final determination of CCC and the exporter will be entitled to no further administrative appellate rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the GSM upholds a determination of the Director, CCCOD, that the exporter owes any funds to CCC under the Agreement, then such funds will become a debt of the exporter to CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to comply with determination. If, for any reason, the exporter has failed to pay funds to CCC which have been determined to be owed to CCC under the Agreement and the exporter has exhausted its rights under this section or has failed to exercise such rights, then CCC will have the right to withdraw funds from the performance security established by the exporter or to take any other measures available to CCC as result of this subpart or any laws or regulations, including debt settlement regulations, applicable to CCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exporter's obligation to perform. The exporter will continue to have an obligation to perform under the Agreement pending the conclusion of all procedures under this section.</p>
