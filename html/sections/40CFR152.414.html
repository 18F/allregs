                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedures for requesting a waiver. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request for a waiver  must be submitted in writing at the time the application is submitted to  the Office of Pesticide Programs' Document Processing Desk at the  appropriate address as set forth in 40 CFR 150.17(a) or (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A payment of $1,200 for processing the waiver or the amount of  the actual fee, whichever is less, must be submitted simultaneously to  the address set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. This fee will be  refunded (or applied to any resulting partial fee) if the waiver is  granted. Payment of fees for the registration activities, in contrast to  the waiver fee, shall not be required until the Agency makes a  determination on the waiver request. Since the actual fee is submitted  to an address different than the one to which the waiver request is  submitted, a copy of the payment document must be submitted with the  waiver request that is submitted to the Office of Pesticide Programs'  Document Processing Desk as described in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. No fee is required from a person who has no financial interest  in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for payment of fees. All fees required by this  section must be paid by money order, bank draft, or certified check  drawn to the order of the Environmental Protection Agency. All payment  of fees must be forwarded to the Environmental Protection Agency,  Headquarters Accounting Operations Branch, Office of Pesticide Programs  (Registration Fees), P.O. Box 360277M, Pittsburgh, PA 15251. The  payments should be specifically labeled ``Registration Fees'' and should  be accompanied only by a copy of the registration application form or  the experimental use permit application form, as appropriate. An  application will not be accepted for processing until the required fees  have been submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for submitting application and supporting data. The  application, along with supporting data, shall be forwarded within 30  days of payment to the Washington DC address set forth in paragraph  (a)(1) of this section.
