                            <p class="depth0">Pending final action by the Secretary, the Administrator may,  whenever he deems such action necessary, suspend the license of any  licensed inspector issued pursuant to the regulations in this part by  giving notice of such suspension to the respective licensee, accompanied  by a statement of the reasons therefor. Within 10 days after the receipt  of the aforesaid notice and statement of the reasons by such licensee,  he may file an appeal, in writing, with the Secretary, supported by any  argument or evidence that he may wish to offer as to why his license  should not be suspended or revoked. After the expiration of the  aforesaid 10-day period and consideration of such argument and evidence,  the Secretary will take such action as he deems appropriate with respect  to such suspension or revocation. When no appeal is filed within the  prescribed 10 days, the license shall be automatically revoked.</p>
