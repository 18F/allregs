                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, which stock has a basis equal to the amount by which the  shareholder's basis for his stock in the acquiring corporation was  increased on account of the contribution to capital as provided for  above in this paragraph. Accordingly, such amount shall be applied in  reduction of the shareholder's basis for his stock in the acquiring  corporation. Thus, the basis of each share of the shareholder's stock in  the acquiring corporation will be the same as the basis of such share  before the entire transaction. The holding period of the stock which is  considered to have been redeemed shall be the same as the holding period  of the stock actually surrendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In any case in which two or more persons, in the aggregate,  control two corporations, section 304(a)(1) will apply to sales by such  persons of stock in either corporation to the other (whether or not made  simultaneously) provided the sales by each of such persons are related  to each other. The determination of whether the sales are related to  each other shall be dependent upon the facts and circumstances  surrounding all of the sales. For this purpose, the fact that the sales  may occur during a period of one or more years (such as in the case of a  series of sales by persons who together control each of such  corporations immediately prior to the first of such sales and  immediately subsequent to the last of such sales) shall be disregarded,  provided the other facts and circumstances indicate related  transactions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The application of section 304(a)(1) may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X and corporation Y each have outstanding 200  shares of common stock. One-half of the stock of each corporation is  owned by an individual, A, and one-half by another individual, B, who is  unrelated to A. On or after August 31, 1964, A sells 30 shares of  corporation X stock to corporation Y for $50,000, such stock having an  adjusted basis of $10,000 to A. After the sale, A is considered as  owning corporation X stock as follows: (i) 70 shares directly, and (ii)  15 shares constructively, since by virtue of his 50-percent ownership of  Y he constructively owns 50 percent of the 30 shares owned directly by  Y. Since A's percentage of ownership of X's voting stock after the sale  (85 out of 200 shares, or 42.5%) is not less than 80 percent of his  percentage of ownership of X's voting stock before the sale (100 out of  200 shares, or 50%), the transfer is not ``substantially  disproportionate'' as to him as provided in section 302(b)(2). Under  these facts, and assuming that section 302(b)(1) is not applicable, the  entire $50,000 is treated as a dividend to A to the extent of the  earnings and profits of corporation Y. The basis of the corporation X  stock to corporation Y is $10,000, its adjusted basis to A. The amount  of $10,000 is added to the basis of the stock of corporation Y in the  hands of A.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) except that A  sells 80 shares of corporation X stock to corporation Y, and the sale  occurs before August 31, 1964. After the sale, A is considered as owning  corporation X stock as follows: (i) 20 shares directly, and (ii) 90  shares indirectly, since by virtue of his 50-percent ownership of Y he  constructively owns 50 percent of the 80 shares owned directly by Y and  50 percent of the 100 shares attributed to Y because they are owned by  Y's stockholder, B. Since after the sale A owns a total of more than 50  percent of the voting power of all of the outstanding stock of X (110  out of 200 shares, or 55%), the transfer is not ``substantially  disproportionate'' as to him as provided in section 302(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation X and corporation Y each have outstanding 100  shares of common stock. A, an individual, owns one-half the stock of  corporation X, and C owns one-half the stock of corporation Y. A, B, and  C are unrelated. A sells 30 shares of the stock of corporation X to  corporation Y for $50,000, such stock having an adjusted basis of  $10,000 to him. After the sale, A is considered as owning 35 shares of  the stock of corporation X (20 shares directly and 15 constructively  because one-half of the 30 shares owned by corporation Y are attributed  to him). Since before the sale he owned 50 percent of the stock of  corporation X and after the sale he owned directly and constructively  only 35 percent of such stock, the redemption is substantially  disproportionate as to him pursuant to the provisions of section  302(b)(2). He, therefore, realizes a gain of $40,000 ($50,000 minus  $10,000). If the stock surrendered is a capital asset, such gain is  long-term or short-term capital gain depending on the period of time  that such stock was held. The basis to A for the stock of corporation Y  is not changed as a result of the entire transaction. The basis to  corporation Y for the stock of corporation X is $50,000, i.e., the basis  of the transferor ($10,000), increased in the amount of gain recognized  to the transferor ($40,000) on the transfer.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. Corporation X and corporation Y each have outstanding 100  shares of common stock. H, an individual, W, his wife, S, his son, and  G, his grandson, each own 25 shares of stock of each corporation. H  sells all of his 25 shares of stock of corporation X to corporation Y.  Since both before and after the transaction H owned directly and  constructively 100 percent of the stock of corporation X, and assuming  that section 302(b)(1) is not applicable, the amount received by him for  his stock of corporation X is treated as a dividend to him to the extent  of the earnings and profits of corporation Y.
