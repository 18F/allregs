                            <p class="depth0">Work funded under this Program must meet the requirements of Federal  interest and Corps responsibility set forth in one of the legislative  authorities referenced in Sec. 263.13. Any project recommended must be  justified under established Federal planning criteria, must be complete  in itself and must not obligate the Federal government to future work  except for those cases in which maintenance by the Federal government is  provided by applicable provisions of general law. Eligibility is not  permitted for the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Projects specifically authorized by Congress. The Program will  not be used to implement any portion of a project specifically  authorized by Congress, including postauthorization changes to such  projects. However, once a project has been completed to the full extent  permitted by its Congressional authorization, this Program could be  utilized to provide for a new, complete-in-itself improvement which will  not impair or substantially change the purposes of the specifically  authorized project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Existing non-Federal responsibility. This Program may not be  utilized for a project that would in effect nullify or change an  existing condition of non-Federal responsibility required for a project  specifically authorized by Congress, whether constructed or not. Such  changes would require Congressional action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operation and maintenance of non-Federal projects. This Program  may not be used for adoption of a non-Federal project for future  maintenance at Federal expense.</p>
