                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The purpose of fire-protective systems is to give warning of the presence of fire in the protected spaces. To meet this end, the basic requirements of the fire-protective systems are reliability, sturdiness, simplicity of design, ease of servicing, and the ability to withstand shipboard shock and vibration and the adverse effects of sea humidity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards. (1) All fire-protective systems must be designed, constructed, tested, marked, and installed according to the applicable standards under Sec. 161.002-1 and subchapter J (Electrical Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All fire-protective systems must be designed, constructed, tested, marked, and installed according to the applicable standards under Sec. 161.002-1 and subchapter J (Electrical Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All systems must be listed or certified as meeting these standards by an independent laboratory that is accepted by the Commandant under part 159 of this chapter for the testing and listing or certification of fire detection equipment and systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All parts of the system must pass the environmental tests for control and monitoring equipment in either ABS Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels Table 4/11.1 or pass the Category ENV3 tests of Lloyd's Register Type Approval System, Test Specification Number 1, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Those parts of the system that are to be installed in locations requiring exceptional degrees of protection (defined in Sec. 110.15-1 of this chapter) must also pass the salt spray (mist) test in either ABS Rules for Building and Classing Steel Vessels Table 4/11.1; Lloyd's Register Type Approval System, Test Specification No. 1; or ASTM B 117 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 161.002-1) with results as described in corrosion-resistant finish in Sec. 110.15-1 of this chapter.
