                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Some definitions and standards of identity for foods set forth below  require that designated optional ingredients such as spices, flavorings,  colorings, emulsifiers, flavor enhancers, stabilizers, preservatives,  and sweeteners be declared in a specified manner on the label wherever  the name of the standardized food appears on the label so conspicuously  as to be easily seen under customary conditions of purchase. Such  requirements shall apply to a manufacturer, packer, or distributor of a  standardized food only if the words or statements on the label of the  standardized food significantly differentiate between two or more foods  that comply with the same standard by describing the optional forms or  varieties, the packing medium, or significant characterizing ingredients  present in the food.
