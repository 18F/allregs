The scale tank also  must be equipped with a suitable device so that the volume of the  contents can be quickly and accurately determined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The requirement to mount tanks on scales does not apply to tanks  having a capacity of 55 gallons or less. Such tanks may be moved onto an  accurately calibrated scale when a tax determination gauge needs to be  made.  (26 U.S.C. 5006, 5204, 5505)</p>
