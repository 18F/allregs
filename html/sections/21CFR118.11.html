If any information you previously submitted that was correct at the time of submission subsequently changes, you must update your facility's registration within 60 calendar days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Your facility is considered registered once FDA enters your facility's registration data into the registration system and the system generates a registration number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Registration by CD-ROM for multiple submissions. If, for example, you do not have reasonable access to the Internet through any of the methods provided under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, you may register by CD-ROM.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Registrants submitting their registrations in CD-ROM format must use ISO 9660 (CD-R or CD-RW) data format.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> These files must be submitted on a portable document format (PDF) rendition of the registration form (FDA Form No. 3733) and be accompanied by one signed copy of the certification statement that appears on the registration form.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each submission on the CD-ROM must contain the same preferred mailing address in the appropriate block on FDA Form No. 3733.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A CD-ROM may contain registrations for as many facilities as needed up to the CD-ROM's capacity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The registration on the CD-ROM for each separate facility must have a unique file name up to 32 characters long, the first part of which may be used to identify the parent company.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You must mail the CD-ROM to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, 5600 Fishers Lane (HFS-681), Rockville, MD 20857.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> If FDA receives a CD-ROM that does not comply with these specifications, it will return the CD-ROM to the submitter unprocessed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> FDA will enter CD-ROM submissions that comply with these specifications into its registration system, along with the complete and legible mailed and faxed submissions, as soon as practicable, in the order FDA receives them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> For each facility on the CD-ROM, FDA will mail to the preferred mailing address a copy of the registration(s) as entered, confirmation of registration, and each facility's assigned registration number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> If any information you previously submitted was incorrect at the time of submission, you must immediately update your facility's registration. If any information you previously submitted that was correct at the time of submission subsequently changes, you must update your facility's registration within 60 calendar days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Your facility is considered registered once FDA enters your facility's registration data into the registration system and the system generates a registration number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No registration fee is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must submit all registration information in the English language.

Each registration must include the name of the individual registering the farm submitting the registration, and the individual's signature (for paper and CD-ROM options).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Registered egg producers must submit an update to a registration within 60-calendar days of any change to any of the information previously submitted by any of the means as provided in Sec. 118.11(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Registered egg producers must notify FDA within 120 days of ceasing egg production by completing sections 1b, 1c, and 2 of Form 3733.
