                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certification requirement. Each affected wood heater must be certified to be in compliance with the applicable emission standards and other requirements of this subpart. For each model line manufactured or sold by a single entity (e.g., company or manufacturer), compliance with applicable emission standards of Sec. 60.532 must be determined based on testing of representative affected wood heaters within the model line. If one entity licenses a model line to another entity, each entity's model line must be certified. If an entity intends to change the name of the entity or the name of the model, the manufacturer must apply for a new certification 60 days before the intended name change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for model lines meeting the requirements of paragraph (h)(1) of this section, on or after May 15, 2015, the manufacturer must submit to the Administrator the information required in paragraph (b) of this section and follow either the certification process in paragraphs (c) through (e) of this section or the third-party certifier-based application process specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or after May 16, 2016, the manufacturer must submit the information required in paragraph (b) of this section and follow the third-party certifier-based application process specified in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for a certificate of compliance. Any manufacturer of an affected wood heater must apply to the Administrator for a certificate of compliance for each model line. The application must be submitted to: WoodHeaterReports@epa.gov.
