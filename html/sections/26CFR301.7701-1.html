                                Sec. 301.7701-1  Classification of organizations for federal tax
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Organizations for federal tax purposes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  Internal Revenue Code prescribes the classification of various  organizations for federal tax purposes. Whether an organization is an  entity separate from its owners for federal tax purposes is a matter of  federal tax law and does not depend on whether the organization is  recognized as an entity under local law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain joint undertakings give rise to entities for federal tax  purposes. A joint venture or other contractual arrangement may create a  separate entity for federal tax purposes if the participants carry on a  trade, business, financial operation, or venture and divide the profits  therefrom. For example, a separate entity exists for federal tax  purposes if co- owners of an apartment building lease space and in  addition provide services to the occupants either directly or through an  agent. Nevertheless, a joint undertaking merely to share expenses does  not create a separate entity for federal tax   purposes. For example, if two or more persons jointly construct a ditch  merely to drain surface water from their properties, they have not  created a separate entity for federal tax purposes. Similarly, mere co- ownership of property that is maintained, kept in repair, and rented or  leased does not constitute a separate entity for federal tax purposes.  For example, if an individual owner, or tenants in common, of farm  property lease it to a farmer for a cash rental or a share of the crops,  they do not necessarily create a separate entity for federal tax  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain local law entities not recognized. An entity formed  under local law is not always recognized as a separate entity for  federal tax purposes. For example, an organization wholly owned by a  State is not recognized as a separate entity for federal tax purposes if  it is an integral part of the State. Similarly, tribes incorporated  under section 17 of the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, as amended,  25 U.S.C. 477, or under section 3 of the Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act, as  amended, 25 U.S.C. 503, are not recognized as separate entities for  federal tax purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Single owner organizations. Under Sec. Sec. 301.7701-2 and  301.7701-3, certain organizations that have a single owner can choose to  be recognized or disregarded as entities separate from their owners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification of organizations. The classification of  organizations that are recognized as separate entities is determined  under Sec. Sec. 301.7701-2, 301.7701-3, and 301.7701-4 unless a  provision of the Internal Revenue Code (such as section 860A addressing  Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits (REMICs)) provides for special  treatment of that organization. For the classification of organizations  as trusts, see Sec. 301.7701-4. That section provides that trusts  generally do not have associates or an objective to carry on business  for profit. Sections 301.7701-2 and 301.7701-3 provide rules for  classifying organizations that are not classified as trusts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost sharing arrangements. A cost sharing arrangement that is  described in Sec. 1.482-7 of this chapter, including any arrangement  that the Commissioner treats as a CSA under Sec. 1.482-7(b)(5) of this  chapter, is not recognized as a separate entity for purposes of the  Internal Revenue Code. See Sec. 1.482-7 of this chapter for the rules  regarding CSAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Domestic and foreign business entities. See Sec. 301.7701-5 for  the rules that determine whether a business entity is domestic or  foreign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State. For purposes of this section and Sec. 301.7701-2, the  term State includes the District of Columbia.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability dates. Except as provided in the  following sentence, the rules of this section are applicable as of  January 1, 1997. The rules of paragraph (c) of this section are  applicable on January 5, 2009.  [T.D. 8697, 61 FR 66588, Dec. 18, 1996, as amended by T.D. 9153, 69 FR  49810, Aug. 12, 2004; T.D. 9246, 71 FR 4816, Jan. 30, 2006; T.D. 9441,  74 FR 390, Jan. 5, 2009; T.D. 9568, 76 FR 80136, Dec. 22, 2011]</p>
