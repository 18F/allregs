An election made under section 1362(a) is terminated if the corporation revokes the election for any taxable year of the corporation for which the election is effective, including the first taxable year. A revocation may be made only with the consent of shareholders who, at the time the revocation is made, hold more than one-half of the number of issued and outstanding shares of stock (including non-voting stock) of the corporation.

See Sec. 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of revoking an election made under section 1362(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When effective--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a revocation made during the taxable year and before the 16th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective on the first day of the taxable year and a revocation made after the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective for the following taxable year. If a corporation makes an election to be an S corporation that is to be effective beginning with the next taxable year and revokes its election on or before the first day of the next taxable year, the corporation is deemed to have revoked its election on the first day of the next taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section, a revocation made during the taxable year and before the 16th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective on the first day of the taxable year and a revocation made after the 15th day of the third month of the taxable year is effective for the following taxable year. If a corporation makes an election to be an S corporation that is to be effective beginning with the next taxable year and revokes its election on or before the first day of the next taxable year, the corporation is deemed to have revoked its election on the first day of the next taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Revocations specifying a prospective revocation date. If a corporation specifies a date for revocation and the date is expressed in terms of a stated day, month, and year that is on or after the date the revocation is filed, the revocation is effective on and after the date so specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect on taxable year of corporation. In the case of a corporation that revokes its election to be an S corporation effective on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election is to be effective, any statement made with the election regarding a change in the corporation's taxable year has no effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Rescission of a revocation. A corporation may rescind a revocation made under paragraph (a)(2) of this section at any time before the revocation becomes effective. A rescission may be made only with the consent of each person who consented to the revocation and by each person who became a shareholder of the corporation within the period beginning on the first day after the date the revocation was made

and ending on the date on which the rescission is made. See Sec. 1.1362-6(a) for rules concerning the time and manner of rescinding a revocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Termination by reason of corporation ceasing to be a small business corporation--(1) In general. If a corporation ceases to be a small business corporation, as defined in section 1361(b), at any time on or after the first day of the first taxable year for which its election under section 1362(a) is effective, the election terminates.

If an election terminates because of a specific event that causes the corporation to fail to meet the definition of a small business corporation, the termination is effective as of the date on which the event occurs. If a corporation makes an election to be an S corporation that is effective beginning with the following taxable year and is not a small business corporation on the first day of that following taxable year, the election is treated as having terminated on that first day. If a corporation is a small business corporation on the first day of the taxable year for which its election is effective, its election does not terminate even if the corporation was not a small business corporation during all or part of the period beginning after the date the election was made and ending before the first day of the taxable year for which the election is effective.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effect on taxable year of corporation. In the case of a corporation that fails to meet the definition of a small business corporation on the first day of the first taxable year for which its election to be an S corporation is to be effective, any statement made with the election regarding a change in the corporation's taxable year has no effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Termination by reason of excess passive investment income--(1) In general.

For purposes of this paragraph (c), gross receipts from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities are taken into account only to the extent of gains therefrom. In addition, for purposes of computing gross receipts from sales or exchanges of stock or securities, losses do not offset gains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of certain liquidations.

In applying this rule, the S corporation's distributive share of gain from the sale of stock or securities held by the partnership is not reduced to reflect any loss that would be recognized from the sale of stock or securities held by the partnership. In the case of tiered partnerships, the rules of this section apply by looking through each tier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(4)(ii) of this section, if an S corporation disposes of a general partner interest, the gain on the disposition is treated as gain from the sale of stock or securities to the extent of the amount the S corporation would have received as a distributive share of gain from the sale of stock or securities held by the partnership if all of the stock and securities held by the partnership had been sold by the partnership at fair market value at the time the S corporation disposes of the general partner interest.

In general, passive investment income means gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and gains from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In general, passive investment income means gross receipts (as defined in paragraph (c)(4) of this section) derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, and gains from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definitions.

See Sec. 1.1362-8 for special rules regarding the treatment of dividends received by an S corporation from a C corporation in which the S corporation holds stock meeting the requirements of section 1504(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Interest--(1) In general. Interest means any amount received for the use of money (including tax-exempt interest and amounts treated as interest under section 483, 1272, 1274, or 7872).

However, interest earned from the investment of idle funds in short-term securities does not constitute gross receipts directly derived in the ordinary course of business. Similarly, a dealer's income or gain from an item of property is not directly derived in the ordinary course of its trade or business if the dealer held the property for investment at any time before the income or gain is recognized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Payment to a patron of a cooperative. Passive investment income does not include amounts included in the gross income of a patron of a cooperative (within the meaning of section 1381(a), without regard to paragraph (2) (A) or (C) of section 1381(a)) by reason of any payment or allocation to the patron based on patronage occurring in the case of a trade or business of the patron.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The principles of paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section are illustrated by the following examples. Unless otherwise provided in an example, S is an S corporation with subchapter C earnings and profits, and S's gross receipts from operations are gross receipts not derived from royalties, rents, dividends, interest, annuities, or gains from the sales or exchanges of stock or securities. S is a calendar year taxpayer and its first taxable year as an S corporation is 1993.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> S uses an accrual method of accounting and sells:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A depreciable asset, held for more than 6 months, which is used in the corporation's business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A capital asset (other than stock or securities) for a gain;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A capital asset (other than stock or securities) for a loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Securities.

S receives payment for each asset partly in money and partly in the form of a note payable at a future time, and elects not to report the sales on the installment method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of money and the face amount (or issue price if different) of the note received for the business asset are considered gross receipts in the taxable year of sale and are not reduced by the adjusted basis of the property, costs of sale, or any other amount. With respect to the sales of the capital assets, gross receipts include the cash down payment and face amount (or issue price if different) of any notes, but only to the extent of S's capital gain net income. In the case of the sale of the securities, gross receipts include the cash down payment and face amount (or issue price if different) of the notes, but only to the extent of gain on the sale. In determining gross receipts from sales of securities, losses are not netted against gains.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Long-term contract reported on percentage-of-completion method. S has a long-term contract as defined in Sec. 1.460-1(b)(1) with respect to which it reports income according to the percentage-of-completion method as described in Sec. 1.460-4(b). The portion of the gross contract price which corresponds to the percentage of the entire contract which has been completed during the taxable year is included in S's gross receipts for the year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Income reported on installment sale method. For its 1993 taxable year, S sells personal property on the installment plan and elects to report its taxable income from the sale of the property (other than property qualifying as a capital asset or stock or securities) on the installment method in accordance with section 453. The installment payment actually received in a given taxable year of S is included in gross receipts for the year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Partnership interests. In 1993, S and two of its shareholders contribute cash to form a general partnership, PRS. S receives a 50 percent interest in the capital and profits of PRS. S formed PRS to indirectly invest in marketable stocks and securities. The only assets of PRS are the stock and securities, and certain real and tangible personal property. In 1994, S needs cash in its business and sells its partnership interest at

a gain rather than having PRS sell the marketable stock or securities that have appreciated. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(B)(4) of this section, the gain on S's disposition of its interest is PRS is treated as gain from the sale or exchange of stock or securities to the extent of the amount the distributive share of gain S would have received from the sale of stock or securities held by PRS if PRS had sold all of its stock or securities at fair market value at the time S disposed of its interest in PRS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1993, S has gross receipts of $75,000. Of this amount, $5,000 is from royalty payments with respect to Trademark A, $8,000 is from royalty payments with respect to Trademark B, and $62,000 is gross receipts from operations. S created Trademark A, but S did not create Trademark B or perform significant services or incur substantial costs with respect to the development or marketing of Trademark B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because S created Trademark A, the royalty payments with respect to Trademark A are derived in the ordinary course of S's business and are not included within the definition of royalties for purposes of determining S's passive investment income. However, the royalty payments with respect to Trademark B are included within the definition of royalties for purposes of determining S's passive investment income. See paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(A) of this section. S's passive investment income for the year is $8,000, and S's passive investment income percentage for the taxable year is 10.67% ($8,000/$75,000). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1993, S receives dividends of $10,000 on stock of corporations P and O, recognizes a gain of $25,000 on sale of the P stock, and recognizes a loss of $12,000 on sale of the O stock. S held the P and O stock for investment, rather than for sale in the ordinary course of a trade or business. S has gross receipts from operations and from gain on the sale of stock in the ordinary course of its trade or business of $110,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S's gross receipts are calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">$110,000  Gross receipts from operations and from gain on the sale of</p><p class="depth0">stock in the ordinary course of a trade or business</p><p class="depth0">10,000  Gross dividend receipts</p><p class="depth0">25,000  Gain on sale of P stock (Loss on O stock not taken into</p><p class="depth0">account-----------</p><p class="depth0">145,000  Total gross receipts</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S's passive investment income is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0">$10,000  Gross dividend receipts</p><p class="depth0">25,000  Gain on sale of P stock (Loss on O stock not taken into</p><p class="depth0">account-----------</p><p class="depth0">35,000  Total passive investment income</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> S's passive investment income percentage for its first year as an S corporation is 24.1% ($35,000/$145,000). This does not exceed 25 percent of S's gross receipts and consequently the three-year period described in section 1362(d)(3) does not begin to run.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1993, S receives $6,000 of interest on accounts receivable arising from S's sales of inventory property. S also received dividends with respect to stock held for investment of $1,500. In addition, S sells two parcels of real property (Property J and Property K) that S had purchased and held for investment. S sells Property J, in which S has a basis of $5,000, for $10,000 (a gain of $5,000). S sells Property K, in which S has a basis of $12,000, for $9,000 (a loss of $3,000). S has gross receipts from operations of $90,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> S's gross receipts are calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">$90,000  Gross receipts from operations</p><p class="depth0">6,000  Gross interest receipts</p><p class="depth0">1,500  Gross dividend receipts</p><p class="depth0">2,000  Net gain on sale of real property investments-----------</p><p class="depth0">$99,500  Total gross receipts</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(5)(ii)(D) of this section, S's gross interest receipts are not passive investment income. In addition, gain on the sale of real property ($2,000) is not passive investment income. S's passive investment income includes only the $1,500 of gross dividend receipts. Accordingly, S's passive investment income percentage for its first year as an S corporation is 1.51% ($1,500/$99,500).
