                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. Any critically undercapitalized insured depository institution shall submit an application to engage in certain restricted activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Content of filing. Applications to engage in any of the following activities, as set forth in sections 38(i)(2) (A) through (G) of the FDI Act, shall describe the proposed activity and explain how the activity would further the purposes of section 38 of the FDI Act (12 U.S.C. 1831o):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Enter into any material transaction other than in the usual course of business including any action with respect to which the institution is required to provide notice to the appropriate federal banking agency. Materiality will be determined on a case-by-case basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extend credit for any highly leveraged transaction. A highly leveraged transaction means an extension of credit to or investment in a business by an insured depository institution where the financing transaction involves a buyout, acquisition, or recapitalization of an existing business and one of the following criteria is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transaction results in a liabilities-to-assets leverage ratio higher than 75 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The transaction at least doubles the subject company's liabilities and results in a liabilities-to-assets leverage ratio higher than 50 percent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The transaction is designated an highly leverage transaction by a syndication agent or a federal bank regulator.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Loans and exposures to any obligor in which the total financing package, including all obligations held by all participants is $20 million or more, or such lower level as the FDIC may establish by order on a case-by-case basis, will be excluded from this definition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amend the institution's charter or bylaws, except to the extent necessary to carry out any other requirement of any law, regulation, or order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Make any material change in accounting methods;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Engage in any covered transaction (as defined in section 23A(b) of the Federal Reserve Act (12 U.S.C. 371c(b));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Pay excessive compensation or bonuses. Part 364 of this chapter provides guidance for determining excessive compensation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Pay interest on new or renewed liabilities at a rate that would increase the institution's weighted average cost of funds to a level significantly exceeding the prevailing rates of interest on insured deposits in the institution's normal market area. Section 337.6 of this chapter (Brokered deposits) provides guidance for defining the relevant terms of this provision; however this provision does not supersede the general prohibitions contained in Sec. 337.6.
