NSF may seek the assistance of any involved State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NSF will put any agreement in writing and have it signed by the  parties and an authorized official of NSF.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A settlement shall not affect other enforcement efforts of NSF,  including compliance reviews, or individual complaints that involve the  recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A settlement is not a finding of discrimination against the  recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Formal investigation. If NSF cannot resolve the complaint  through informal investigation, it will begin to develop formal findings  through further investigation of the complaint. If the investigation  indicates a violation of the Act, NSF will try to obtain voluntary  compliance. If NSF cannot obtain voluntary compliance, it will begin  enforcement as described in Sec. 617.12. If the investigation does not  indicate a violation of the Act, NSF will issue a written determination  in favor of the recipient.
