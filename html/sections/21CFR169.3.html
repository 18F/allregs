                            <p class="depth0">For the purposes of this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The term vanilla beans means the properly cured and dried fruit  pods of Vanilla planifolia Andrews and of Vanilla tahitensis Moore.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The term unit weight of vanilla beans means, in the case of  vanilla   beans containing not more than 25 percent moisture, 13.35 ounces of such  beans; and, in the case of vanilla beans containing more than 25 percent  moisture, it means the weight of such beans equivalent in content of  moisture-free vanilla-bean solids to 13.35 ounces of vanilla beans  containing 25 percent moisture. (For example, one unit weight of vanilla  beans containing 33.25 percent moisture amounts to 15 ounces.) The  moisture content of vanilla beans is determined by the method prescribed  in ``Official Methods of Analysis of the Association of Official  Analytical Chemists,'' 13th Ed. (1980), sections 7.004 and 7.005, which  is incorporated by reference, except that the toluene used is blended  with 20 percent by volume of benzene and the total distillation time is  4 hours. Copies of the material incorporated by reference may be  obtained from the AOAC INTERNATIONAL, 481 North Frederick Ave., suite  500, Gaithersburg, MD 20877, or may be examined at the National Archives  and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability  of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: http:// www.archives.gov/federal_register/code_of_federal_regulations/ ibr_locations.html. To prepare samples for analysis, the pods are  chopped into pieces approximately \1/4\-inch in longest dimension, using  care to avoid moisture change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The term unit of vanilla constituent means the total sapid and  odorous principles extractable from one unit weight of vanilla beans, as  defined in paragraph (b) of this section, by an aqueous alcohol solution  in which the content of ethyl alcohol by volume amounts to not less than  35 percent.
