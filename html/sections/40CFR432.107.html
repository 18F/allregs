If a renderer does cure hide, the following formulas should be used to calculate BOD5 and TSS limitations for process wastewater associated with cattle hide curing, in addition to the limitation specified in paragraph (a) of this section:
lbs BOD5/1000 lbs RM = 7.9 x (no. of hides)/lbs RMkg BOD5/kkg RM = 3.6 x (no. of hides)/kg RMlbs TSS/1000 lbs RM = 13.6 x (no. of hides)/lbs RMkg TSS/kkg RM = 6.2 x (no. of hides)/kg RM</p>
