The notice must include a statement that all responsible  sources may submit a response which, if timely received, must be  considered by the agency. The information must be posted not later than  the date the solicitation is issued, and must remain posted for at least  10 days or until after quotations have been opened, whichever is later.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If solicitations are posted instead of a notice, the contracting  officer may employ various methods of satisfying the requirements of  5.207(c). For example, the contracting officer may meet the requirements  of 5.207(c) by stamping the solicitation, by a cover sheet to the  solicitation, or by placing a general statement in the display room.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The contracting officer need not comply with the display  requirements of this section when the exemptions at 5.202(a)(1), (a)(4)  through (a)(9), or (a)(11) apply, when oral solicitations are used, or  when providing access to a notice of proposed contract action and  solicitation through the GPE and the notice permits the public to  respond to the solicitation electronically.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contracting officers may use electronic posting of  requirements in a place accessible by the general public at the  Government installation to satisfy the public display requirement.  Contracting offices using electronic systems for public posting that are  not accessible outside the installation must periodically publicize the  methods for accessing the information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, one or more of the following methods may be used:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preparing periodic handouts listing proposed contracts, and  displaying them as in 5.101(a)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assisting local trade associations in disseminating information  to their members.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Making brief announcements of proposed contracts to newspapers,  trade journals, magazines, or other mass communication media for  publication without cost to the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Placing paid advertisements in newspapers or other  communications media, subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contracting officers shall place paid advertisements of proposed  contracts only when it is anticipated that effective competition cannot  be obtained otherwise (see 5.205(d)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contracting officers shall not place advertisements of proposed  contracts in a newspaper published and printed in the District of  Columbia unless the supplies or services will be furnished, or the labor  performed, in the District of Columbia or adjoining counties in Maryland  or Virginia (44 U.S.C. 3701).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Advertisements published in newspapers must be under proper  written authority in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3702 (see 5.502(a)).
