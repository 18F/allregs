                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of section 9.4);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How are biosafety concerns addressed? The sanctuary shall  institute and administer an effective biosafety program that addresses  the biosafety hazards at that particular site. The program shall include  identifying biohazards, outlining practices and procedures to be  followed, providing personal safety equipment or protective clothing and  equipment, and establishing a description of the facility requirements  for working with hazardous agents or materials. Policies and procedures  must be implemented to avoid exposure to environmental and animal  hazards. Biosafety must be included in the training program for all  Sanctuary employees. In establishing a program, the Sanctuary must use  current accepted practices and publications prepared by the CDC, NIH,  and professional societies specializing in biosafety. The input and  guidance of personnel trained or experienced in biosafety are essential.  Complete records of both clinical and experimental agent exposure must  accompany each chimpanzee sent to the sanctuary. The donating facility  must also provide recent testing (for example, serology, virus culture,  histology) so that the sanctuary staff is fully aware of the health  condition of the arriving chimpanzee. The records may be created and  retained in electronic form.</p>
