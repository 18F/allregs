If the costs  actually incurred exceed the estimate paid at the time of application,  reimbursement by the applicant of such additional costs shall be due  within 30 days of receiving notice from the Regional Director of the  additional amount due. If the actual costs incurred are less than the  estimate paid by the applicant, the excess shall be refunded to the  applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant's plan is approved, the applicant shall pay an  estimate made by the Regional Director of the costs which will be  incurred by the Department in preparing and issuing to the applicant a  special use permit. The first quarterly payment made by the applicant  pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section will be adjusted upward or  downward, as warranted, to accurately reflect the actual costs incurred  by the Department in processing the permit. If an applicant withdraws  after its plan is approved, but before its special use permit is issued,  the applicant shall be responsible for such costs incurred by the  Department in preparing the applicant's permit up to the date on which  the Regional Director receives written notice of the applicant's  withdrawal and for costs subsequently incurred by the Department in  terminating permit preparation and issuance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When two or more applications are filed which the Regional  Director determines to be in competition with each other, each applicant  shall reimburse the Department for such actual costs incurred in  processing its exploration plan and special use permit, if issued,  except that those costs which   are not readily identifiable with one of the applicants, shall be paid  by each of the applicants in equal shares.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon issuance of a special use permit, the permittee shall make  an initial advance payment covering that current fiscal year quarter and  quarterly payments thereafter to cover the actual costs incurred by the  Department in administering the permittee's permit for its duration.  Such costs shall include, but are not limited to, those direct costs and  indirect costs, as established by the indirect costs rate of the  charging bureau or office, incurred in reviewing and acting on  permittee's plan(s) of operation; reviewing evidence of the permittee's  compliance with any order given by the Regional Director under Sec.   37.13; preparing and issuing the permittee's special use permit;  inspecting, monitoring, and enforcing the permittee's compliance with  its approved exploration plan, plan(s) of operation, special use permit  and this part; performing the permittee's obligations pursuant to Sec.   37.31(a); and identifying, evaluating and preserving historic,  archeological and cultural resources in areas to be explored by the  permittee. Each quarterly payment will be paid at the outset of the  quarter and will cover the estimated cost of that quarter as adjusted by  the Regional Director by reason of any adjustment warranted by paragraph  (b) of this section or by overpayments or underpayments in previous  quarters for which adjustment has not already been made. Upon  termination of the permittee's special use permit, reimbursement or  refundment of any outstanding amounts due the Department or the  permittee shall be made within 180 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Estimates required by this section shall be made by the Regional  Director on the basis of the best available cost information. However,  reimbursement shall not be limited to the Regional Director's estimate  if actual costs exceed projected estimates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All payments required by this section shall be made payable to  the Service. No applicant or permittee shall set off or otherwise deduct  any debt due to or any sum claimed to be owed to it by the United States  from any payment required by this section. Overpayments shall be  credited or refunded to the person making them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When through partnership, joint venture or other business  arrangement more than one person applies for or participates in a  special use permit, each shall be jointly and severally liable for  reimbursing the Department's cost under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Any lodging, food, communication, and transportation provided by  a permittee under Sec.  37.42 shall be deemed to be costs paid to the  Department in kind for services rendered in inspecting and monitoring  the permittee's exploratory activities. At the end of each quarter, the  permittee shall furnish the Regional Director with a report, in a format  approved or prescribed by him, on the goods and services provided during  that quarter, and the names of the individuals to whom they were  provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Any dispute between an applicant or permittee and the Regional  Director as to costs actually incurred by the Department and charged to  the applicant or permittee shall be finally decided for the Secretary by  the Director, using the procedures described in Sec.  37.22(c).</p>
