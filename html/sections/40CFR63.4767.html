                            <p class="depth0">During the performance test required by Sec. 63.4760 and described in Sec. Sec. 63.4764, 63.4765, and 63.4766, you must establish the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4692 according to this section, unless you have received approval for alternative monitoring and operating limits under Sec. 63.8(f) as specified in Sec. 63.4692.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Thermal oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a thermal oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the combustion temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. You must monitor the temperature in the firebox of the thermal oxidizer or immediately downstream of the firebox before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average combustion temperature maintained during the performance test. This average combustion temperature is the minimum operating limit for your thermal oxidizer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Catalytic oxidizers. If your add-on control device is a catalytic oxidizer, establish the operating limits according to either paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) or paragraphs (b)(3) and (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature before the catalyst bed and the temperature difference across the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed maintained during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an alternative to monitoring the temperature difference across the catalyst bed, you may monitor the temperature at the inlet to the catalyst bed and implement a site-specific inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer as specified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section. During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature before the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature before the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer. (Note: For regenerative catalytic oxidizers, the inlet to the catalyst is defined as the general zone between the inlets to the catalyst beds located in the multiple regeneration towers; select either a monitoring location or multiple monitoring locations. If multiple monitoring locations are selected, either establish separate operating limits for each location or calculate an average of the multiple measurements and set a single operating limit.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s) for which you elect to monitor according to paragraph (b)(3) of this section. The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Annual sampling and analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e, conversion efficiency) following the recommended procedures from the manufacturer, the catalyst supplier, or the catalyst test provider.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monthly inspection of the oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Annual internal and monthly external visual inspection of the catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendation and conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.4766.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carbon adsorbers. If your add-on control device is a carbon adsorber, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must monitor and record the total regeneration desorbing gas (e.g., steam or nitrogen) mass flow for each regeneration cycle, and the carbon bed temperature after each carbon bed regeneration and cooling cycle for the regeneration cycle either immediately preceding or immediately following the performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The operating limits for your carbon adsorber are the minimum total desorbing gas mass flow recorded during the regeneration cycle, and the maximum carbon bed temperature recorded after the cooling cycle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Condensers. If your add-on control device is a condenser, establish the operating limits according to paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average condenser outlet (product side) gas temperature maintained during the performance test. This average condenser outlet gas temperature is the maximum operating limit for your condenser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Concentrators. If your add-on control device includes a concentrator, you must establish operating limits for the concentrator according to paragraphs (e)(1) through (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the desorption concentrate stream gas temperature at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature. This is the minimum operating limit for the desorption concentrate gas stream temperature.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> During the performance test, you must monitor and record the pressure drop of the dilute stream across the concentrator at least once every 15

minutes during each of the three runs of the performance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average pressure drop. This is the maximum operating limit for the dilute stream across the concentrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Emission capture system. For each capture device that is not part of a PTE that meets the criteria of Sec. 63.4765(a), establish an operating limit for either the gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure, as specified in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section. The operating limit for a PTE is specified in Table 3 to this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During the capture efficiency determination required by Sec. 63.4760 and described in Sec. Sec. 63.4764 and 63.4765, you must monitor and record either the gas volumetric flow rate or the duct static pressure for each separate capture device in your emission capture system at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs at a point in the duct between the capture device and the add-on control device inlet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate and record the average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure for the three test runs for each capture device. This average gas volumetric flow rate or duct static pressure is the minimum operating limit for that specific capture device.</p>
