                            <p class="depth0">The respondent may petition the administrative law judge within one  year of the date of the final decision, except where the decision arises  from a default judgment or from a settlement, to reopen an  administrative enforcement proceeding to receive any relevant and  material evidence which was unknown or unobtainable at the time the  proceeding was held. The petition must include a summary of such  evidence, the reasons why it is deemed relevant and material, and the  reasons why it could not have been presented at the time the proceedings  were held. The administrative law judge will grant or deny the petition  after providing other parties reasonable opportunity to comment. If the  proceeding is reopened, the administrative law judge may make such  arrangements as the judge deems appropriate for receiving the new  evidence and completing the record. The administrative law judge will  then issue a new initial or recommended decision and order, and the case  will proceed to final decision and order in accordance with Sec. 766.21  or Sec. 766.22 of this part, as appropriate.</p>
