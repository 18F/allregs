A unit operation may have more than one batch emission episode. For example, a displacement of vapor resulting from the charging of a vessel with HAP will result in a discrete emission episode that will last through the duration of the charge and will have an average flowrate equal to the rate of the charge. If the vessel is then heated, there will also be another discrete emission episode resulting from the expulsion of expanded vapor. Both emission episodes may occur in the same vessel or unit operation. There are possibly other emission episodes that may occur from the vessel or other process components, depending on process operations.</p><p class="depth0">Batch operation means a noncontinuous operation involving intermittent or discontinuous feed into process components, and, in general, involves the emptying of the process components after the operation ceases and prior to beginning a new operation.

If you use Method 301 to validate your proposed alternative method, you must use the procedures described in this method. This method describes the minimum procedures that you must use to validate an alternative test method to meet 40 CFR part 63 compliance requirements. If you choose to propose a validation method other than Method 301, you must submit and obtain the Administrator's approval for the alternative validation method.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 When must I use Method 301?</p><p class="depth0">If you want to use an alternative test method to meet requirements in a subpart of 40 CFR part 63, you can use Method 301 to validate the alternative test method. You must request approval to use this alternative test method according to the procedures in Sections 16 and 63.7(f). You must receive the Administrator's written approval to use the alternative test method before you use the alternative test method to meet requirements under 40 CFR part 63. In some cases, the Administrator may decide to waive the requirement to use Method 301 for alternative test methods. Section 17 describes the requirements for obtaining a waiver.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 What does Method 301 include?</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Procedures. This method includes minimum procedures to determine and document systematic error (bias) and random error (precision) of measured concentrations from exhaust gases, wastewater, sludge, and other media. It contains procedures for ensuring sample stability if such procedures are not included in the test method. This method also includes optional procedures for ruggedness and detection limits.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Definitions.</p><p class="depth0">Affected source means affected source as defined in 40 CFR 63.2 and in the relevant subpart under 40 CFR part 63.</p><p class="depth0">Alternative test method means the sampling and analytical methodology selected for field validation using the method described in this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">Paired sampling system means a sampling system capable of obtaining two replicate samples that were collected as closely as possible in sampling time and sampling location.</p><p class="depth0">Quadruplet sampling system means a sampling system capable of obtaining four replicate samples that were collected as closely as possible in sampling time and sampling location.</p><p class="depth0">Surrogate compound means a compound that serves as a model for the types of compounds being analyzed (i.e., similar chemical structure, properties, behavior). The model can be distinguished by the method from the compounds being analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 How do I perform Method 301?</p><p class="depth0">First, you introduce a known concentration of an analyte or compare the alternative test method against a validated test method to determine the alternative test method's bias. Then, you collect multiple, collocated simultaneous samples to determine the alternative test method's precision. Alternatively, though it is not required, we allow validation testing over a broad range of concentrations over an extended time period to determine precision of a proposed alternative method. Sections 5.0 through 17.0 describe the procedures in detail.</p><p class="depth0">Reference Materials</p><p class="depth0">5.0 What reference materials must I use?</p><p class="depth0">You must use reference materials (a material or substance whose one or more properties are sufficiently homogenous to the analyte) that are traceable to a national standards body (e.g., National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)) at the level of the applicable emission limitation or standard that the subpart in 40 CFR part 63 requires. If you want to expand the applicable range of the method, you must conduct additional runs with higher and lower analyte concentrations. You must obtain information about your analyte according to the procedures in Sections 5.1 through 5.4.</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Exhaust Gas Tests Concentration. You must get a known concentration of each analyte from an independent source such as a speciality gas manufacturer, specialty chemical company, or chemical laboratory. You must also get the manufacturer's certification for the analyte concentration and stability.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Tests for Other Waste Media. You must get the pure liquid components of each analyte from an independent manufacturer. The manufacturer must certify the purity and shelf life of the pure liquid components. You must dilute the pure liquid components in the same type medium as the waste from the affected source.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Surrogate Analytes. If you demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that a surrogate compound behaves as the analyte does, then you may use surrogate compounds for highly toxic or reactive compounds. A surrogate may be an isotope or one that contains a unique element (for example, chlorine) that is not present in the source or a derivation of the toxic or reactive compound if the derivative formation is part of the method's procedure. You may use laboratory experiments or literature data to show behavioral acceptability.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Isotopically Labeled Materials. Isotope mixtures may contain the isotope and the natural analyte. The isotope labeled analyte concentration must be more than five times the natural concentration of the analyte.</p><p class="depth0">Sampling Procedures</p><p class="depth0">6.0 What sampling procedures must I use?</p><p class="depth0">You may determine bias and precision by comparing against a validated test method, using isotopic sampling, or using analyte spiking (or the equivalent). Isotopic sampling can only be used for procedures requiring mass spectrometry or radiological procedures. You must collect samples according to the requirements in Table 1. You must perform the sampling according to the procedures in Sections 6.1 through 6.4.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Isotopic Spiking. Spike all 12 samples with the analyte at the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63. If there is no applicable emission limitation or standard, spike at the expected level of the samples. Follow the

appropriate spiking procedures in Sections 6.3.1 through 6.3.2 for the applicable waste medium.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Analyte Spiking. In each quadruplet set, spike half of the samples (two out of the four) with the analyte according to the applicable procedure in Section 6.3.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Spiking Procedure.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 Gaseous Analyte with Sorbent or Impinger Sampling Trains. Sample the analyte (in the laboratory or in the field) at a concentration that is close to the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR Part 63 (or the expected sample concentration where there is no standard) for the time required by the method, and then sample the gas stream for an equal amount of time. The time for sampling both the analyte and gas stream should be equal; however, the time should be adjusted to avoid sorbent breakthrough. The stack gas and the gaseous analyte may be sampled at the same time. The analyte must be introduced as close to the tip of the sampling train as possible.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 Gaseous Analyte with Sample Container (Bag or Canister). Spike the sample containers after completion of each test run with an amount equal to the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (or the expected sample concentration where there is no standard). The final concentration of the analyte would be approximately equal to the analyte concentration in the stack plus the applicable emission standard (corrected for spike volume). The volume amount of analyte must be less than 10 percent of the sample volume.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.3 Liquid and Solid Analyte with Sorbent or Impinger Trains. Spike the trains with an amount equal to the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (or the expected sample concentration where there is no standard) before sampling the stack gas. If possible, do the spiking in the field. If it is not possible to do the spiking in the field, you can do it in the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.4 Liquid and Solid Analyte with Sample Container (Bag or Canister). Spike the containers at the completion of each test run with an amount equal to the concentration in the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 (or the expected sample concentration where there is no standard).</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Probe Placement and Arrangement for Stationary Source Stack or Duct Sampling. To sample a stationary source as defined in 40 CFR 63.2, you must place the probe according to the procedures in this subsection. You must place the probes in the same horizontal plane.</p><p class="depth0">6.4.1 Paired Sampling Probes. For paired sampling probes, the probe tip should be 2.5 cm from the outside edge of the other sample probe, with a pitot tube on the outside of each probe. The Administrator may approve a validation request where other paired arrangements for the pitot tube (where required) are used.</p><p class="depth0">6.4.2 Quadruplet Sampling Probes. For quadruplet sampling probes, the tips should be in a 6.0 cm x 6.0 cm square area measured from the center line of the opening of the probe tip with a single pitot tube (where required) in the center or two pitot tubes (where required) with their location on either side of the probe tip configuration. You must propose an alternative arrangement whenever the cross-sectional area of the probe tip configuration is approximately five percent or more of the stack or duct cross-sectional area.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 How do I ensure sample stability?</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Developing Storage and Analysis Procedures. If the alternative test method includes well-established procedures supported by experimental data for sample storage and the time within which the collected samples must be analyzed, you must store the samples according to the procedures in the alternative test method. You are not required to conduct the procedures in Section 7.2 or 7.3. If the alternative test method does not include such procedures, you must propose procedures for storing and analyzing samples to ensure sample stability. At a minimum, your proposed procedures must meet the requirements in Section 7.2 or 7.3. The minimum storage time should be as soon as possible, but no longer than 72 hours after collection of the sample. The maximum storage time should be no longer than two weeks.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Storage and Sampling Procedures for Stack Test Emissions. You must store and analyze samples of stack test emissions according to Table 3. If you are using analyte spiking procedures, you must include equal numbers of spiked and unspiked samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Storage and Sampling Procedures for Testing Other Waste Media (e.g., Soil/Sediment, Solid Waste, Water/Liquid). You must analyze half of the replicate samples at the proposed minimum storage time and the other half at the proposed maximum storage time or within two weeks of the initial analysis to identify the effect of storage times on analyte samples. The minimum storage time should be as soon as possible, but no longer than seven days after collection of the sample.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Sample Stability. After you have conducted sampling and analysis according to Section 7.2 or 7.3, compare the results at the minimum and maximum storage times. Calculate the difference in the results using Equation 301-1.

Where:di = difference between the results of the ith sample.Rmini = results from the ith sample at the minimum storage time.Rmaxi = results from the ith sample at the maximum storage time.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.1 Standard Deviation. Determine the standard deviation (SDd) of the differences (di's) of the paired samples using Equation 301-2.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.003
Where:
di = The difference between the results of the ith sample, Rmini - Rmaxi.dm = The mean of the paired sample differences.n = Total number of paired samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.4.2 t Test. Test the difference in the results for statistical significance by calculating the t-statistic and determining if the mean of the differences between the initial results and the results after storage is significant at the 95 percent confidence level and n - 1 degrees of freedom. Calculate the value of the t-statistic using Equation 301-3.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.004
Where:
n = The total number of paired samples.</p><p class="depth0">Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value of the t-statistic from Table 2. If the calculated t-value is less than the critical value, the difference is not statistically significant; thus, the sampling and analysis procedure ensures stability, and you may submit a request for validation of the proposed alternative test method. If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, the difference is statistically significant, and you must repeat the procedures in Section 7.2 or 7.3 with new samples using shorter proposed maximum storage times.</p><p class="depth0">Bias and Precision</p><p class="depth0">8.0 What are the requirements for bias?</p><p class="depth0">You must establish bias by comparing the results of the sampling using the alternative test method against a reference value. The bias must be no more than [10 percent without the use of correction factors, and no more than [30 percent with the use of correction factors for bias values between 10 and 30 percent for the alternative test method to be acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 What are the requirements for precision?</p><p class="depth0">At a minimum, you must use paired sampling systems to establish precision. If you are using analyte spiking, including isotopic samples, the precision expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) of the alternative test method at the level of the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 must be less than or equal to 20 percent. For samples with a precision greater than 20 percent but less than 50 percent, a minimum of nine sample runs will be required. If you are comparing to a validated test method, the alternative test method must be at least as precise as the validated method at the level of the applicable emission limitation or standard in the subpart of 40 CFR part 63 as determined by an F test (Section 11.2.2).</p><p class="depth0">10.0 What calculations must I perform for isotopic spiking?</p><p class="depth0">You must analyze the bias, precision, relative standard deviation, and data acceptance for isotopic spiking tests according to the provisions in Sections 10.1 through 10.3.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Numerical Bias. Calculate the numerical value of the bias using the results from the analysis of the isotopically spiked field samples and the calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike according to Equation 301-4.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.005
Where:
B = Bias at the spike level.Sm = Mean of the measured values of the isotopically spiked samples.CS = Calculated value of the isotopically labeled spike.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Standard Deviation. Calculate the standard deviation of the Si values according to Equation 301-5.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.006
Where:
Si = Measured value of the isotopically labeled analyte in the i-th field sample,n = Number of isotopically spiked samples, 12.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 t Test. Test the bias for statistical significance by calculating the t-statistic using Equation 301-6. Use the standard deviation determined in Section 10.2 and the numerical bias determined in Section 10.1.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.007</p><p class="depth0">Compare the calculated t-value with the critical value of the two-sided t-distribution at the 95 percent confidence level and n-1 degrees of freedom. When spiking is conducted according to the procedures specified in Sections 6.2 and 6.4 as required, this critical value is 2.201 for the 11 degrees of freedom. If the calculated t-value is less than the critical value, the bias is not statistically significant, and the bias of the candidate test method is acceptable. If the calculated t-value is greater than the critical value, the bias is statistically significant, and you must evaluate the relative magnitude of the bias using Equation 301-7.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.008
Where:
BR = Relative bias.</p><p class="depth0">If the relative bias is less than or equal to ten percent, the bias of the candidate test method is acceptable and no correction factors are required. If the relative bias is greater than 10 percent but less than 30 percent, and if you correct all future data collected with the method for the magnitude of the bias, the bias of the candidate test method is acceptable. If either of the preceding two cases applies, you may continue to evaluate the method by calculating its precision. If not, the candidate method will not meet the requirements of Method 301.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Relative Standard Deviation. Calculate the RSD according to Equation 301-8.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY11.009

This method requires only the determination of whether VE occur and does not require the determination of opacity levels; therefore, observer certification according to Method 9 in appendix A to part 60 of this chapter is not required to obtain certification under this method. However, in order to receive Method 303 observer certification, the first-time observer (trainee) shall have attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course. In addition, the trainee shall successfully complete the Method 303 training course, satisfy the field observation requirement, and demonstrate adequate performance and sufficient knowledge of Method 303. The Method 303 training course shall be conducted by or under the sanction of the EPA and shall consist of classroom instruction and field observations, and a proficiency test.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.1 The classroom instruction shall familiarize the trainees with Method 303 through lecture, written training materials, and a Method 303 demonstration video. A successful completion of the classroom portion of the Method 303 training course shall be demonstrated by a perfect score on a written test. If the trainee fails to answer all of the questions correctly, the trainee may review the appropriate portion of the training materials and retake the test.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.2 The field observations shall be a minimum of 12 hours and shall be completed before attending the Method 303 certification course. Trainees shall observe the operation of a coke oven battery as it pertains to Method 303, including topside operations, and shall also practice conducting Method 303 or similar methods. During the field observations, trainees unfamiliar with coke battery operations shall receive instruction from an experienced coke oven observer familiar with Method 303 or similar methods and with the operation of coke batteries. The trainee must verify completion of at least 12 hours of field observation prior to attending the Method 303 certification course.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.3 All trainees must demonstrate proficiency in the application of Method 303 to a panel of three certified Method 303 observers, including an ability to differentiate coke oven emissions from condensing water vapor and smoldering coal. Each panel member shall have at least 120 days experience in reading visible emissions from coke ovens. The visible emissions inspections that will satisfy the experience requirement must be inspections of coke oven battery fugitive emissions from the emission points subject to emission standards under subpart L of this part (i.e., coke oven doors, topside port lids, offtake system(s), and charging operations), using either Method 303 or predecessor State or local test methods. A ``day's experience'' for a particular inspection is a day on which one complete inspection was performed for that emission point under Method 303 or a predecessor State or local method. A ``day's experience'' does not mean 8 or 10 hours performing inspections, or any particular time expressed in minutes or hours that may have been spent performing them. Thus, it would be possible for an individual to qualify as a Method 303 panel member for some emission points, but not others (e.g., an individual might satisfy the experience requirement for coke oven doors, but not topside port lids). Until November 15, 1994, the EPA may waive the certification requirement (but not the experience requirement) for panel members. The composition of the panel shall be approved by the EPA. The panel shall observe the trainee in a series of training runs and a series of certification runs. There shall be a minimum of 1 training run for doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, and a minimum of 5 training runs (i.e., 5 charges) for charging. During training runs, the panel can advise the trainee on proper procedures. There shall be a minimum of 3 certification runs for doors, topside port lids, and offtake systems, and a minimum of 15 certification runs for charging (i.e., 15 charges). The certifications runs shall be unassisted. Following the certification test runs, the panel shall approve or disapprove certification based on the trainee's performance during the certification runs. To obtain certification, the trainee shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the panel a high degree of proficiency in performing Method 303. To aid in evaluating the trainee's performance, a checklist, provided by the EPA, will be used by the panel members.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Observer Certification/Recertification. The coke oven observer certification is valid for 1 year from date of issue. The observer shall recertify annually by viewing the training video and answering all of the questions on the certification test correctly. Every 3 years, an observer shall be required to pass the proficiency test in Section 10.1.3 in order to be certified.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 The EPA (or applicable enforcement agency) shall maintain records reflecting a certified observer's successful completion of the proficiency test, which shall include the completed proficiency test checklists for the certification runs.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 An owner or operator of a coke oven battery subject to subpart L of this part may observe a training and certification program under this section.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Procedure for Determining VE from Charging Systems During Charging.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 Number of Oven Charges. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the number of oven charges to observe. The observer shall observe consecutive charges. Charges that are nonconsecutive can only be observed when necessary to replace observations terminated prior to the completion of a charge because of visual interferences. (See Section 11.1.5).</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 Data Records. Record all the information requested at the top of the charging system inspection sheet (Figure 303-1). For each charge, record the identification number of the oven being charged, the approximate beginning time of the charge, and the identification of the larry car used for the charge.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.3 Observer Position. Stand in an area or move to positions on the topside of the coke oven battery with an unobstructed view of the entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-pipeline coal charging systems, the observer should have an unobstructed view of the emission points of the charging system, including larry car hoppers, drop sleeves, and the topside ports of the oven being charged. Some charging systems are configured so that all emission points can only be seen from a distance of five ovens. For other batteries, distances of 8 to 12 ovens are adequate.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.4 Observation. The charging period begins when coal begins to flow into the oven and ends when the last charging port is recapped. During the charging period, observe all of the potential sources of VE from the entire charging system. For wet coal charging systems or non-pipeline coal charging systems, sources of VE typically include the larry car hoppers, drop sleeves, slide gates, and topside ports on the oven being charged. Any VE from an open standpipe cap on the oven being charged is included as charging VE.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.4.1 Using an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of at least 0.5 seconds, determine the total time VE are observed as follows. Upon observing any VE emerging from any part of the charging system, start the stopwatch. Stop the watch when VE are no longer observed emerging, and restart the watch when VE reemerges.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.4.2 When VE occur simultaneously from several points during a charge, consider the sources as one. Time overlapping VE as continuous VE. Time single puffs of VE only for the time it takes for the puff to emerge from the charging system. Continue to time VE in this manner for the entire charging period. Record the accumulated time to the nearest 0.5 second under ``Visible emissions, seconds'' on Figure 303-1.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.5 Visual Interference. If fugitive VE from other sources at the coke oven battery site (e.g., door leaks or condensing water vapor from the coke oven wharf) prevent a clear view of the charging system during a charge, stop the stopwatch and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments'' on Figure 303-1. Label the observation an observation of an incomplete charge, and observe another charge to fulfill the requirements of Section 11.1.1.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.6 VE Exemptions. Do not time the following VE:</p><p class="depth0">11.1.6.1 The VE from burning or smoldering coal spilled on top of the oven, topside port lid, or larry car surfaces;</p><p class="depth0">Note: The VE from smoldering coal are generally white or gray. These VE generally have a plume of less than 1 meter long. If the observer cannot safely and with reasonable confidence determine that VE are from charging, do not count them as charging emissions.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.6.2 The VE from the coke oven doors or from the leveler bar; or</p><p class="depth0">11.1.6.3 The VE that drift from the top of a larry car hopper if the emissions had already been timed as VE from the drop sleeve.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When the slide gate on a larry car hopper closes after the coal has been added to the oven, the seal may not be airtight. On occasions, a puff of smoke observed at the drop sleeves is forced past the slide gate up into the larry car hopper and may drift from the top; time these VE either at the drop sleeves or the hopper. If the larry car hopper does not have a slide gate or the slide gate is left open or partially closed, VE may quickly pass through the larry car hopper without being observed at the drop sleeves and will appear as a strong surge of smoke; time these as charging VE.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.7 Total Time Record. Record the total time that VE were observed for each charging operation in the appropriate column on the charging system inspection sheet.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.8 Determination of Validity of a Set of Observations. Five charging observations (runs) obtained in accordance with this method shall be considered a valid set of observations for that day. No observation of an incomplete charge shall be included in a daily set of observations that is lower than the lowest reading for a complete charge. If both complete and incomplete charges have been observed, the daily set of observations shall include the five

highest values observed. Four or three charging observations (runs) obtained in accordance with this method shall be considered a valid set of charging observations only where it is not possible to obtain five charging observations, because visual interferences (see Section 11.1.5) or inclement weather prevent a clear view of the charging system during charging. However, observations from three or four charges that satisfy these requirements shall not be considered a valid set of charging observations if use of such set of observations in a calculation under Section 12.4 would cause the value of A to be less than 145.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.9 Log Average. For each day on which a valid daily set of observations is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling log average of seconds of visible emissions from the charging operation for each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily sets of observations, in accordance with Section 12.4.</p><p class="depth0">11.2. Procedure for Determining VE from Coke Oven Door Areas. The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door areas by carefully observing the door area from a standard distance while walking at a normal pace.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the appropriate number of runs.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2). A single test run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for the push side. The walking pace shall be such that the duration of the traverse does not exceed an average of 4 seconds per oven door, excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view of a series of doors. Extra time is allowed for each leak (a maximum of 10 additional seconds for each leaking door) for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been found to be typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2.1 Include in the traverse time only the time spent observing the doors and recording door leaks. To measure actual traverse time, use an accumulative-type stopwatch with unit divisions of 0.5 seconds or less. Exclude interruptions to the traverse and time required for the observer to move to positions where the view of the battery is unobstructed, or for obstructions, such as the door machine, to move from positions blocking the view of a series of doors.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2.2 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer from viewing a door or a series of doors. Prior to the door inspection, the owner or operator may elect to temporarily suspend charging operations for the duration of the inspection, so that all of the doors can be viewed by the observer. The observer has two options for dealing with obstructions to view: (a) Stop the stopwatch and wait for the equipment to move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before completing the traverse; or (b) stop the stopwatch, skip the affected ovens, and move to an unobstructed position to continue the traverse. Restart the stopwatch and continue the traverse. After the completion of the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have dissipated, inspect the affected doors. If the equipment is still preventing the observer from viewing the doors, then the affected doors may be counted as not observed. If option (b) is used because of doors blocked by machines during charging operations, then, of the affected doors, exclude the door from the most recently charged oven from the inspection. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2.3 When batteries have sheds to control emissions, conduct the inspection from outside the shed unless the doors cannot be adequately viewed. In this case, conduct the inspection from the bench. Be aware of special safety considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and follow the instructions of company personnel on the required equipment and procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2), including the number of non-operating ovens. Record the clock time at the start of the traverse on each side of the battery. Record which side is being inspected (i.e., coke side or push side). Other information may be recorded at the discretion of the observer, such as the location of the leak (e.g., top of the door, chuck door, etc.), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, partly sunny, etc.).</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.1 Begin the test run by starting the stopwatch and traversing either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing one side, stop the watch. Complete this procedure on the other side. If inspecting more than one battery, the observer may view the push sides and the coke sides sequentially.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the battery between two adjacent buck stays (e.g., the oven door, chuck door, between the

masonry brick, buck stay or jamb, or other sources). Record the oven number and make the appropriate notation on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303-2).</p><p class="depth0">Note: Multiple VE from the same door area (e.g., VE from both the chuck door and the push side door) are counted as only one emitting door, not as multiple emitting doors.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.3 Do not record the following sources as door area VE:</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.3.1 VE from ovens with doors removed. Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;''</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.3.2 VE from ovens taken out of service. The owner or operator shall notify the observer as to which ovens are out of service. Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or</p><p class="depth0">11.2.3.3.3 VE from hot coke that has been spilled on the bench as a result of pushing.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.4 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run, calculate the maximum time allowed to observe the ovens using the equation in Section 12.2. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run, and conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.5 Percent Leaking Doors. For each day on which a valid observation is obtained, calculate the daily 30-day rolling average for each battery using these data and the 29 previous valid daily observations, in accordance with Section 12.5.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Procedure for Determining VE from Topside Port Lids and Offtake Systems.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the number of runs to be conducted. Simultaneous runs or separate runs for the topside port lids and offtake systems may be conducted.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a topside traverse of the battery, walk the length of the battery at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing only to make appropriate entries on the topside inspection sheet (Figure 303-3). The walking pace shall not exceed an average rate of 4 seconds per oven, excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view. Extra time is allowed for each leak for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven is typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 Topside Port Lid Observations. To observe lids of the ovens involved in the charging operation, the observer shall wait to view the lids until approximately 5 minutes after the completion of the charge. Record all the information requested on the topside inspection sheet (Figure 303-3). Record the clock time when traverses begin and end. If the observer's view is obstructed during the traverse (e.g., steam from the coke wharf, larry car, etc.), follow the guidelines given in Section 11.2.2.2.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.1 To perform a test run, conduct a single traverse on the topside of the battery. The observer shall walk near the center of the battery but may deviate from this path to avoid safety hazards (such as open or closed charging ports, luting buckets, lid removal bars, and topside port lids that have been removed) and any other obstacles. Upon noting VE from the topside port lid(s) of an oven, record the oven number and port number, then resume the traverse. If any oven is dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization, note this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Count the number of topside ports, not the number of points, exhibiting VE, i.e., if a topside port has several points of VE, count this as one port exhibiting VE.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2 Do not count the following as topside port lid VE:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2.1 VE from between the brickwork and oven lid casing or VE from cracks in the oven brickwork. Note these VE under ``Comments;''</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2.2 VE from topside ports involved in a charging operation. Record the oven number, and make an appropriate notation (e.g., not observed because ports open for charging) under ``Comments;''</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2.3 Topside ports having maintenance work done. Record the oven number and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments;'' or</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2.4 Condensing water from wet-sealing material. Ports with only visible condensing water from wet-sealing material are counted as observed but not as having VE.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3.2.5 Visible emissions from the flue inspection ports and caps.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4 Offtake Systems Observations. To perform a test run, traverse the battery as in Section 11.3.3.1. Look ahead and back two to four ovens to get a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven. Consider visible emissions from the following points as offtake system VE: (a) the flange between the gooseneck and collecting main (``saddle''), (b) the junction point of the standpipe and oven (``standpipe base''), (c) the other parts of the offtake system (e.g., the standpipe cap), and (d) the junction points with ovens and flanges of jumper pipes.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4.1 Do not stray from the traverse line in order to get a ``closer look'' at any part of the offtake system unless it is to distinguish leaks from interferences from other sources or to avoid obstacles.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4.2 If the centerline does not provide a clear view of the entire offtake system for each oven (e.g., when standpipes are longer than 15 feet), the observer may conduct the traverse farther from (rather than closer to) the offtake systems.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4.3 Upon noting a leak from an offtake system during a traverse, record the oven number. Resume the traverse. If the oven is dampered-off from the collecting main for decarbonization and VE are observed, note this under ``Comments'' for that particular oven.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4.4 If any part or parts of an offtake system have VE, count it as one emitting offtake system. Each stationary jumper pipe is considered a single offtake system.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.4.5 Do not count standpipe caps open for a decarbonization period or standpipes of an oven being charged as source of offtake system VE. Record the oven number and write ``Not observed'' and the reason (i.e., decarb or charging) under ``Comments.''</p><p class="depth0">Note: VE from open standpipes of an oven being charged count as charging emissions. All VE from closed standpipe caps count as offtake leaks.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.5 Criteria for Acceptance. After completing the run (allow 2 traverses for batteries with double mains), calculate the maximum time allowed to observe the topside port lids and/or offtake systems using the equation in Section 12.3. If the total traverse time exceeds T, void the run and conduct another run to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.6 In determining the percent leaking topside port lids and percent leaking offtake systems, do not include topside port lids or offtake systems with VE from the following ovens:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.6.1 Empty ovens, including ovens undergoing maintenance, which are properly dampered off from the main.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.6.2 Ovens being charged or being pushed.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.6.3 Up to 3 full ovens that have been dampered off from the main prior to pushing.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.6.4 Up to 3 additional full ovens in the pushing sequence that have been dampered off from the main for offtake system cleaning, for decarbonization, for safety reasons, or when a charging/pushing schedule involves widely separated ovens (e.g., a Marquard system); or that have been dampered off from the main for maintenance near the end of the coking cycle. Examples of reasons that ovens are dampered off for safety reasons are to avoid exposing workers in areas with insufficient clearance between standpipes and the larry car, or in areas where workers could be exposed to flames or hot gases from open standpipes, and to avoid the potential for removing a door on an oven that is not dampered off from the main.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.7 Percent Leaking Topside Port Lids and Offtake Systems.

However, the first-time observer (trainee) shall have attended the lecture portion of the Method 9 certification course. Furthermore, before conducting any VE observations, an observer shall become familiar with nonrecovery coke oven battery operations and with this test method by observing for a minimum of 4 hours the operation of a nonrecovery coke oven battery in the presence of personnel experienced in performing Method 303 assessments.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Procedure</p><p class="depth0">The intent of this procedure is to determine VE from coke oven door areas by carefully observing the door area while walking at a normal pace.</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Number of Runs. Refer to Sec. 63.309(c)(1) of this part for the appropriate number of runs.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Battery Traverse. To conduct a battery traverse, walk the length of the battery on the outside of the pusher machine and quench car tracks at a steady, normal walking pace, pausing to make appropriate entries on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1). The walking pace shall be such that the duration of the traverse does not exceed an average of 4 seconds per oven door, excluding time spent moving around stationary obstructions or waiting for other obstructions to move from positions blocking the view of a series of doors. Extra time is allowed for each leak (a maximum of 10 additional seconds for each leaking door) for the observer to make the proper notation. A walking pace of 3 seconds per oven door has been found to be typical. Record the actual traverse time with a stopwatch. A single test run consists of two timed traverses, one for the coke side and one for the push side.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Various situations may arise that will prevent the observer from viewing a door or a series of doors. The observer has two options for dealing with obstructions to view: (a) Wait for the equipment to move or the fugitive emissions to dissipate before completing the traverse; or (b) skip the affected ovens and move to an unobstructed position to continue the traverse. Continue the traverse. After the completion of the traverse, if the equipment has moved or the fugitive emissions have dissipated, complete the traverse by inspecting the affected doors. Record the oven numbers and make an appropriate notation under ``Comments'' on the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1).</p><p class="depth0">Note: Extra time incurred for handling obstructions is not counted in the traverse time.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 When batteries have sheds to control pushing emissions, conduct the inspection from outside the shed, if the shed allows such observations, or from the bench. Be aware of special safety considerations pertinent to walking on the bench and follow the instructions of company personnel on the required equipment and operations procedures. If possible, conduct the bench traverse whenever the bench is clear of the door machine and hot coke guide.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Observations. Record all the information requested at the top of the door area inspection sheet (Figure 303A-1), including the number of non-operating ovens. Record which side is being inspected, i.e., coke side or push side. Other information may be recorded at the discretion of the observer, such as the location of the leak (e.g., top of the door), the reason for any interruption of the traverse, or the position of the sun relative to the battery and sky conditions (e.g., overcast, partly sunny, etc.).</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Begin the test run by traversing either the coke side or the push side of the battery. After completing one side, traverse the other side.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 During the traverse, look around the entire perimeter of each oven door. The door is considered leaking if VE are detected in the coke oven door area. The coke oven door area includes the entire area on the vertical face of a coke oven between the bench and the top of the battery and the adjacent doors on both sides.

Method 304A: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds</p><p class="depth0">(Vent Option)</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not representative of a full-scale system. The rates measured by this method shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the fraction biodegraded.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge process. Bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, and biomass composition of the full-scale process are the parameters which are duplicated in the benchtop bioreactor. Biomass shall be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The flow rate of the exit vent is used to calculate the concentration of target compounds (utilizing Henry's law) in the exit gas stream. If Henry's law constants for the compounds of interest are not known, this method cannot be used in the determination of the biodegradation rate and Method 304B is the suggested method. The choice of analytical methodology for measuring the compounds of interest at the inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor are left to the discretion of the source, except where validated methods are available.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended regardless of byproducts produced.</p><p class="depth0">6.0. Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Figure 304A-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers to Figure 304A-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and isolated from the atmosphere (except for the exit vent stream) by leak-checking fittings, tubing, etc.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a biological oxidation reactor of at least 6 liters capacity. The benchtop bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the reactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist around the fittings).</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the aeration gas into the reactor diffusers. Measure the aeration gas flow rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). The aeration gas will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide sufficient agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit for the aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor through a water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install the condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor closure. Install a splitter which directs a portion of the gas to an exit vent and the rest of the gas through an air recycle pump back to the benchtop bioreactor. Monitor and record the flow rate through the exit vent at least 3 times per day throughout the day.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop bioreactor in a

collapsible low-density polyethylene container or collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap (collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization tank of the full-scale treatment system.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or by refrigeration to 4 C. If using a bleed stream from the equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate sufficient to achieve 90 to 100 percent of the full-scale system residence time.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the clarifier.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no headspace in the clarifier.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus.

Control the dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers).

Method 304B: Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds</p><p class="depth0">(Scrubber Option)</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for the determination of biodegradation rates of organic compounds in an activated sludge process. The test method is designed to evaluate the ability of an aerobic biological reaction system to degrade or destroy specific components in waste streams. The method may also be used to determine the effects of changes in wastewater composition on operation. The biodegradation rates determined by utilizing this method are not representative of a full-scale system. Full-scale systems embody biodegradation and air

emissions in competing reactions. This method measures biodegradation in absence of air emissions. The rates measured by this method shall be used in conjunction with the procedures listed in appendix C of this part to calculate the fraction emitted to the air versus the fraction biodegraded.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 A self-contained benchtop bioreactor system is assembled in the laboratory. A sample of mixed liquor is added and the waste stream is then fed continuously. The benchtop bioreactor is operated under conditions nearly identical to the target full-scale activated sludge process, except that air emissions are not a factor. The benchtop bioreactor temperature, dissolved oxygen concentration, average residence time in the reactor, waste composition, biomass concentration, and biomass composition of the target full-scale process are the parameters which are duplicated in the laboratory system. Biomass shall be removed from the target full-scale activated sludge unit and held for no more than 4 hours prior to use in the benchtop bioreactor. If antifoaming agents are used in the full-scale system, they shall also be used in the benchtop bioreactor. The feed flowing into and the effluent exiting the benchtop bioreactor are analyzed to determine the biodegradation rates of the target compounds. The choice of analytical methodology for measuring the compounds of interest at the inlet and outlet to the benchtop bioreactor are left to the discretion of the source, except where validated methods are available.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 If explosive gases are produced as a byproduct of biodegradation and could realistically pose a hazard, closely monitor headspace concentration of these gases to ensure laboratory safety. Placement of the benchtop bioreactor system inside a laboratory hood is recommended regardless of byproducts produced.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Figure 304B-1 illustrates a typical laboratory apparatus used to measure biodegradation rates. While the following description refers to Figure 304B-1, the EPA recognizes that alternative reactor configurations, such as alternative reactor shapes and locations of probes and the feed inlet, will also meet the intent of this method. Ensure that the benchtop bioreactor system is self-contained and isolated from the atmosphere by leak-checking fittings, tubing, etc.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Benchtop Bioreactor. The biological reaction is conducted in a biological oxidation reactor of at least 6-liters capacity. The benchtop bioreactor is sealed and equipped with internal probes for controlling and monitoring dissolved oxygen and internal temperature. The top of the benchtop bioreactor is equipped for aerators, gas flow ports, and instrumentation (while ensuring that no leaks to the atmosphere exist around the fittings).</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Aeration gas. Aeration gas is added to the benchtop bioreactor through three diffusers, which are glass tubes that extend to the bottom fifth of the reactor depth. A pure oxygen pressurized cylinder is recommended in order to maintain the specified oxygen concentration. Install a blower (e.g., Diaphragm Type, 15 SCFH capacity) to blow the aeration gas into the benchtop bioreactor diffusers. Measure the aeration gas flow rate with a rotameter (e.g., 0-15 SCFH recommended). The aeration gas will rise through the benchtop bioreactor, dissolving oxygen into the mixture in the process. The aeration gas must provide sufficient agitation to keep the solids in suspension. Provide an exit for the aeration gas from the top flange of the benchtop bioreactor through a water-cooled (e.g., Allihn-type) vertical condenser. Install the condenser through a gas-tight fitting in the benchtop bioreactor closure. Design the system so that at least 10 percent of the gas flows through an alkaline scrubber containing 175 mL of 45 percent by weight solution of potassium hydroxide (KOH) and 5 drops of 0.2 percent alizarin yellow dye. Route the balance of the gas through an adjustable scrubber bypass. Route all of the gas through a 1-L knock-out flask to remove entrained moisture and then to the intake of the blower. The blower recirculates the gas to the benchtop bioreactor.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Wastewater Feed. Supply the wastewater feed to the benchtop bioreactor in a collapsible low-density polyethylene container or collapsible liner in a container (e.g., 20 L) equipped with a spigot cap (collapsible containers or liners of other material may be required due to the permeability of some volatile compounds through polyethylene). Obtain the wastewater feed by sampling the wastewater feed in the target process. A representative sample of wastewater shall be obtained from the piping leading to the aeration tank. This sample may be obtained from existing sampling valves at the discharge of the wastewater feed pump, or collected from a pipe discharging to the aeration tank, or by pumping from a well-mixed equalization tank upstream from the aeration tank. Alternatively, wastewater can be pumped continuously to the laboratory apparatus from a bleed stream taken from the equalization tank of the full-scale treatment system.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 Refrigeration System. Keep the wastewater feed cool by ice or by refrigeration to 4 C. If using a bleed stream from the

equalization tank, refrigeration is not required if the residence time in the bleed stream is less than five minutes.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 Wastewater Feed Pump. The wastewater is pumped from the refrigerated container using a variable-speed peristaltic pump drive equipped with a peristaltic pump head. Add the feed solution to the benchtop bioreactor through a fitting on the top flange. Determine the rate of feed addition to provide a retention time in the benchtop bioreactor that is numerically equivalent to the retention time in the target full-scale system. The wastewater shall be fed at a rate sufficient to achieve 90 to 100 percent of the target full-scale system residence time.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.3 Treated wastewater feed. The benchtop bioreactor effluent exits at the bottom of the reactor through a tube and proceeds to the clarifier.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Clarifier. The effluent flows to a separate closed clarifier that allows separation of biomass and effluent (e.g., 2-liter pear-shaped glass separatory funnel, modified by removing the stopcock and adding a 25-mm OD glass tube at the bottom). Benchtop bioreactor effluent enters the clarifier through a tube inserted to a depth of 0.08 m (3 in.) through a stopper at the top of the clarifier. System effluent flows from a tube inserted through the stopper at the top of the clarifier to a drain (or sample bottle when sampling). The underflow from the clarifier leaves from the glass tube at the bottom of the clarifier. Flexible tubing connects this fitting to the sludge recycle pump. This pump is coupled to a variable speed pump drive. The discharge from this pump is returned through a tube inserted in a port on the side of the benchtop bioreactor. An additional port is provided near the bottom of the benchtop bioreactor for sampling the reactor contents. The mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor flows into the center of the clarifier. The clarified system effluent separates from the biomass and flows through an exit near the top of the clarifier. There shall be no headspace in the clarifier.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Temperature Control Apparatus.

Pump this mixed liquor to the benchtop bioreactor through the upper side port (Item 24 in Figure 304B-1). Change the

membrane on the dissolved oxygen probe before starting the test. Calibrate the oxygen probe immediately before the start of the test and each time the membrane is changed. The scrubber solution shall be replaced each weekday with 175 mL 45 percent W/W KOH solution to which five drops of 0.2 percent alizarin yellow indicator in water have been added. The potassium hydroxide solution in the alkaline scrubber shall be changed if the alizarin yellow dye color changes.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 Inspection and Correction Procedures. If the feed line tubing becomes clogged, replace with new tubing. If the feed flow rate is not within 5 percent of target flow any time the flow rate is measured, reset pump or check the flow measuring device and measure flow rate again until target flow rate is achieved.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Test Sampling. At least two and one half hydraulic residence times after the system has reached the targeted specifications shall be permitted to elapse before the first sample is taken. Effluent samples of the clarifier discharge (Item 20 in Figure 304B-1) and the influent wastewater feed are collected in 40-mL septum vials to which two drops of 1:10 hydrochloric acid (HCl) in water have been added. Sample the clarifier discharge directly from the drain line. These samples will be composed of the entire flow from the system for a period of several minutes. Feed samples shall be taken from the feed pump suction line after temporarily stopping the benchtop bioreactor feed, removing a connector, and squeezing the collapsible feed container. Store both influent and effluent samples at 4 C immediately after collection and analyze within 8 hours of collection.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Frequency of Sampling. During the test, sample and analyze the wastewater feed and the clarifier effluent at least six times. The sampling intervals shall be separated by at least 8 hours. During any individual sampling interval, sample the wastewater feed simultaneously with or immediately after the effluent sample. Calculate the RSD of the amount removed (i.e., effluent concentration--wastewater feed concentration). The RSD values shall be <15 percent. If an RSD value is >15 percent, continue sampling and analyzing influent and effluent sets of samples until the RSD values are within specifications.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Sampling After Exposure of System to Atmosphere. If, after starting sampling procedures, the benchtop bioreactor system is exposed to the atmosphere (due to leaks, maintenance, etc.), allow at least one hydraulic residence time to elapse before resuming sampling.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Dissolved Oxygen. Fluctuation in dissolved oxygen concentration may occur for numerous reasons, including undetected gas leaks, increases and decreases in mixed liquor suspended solids resulting from cell growth and solids loss in the effluent stream, changes in diffuser performance, cycling of effluent flow rate, and overcorrection due to faulty or sluggish dissolved oxygen probe response. Control the dissolved oxygen concentration in the benchtop bioreactor by changing the proportion of oxygen in the circulating aeration gas. Should the dissolved oxygen concentration drift below the designated experimental condition, bleed a small amount of aeration gas from the system on the pressure side (i.e., immediately upstream of one of the diffusers). This will create a vacuum in the system, triggering the pressure sensitive relay to open the solenoid valve and admit oxygen to the system. Should the dissolved oxygen concentration drift above the designated experimental condition, slow or stop the oxygen input to the system until the dissolved oxygen concentration approaches the correct level.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Sludge Wasting.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 Determine the suspended solids concentration (section 8.1.4) at the beginning of a test, and once per day thereafter during the test. If the test is completed within a two day period, determine the suspended solids concentration after the final sample set is taken. If the suspended solids concentration exceeds the specified concentration, remove a fraction of the sludge from the benchtop bioreactor. The required volume of mixed liquor to remove is determined as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.556

Vw is the wasted volume (Liters),Vr is the volume of the benchtop bioreactor (Liters),Sm is the measured solids (g/L), andSs is the specified solids (g/L).</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Remove the mixed liquor from the benchtop bioreactor by loosening a clamp on the mixed liquor sampling tube and allowing the required volume to drain to a graduated

flask. Clamp the tube when the correct volume has been wasted. Replace the volume of the liquid wasted by pouring the same volume of effluent back into the benchtop bioreactor. Dispose of the waste sludge properly.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Sludge Makeup. In the event that the suspended solids concentration is lower than the specifications, add makeup sludge back into the benchtop bioreactor. Determine the amount of sludge added by the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17OC00.557

The recovery efficiency of the sample collection and analytical technique is determined for each waste matrix.

Determine the individual recovery efficiency (RE) for each of the target compounds in duplicate before the waste samples are analyzed. To determine the RE, generate a water blank (Section 11.1) and use the injection port to introduce a known volume of spike solution (or certified gaseous standard) containing all of the target compounds at the levels expected in the waste sample. Introduce the spike solution immediately after the nitrogen purge has been started (Section

8.3.2). Follow the procedures outlined in Section 8.3.3. Analyze the recovery efficiency samples using the techniques described in Section 11.2. Determine the recovery efficiency (Equation 305-1, Section 12.2) by comparing the amount of compound recovered to the theoretical amount spiked. Determine the RE twice for each compound; the relative standard deviation, (RSD) shall be 410 percent for each compound. If the RSD for any compound is not 410 percent, modify the sampling/analytical procedure and complete an RE study in duplicate, or continue determining RE until the RSD meets the acceptable criteria.

Remove the sample container from the cooler and wipe the exterior to remove any ice or water. Weigh the container and sample to the nearest 0.01 g and record the weight. Pour the sample from the container into the purge flask. Rinse the sample container three times with approximately 6 mL of PEG (or the volume needed to total 50 mL of PEG in the purge flask), transferring the rinses to the purge flask. Add 50 mL of organic-free deionized water to the purge flask. Cap the purge flask tightly in between each rinse and after adding all the components into the flask.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Allow the oven to equilibrate to 75 [2 C (167 [3.6 F). Begin the sample recovery process by turning the toggle valve on, thus allowing a 6 L/min flow of pure nitrogen through the purge chamber.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Stop the purge after 30 min. Immediately remove the sorbent tube(s) from the apparatus and cap both ends. Remove the knockout trap and transfer the water catch to a 10 mL volumetric flask. Rinse the trap with organic-free deionized water and transfer the rinse to the volumetric flask. Dilute to the 10 mL mark with water. Transfer the water sample to a sample vial and store at 4 C (39.2 F) with zero headspace. The analysis of the contents of the water knockout trap is optional for this method. If the target compounds are water soluble, analysis of the water is recommended; meeting the recovery efficiency criteria in these cases would be difficult without adding the amount captured in the knockout trap.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Miscellaneous Quality Control Measures.

Liquid calibration standards shall be used for calibration in the analysis of the solvent extracts. The liquid calibration standards shall be prepared in the desorption solvent matrix. The calibration standards may be prepared and injected individually or as a mixture. If thermal desorption and focusing (onto another sorbent or cryogen focusing) are used, a certified gaseous mixture or a series of gaseous standards shall be used for calibration of the instrument. The gaseous standards shall be focused and analyzed in the same manner as the samples.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 The analytical system shall be certified free from contaminants before a calibration is performed (see Section 11.1). The calibration standards are used to determine the linearity of the analytical system. Perform an initial calibration and linearity check by analyzing the three calibration standards for each target compound in triplicate starting with the lowest level and continuing to the highest level. If the triplicate analyses do not agree within 5 percent of their average, additional analyses will be needed until the 5 percent criteria is met. Calculate the response factor (Equation 305-3, Section 12.4) from the average area counts of the injections for each concentration level. Average the response factors of the standards for each compound. The linearity of the detector is acceptable if the response

factor of each compound at a particular concentration is within 10 percent of the overall mean response factor for that compound. Analyze daily a mid-level calibration standard in duplicate and calculate a new response factor. Compare the daily response factor average to the average response factor calculated for the mid-level calibration during the initial linearity check; repeat the three-level calibration procedure if the daily average response factor differs from the initial linearity check mid-level response factor by more than 10 percent. Otherwise, proceed with the sample analysis.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Analytical Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Water Blank Analysis. A water blank shall be analyzed daily to determine the cleanliness of the purge and recovery system. A water blank is generated by adding 60 mL of organic-free deionized water to 50 mL of PEG in the purge chamber. Treat the blank as described in Sections 8.3.2 and 8.3.3. The purpose of the water blank is to insure that no contaminants exist in the sampling and analytical apparatus which would interfere with the quantitation of the target compounds. If contaminants are present, locate the source of contamination, remove it, and repeat the water blank analysis.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Sample Analysis. Sample analysis in the context of this method refers to techniques to remove the target compounds from the sorbent tubes, separate them using a chromatography technique, and quantify them with an appropriate detector. Two types of sample extraction techniques typically used for sorbents include solvent desorption or direct thermal desorption of test compounds to a secondary focusing unit (either sorbent or cryogen based). The test compounds are then typically transferred to a GC system for analysis. Other analytical systems may be used (e.g., HPLC) in lieu of GC systems as long as the recovery efficiency criteria of this method are met.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Recover the test compounds from the sorbent tubes that require solvent desorption by transferring the adsorbent material to a sample vial containing the desorption solvent. The desorption solvent shall be the same as the solvent used to prepare calibration standards. The volume of solvent depends on the amount of adsorbed material to be desorbed (1.0 mL per 100 mg of adsorbent material) and also on the amount of test compounds present. Final volume adjustment and or dilution can be made so that the concentration of test compounds in the desorption solvent is bracketed by the concentration of the calibration solutions. Ultrasonicate the desorption solvent for 15 min in an ice bath. Allow the sample to sit for a period of time so that the adsorbent material can settle to the bottom of the vial. Transfer the solvent with a pasteur pipet (minimizing the amount of adsorbent material taken) to another vial and store at 4 C (39.2 F).</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Analyze the desorption solvent or direct thermal desorption tubes from each sample using the same analytical parameters used for the calibration standard. Calculate the total weight detected for each compound (Equation 305-4, Section 12.5). The slope (area/amount) and y-intercept are calculated from the line bracketed between the two closest calibration points. Correct the concentration of each waste sample with the appropriate recovery efficiency factor and the split flow ratio (if used).

This method applies to the determination of chromium (Cr) in emissions from decorative and hard chrome electroplating facilities, chromium anodizing operations, and continuous chromium plating operations at iron and steel facilities.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Data Quality Objectives. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Sampling. An emission sample is extracted isokinetically from the source using an unheated Method 5 sampling train (40 CFR Part 60, Appendix A), with a glass nozzle and probe liner, but with the filter omitted. The sample time shall be at least two hours. The Cr emissions are collected in an alkaline solution containing 0.1 N sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or 0.1 N sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3). The collected samples are recovered using an alkaline solution and are then transported to the laboratory for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Analysis.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Total chromium samples with high chromium concentrations ("35 g/L) may be analyzed using inductively coupled plasma emission spectrometry (ICP) at 267.72 nm.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The ICP analysis is applicable for this method only when the solution analyzed has a Cr concentration greater than or equal to 35 g/L or five times the method detection limit as determined according to appendix B in 40 CFR part 136. Similarly, inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS)

may be used for total chromium analysis provided the procedures for ICP-MS analysis described in Method 6020 or 6020A (EPA Office of Solid Waste, publication SW-846) are followed.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 Alternatively, when lower total chromium concentrations (<35 g/L) are encountered, a portion of the alkaline sample solution may be digested with nitric acid and analyzed by graphite furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GFAAS) at 357.9 nm.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.3 If it is desirable to determine hexavalent chromium (Cr+6) emissions, the samples may be analyzed using an ion chromatograph equipped with a post-column reactor (IC/PCR) and a visible wavelength detector. To increase sensitivity for trace levels of Cr+6, a preconcentration system may be used in conjunction with the IC/PCR.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Total Chromium--measured chromium content that includes both major chromium oxidation states (Cr+3, Cr+3).</p><p class="depth0">3.2 May--Implies an optional operation.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Digestion--The analytical operation involving the complete (or nearly complete) dissolution of the sample in order to ensure the complete solubilization of the element (analyte) to be measured.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Interferences--Physical, chemical, or spectral phenomena that may produce a high or low bias in the analytical result.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Analytical System--All components of the analytical process including the sample digestion and measurement apparatus.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Sample Recovery--The quantitative transfer of sample from the collection apparatus to the sample preparation (digestion, etc.) apparatus. This term should not be confused with analytical recovery.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Matrix Modifier--A chemical modification to the sample during GFAAS determinations to ensure that the analyte is not lost during the measurement process (prior to the atomization stage)</p><p class="depth0">3.8 Calibration Reference Standards--Quality control standards used to check the accuracy of the instrument calibration curve prior to sample analysis.</p><p class="depth0">3.9 Continuing Check Standard--Quality control standards used to verify that unacceptable drift in the measurement system has not occurred.</p><p class="depth0">3.10 Calibration Blank--A blank used to verify that there has been no unacceptable shift in the baseline either immediately following calibration or during the course of the analytical measurement.</p><p class="depth0">3.11 Interference Check--An analytical/measurement operation that ascertains whether a measurable interference in the sample exists.</p><p class="depth0">3.12 Interelement Correction Factors--Factors used to correct for interfering elements that produce a false signal (high bias).</p><p class="depth0">3.13 Duplicate Sample Analysis--Either the repeat measurement of a single solution or the measurement of duplicate preparations of the same sample. It is important to be aware of which approach is required for a particular type of measurement. For example, no digestion is required for the ICP determination and the duplicate instrument measurement is therefore adequate whereas duplicate digestion/instrument measurements are required for GFAAS.</p><p class="depth0">3.14 Matrix Spiking--Analytical spikes that have been added to the actual sample matrix either before (Section 9.2.5.2) or after (Section 9.1.6). Spikes added to the sample prior to a preparation technique (e.g., digestion) allow for the assessment of an overall method accuracy while those added after only provide for the measurement accuracy determination.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 ICP Interferences.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 ICP Spectral Interferences. Spectral interferences are caused by: overlap of a spectral line from another element; unresolved overlap of molecular band spectra; background contribution from continuous or recombination phenomena; and, stray light from the line emission of high-concentrated elements. Spectral overlap may be compensated for by correcting the raw data with a computer and measuring the interfering element. At the 267.72 nm Cr analytical wavelength, iron, manganese, and uranium are potential interfering elements. Background and stray light interferences can usually be compensated for by a background correction adjacent to the analytical line. Unresolved overlap requires the selection of an alternative chromium wavelength. Consult the instrument manufacturer's operation manual for interference correction procedures.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 ICP Physical Interferences. High levels of dissolved solids in the samples may cause significant inaccuracies due to salt buildup at the nebulizer and torch tips. This problem can be controlled by diluting the sample or by extending the rinse times between sample analyses. Standards shall be prepared in the same solution matrix as the samples (i.e., 0.1 N NaOH or 0.1 N NaHCO3).</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3 ICP Chemical Interferences. These include molecular compound formation, ionization effects and solute vaporization effects, and are usually not significant in the ICP procedure, especially if the standards and samples are matrix matched.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 GFAAS Interferences.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 GFAAS Chemical Interferences. Low concentrations of calcium and/or phosphate may cause interferences; at concentrations above 200 g/L, calcium's effect is constant

and eliminates the effect of phosphate. Calcium nitrate is therefore added to the concentrated analyte to ensure a known constant effect. Other matrix modifiers recommended by the instrument manufacturer may also be considered.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 GFAAS Cyanide Band Interferences. Nitrogen should not be used as the purge gas due to cyanide band interference.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 GFAAS Spectral Interferences. Background correction may be required because of possible significant levels of nonspecific absorption and scattering at the 357.9 nm analytical wavelength.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 GFAAS Background Interferences. Zeeman or Smith-Hieftje background correction is recommended for interferences resulting from high levels of dissolved solids in the alkaline impinger solutions.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 IC/PCR Interferences.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.1 IC/PCR Chemical Interferences. Components in the sample matrix may cause Cr+6 to convert to trivalent chromium (Cr+3) or cause Cr+3 to convert to Cr+6. The chromatographic separation of Cr+6 using ion chromatography reduces the potential for other metals to interfere with the post column reaction. For the IC/PCR analysis, only compounds that coelute with Cr+6 and affect the diphenylcarbazide reaction will cause interference.</p><p class="depth0">4.3.2 IC/PCR Background Interferences. Periodic analyses of reagent water blanks are used to demonstrate that the analytical system is essentially free of contamination. Sample cross-contamination can occur when high-level and low-level samples or standards are analyzed alternately and can be eliminated by thorough purging of the sample loop. Purging of the sample can easily be achieved by increasing the injection volume to ten times the size of the sample loop.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Disclaimer. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method may not address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations prior to performing this test method.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Hexavalent chromium compounds have been listed as carcinogens although chromium (III) compounds show little or no toxicity.

Same as Method 5.</p><p class="depth0">13.0 Method Performance</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Range. The recommended working range for all of the three analytical techniques starts at five times the analytical detection limit (see also Section 13.2.2). The upper limit of all three techniques can be extended indefinitely by appropriate dilution.</p><p class="depth0">13.2 Sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.1 Analytical Sensitivity. The estimated instrumental detection limits listed are provided as a guide for an instrumental limit. The actual method detection limits are sample and instrument dependent and may vary as the sample matrix varies.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.1.2 ICP Analytical Sensitivity. The minimum estimated detection limits for ICP, as reported in Method 6010A and the recently revised Method 6010B of SW-846 (Reference 1), are 7.0 g Cr/L and 4.7 g Cr/L, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.1.3 GFAAS Analytical Sensitivity.

The laboratory performing the Cr+6 measurements must determine the method detection limit on a quarterly basis using a suitable procedure such as that found in 40 CFR, Part 136, Appendix B. The determination should be made on samples in the appropriate alkaline matrix. Normally this involves the preparation (if applicable) and consecutive measurement of seven (7) separate aliquots of a sample with a concentration <5 times the expected detection limit. The detection limit is 3.14 times the standard deviation of these results.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.2 In-stack Sensitivity. The in-stack sensitivity depends upon the analytical detection limit, the volume of stack gas sampled, the total volume of the impinger absorbing solution plus the rinses, and, in some cases, dilution or concentration factors from sample preparation. Using the analytical detection limits given in Sections 13.2.1.1, 13.2.1.2, and 13.2.1.3; a stack gas sample volume of 1.7 dscm; a total liquid sample volume of 500 mL; and the digestion concentration factor of \1/2\ for the GFAAS analysis; the corresponding in-stack detection limits are 0.0014 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0021 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00015 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000015 mg Cr+6/dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration.</p><p class="depth0">Note: It is recommended that the concentration of Cr in the analytical solutions be at least five times the analytical detection limit to optimize sensitivity in the analyses. Using this guideline and the same assumptions for impinger sample volume, stack gas sample volume, and the digestion concentration factor for the GFAAS analysis (500 mL,1.7 dscm, and 1/2, respectively), the recommended minimum stack concentrations for optimum sensitivity are 0.0068 mg Cr/dscm to 0.0103 mg Cr/dscm for ICP, 0.00074 mg Cr/dscm for GFAAS, and 0.000074 mg Cr+6/dscm for IC/PCR with preconcentration. If required, the in-stack detection limits can be improved by either increasing the stack gas sample volume, further reducing the volume of the digested sample for GFAAS, improving the analytical detection limits, or any combination of the three.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 Precision.</p><p class="depth0">13.3.1 The following precision data have been reported for the three analytical methods.

As reported in Method 7191 of SW-846 (Reference 1), in a single laboratory (EMSL), using Cincinnati, Ohio tap water spiked at concentrations of 19, 48, and 77 g Cr/L, the standard deviations were [0.1, [0.2, and [0.8, respectively. Recoveries at these levels were 97 percent, 101 percent, and 102 percent, respectively.</p><p class="depth0">13.6 IC/PCR Precision. As reported in Methods 0061 and 7199 of SW-846 (Reference 1), the precision of IC/PCR with sample preconcentration is 5 to 10 percent. The overall precision for sewage sludge incinerators emitting 120 ng/dscm of Cr+6 and 3.5 g/dscm of total Cr was 25 percent and 9 percent, respectively; and for hazardous waste incinerators emitting 300 ng/dscm of C+6 the precision was 20 percent.</p><p class="depth0">14.0 Pollution Prevention</p><p class="depth0">14.1 The only materials used in this method that could be considered pollutants are the chromium standards used for instrument calibration and acids used in the cleaning of the collection and measurement containers/labware, in the preparation of standards, and in the acid digestion of samples.

A pretest leak-check is recommended, but not required. If the tester opts to conduct the pretest leak-check, the following procedures shall be performed: (1) Place the jar/impinger containers into an ice bath and wait 10 minutes for the ice to cool the containers before performing the leak check and/or start sampling; (2) to perform the leak check, seal the nozzle using a piece of clear plastic wrap placed over the end of a finger and switch on the pump; and (3) the train system leak rate should not exceed 0.02 cfm at a vacuum of 380 mm Hg (15 in. Hg) or greater. If the leak rate does exceed the 0.02 cfm requirement, identify and repair the leak area and perform the leak check again.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Use caution when releasing the vacuum following the leak check.

If the leakage rate is found to be 40.02 cfm at the maximum operating vacuum, the results are acceptable. If,

however, a higher leak rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume as shown in Section 12.3 of Method 5 or void the sample and initiate a replacement run. Following the component change, leak-checks are optional, but are recommended as are the pretest leak-checks.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1.12 Post Test Leak Check. Remove the probe assembly and flexible tubing from the first jar/impinger container. Seal the inlet tube of the first container using clear plastic wrap and switch on the pump.

Place the probe/nozzle into the duct at the first sampling point and switch on the pump. Start the sampling using the time interval calculated for the first point. When the first point sampling time has been completed, move to the second point and continue to sample for the time interval calculated for that point; sample each point on the traverse in this manner. Maintain ice around the sample containers during the run.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2.3 Critical Flow. The sample line between the critical orifice and the pump must operate at a vacuum of "380 mm Hg ("15 in. Hg) in order for critical flow to be maintained. This vacuum must be monitored and documented using the vacuum gauge located between the critical orifice and the pump.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Theoretically, critical flow for air occurs when the ratio of the orifice outlet absolute pressure to the orifice inlet absolute pressure is less than a factor of 0.53. This means that the system vacuum should be at least "356 mm Hg ("14 in. Hg) at sea level and  305 mm Hg ( 12 in.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR15AP98.014</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 Leak Check. A leak check prior to the sampling run is optional; however, a leak check after the sampling run is mandatory. The leak-check procedure is as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Temporarily attach a suitable (e.g., 0-to 40-ml/min) rotameter to the outlet of the DGM, and place a vacuum gauge at or near the probe inlet. Plug the probe inlet, pull a vacuum of at least 250 mm (10 inch) Hg, and note the flow rate as indicated by the rotameter. A leakage rate not in excess of 2 percent of the average sampling rate is acceptable.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Carefully release the probe inlet plug before turning off the pump.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Sample Collection. Record the initial DGM reading and barometric pressure. To begin sampling, position the tip of the Teflon [supreg] tubing at the sampling point, connect the tubing to the impinger, and start the pump. Adjust the sample flow to a constant rate between 200 and 1000 ml/min as indicated by the rotameter. Maintain this constant rate ([10 percent) during the entire sampling run. Take readings (DGM, temperatures at DGM and at impinger outlet, and rate meter) at least every 5 minutes. Add more ice during the run to keep the temperature of the gases leaving the last impinger at 20 C (68 F) or less. At the conclusion of each run,

turn off the pump, remove the Teflon [supreg] tubing from the stack, and record the final readings. Conduct a leak check as in section 8.1.2. (This leak check is mandatory.) If a leak is found, void the test run or use procedures acceptable to the Administrator to adjust the sample volume for the leakage.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Sample Recovery. The following items are required for sample recovery:</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Impinger. Disconnect the impinger. Pour the contents of the midget impinger into a graduated cylinder.

The following items are required for the metering system:</p><p class="depth0">10.1.1 Initial Calibration.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.1.1 Before its initial use in the field, first leak-check the metering system (drying tube, needle valve, pump, rotameter, and DGM) as follows: Place a vacuum gauge at the inlet to the drying tube, and pull a vacuum of 250 mm (10 inch) Hg; plug or pinch off the outlet of the flow meter, and then turn off the pump. The vacuum shall remain stable for at least 30 seconds. Carefully release the vacuum gauge before releasing the flow meter end.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.1.2 Next, remove the drying tube, and calibrate the metering system (at the sampling flow rate specified by the method) as follows: Connect an appropriately sized wet test meter (e.g., 1 liter per revolution (0.035 cubic feet per revolution)) to the inlet of the drying tube. Make three independent calibrations runs, using at least five revolutions of the DGM per run. Calculate the calibration factor, Y (wet test meter calibration volume divided by the DGM volume, both volumes adjusted to the same reference temperature and pressure), for each run, and average the results. If any Y-value deviates by more than 2 percent from the average, the metering system is unacceptable for use. Otherwise, use the average as the calibration factor for subsequent test runs.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.2 Posttest Calibration Check. After each field test series, conduct a calibration check as in section 10.1.1 above, except for the following variations: (a) The leak check is not to be conducted, (b) three, or more revolutions of the DGM may be used, and (c) only two independent runs need be made. If the calibration factor does not deviate by more than 5 percent from the initial calibration factor (determined in section 10.1.1), then the DGM volumes obtained during the test series are acceptable. If the calibration factor deviates by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the metering system as in section 10.1.1, and for the calculations, use the calibration factor (initial or recalibration) that yields the lower gas volume for each test run.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.3 Temperature Sensors. Calibrate against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.4 Rotameter. The rotameter need not be calibrated, but should be cleaned and maintained according to the manufacturer's instruction.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.5 Barometer. Calibrate against a mercury barometer.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Gas Chromatograph. The following procedures are required for the gas chromatograph:</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 Initial Calibration. Inject 1 l of each of the standards prepared in sections 7.2.3.3 and 7.2.3.4 into the GC and record the response. Repeat the injections for each standard until two successive injections agree within 5 percent. Using the mean response for each calibration standard, prepare a linear least squares equation relating the response to the mass of methanol in the sample. Perform the calibration before analyzing each set of samples.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 Continuing Calibration. At the beginning of each day, analyze the mid level calibration standard as described in section 10.5.1. The response from the daily analysis must agree with the response from the initial calibration within 10 percent. If it does not, the initial calibration must be repeated.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Analytical Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Gas Chromatograph Operating Conditions. The following operating conditions are required for the GC:</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 Injector. Configured for capillary column, splitless, 200 C (392 F).</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 Carrier.

Inject 1 l of the stored sample into the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the sample response is above that of the highest calibration standard, either dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the response of the sample. These standards should produce approximately 50 percent and 150 percent of the response of the sample.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Silica Gel Adsorbent Sample. The following items are required for the silica gel adsorbent samples:</p><p class="depth0">11.3.1 Preparation of Samples. Extract the front and backup sections of the adsorbent tube separately. With a file, score the glass adsorbent tube in front of the first section of silica gel. Break the tube open. Remove and discard the glass wool. Transfer the first section of the silica gel to a 5-ml glass vial and stopper the vial. Remove the spacer between the first and second section of the adsorbent tube and discard it. Transfer the second section of silica gel to a separate 5-ml glass vial and stopper the vial.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.2 Desorption of Samples. Add 3 ml of the 10 percent n-propanol solution to each of the stoppered vials and shake or vibrate the vials for 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">11.3.3 Inject a 1-l aliquot of the diluted sample from each vial into the GC. Repeat the injection and average the results. If the sample response is above that of the highest calibration standard, either dilute the sample until it is in the measurement range of the calibration line or prepare additional calibration standards. If the sample response is below that of the lowest calibration standard, prepare additional calibration standards. If additional calibration standards are prepared, there shall be at least two that bracket the response of the sample.

The resulting water-crumb slurry is then pumped to the finishing units. Certain amounts of solvent (hexane being the most commonly used solvent) and diene monomer remain in the crumb. The analyst uses the following procedure to determine those amounts.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 The crumb rubber sample is dissolved in toluene to which heptane has been added as an internal standard. Acetone is then added to this solution to precipitate the crumb, and the supernatant is analyzed for hexane and diene by a gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization detector (FID).</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Included in text as needed.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 None known.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Benzene, introduced as a contaminant in the toluene solvent, elutes between methyl cyclopentane and cyclohexane.

Nonane elutes in the same approximate time region as termonomer and is used to quantify in that region because it has a longer shelf life.

Termonomer, having a high tendency to polymerize, is used in the QC solution only to ensure that both termonomer isomers elute at the proper time.</p><p class="depth0">First, a concentrated stock solution is prepared; the final QC solution can then be prepared by diluting the stock solution.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.1 In preparation of stock solution, fill a 1-liter volumetric flask partially with polymer dissolving solution (PDS)--see section 7.5 of this method.

Samples which have lain untouched for more than 30 minutes should be discarded.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">Quality control is monitored via a computer program that tracks analyses of a prepared QC sample (from section 7.6.2 of this method). The QC sample result is entered daily into the program, which plots the result as a data point on a statistical chart. If the data point does not satisfy the ``in-control'' criteria (as defined by the lab quality facilitator), an ``out-of-control'' flag appears, mandating corrective action.</p><p class="depth0">In addition, the area of the n-heptane peak is monitored so that any errors in making up the polymer dissolving solution will be caught and corrected. Refer to section 12.4 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Fill an autosampler vial with the quality control solution (from section 7.6.2 of this method) and analyze on the GC as normal (per section 11 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Add the concentrations of the 5 hexane isomers as they appear on the CALS printout. Also include the 2,2-dimethyl-pentane peak just ahead of the methyl cyclopentane (the fourth major isomer) peak in the event that the peak integration split this peak out. Do not include the benzene peak in the sum. Note the nonane concentration. Record both results (total hexane and nonane) in the QC computer program. If out of control, and GC appears to be functioning within normal parameters, reanalyze a fresh control sample. If the fresh QC is not in control, check stock solution for contaminants or make up a new QC sample with the toluene currently in use. If instrument remains out-of-control, more thorough GC troubleshooting may be needed.</p><p class="depth0">Also, verify that the instrument has detected both isomers of termonomer (quantification not necessary--see section 7.0 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Recovery efficiency must be determined for high ethylene concentration, low ethylene concentration, E-P terpolymer, or oil extended samples and whenever modifications are made to the method.

The polymer shall be dissolved by agitating the bottles on a shaker for 4 hours. The polymer shall be precipitated using 100 ml acetone.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.2 The supernatant liquid shall be decanted from the polymer. Care shall be taken to remove as much of the liquid phase from the sample as possible to minimize the effect of retained liquid phase upon the next cycle of the analysis. The supernatant liquid shall be analyzed by gas chromatography using an internal standard quantitation method with heptane as the internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.3 The precipitated polymer from the steps described above shall be redissolved using toluene as the solvent.

The area ratios of the total hexane to heptane (R1) shall be determined for the two analysis cycles of the sample set. The ratio of the values of R1 from the second analysis cycle to the first cycle shall be determined to give a second ratio (R2).</p><p class="depth0">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</p><p class="depth0">The procedure for preparing a Quality Control sample with the internal standard in it is outlined in section 7.6 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 The relative FID response factors for n-heptane, the internal standard, versus the various hexane isomers and termonomer are relatively constant and should seldom need to be altered. However Baseline construction is a most critical factor in the production of good data. For this reason, close attention should be paid to peak integration. Procedures for handling peak integration will depend upon the data system used.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 If recalibration of the analysis is needed, make up a calibration blend of the internal standard and the analytes as detailed below and analyze it using the analytical method used for the samples.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 Weigh 5 g heptane into a tared scintillation vial to five places.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 Add 0.2 ml termonomer to the vial and reweigh.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.3 Add 0.5 ml hexane to the vial and reweigh.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.4 Cap, and shake vigorously to mix.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.5 Calculate the weights of termonomer and of hexane added and divide their weights by the weight of the n-heptane added.

Insure that toggle switch atop timer control box is in the middle (``off'') position. If display reads ``04:00'' (4 hours), move toggle switch to the left position. Shaker should begin operating.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.7 After shaker stops, add 100 ml acetone to each sample to precipitate polymer. Shake minimum of 5 minutes on shaker--Vistalon sample may not have fully dissolved; nevertheless, for purposes of consistency, 4 hours is the agreed-upon dissolving time.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.8 Using a 5-ml glass Luer-lock syringe and Acrodisc filter, filter some of the supernatant liquid into an autosampler vial; crimp the vial and load it into the GC autosampler for analysis (section 11.2 of this method)--The samples are filtered to prevent polymer buildup in the GC. Clean the syringes in toluene.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.9 Decant remaining supernatant into a hydrocarbon waste sink, being careful not to discard any of the polymer. Place bottle of precipitate into the steam oven and dry for six hours--Some grades of Vistalon produce very small particles in the precipitate, thus making complete decanting impossible without discarding some polymer. In this case, decant as much as possible and put into the oven as is, allowing the oven to drive off remaining supernatant (this practice is avoided for environmental reasons).

Method 311--Analysis of Hazardous Air Pollutant Compounds in Paints and</p><p class="depth0">Coatings by Direct Injection Into a Gas Chromatograph</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Applicability. This method is applicable for determination of most compounds designated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as volatile hazardous air pollutants (HAP's) (See Reference 1) that are contained in paints and coatings. Styrene, ethyl acrylate, and methyl methacrylate can be measured by ASTM D 4827-93 or ASTM D 4747-87. Formaldehyde can be measured by ASTM PS 9-94 or ASTM D 1979-91. Toluene diisocyanate can be measured in urethane prepolymers by ASTM D 3432-89. Method 311 applies only to those volatile HAP's which are added to the coating when it is manufactured, not to those which may form as the coating cures (reaction products or cure volatiles). A separate or modified test procedure must be used to measure these reaction products or cure volatiles in order to determine the total volatile HAP emissions from a coating. Cure volatiles are a significant component of the total HAP content of some coatings. The term ``coating'' used in this method shall be understood to mean paints and coatings.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Principle. The method uses the principle of gas chromatographic separation and quantification using a detector that responds to concentration differences. Because there are many potential analytical systems or sets of operating conditions that may represent useable methods for determining the concentrations of the compounds cited in Section 1.1 in the applicable matrices, all systems that employ this principle, but differ only in details of equipment and operation, may be used as alternative methods, provided that the prescribed quality control, calibration, and method performance requirements are met. Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">Whole coating is added to dimethylformamide and a suitable internal standard compound is added. An aliquot of the sample mixture is injected onto a chromatographic column containing a stationary phase that separates the analytes from each other and from other volatile compounds contained in the sample. The concentrations of the analytes are determined by comparing the detector responses for the sample to the responses obtained using known concentrations of the analytes.</p><p class="depth0">3. Definitions [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">4. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Coating samples of unknown composition may contain the compound used as the internal standard. Whether or not this is the case may be determined by following the procedures of Section 11 and deleting the addition of the internal standard specified in Section 11.5.3. If necessary, a different internal standard may be used.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 The GC column and operating conditions developed for one coating formulation may not ensure adequate resolution of target analytes for other coating formulations. Some formulations may contain nontarget analytes that coelute with target analytes. If there is any doubt about the identification or resolution of any gas chromatograph (GC) peak, it may be necessary to analyze the sample using a different GC column or different GC operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Cross-contamination may occur whenever high-level and low-level samples are analyzed sequentially. The order of sample

analyses specified in Section 11.7 is designed to minimize this problem.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Cross-contamination may also occur if the devices used to transfer coating during the sample preparation process or for injecting the sample into the GC are not adequately cleaned between uses. All such devices should be cleaned with acetone or other suitable solvent and checked for plugs or cracks before and after each use.</p><p class="depth0">5. Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Many solvents used in coatings are hazardous. Precautions should be taken to avoid unnecessary inhalation and skin or eye contact. This method may involve hazardous materials, operations, and equipment. This test method does not purport to address all of the safety problems associated with its use. It is the responsibility of the user of this test method to establish appropriate safety and health practices and to determine the applicability of regulatory limitations in regards to the performance of this test method.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Dimethylformamide is harmful if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. The user should obtain relevant health and safety information from the manufacturer. Dimethylformamide should be used only with adequate ventilation. Avoid contact with skin, eyes, and clothing. In case of contact, immediately flush skin or eyes with plenty of water for at least 15 minutes. If eyes are affected, consult a physician. Remove and wash contaminated clothing before reuse.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 User's manuals for the gas chromatograph and other related equipment should be consulted for specific precautions to be taken related to their use.</p><p class="depth0">6. Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Sample Collection.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Sampling Containers. Dual-seal sampling containers, four to eight fluid ounce capacity, should be used to collect the samples. Glass sample bottles or plastic containers with volatile organic compound (VOC) impermeable walls must be used for corrosive substances (e.g., etch primers and certain coating catalysts such as methyl ethyl ketone (MEK) peroxide). Sample containers, caps, and inner seal liners must be inert to the compounds in the sample and must be selected on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.1 Other routine sampling supplies needed include waterproof marking pens, tubing, scrappers/spatulas, clean rags, paper towels, cooler/ice, long handle tongs, and mixing/stirring paddles.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 Personal safety equipment needed includes eye protection, respiratory protection, a hard hat, gloves, steel toe shoes, etc.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.3 Shipping supplies needed include shipping boxes, packing material, shipping labels, strapping tape, etc.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.4 Data recording forms and labels needed include coating data sheets and sample can labels.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The actual requirements will depend upon the conditions existing at the source sampled.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Laboratory Equipment and Supplies.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 Gas Chromatograph (GC). Any instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector and capable of being temperature programmed may be used. Optionally, other types of detectors (e.g., a mass spectrometer), and any necessary interfaces, may be used provided that the detector system yields an appropriate and reproducible response to the analytes in the injected sample. Autosampler injection may be used, if available.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 Recorder. If available, an electronic data station or integrator may be used to record the gas chromatogram and associated data. If a strip chart recorder is used, it must meet the following criteria: A 1 to 10 millivolt (mV) linear response with a full scale response time of 2 seconds or less and a maximum noise level of [0.03 percent of full scale. Other types of recorders may be used as appropriate to the specific detector installed provided that the recorder has a full scale response time of 2 seconds or less and a maximum noise level of [0.03 percent of full scale.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 Column. The column must be constructed of materials that do not react with components of the sample (e.g., fused silica, stainless steel, glass). The column should be of appropriate physical dimensions (e.g., length, internal diameter) and contain sufficient suitable stationary phase to allow separation of the analytes. DB-5, DB-Wax, and FFAP columns are commonly used for paint analysis; however, it is the responsibility of each analyst to select appropriate columns and stationary phases.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4 Tube and Tube Fittings. Supplies to connect the GC and gas cylinders.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.5 Pressure Regulators. Devices used to regulate the pressure between gas cylinders and the GC.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.6 Flow Meter. A device used to determine the carrier gas flow rate through the GC. Either a digital flow meter or a soap film bubble meter may be used to measure gas flow rates.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.7 Septa. Seals on the GC injection port through which liquid or gas samples can be injected using a syringe.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.8 Liquid Charging Devices. Devices used to inject samples into the GC such as clean and graduated 1, 5, and 10 microliter (l) capacity syringes.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.9 Vials. Containers that can be sealed with a septum in which samples may be prepared or stored. The recommended size is 25 ml capacity. Mininert [supreg] valves have been found satisfactory and are available from Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, Illinois.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.10 Balance. Device used to determine the weights of standards and samples. An analytical balance capable of accurately weighing to 0.0001 g is required.</p><p class="depth0">7. Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Purity of Reagents. Reagent grade chemicals shall be used in all tests. Unless otherwise specified, all reagents shall conform to the specifications of the Committee on Analytical Reagents of the American Chemical Society, where such specifications are available. Other grades may be used provided it is first ascertained that the reagent is of sufficient purity to permit its use without lessening the accuracy of determination.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Carrier Gas. Helium carrier gas shall have a purity of 99.995 percent or higher. High purity nitrogen may also be used. Other carrier gases that are appropriate for the column system and analyte may also be used. Ultra-high purity grade hydrogen gas and zero-grade air shall be used for the flame ionization detector.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Dimethylformamide (DMF). Solvent for all standards and samples. Some other suitable solvent may be used if DMF is not compatible with the sample or coelutes with a target analyte.</p><p class="depth0">Note: DMF may coelute with ethylbenzene or p-xylene under the conditions described in the note under Section 6.2.3.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Internal Standard Materials. The internal standard material is used in the quantitation of the analytes for this method. It shall be gas chromatography spectrophotometric quality or, if this grade is not available, the highest quality available. Obtain the assay for the internal standard material and maintain at that purity during use. The recommended internal standard material is 1-propanol; however, selection of an appropriate internal standard material for the particular coating and GC conditions used is the responsibility of each analyst.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Reference Standard Materials. The reference standard materials are the chemicals cited in Section 1.1 which are of known identity and purity and which are used to assist in the identification and quantification of the analytes of this method. They shall be the highest quality available. Obtain the assays for the reference standard materials and maintain at those purities during use.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Stock Reference Standards. Stock reference standards are dilutions of the reference standard materials that may be used on a daily basis to prepare calibration standards, calibration check standards, and quality control check standards. Stock reference standards may be prepared from the reference standard materials or purchased as certified solutions.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.1 Stock reference standards should be prepared in dimethylformamide for each analyte expected in the coating samples to be analyzed. The concentrations of analytes in the stock reference standards are not specified but must be adequate to prepare the calibration standards required in the method. A stock reference standard may contain more than one analyte provided all analytes are chemically compatible and no analytes coelute. The actual concentrations prepared must be known to within 0.1 percent (e.g., 0.1000 [0.0001 g/g solution). The following procedure is suggested. Place about 35 ml of dimethylformamide into a tared ground-glass stoppered 50 ml volumetric flask. Weigh the flask to the nearest 0.1 mg. Add 12.5 g of the reference standard material and reweigh the flask. Dilute to volume with dimethylformamide and reweigh. Stopper the flask and mix the contents by inverting the flask several times. Calculate the concentration in grams per gram of solution from the net gain in weights, correcting for the assayed purity of the reference standard material.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Although a glass-stoppered volumetric flask is convenient, any suitable glass container may be used because stock reference standards are prepared by weight.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.2 Transfer the stock reference standard solution into one or more Teflon-sealed screw-cap bottles. Store, with minimal headspace, at -10 C to 0 C and protect from light.</p><p class="depth0">7.6.3 Prepare fresh stock reference standards every six months, or sooner if analysis results from daily calibration check standards indicate a problem. Fresh stock reference standards for very volatile HAP's may have to be prepared more frequently.</p><p class="depth0">7.7 Calibration Standards. Calibration standards are used to determine the response of the detector to known amounts of reference material. Calibration standards must be prepared at a minimum of three concentration levels from the stock reference standards (see Section 7.6). Prepare the calibration standards in dimethylformamide (see Section 7.3). The lowest concentration standard should contain a concentration of analyte equivalent either to a concentration of no more than 0.01% of the analyte in a coating or to a concentration that is lower than the actual concentration of the analyte in the coating, whichever concentration is higher. The highest concentration standard

should contain a concentration of analyte equivalent to slightly more than the highest concentration expected for the analyte in a coating. The remaining calibration standard should contain a concentration of analyte roughly at the midpoint of the range defined by the lowest and highest concentration calibration standards. The concentration range of the standards should thus correspond to the expected range of analyte concentrations in the prepared coating samples (see Section 11.5). Each calibration standard should contain each analyte for detection by this method expected in the actual coating samples (e.g., some or all of the compounds listed in Section 1.1 may be included). Each calibration standard should also contain an appropriate amount of internal standard material (response for the internal standard material is within 25 to 75 percent of full scale on the attenuation setting for the particular reference standard concentration level). Calibration Standards should be stored for 1 week only in sealed vials with minimal headspace. If the stock reference standards were prepared as specified in Section 7.6, the calibration standards may be prepared by either weighing each addition of the stock reference standard or by adding known volumes of the stock reference standard and calculating the mass of the standard reference material added. Alternative 1 (Section 7.7.1) specifies the procedure to be followed when the stock reference standard is added by volume. Alternative 2 (Section 7.7.2) specifies the procedure to be followed when the stock reference standard is added by weight.</p><p class="depth0">Note: To assist with determining the appropriate amount of internal standard to add, as required here and in other sections of this method, the analyst may find it advantageous to prepare a curve showing the area response versus the amount of internal standard injected into the GC.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.1 Preparation Alternative 1. Determine the amount of each stock reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or Mininert [supreg] valve, add the total amount of dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add the calculated amount of each stock reference standard using new pipets (or pipet tips) for each stock reference standard. Reweigh the vial and seal it. Using the known weights of the standard reference materials per ml in the stock reference standards, the volumes added, and the total weight of all reagents added to the vial, calculate the weight percent of each standard reference material in the calibration standard prepared. Repeat this process for each calibration standard to be prepared.</p><p class="depth0">7.7.2 Preparation Alternative 2. Determine the amount of each stock reference standard and dimethylformamide solvent needed to prepare approximately 25 ml of the specific calibration concentration level desired. To a tared 25 ml vial that can be sealed with a crimp-on or Mininert [supreg] valve, add the total amount of dimethylformamide calculated to be needed. As quickly as practical, add the calculated amount of a stock reference standard using a new pipet (or pipet tip) and reweigh the vial. Repeat this process for each stock reference standard to be added. Seal the vial after obtaining the final weight. Using the known weight percents of the standard reference materials in the stock reference standards, the weights of the stock reference standards added, and the total weight of all reagents added to the vial, calculate the weight percent of each standard reference material in the calibration standard prepared. Repeat this process for each calibration standard to be prepared.</p><p class="depth0">8. Sample Collection, Preservation, Transport, and Storage</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Copies of material safety data sheets (MSDS's) for each sample should be obtained prior to sampling. The MSDS's contain information on the ingredients, and physical and chemical properties data. The MSDS's also contain recommendations for proper handling or required safety precautions. Certified product data sheets (CPDS) may also include information relevant to the analysis of the coating sample including, but not limited to, separation column, oven temperature, carrier gas, injection port temperature, extraction solvent, and internal standard.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 A copy of the blender's worksheet can be requested to obtain data on the exact coating being sampled. A blank coating data sheet form (see Section 18) may also be used. The manufacturer's formulation information from the product data sheet should also be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Prior to sample collection, thoroughly mix the coating to ensure that a representative, homogeneous sample is obtained. It is preferred that this be accomplished using a coating can shaker or similar device; however, when necessary, this may be accomplished using mechanical agitation or circulation systems.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 Water-thinned coatings tend to incorporate or entrain air bubbles if stirred too vigorously; mix these types of coatings slowly and only as long as necessary to homogenize.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Each component of multicomponent coatings that harden when mixed must be sampled separately. The component mix ratios must be obtained at the facility at the time of sampling and submitted to the analytical laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Sample Collection. Samples must be collected in a manner that prevents or minimizes loss of volatile components and that does not contaminate the coating reservoir. A suggested procedure is as follows. Select a sample collection container which has a capacity at least 25 percent greater than the container in which the sample is to be transported. Make sure both sample containers are clean and dry. Using clean, long-handled tongs, turn the sample collection container upside down and lower it into the coating reservoir. The mouth of the sample collection container should be at approximately the midpoint of the reservoir (do not take the sample from the top surface). Turn the sample collection container over and slowly bring it to the top of the coating reservoir. Rapidly pour the collected coating into the sample container, filling it completely. It is important to fill the sample container completely to avoid any loss of volatiles due to volatilization into the headspace. Return any unused coating to the reservoir or dispose as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If a company requests a set of samples for its own analysis, a separate set of samples, using new sample containers, should be taken at the same time.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Once the sample is collected, place the sample container on a firm surface and insert the inner seal in the container by placing the seal inside the rim of the container, inverting a screw cap, and pressing down on the screw cap which will evenly force the inner seal into the container for a tight fit. Using clean towels or rags, remove all residual coating material from the outside of the sample container after inserting the inner seal. Screw the cap onto the container.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 Affix a sample label (see Section 18) clearly identifying the sample, date collected, and person collecting the sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 Prepare the sample for transportation to the laboratory. The sample should be maintained at the coating's recommended storage temperature specified on the Material Safety Data Sheet, or, if no temperature is specified, the sample should be maintained within the range of 5 C to 38 C.</p><p class="depth0">8.9 The shipping container should adhere to U.S. Department of Transportation specification DOT 12-B. Coating samples are considered hazardous materials; appropriate shipping procedures should be followed.</p><p class="depth0">9. Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Laboratories using this method should operate a formal quality control program. The minimum requirements of the program should consist of an initial demonstration of laboratory capability and an ongoing analysis of blanks and quality control samples to evaluate and document quality data. The laboratory must maintain records to document the quality of the data generated. When results indicate atypical method performance, a quality control check standard (see Section 9.4) must be analyzed to confirm that the measurements were performed in an in-control mode of operation.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Before processing any samples, the analyst must demonstrate, through analysis of a reagent blank, that there are no interferences from the analytical system, glassware, and reagents that would bias the sample analysis results. Each time a set of analytical samples is processed or there is a change in reagents, a reagent blank should be processed as a safeguard against chronic laboratory contamination. The blank samples should be carried through all stages of the sample preparation and measurement steps.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 Required instrument quality control parameters are found in the following sections:</p><p class="depth0">9.3.1 Baseline stability must be demonstrated to be 45 percent of full scale using the procedures given in Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.2 The GC calibration is not valid unless the retention time (RT) for each analyte at each concentration is within [0.05 min of the retention time measured for that analyte in the stock standard.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.3 The retention time (RT) of any sample analyte must be within [0.05 min of the average RT of the analyte in the calibration standards for the analyte to be considered tentatively identified.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.4 The GC system must be calibrated as specified in Section 10.2.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.5 A one-point daily calibration check must be performed as specified in Section 10.3.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 To establish the ability to generate results having acceptable accuracy and precision, the analyst must perform the following operations.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.1 Prepare a quality control check standard (QCCS) containing each analyte expected in the coating samples at a concentration expected to result in a response between 25 percent and 75 percent of the limits of the calibration curve when the sample is prepared as described in Section 11.5. The QCCS may be prepared from reference standard materials or purchased as certified solutions. If prepared in the laboratory, the QCCS must be prepared independently from the calibration standards.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.2 Analyze three aliquots of the QCCS according to the method beginning in Section 11.5.3 and calculate the weight percent of each analyte using Equation 1, Section 12.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.3 Calculate the mean weight percent (X) for each analyte from the three results obtained in Section 9.4.2.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.4 Calculate the percent accuracy for each analyte using the known concentrations (Ti) in the QCCS using Equation 3, Section 12.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.5 Calculate the percent relative standard deviation (percent RSD) for each analyte using Equation 7, Section 12, substituting the appropriate values for the relative response factors (RRF's) in said equation.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.6 If the percent accuracy (Section 9.4.4) for all analytes is within the range 90 percent to 110 percent and the percent RSD (Section 9.4.5) for all analytes is 420 percent, system performance is acceptable and sample analysis may begin. If these criteria are not met for any analyte, then system performance is not acceptable for that analyte and the test must be repeated for those analytes only. Repeated failures indicate a general problem with the measurement system that must be located and corrected. In this case, the entire test, beginning at Section 9.4.1, must be repeated after the problem is corrected.</p><p class="depth0">9.5 Great care must be exercised to maintain the integrity of all standards. It is recommended that all standards be stored at -10 C to 0 C in screw-cap amber glass bottles with Teflon liners.</p><p class="depth0">9.6 Unless otherwise specified, all weights are to be recorded within 0.1 mg.</p><p class="depth0">10. Calibration and Standardization.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Column Baseline Drift. Before each calibration and series of determinations and before the daily calibration check, condition the column using procedures developed by the laboratory or as specified by the column supplier. Operate the GC at initial (i.e., before sample injection) conditions on the lowest attenuation to be used during sample analysis. Adjust the recorder pen to zero on the chart and obtain a baseline for at least one minute. Initiate the GC operating cycle that would be used for sample analysis. On the recorder chart, mark the pen position at the end of the simulated sample analysis cycle. Baseline drift is defined as the absolute difference in the pen positions at the beginning and end of the cycle in the direction perpendicular to the chart movement. Calculate the percent baseline drift by dividing the baseline drift by the chart width representing full-scale deflection and multiply the result by 100.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Calibration of GC. Bring all stock standards and calibration standards to room temperature while establishing the GC at the determined operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.1 Retention Times (RT's) for Individual Compounds.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The procedures of this subsection are required only for the initial calibration. However, it is good laboratory practice to follow these procedures for some or all analytes before each calibration. The procedures were written for chromatograms output to a strip chart recorder. More modern instruments (e.g., integrators and electronic data stations) determine and print out or display retention times automatically.</p><p class="depth0">The RT for each analyte should be determined before calibration. This provides a positive identification for each peak observed from the calibration standards. Inject an appropriate volume (see note in Section 11.5.2) of one of the stock reference standards into the gas chromatograph and record on the chart the pen position at the time of the injection (see Section 7.6.1). Dilute an aliquot of the stock reference standard as required in dimethylformamide to achieve a concentration that will result in an on-scale response. Operate the gas chromatograph according to the determined procedures. Select the peak(s) that correspond to the analyte(s) [and internal standard, if used] and measure the retention time(s). If a chart recorder is used, measure the distance(s) on the chart from the injection point to the peak maxima. These distances, divided by the chart speed, are defined as the RT's of the analytes in question. Repeat this process for each of the stock reference standard solutions.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If gas chromatography with mass spectrometer detection (GC-MS) is used, a stock reference standard may contain a group of analytes, provided all analytes are adequately separated during the analysis. Mass spectral library matching can be used to identify the analyte associated with each peak in the gas chromatogram. The retention time for the analyte then becomes the retention time of its peak in the chromatogram.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2 Calibration. The GC must be calibrated using a minimum of three concentration levels of each potential analyte. (See Section 7.7 for instructions on preparation of the calibration standards.) Beginning with the lowest concentration level calibration standard, carry out the analysis procedure as described beginning in Section 11.7. Repeat the procedure for each progressively higher concentration level until all calibration standards have been analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2.1 Calculate the RT's for the internal standard and for each analyte in the calibration standards at each concentration level as described in Section 10.2.1. The RT's for the internal standard must not vary by more than 0.10 minutes. Identify each analyte by comparison of the RT's for peak maxima to the RT's determined in Section 10.2.1.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2.2 Compare the retention times (RT's) for each potential analyte in the calibration standards for each concentration level to the retention times determined in Section 10.2.1. The calibration is not valid unless all RT's for all analytes meet the criteria given in Section 9.3.2.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2.3 Tabulate the area responses and the concentrations for the internal standard and each analyte in the calibration standards. Calculate the response factor for the

internal standard (RFis) and the response factor for each compound relative to the internal standard (RRF) for each concentration level using Equations 5 and 6, Section 12.</p><p class="depth0">10.2.2.4 Using the RRF's from the calibration, calculate the percent relative standard deviation (percent RSD) for each analyte in the calibration standard using Equation 7, Section 12. The percent RSD for each individual calibration analyte must be less than 15 percent. This criterion must be met in order for the calibration to be valid. If the criterion is met, the mean RRF's determined above are to be used until the next calibration.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Daily Calibration Checks. The calibration curve (Section 10.2.2) must be checked and verified at least once each day that samples are analyzed. This is accomplished by analyzing a calibration standard that is at a concentration near the midpoint of the working range and performing the checks in Sections 10.3.1, 10.3.2, and 10.3.3.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 For each analyte in the calibration standard, calculate the percent difference in the RRF from the last calibration using Equation 8, Section 12. If the percent difference for each calibration analyte is less than 10 percent, the last calibration curve is assumed to be valid. If the percent difference for any analyte is greater than 5 percent, the analyst should consider this a warning limit. If the percent difference for any one calibration analyte exceeds 10 percent, corrective action must be taken. If no source of the problem can be determined after corrective action has been taken, a new three-point (minimum) calibration must be generated. This criterion must be met before quantitative analysis begins.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.2 If the RFis for the internal standard changes by more than [20 percent from the last daily calibration check, the system must be inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.3 The retention times for the internal standard and all calibration check analytes must be evaluated. If the retention time for the internal standard or for any calibration check analyte changes by more than 0.10 min from the last calibration, the system must be inspected for malfunctions and corrections made as required.</p><p class="depth0">11. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 All samples and standards must be allowed to warm to room temperature before analysis. Observe the given order of ingredient addition to minimize loss of volatiles.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Bring the GC system to the determined operating conditions and condition the column as described in Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The temperature of the injection port may be an especially critical parameter. Information about the proper temperature may be found on the CPDS.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Perform the daily calibration checks as described in Section 10.3. Samples are not to be analyzed until the criteria in Section 10.3 are met.</p><p class="depth0">11.4 Place the as-received coating sample on a paint shaker, or similar device, and shake the sample for a minimum of 5 minutes to achieve homogenization.</p><p class="depth0">11.5 Note: The steps in this section must be performed rapidly and without interruption to avoid loss of volatile organics. These steps must be performed in a laboratory hood free from solvent vapors. All weights must be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mg.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.1 Add 16 g of dimethylformamide to each of two tared vials (A and B) capable of being septum sealed.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.2 To each vial add a weight of coating that will result in the response for the major constituent being in the upper half of the linear range of the calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The magnitude of the response obviously depends on the amount of sample injected into the GC as specified in Section 11.8. This volume must be the same as used for preparation of the calibration curve, otherwise shifts in compound retention times may occur. If a sample is prepared that results in a response outside the limits of the calibration curve, new samples must be prepared; changing the volume injected to bring the response within the calibration curve limits is not permitted.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.3 Add a weight of internal standard to each vial (A and B) that will result in the response for the internal standard being between 25 percent and 75 percent of the linear range of the calibration curve.</p><p class="depth0">11.5.4 Seal the vials with crimp-on or Mininert [supreg] septum seals.</p><p class="depth0">11.6 Shake the vials containing the prepared coating samples for 60 seconds. Allow the vials to stand undisturbed for ten minutes. If solids have not settled out on the bottom after 10 minutes, then centrifuge at 1,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The analyst also has the option of injecting the sample without allowing the solids to settle.</p><p class="depth0">11.7 Analyses should be conducted in the following order: daily calibration check sample, method blank, up to 10 injections from sample vials (i.e., one injection each from up to five pairs of vials, which corresponds to analysis of 5 coating samples).</p><p class="depth0">11.8 Inject the prescribed volume of supernatant from the calibration check sample, the method blank, and the sample vials onto the chromatographic column and record the chromatograms while operating the system under the specified operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The analyst has the option of injecting the unseparated sample.</p><p class="depth0">12. Data Analysis and Calculations</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Qualitative Analysis. An analyte (e.g., those cited in Section 1.1) is considered tentatively identified if two criteria are satisfied: (1) elution of the sample analyte within [0.05 min of the average GC retention time of the same analyte in the calibration standard; and (2) either (a) confirmation of the identity of the compound by spectral matching on a gas chromatograph equipped with a mass selective detector or (b) elution of the sample analyte within [0.05 min of the average GC retention time of the same analyte in the calibration standard analyzed on a dissimilar GC column.</p><p class="depth0">12.1.1 The RT of the sample analyte must meet the criteria specified in Section 9.3.3.</p><p class="depth0">12.1.2 When doubt exists as to the identification of a peak or the resolution of two or more components possibly comprising one peak, additional confirmatory techniques (listed in Section 12.1) must be used.</p><p class="depth0">12.2 Quantitative Analysis.

It is applicable at least over the range of 0.01 to 10.0 % residual toluene and from 0.1 to 3.0 % residual styrene. It is probably applicable over a wider range, but this must be verified prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 The method may also be applicable to other process samples as long as they are of a similar composition to stripper crumb. See section 3.1 of this method for a description of stripper crumb.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 The wet crumb is placed in a sealed vial and run on a headspace sampler which heats the vial to a specified temperature for a specific time and then injects a known volume of vapor into a capillary GC. The concentration of each component in the vapor is proportional to the level of that component in the crumb sample and does not depend on water content of the crumb.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Identification of each component is performed by comparing the retention times to those of known standards.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Results are calculated by the external standard method since injections are all performed in an identical manner.

The primary component of this will be polymer with lesser amounts of entrained water and residual toluene and other hydrocarbons. The amounts of hydrocarbons present must be such that the crumb is a solid material, generally less that 10 % of the dry rubber weight.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Contamination is not normally a problem since samples are sealed into vials immediately on sampling.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Cross contamination in the headspace sampler should not be a problem if the correct sampler settings are used. This should be verified by running a blank sample immediately following a normal or high sample. Settings may be modified if necessary if this proves to be a problem, or a blank sample may be inserted between samples.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Interferences may occur if volatile hydrocarbons are present which have retention times close to that of the components of interest.

Allow the water to drain freely, do not attempt to squeeze any water from the crumb. Results will not depend on the exact water content of the samples. Immediately place several pieces of crumb directly into a headspace vial. This should be done with rubber gloves to protect the hands from both the heat and from contact with residual hydrocarbons. The vial should be between \1/4\ and \1/3\ full. Results do not depend on sample size as long as there is sufficient sample to reach an equilibrium vapor pressure in the headspace of the vial. Cap and seal the vial. Prepare each sample at least in duplicate. This is to minimize the effect of the variation that naturally occurs in the composition of non homogeneous crumb. The free water is not analyzed by this method and should be disposed of appropriately along with any unused rubber crumb.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 Alternatively the process can be sampled in a specially constructed sealed bomb which can then be transported to the laboratory. The bomb is then cooled to ambient temperature by applying a stream of running water. The bomb can then be opened and the crumb separated from the water and the vials filled as described in section 8.1.1 of this method. The bomb may be stored up to 8 hours prior to transferring the crumb into vials.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 The sealed headspace vials may be run immediately or may be stored up to 72 hours prior to running. It is possible that even longer storage times may be acceptable, but this must be verified for the particular type of sample being analyzed (see section 9.2.3 of this method). The main concern here is that some types of rubber eventually may flow, thus compacting the crumb so that the surface area is reduced. This may have some effect on the headspace equilibration.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 The laboratory is required to operate a formal quality control program. This consists of an initial demonstration of the capability of the method as well as ongoing analysis of standards, blanks and spiked samples to demonstrate continued performance.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.1 When the method is first set up a calibration is run (described in section 10 of this method) and an initial demonstration of method capability is performed (described in section 9.2 of this method). Also recovery efficiency for each type of sample must be determined (see section 9.4 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.1.2 It is permissible to modify this method in order to improve separations or make other improvements, provided that all performance specifications are met. Each time a modification to the method is made it is necessary to repeat the calibration (section 10 of this method), the demonstration of method performance (section 9.2 of this method) and the recovery efficiency for each type of sample (section 9.4 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.1.3 Ongoing performance should be monitored by running a spiked rubber standard. If this test fails to demonstrate that the analysis is in control, then corrective action must be taken. This method is described in section 9.3 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.4 If new types of samples are being analyzed then recovery efficiency for each new type of sample must be determined. New type includes any change, such as polymer type, physical form or a significant change in the composition of the matrix.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Initial demonstration of method capability to establish the accuracy and precision of the method. This is to be run following the calibration described in section 10 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 Prepare a series of identical spiked rubber standards as described in section 9.3 of this method. A sufficient number to determine statistical information on the test should be run. Ten may be a suitable number, depending on the quality control methodology used at the laboratory running the tests. These are run in the same manner as unknown samples (see section 11 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Determine mean and standard deviation for the results. Use these to determine the capability of the method and to calculate suitable control limits for the ongoing performance check which will utilize the same standards.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3 Prepare several additional spiked rubber standards and run 2 each day to determine the suitability of storage of the samples for 24, 48 and 72 hours or longer if longer storage times are desired.</p><p class="depth0">9.3 A spiked rubber standard should be run on a regular basis to verify system performance. This would probably be done daily if samples are run daily. This is prepared in the same manner as the calibration standards (section 10.1 of this method), except that only one concentration of toluene and styrene is prepared. Choose concentrations of toluene and styrene that fall in the middle of the range expected in the stripper crumb and then do not change these unless there is a major change in the composition of the unknowns. If it becomes necessary to change the composition of this standard the initial performance demonstration must be repeated with the new standard (section 9.2 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">9.3.1 Each day prepare one spiked rubber standard to be run the following day. The dry rubber may be prepared in bulk and stored for any length of time consistent with the shelf life of the product. The addition of water and hydrocarbons must be performed daily and all the steps described under section 10.1 of this method must be followed.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.2 Run the spiked rubber standard prepared the previous day. Record the results and plot on an appropriate control chart or other means of determining statistical control.</p><p class="depth0">9.3.3 If the results for the standard indicate that the test is out of control then corrective action must be taken. This may include a check on procedures, instrument settings, maintenance or recalibration. Samples may be stored (see section 8.2 of this method) until compliance is demonstrated.</p><p class="depth0">9.4 Recovery efficiency must be determined once for each sample type and whenever modifications are made to the method.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.1 For each sample type collect 12 samples from the process (section 8.1 of this method). This should be done when the process is operating in a normal manner and residual hydrocarbon levels are in the normal range. Half the vials and caps should be tared, labeled ``spiked'' and numbered 1 through 6. The other vials are labeled ``unspiked'' and need not be tared but are also numbered 1 through 6. Immediately on sampling, the vials should be capped to prevent loss of volatiles. Allow all the samples to cool completely to ambient temperature. Reweigh each of the vials labeled ``spiked'' to determine the weight of wet crumb inside.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.2 The dry weight of rubber present in the wet crumb is estimated by multiplying the weight of wet crumb by the fraction of nonvolatiles typical for the sample. If this is not known, an additional quantity of crumb may be sampled, weighed, dried in an oven and reweighed to determine the fraction of volatiles and nonvolatiles prior to starting this procedure.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.3 To the vials labeled ``spiked'' add an amount of a mixture of toluene and styrene that is between 40 and 60 % of the amount expected in the crumb. This is done by removing the cap, adding the mixture by syringe, touching the tip of the needle to the sample in order to remove the drop and then immediately recapping the vials. The mixture is not added through the septum, because a punctured septum may leak and vent vapors as the vial is heated. The weights of toluene and styrene added may be calculated from the volumes of the mixture added, its composition and density, or may be determined by the weight of the vials and caps prior to and after addition. The exact dry weight of rubber present and the concentration of residual toluene and styrene are not known at this time so an exact calculation of the concentration of hydrocarbons is not possible until the test is completed.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.4 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 [2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.5 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.6 Run the spiked and unspiked samples in the normal manner. Record the concentrations of toluene and styrene reported for each pair of spiked and unspiked samples with the same vial number.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.7 Open each of the vials labeled ``spiked'', remove all the rubber crumb and place it into a tarred drying pan. Place in a 100 deg C oven for two hours, cool and reweigh. Subtract the weight of the tare to give the dry weight of rubber in each spiked vial. Calculate the concentration of toluene and styrene spiked into each vial as percent of dry rubber weight. This will be slightly different for each vial since the weights of dry rubber will be different.</p><p class="depth0">9.4.8 For each hydrocarbon calculate the average recovery efficiency (R) using the following equations:
R=R--[Sigma](Pn)/6 (average of the 6 individual Rn</p><p class="depth0">values)
Where:Rn = (Cns--Cnu) / Sn

Place these in a single layer on a piece of aluminum foil or other suitable surface and place into a forced air oven at 100 C for four hours. This is to remove any residual hydrocarbons that may be present. This step may be performed in advance.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.2 Into each of a series of vials add 3.0 g of the dry rubber.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.3 Into each vial add 1.0 ml distilled water or an amount that is close to the

amount that will be present in the unknowns. The exact amount of water present does not have much effect on the analysis, but it is necessary to have a saturated environment. The water will also aid in the uniform distribution of the spiked hydrocarbons over the surface of the rubber after the vials are placed on the shaker (in step 10.1.5 of this method).</p><p class="depth0">10.1.4 Into each vial add varying amounts of toluene and styrene by microliter syringe and cap the vials immediately to prevent loss. The tip of the needle should be carefully touched to the rubber in order to transfer the last drop to the rubber. Toluene and styrene may first be mixed together in suitable proportions and added together if desired. The weights of toluene and styrene added may be calculated from the volumes of the mixture added, its composition and density, or may be determined by the weight of the vials and caps prior to and after addition. Concentrations of added hydrocarbons are calculated as percent of the dry rubber weight. At least 5 standards should be prepared with the amounts of hydrocarbons added being calculated to cover the entire range possible in the unknowns. Retain two samples with no added hydrocarbons as blanks.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.5 Place all the vials onto a shaker or tumbler for 24 [2 hours. This is essential in order for the hydrocarbons to be evenly distributed and completely absorbed into the rubber. If this is not followed the toluene and styrene will be mostly at the surface of the rubber and high results will be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">10.1.6 Remove the vials from the shaker and tap them so that all the crumb settles to the bottom of the vials. Allow them to stand for 1 hour prior to analysis to allow any liquid to drain fully to the bottom.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Run the standards and blanks in the same manner as described for unknowns (section 11 of this method), starting with a blank, then in order of increasing hydrocarbon content and ending with the other blank.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Verify that the blanks are sufficiently free from toluene and styrene or any interfering hydrocarbons.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 It is possible that trace levels may be present even in dry product. If levels are high enough that they will interfere with the calibration then the drying procedure in section 10.1.1 of this method should be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure that suitable standards can be prepared.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.2 It is possible that the final blank is contaminated by the previous standard. If this is the case review and modify the sampler parameters as needed to eliminate this problem.

If a wide range of levels are to be determined it may be desirable to apply a nonlinear calibration to get the best fit.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Place the vials in the tray of the headspace sampler. Enter the starting and ending positions through the console of the sampler. For unknown samples each is run in duplicate to minimize the effect of variations in crumb composition.

The actual performance depends largely on the exact nature of the samples being analyzed.

A schematic of the sampling train used in this method is shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3. Complete construction details are given in APTD-0581 (Reference 2 in section 17.0 of this method); commercial models of this train are also available. For changes from APTD-0581 and for allowable modifications of the train shown in Figure 5-1, Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3, see the following subsections.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The operating and maintenance procedures for the sampling train are described in APTD-0576 (Reference 3 in section 17.0 of this method). Since correct usage is important in obtaining valid results, all users should read APTD-0576 and adopt the operating and maintenance procedures outlined in it, unless otherwise specified herein. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application. The use of grease for sealing sampling train components is not recommended because many greases are soluble in methylene chloride. The sampling train consists of the following components:</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.1 Probe nozzle. Glass or glass lined with sharp, tapered leading edge. The angle of taper shall be 430 , and the taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant internal diameter. The probe nozzle shall be of the button-hook or elbow design, unless otherwise specified by the Administrator. Other materials of construction may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be available. Typical nozzle sizes range from 0.32 to 1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/2\ in.) inside diameter (ID) in increments of 0.16 cm (\1/16\ in.). Larger nozzle sizes are also available if higher volume sampling trains are used.

Borosilicate or quartz glass tubing with a heating system capable of maintaining a probe gas temperature at the exit end during sampling of 120 [14 C (248[25 F), or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application. Because the actual temperature at the outlet of the probe is not usually monitored during sampling, probes constructed according to APTD-0581 and using the calibration curves of APTD-0576 (or calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-0576) will be considered acceptable. Either borosilicate or quartz glass probe liners may be used for stack temperatures up to about 480 C (900 F); quartz liners shall be used for temperatures between 480 and 900 C (900 and 1,650

F). Both types of liners may be used at higher temperatures than specified for short periods of time, subject to the approval of the Administrator. The softening temperature for borosilicate glass is 820 C (1,500 F) and for quartz glass it is 1,500 C (2,700 F).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.3 Pitot tube.

The holder shall be attached immediately at the outlet of the probe (or cyclone, if used).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.6 Filter heating system. Any heating system capable of maintaining a temperature around the filter holder of 120 [14 C (248 [25 F) during sampling, or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator for a particular application. Alternatively, the tester may opt to operate the equipment at a temperature lower than that specified. A temperature gauge capable of measuring temperature to within 3 C (5.4 F) shall be installed so that the temperature around the filter holder can be regulated and monitored during sampling. Heating systems other than the one shown in APTD-0581 may be used.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.7 Temperature sensor.

The first, third, and fourth impingers shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip with a 1.3 cm (1/2 in.) ID glass tube extending to about 1.3 cm (1/2 in.) from the bottom of the flask. The second impinger shall be of the Greenburg-Smith design with the standard tip. The first and second impingers shall contain known quantities of water (section 8.3.1 of this method), the third shall be empty, and the fourth shall contain a known weight of silica gel or equivalent desiccant. A temperature sensor capable of measuring temperature to within 1 C (2 F) shall be placed at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.9 Metering system. Vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, temperature sensors capable of measuring temperature to within 3 C (5.4 F), dry gas meter (DGM) capable of measuring volume to within 2 percent, and related equipment, as shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Other metering systems capable of maintaining sampling rates within 10 percent of isokinetic and of determining sample volumes to within 2 percent may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. When the metering system is used in conjunction with a pitot tube, the system shall allow periodic checks of isokinetic rates.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1.10 Sampling trains using metering systems designed for higher flow rates than that described in APTD-0581 or APTD-0576 may be used provided that the specifications of this method are met.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 Barometer. Mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm (0.1 in.) Hg.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National Weather Service station. In this case, the station value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) shall be requested and an adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point shall be made at a rate of minus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) elevation increase or plus 2.5 mm (0.1 in) Hg per 30 m (100 ft) elevation decrease.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.3 Gas density determination equipment. Temperature sensor and pressure gauge, as described in sections 6.3 and 6.4 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and gas analyzer, if necessary, as described in Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The temperature sensor shall, preferably, be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe in a fixed configuration, such that the tip of the sensor extends beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the Type S pitot tube openings (see Method 2, Figure 2-4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of not more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be introduced, the temperature sensor need not be

attached to the probe or pitot tube. (This alternative is subject to the approval of the Administrator.)</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Sample recovery. The following items are required for sample recovery:</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 Probe-liner and probe-nozzle brushes. Nylon or Teflon [supreg] bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles.

The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to brush out the probe liner and nozzle.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 Wash bottles. Glass wash bottles are recommended. Polyethylene or tetrafluoroethylene (TFE) wash bottles may be used, but they may introduce a positive bias due to contamination from the bottle. It is recommended that acetone not be stored in polyethylene or TFE bottles for longer than a month.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 Glass sample storage containers. Chemically resistant, borosilicate glass bottles, for acetone and methylene chloride washes and impinger water, 500 ml or 1,000 ml.

Flat bottom, smooth sides, and flanged top, 18 mm deep and with an inside diameter of approximately 60 mm.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">7.l Sample collection. The following reagents are required for sample collection:</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 Filters. Glass fiber filters, without organic binder, exhibiting at least 99.95 percent efficiency (<0.05 percent penetration) on 0.3 micron dioctyl phthalate smoke particles. The filter efficiency test shall be conducted in accordance with ASTM Method D 2986-95A (incorporated by reference in Sec. 63.841 of this part). Test data from the supplier's quality control program are sufficient for this purpose. In sources containing S02 or S03, the filter material must be of a type that is unreactive to S02 or S03. Reference 10 in section 17.0 of this method may be used to select the appropriate filter.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2 Silica gel. Indicating type, 6 to l6 mesh. If previously used, dry at l75 C (350 F) for 2 hours. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.3 Water. When analysis of the material caught in the impingers is required, deionized distilled water shall be used. Run blanks prior to field use to eliminate a high blank on test samples.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.4 Crushed ice.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.5 Stopcock grease. Acetone-insoluble, heat-stable silicone grease. This is not necessary if screw-on connectors with Teflon'' sleeves, or similar, are used. Alternatively, other types of stopcock grease may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator. [Caution: Many stopcock greases are methylene chloride-soluble. Use sparingly and carefully remove prior to recovery to prevent contamination of the MCEM analysis.]</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Sample recovery. The following reagents are required for sample recovery:</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Acetone. Acetone with blank values <1 ppm, by weight residue, is required. Acetone blanks may be run prior to field use, and only acetone with low blank values may be used. In no case shall a blank value of greater than 1E-06 of the weight of acetone used be subtracted from the sample weight.</p><p class="depth0">Note: This is more restrictive than Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. At least one vendor (Supelco Incorporated located in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania) lists <1 mg/l as residue for its Environmental Analysis Solvents.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Methylene chloride. Methylene chloride with a blank value <1.5 ppm, by weight, residue. Methylene chloride blanks may be run prior to field use, and only methylene

Anhydrous calcium sulfate, indicating type. Alternatively, other types of desiccants may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">7.3.3 Methylene chloride. Same as in section 7.2.2 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</p><p class="depth0">Note: The complexity of this method is such that, in order to obtain reliable results, testers should be trained and experienced with the test procedures.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Pretest preparation. It is suggested that sampling equipment be maintained according to the procedures described in APTD-0576. Alternative mercury-free thermometers may be used if the thermometers are at a minimum equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 Weigh several 200 g to 300 g portions of silica gel in airtight containers to the nearest 0.5 g. Record on each container the total weight of the silica gel plus container. As an alternative, the silica gel need not be preweighed but may be weighed directly in its impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 A batch of glass fiber filters, no more than 50 at a time, should placed in a soxhlet extraction apparatus and extracted using methylene chloride for at least 16 hours. After extraction, check filters visually against light for irregularities, flaws, or pinhole leaks. Label the shipping containers (glass or plastic petri dishes), and keep the filters in these containers at all times except during sampling and weighing.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Desiccate the filters at 20 [5.6 C (68 [10 F) and ambient pressure for at least 24 hours and weigh at intervals of at least 6 hours to a constant weight, i.e., <0.5 mg change from previous weighing; record results to the nearest 0.1 mg. During each weighing the filter must not be exposed to the laboratory atmosphere for longer than 2 minutes and a relative humidity above 50 percent. Alternatively (unless otherwise specified by the Administrator), the filters may be oven-dried at 104 C (220 F) for 2 to 3 hours, desiccated for 2 hours, and weighed. Procedures other than those described, which account for relative humidity effects, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Preliminary determinations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling points according to Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified by the Administrator. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and the range of velocity heads using Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; it is recommended that a leak check of the pitot lines (see section 8.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) be performed. Determine the moisture content using Approximation Method 4 (section 1.2 of Method 4, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) or its alternatives to make isokinetic sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as described in section 8.6 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A; if integrated Method 3 sampling is used for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the particulate sample run.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads such that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates. During the run, do not change the nozzle size. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see section 8.2 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length such that all traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack to reduce the required probe length.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Select a total sampling time greater than or equal to the minimum total sampling time specified in the test procedures for the specific industry such that: (1) The sampling time per point is not less than 2 minutes (or some greater time interval as specified by the Administrator); and (2) the sample volume taken (corrected to standard conditions) will exceed the required minimum total gas sample volume. The latter is based on an approximate average sampling rate.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 The sampling time at each point shall be the same. It is recommended that the number of minutes sampled at each point be an integer or an integer plus one-half minute, in order to eliminate timekeeping errors.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles), it may be necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to obtain smaller gas sample volumes. In these cases, the Administrator's approval must first be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Preparation of sampling train.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all openings where contamination can occur covered until just

prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin. Place l00 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, leave the third impinger empty, and transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of preweighed silica gel from its container to the fourth impinger. More silica gel may be used, but care should be taken to ensure that it is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and recorded.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Using a tweezer or clean disposable surgical gloves, place a labeled (identified) and weighed filter in the filter holder. Be sure that the filter is properly centered and the gasket properly placed so as to prevent the sample gas stream from circumventing the filter. Check the filter for tears after assembly is completed.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 When glass liners are used, install the selected nozzle using a Viton A 0-ring when stack temperatures are less than 260 C (500 F) and an asbestos string gasket when temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 for details. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 Set up the train as in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, using (if necessary) a very light coat of silicone grease on all ground glass joints, greasing only the outer portion (see APTD-0576) to avoid possibility of contamination by the silicone grease. Subject to the approval of the Administrator, a glass cyclone may be used between the probe and filter holder when the total particulate catch is expected to exceed 100 mg or when water droplets are present in the stack gas.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.5 Place crushed ice around the impingers.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Leak-check procedures.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Leak check of metering system shown in Figure 5-1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. That portion of the sampling train from the pump to the orifice meter should be leak-checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. The following procedure is suggested (see Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A): Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13 to 18 cm (5 to 7 in.) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing, and observe the manometer for 1 minute. A loss of pressure on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box; leaks, if present, must be corrected.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Pretest leak check. A pretest leak-check is recommended but not required. If the pretest leak-check is conducted, the following procedure should be used.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set the filter and probe heating systems to the desired operating temperatures. Allow time for the temperatures to stabilize. If a Viton A 0-ring or other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that it is not exceeded during the test.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2.2 If an asbestos string is used, do not connect the probe to the train during the leak check. Instead, leak-check the train by first plugging the inlet to the filter holder (cyclone, if applicable) and pulling a 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. (See NOTE in section 8.4.2.1 of this method). Then connect the probe to the train and perform the leak check at approximately 25 mm (1 in.) Hg vacuum; alternatively, the probe may be leak-checked with the rest of the sampling train, in one step, at 380 mm (15 in.) Hg vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of 4 percent of the average sampling rate or 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, are unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2.3 The following leak check instructions for the sampling train described in APTD-0576 and APTD-058l may be helpful. Start the pump with the bypass valve fully open and the coarse adjust valve completely closed. Partially open the coarse adjust valve and slowly close the bypass valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse the direction of the bypass valve, as this will cause water to back up into the filter holder. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either leak-check at this higher vacuum or end the leak check as shown below and start over.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2.4 When the leak check is completed, first slowly remove the plug from the inlet to the probe, filter holder, or cyclone (if applicable) and immediately turn off the vacuum pump. This prevents the water in the impingers from being forced backward into the filter holder and the silica gel from being entrained backward into the third impinger.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Leak checks during sample run. If, during the sampling run, a component (e.g., filter assembly or impinger) change becomes necessary, a leak check shall be conducted immediately before the change is made. The leak check shall be done according to the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method, except that it shall be done at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is

less), the results are acceptable, and no correction will need to be applied to the total volume of dry gas metered; if, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and plan to correct the sample volume as shown in section 12.3 of this method or void the sample run.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Immediately after component changes, leak checks are optional; if such leak checks are done, the procedure outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method should be used.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.4 Post-test leak check. A leak check is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling run. The leak check shall be performed in accordance with the procedures outlined in section 8.4.2 of this method, except that it shall be conducted at a vacuum equal to or greater than the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable, and no correction need be applied to the total volume of dry gas metered. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, either record the leakage rate and correct the sample volume, as shown in section 12.4 of this method, or void the sampling run.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Sampling train operation. During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate (within l0 percent of true isokinetic unless otherwise specified by the Administrator) and a temperature around the filter of 120 14 C (248 25 F), or such other temperature as specified by an applicable subpart of the standards or approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 For each run, record the data required on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Be sure to record the initial reading. Record the DGM readings at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings indicated by Figure 5-2 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A at least once at each sample point during each time increment and additional readings when significant changes (20 percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 Clean the portholes prior to the test run to minimize the chance of sampling deposited material. To begin sampling, remove the nozzle cap and verify that the filter and probe heating systems are up to temperature and that the pitot tube and probe are properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs are available, which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without excessive computations. These nomographs are designed for use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient (Cp) is 0.85  0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is 29 [4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the nomographs. If Cp and Md are outside the above-stated ranges, do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps (see Reference 7 in section 17.0 of this method) are taken to compensate for the deviations.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.3 When the stack is under significant negative pressure (height of impinger stem), close the coarse adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack to prevent water from backing into the filter holder. If necessary, the pump may be turned on with the coarse adjust valve closed.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.4 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around the probe and porthole to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas stream.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.5 Traverse the stack cross-section, as required by Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A or as specified by the Administrator, being careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the portholes; this minimizes the chance of extracting deposited material.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.6 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the temperature around the filter holder at the proper level; add more ice and, if necessary, salt to maintain a temperature of less than 20 C (68 F) at the condenser/silica gel outlet. Also, periodically check the level and zero of the manometer.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.7 If the pressure drop across the filter becomes too high, making isokinetic sampling difficult to maintain, the filter may be replaced in the midst of the sample run. It is recommended that another complete filter assembly be used rather than attempting to change the filter itself. Before a new filter assembly is installed, conduct a leak check (see section 8.4.3 of this method). The total PM weight shall include the summation of the filter assembly catches.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sample run, except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of trains. In all other situations, the use of two or more trains will be subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">Note: When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of the front-half and (if applicable) impinger catches from each train shall be performed, unless identical nozzle sizes were used in all trains, in which case the front-half catches from the individual

trains may be combined (as may the impinger catches) and one analysis of the front-half catch and one analysis of the impinger catch may be performed.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.9 At the end of the sample run, turn off the coarse adjust valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, record the final DGM reading, and then conduct a post-test leak check, as outlined in section 8.4.4 of this method. Also leak-check the pitot lines as described in section 8.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The lines must pass this leak check in order to validate the velocity head data.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 Calculation of percent isokinetic. Calculate percent isokinetic (see Calculations, section 12.12 of this method) to determine whether a run was valid or another test run should be made. If there was difficulty in maintaining isokinetic rates because of source conditions, consult the Administrator for possible variance on the isokinetic rates.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Sample recovery.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the probe to cool.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.2 When the probe can be safely handled, wipe off all external PM near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over it to prevent losing or gaining PM. Do not cap off the probe tip tightly while the sampling train is cooling down. This would create a vacuum in the filter holder, thus drawing water from the impingers into the filter holder.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.3 Before moving the sample train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sample train, wipe off the silicone grease, and cap the open outlet of the probe. Be careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Wipe off the silicone grease from the filter inlet where the probe was fastened and cap it. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used between the first impinger or condenser and the filter holder, disconnect the line at the filter holder and let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers or condenser. After wiping off the silicone grease, cap off the filter holder outlet and impinger inlet. Ground-glass stoppers, plastic caps, or serum caps may be used to close these openings.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.4 Transfer the probe and filter-impinger assembly to the cleanup area. This area should be clean and protected from the wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample will be minimized.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.5 Save a portion of the acetone and methylene chloride used for cleanup as blanks. Take 200 ml of each solvent directly from the wash bottle being used and place it in glass sample containers labeled ``acetone blank'' and ``methylene chloride blank,'' respectively.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6 Inspect the train prior to and during disassembly and note any abnormal conditions. Treat the samples as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.1 Container No. 1. Carefully remove the filter from the filter holder, and place it in its identified petri dish container. Use a pair of tweezers and/or clean disposable surgical gloves to handle the filter. If it is necessary to fold the filter, do so such that the PM cake is inside the fold. Using a dry nylon bristle brush and/or a sharp-edged blade, carefully transfer to the petri dish any PM and/or filter fibers that adhere to the filter holder gasket. Seal the container.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2 Container No. 2. Taking care to see that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, quantitatively recover PM or any condensate from the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, and front half of the filter holder by washing these components with acetone and placing the wash in a glass container. Perform the acetone rinse as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and clean the inside surface by rinsing with acetone from a wash bottle and brushing with a nylon bristle brush. Brush until the acetone rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface with acetone.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.2 Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok fitting with acetone in a similar way until no visible particles remain.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.3 Rinse the probe liner with acetone by tilting and rotating the probe while squirting acetone into its upper end so that all inside surfaces are wetted with acetone. Let the acetone drain from the lower end into the sample container. A funnel (glass or polyethylene) may be used to aid in transferring liquid washes to the container. Follow the acetone rinse with a probe brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, squirt acetone into the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe, hold a sample container under the lower end of the probe, and catch any acetone and PM that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more until no visible PM is carried out with the acetone or until none remains in the probe liner on visual inspection. With stainless steel or other metal probes, run the brush through in the above-described manner at least six times, since metal probes have small crevices in which PM can be entrapped. Rinse the brush with acetone and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final acetone rinse of the probe as described above.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.4 It is recommended that two people clean the probe to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, keep brushes clean and protected from contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.5 After ensuring that all joints have been wiped clean of silicone grease, clean the

inside of the front half of the filter holder by rubbing the surfaces with a nylon bristle brush and rinsing with acetone. Rinse each surface three times or more if needed to remove visible particulate. Make a final rinse of the brush and filter holder. Carefully rinse out the glass cyclone also (if applicable).</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.6 After rinsing the nozzle, probe, and front half of the filter holder with acetone, repeat the entire procedure with methylene chloride and save in a separate No. 2M container.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.2.7 After acetone and methylene chloride washings and PM have been collected in the proper sample containers, tighten the lid on the sample containers so that acetone and methylene chloride will not leak out when it is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label each container to identify clearly its contents.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.3 Container No. 3. Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent, and make a notation of its condition. Transfer the silica gel from the fourth impinger to its original container and seal the container. A funnel may make it easier to pour the silica gel without spilling. A rubber policeman may be used as an aid in removing the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use any water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, follow the procedure for Container No. 3 in section 11.2.3 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.4 Impinger water. Treat the impingers as follows:</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.4.1 Make a notation of any color or film in the liquid catch. Measure the liquid that is in the first three impingers to within 1 ml by using a graduated cylinder or by weighing it to within 0.5 g by using a balance (if one is available). Record the volume or weight of liquid present. This information is required to calculate the moisture content of the effluent gas.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.4.2 Following the determination of the volume of liquid present, rinse the back half of the train with water, add it to the impinger catch, and store it in a container labeled 3W (water).</p><p class="depth0">8.7.6.4.3 Following the water rinse, rinse the back half of the train with acetone to remove the excess water to enhance subsequent organic recovery with methylene chloride and quantitatively recover to a container labeled 3S (solvent) followed by at least three sequential rinsings with aliquots of methylene chloride. Quantitatively recover to the same container labeled 3S. Record separately the amount of both acetone and methylene chloride used to the nearest 1 ml or 0.5g.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Because the subsequent analytical finish is gravimetric, it is okay to recover both solvents to the same container. This would not be recommended if other analytical finishes were required.</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Sample transport. Whenever possible, containers should be shipped in such a way that they remain upright at all times.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Miscellaneous quality control measures.

The [Delta]Ha is calculated as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.008

Record the volume collected, the DGM temperature, and the barometric pressure. Calculate a DGM calibration check value, Yc, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR07OC97.009
Where
Yc = DGM calibration check value, dimensionless;10 = Run time, min.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1.2 Compare the Yc value with the dry gas meter calibration factor Y to determine that: 0.97 Y c <1.03Y. If the Yc value is not within this range, the volume metering system should be investigated before beginning the test.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Calibrated critical orifice. A calibrated critical orifice, calibrated against a wet test meter or spirometer and designed to be inserted at the inlet of the sampling meter box, may be used as a quality control check by following the procedure of section 16.2 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">10.0 Calibration and Standardization</p><p class="depth0">Note: Maintain a laboratory log of all calibrations.</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Probe nozzle. Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the ID of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in.). Make three separate measurements using different diameters each time, and obtain the average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in.). When nozzles become nicked, dented, or corroded, they shall be reshaped, sharpened, and recalibrated before use. Each nozzle shall be permanently and uniquely identified.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Pitot tube assembly. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in section 10.1 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Metering system.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 Calibration prior to use. Before its initial use in the field, the metering system shall be calibrated as follows: Connect the metering system inlet to the outlet of a wet test meter that is accurate to within 1 percent. Refer to Figure 5-5 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/revolution (1 ft\3\/rev). A spirometer of 400 liters (14 ft\3\) or more capacity, or equivalent, may be used for this calibration, although a wet test meter is usually more practical. The wet test meter should be periodically calibrated with a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained. Run the metering system pump for about 15 minutes with the orifice manometer indicating a median reading, as expected in field use, to allow the pump to warm up and to permit the interior surface of the wet test meter to be thoroughly wetted. Then, at each of a minimum of three orifice manometer settings, pass an exact quantity of gas through the wet test meter and note the gas volume indicated by the DGM. Also note the barometric pressure and the temperatures of the wet test meter, the inlet of the DGM, and the outlet of the DGM. Select the highest and lowest orifice settings to bracket the expected field operating range of the orifice. Use a minimum volume of 0.15 m\3\ (5 cf) at all orifice settings. Record all the data on a form similar to Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, and calculate Y (the DGM calibration factor) and [Delta]Ha (the orifice calibration factor) at each orifice setting, as shown on Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Allowable tolerances for individual Y and [Delta]Ha values are given in Figure 5-6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Use the average of the Y values in the calculations in section 12 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1.1 Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a leak check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, the normal leak check procedure will not detect leakages within the pump. For these cases the following leak check procedure is suggested: make a 10-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm); at the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet test meter and DGM volumes; divide the difference by 10 to get the leak rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).</p><p class="depth0">10.3.2 Calibration after use. After each field use, the calibration of the metering system shall be checked by performing three calibration runs at a single, intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous field test) with the vacuum set at the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet test meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value of the DGM calibration factor. If the value has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, as previously detailed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Alternative procedures, e.g., rechecking the orifice meter coefficient, may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.3 Acceptable variation in calibration. If the DGM coefficient values obtained before and after a test series differ by more than 5 percent, either the test series shall be voided or calculations for the test series shall be performed using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Probe heater calibration. Use a heat source to generate air heated to selected temperatures that approximate those expected to occur in the sources to be sampled. Pass this air through the probe at a typical sample flow rate while measuring the probe inlet and outlet temperatures at various probe heater settings. For each air temperature generated, construct a graph of probe heating system setting versus probe outlet temperature. The procedure outlined in APTD-0576 can also be used. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used. Also, probes with outlet temperature monitoring capabilities do not require calibration.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The probe heating system shall be calibrated before its initial use in the field.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Temperature sensors. Use the procedure in Section 10.3 of Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1 to calibrate in-stack temperature sensors. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the DGM and condenser outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Barometer.

Leave the contents in the shipping container or transfer the filter and any loose PM from the sample container to a tared glass weighing dish. Desiccate for 24 hours in a desiccator containing anhydrous calcium sulfate. Weigh to a constant weight and report the results to the nearest 0.1 mg. For purposes of this section, the term ``constant weight'' means a difference of no more than 0.5 mg or 1 percent of total weight less tare weight, whichever is greater, between two consecutive weighings, with no less than 6 hours of desiccation time between weighings (overnight desiccation is a common practice). If a third weighing is required and it agrees within [0.5 mg, then the results of the second weighing should be used. For quality assurance purposes, record and report each individual weighing; if more than three weighings are required, note this in the results for the subsequent MCEM results.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1.2 MCEM analysis. Transfer the filter and contents quantitatively into a beaker. Add 100 ml of methylene chloride and cover with aluminum foil. Sonicate for 3 minutes then allow to stand for 20 minutes. Set up the filtration apparatus. Decant the solution into a clean Buchner fritted funnel. Immediately pressure filter the solution through the tube into another clean, dry beaker. Continue decanting and pressure filtration until all the solvent is transferred. Rinse the beaker and filter with 10 to 20 ml methylene chloride, decant into the Buchner fritted funnel and pressure filter. Place the beaker on a low-temperature hot plate (maximum 40 C) and slowly evaporate almost to dryness. Transfer the remaining last few milliliters of solution quantitatively from the beaker (using at least three aliquots of methylene chloride rinse) to a tared clean dry aluminum dish and evaporate to complete dryness. Remove from heat once solvent is evaporated. Reweigh the dish after a 30-minute equilibrium in the balance room and determine the weight to the nearest 0.1 mg. Conduct a methylene chloride blank run in an identical fashion.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2 Container No. 2.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.2.1 PM analysis. Note the level of liquid in the container, and confirm on the analysis sheet whether leakage occurred during transport. If a noticeable amount of leakage has occurred, either void the sample or use methods, subject to the approval of the Administrator, to correct the final results. Measure the liquid in this container either volumetrically to [1 ml or gravimetrically to 1 [0.5 g. Transfer the contents to a tared 250 ml beaker and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight.

Transfer the solution into a 1,000 ml separatory funnel quantitatively with methylene chloride washes. Add enough solvent to total approximately 50 ml, if necessary. Shake the funnel for 1 minute, allow the phases to separate, and drain the solvent layer into a 250 ml beaker. Repeat the extraction twice. Evaporate with low heat (less than 40 C) until near dryness. Transfer the remaining few milliliters of solvent quantitatively with small solvent washes into a clean, dry, tared aluminum dish and evaporate to dryness. Remove from heat once solvent is evaporated.

Transfer the mixed solvent to 250 ml beaker(s). Evaporate and weigh following the procedures detailed for container 3W in section 11.2.4 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">11.2.6 Blank containers. Measure the distilled water, acetone, or methylene chloride in each container either volumetrically or gravimetrically. Transfer the ``solvent'' to a tared 250 ml beaker, and evaporate to dryness at ambient temperature and pressure. (Conduct a solvent blank on the distilled deionized water blank in an identical fashion to that described in section 11.2.4.1 of this method.) Desiccate for 24 hours, and weigh to a constant weight. Report the results to the nearest 0.l mg.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The contents of Containers No. 2, 3W, and 3M as well as the blank containers may be evaporated at temperatures higher than ambient. If evaporation is done at an elevated temperature, the temperature must be below the boiling point of the solvent; also, to prevent ``bumping,'' the evaporation process must be closely supervised, and the contents of the beaker must be swirled occasionally to maintain an even temperature. Use extreme care, as acetone and methylene chloride are highly flammable and have a low flash point.</p><p class="depth0">12.0 Data Analysis and Calculations</p><p class="depth0">12.1 Carry out calculations, retaining at least one extra decimal figure beyond that of the acquired data.

The wet test meter should have a capacity of 30 liters/rev (1 ft \3\/rev) and be capable of measuring volume to within 1.0 percent; wet test meters should be checked against a spirometer or a liquid displacement meter to ensure the accuracy of the wet test meter. Spirometers or wet test meters of other sizes may be used, provided that the specified accuracies of the procedure are maintained.</p><p class="depth0">16.1.1.2 Set up the components as shown in Figure 5-7 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.

Run the pump for at least 5 minutes at a flow rate of about 10 liters/min (0.35 cfm) to condition the interior surface of the wet test meter. The pressure drop indicated by the manometer at the inlet side of the DGM should be minimized (no greater than 100 mm H2O [4 in. H2O] at a flow rate of 30 liters/min [1 cfm]).

Select five critical orifices that are appropriately sized to cover the range of flow rates between 10 and 34 liters/min or the expected operating range. Two of the critical orifices should bracket the expected operating range. A minimum of three critical orifices will be needed to calibrate a Method 5 DGM; the other two critical orifices can serve as spares and provide better selection for bracketing the range of operating flow rates. The needle sizes and tubing lengths shown in Table 315-1 give the approximate flow rates indicated in the table.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.1.2 These needles can be adapted to a Method 5 type sampling train as follows: Insert a serum bottle stopper, 13x20 mm sleeve type, into a 0.5 in Swagelok quick connect. Insert the needle into the stopper as shown in Figure 5-9 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2 Critical orifice calibration. The procedure described in this section uses the Method 5 meter box configuration with a DGM as described in section 6.1.1.9 of this method to calibrate the critical orifices. Other schemes may be used, subject to the approval of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.1 Calibration of meter box. The critical orifices must be calibrated in the same configuration as they will be used; i.e., there should be no connections to the inlet of the orifice.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.1.1 Before calibrating the meter box, leak-check the system as follows: Fully open the coarse adjust valve and completely close the bypass valve. Plug the inlet. Then turn on the pump and determine whether there is any leakage. The leakage rate shall be zero; i.e., no detectable movement of the DGM dial shall be seen for 1 minute.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.1.2 Check also for leakages in that portion of the sampling train between the pump and the orifice meter. See section 5.6 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A for the procedure; make any corrections, if necessary. If leakage is detected, check for cracked gaskets, loose fittings, worn 0-rings, etc. and make the necessary repairs.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.1.3 After determining that the meter box is leakless, calibrate the meter box according to the procedure given in section 5.3 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Make sure that the wet test meter meets the requirements stated in section 7.1.1.1 of Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. Check the water level in the wet test meter. Record the DGM calibration factor, Y.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.2 Calibration of critical orifices.

Observe the meter box orifice manometer reading, DH. Slowly increase the vacuum reading until a stable reading is obtained on the meter box orifice manometer. Record the critical vacuum for each orifice. Orifices that do not reach a critical value shall not be used.</p><p class="depth0">16.2.2.2.4 Obtain the barometric pressure using a barometer as described in section 6.1.2 of this method.

The runs shall be at least 5 minutes each. The DGM volume readings shall be in increments of complete revolutions of the DGM. As a guideline, the times should not differ by more than 3.0 seconds (this includes allowance for changes in the DGM temperatures) to achieve [0.5 percent in K'.

High purity water is used to collect the formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentrations in the stack samples are determined using the modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde can be detected as low as 8.8 x 10\10\ lbs/cu ft (11.3 ppbv) or as high as 1.8 x 10\3\ lbs/cu ft (23,000,000 ppbv), at standard conditions over a 1 hour sampling period, sampling approximately 30 cu ft.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">Gaseous and particulate pollutants are withdrawn isokinetically from an emission source and are collected in high purity water. Formaldehyde present in the emissions is highly soluble in high purity water. The high purity water containing formaldehyde is then analyzed using the modified pararosaniline method. Formaldehyde in the sample reacts with acidic pararosaniline, and the sodium sulfite, forming a purple chromophore. The intensity of the purple color, measured spectrophotometrically, provides an accurate and precise measure of the formaldehyde concentration in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">See the definitions in the General Provisions of this Subpart.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">Sulfite and cyanide in solution interfere with the pararosaniline method.

This sampling train configuration is adapted from EPA Method 5, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, procedures.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.050</p><p class="depth0">The sampling train consists of the following components: probe nozzle, probe liner, pitot tube, differential pressure gauge, impingers, metering system, barometer, and gas density determination equipment.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 Probe Nozzle: Quartz, glass, or stainless steel with sharp, tapered (30  angle) leading edge. The taper shall be on the outside to preserve a constant inner diameter. The nozzle shall be buttonhook or elbow design. A range of nozzle sizes suitable for isokinetic sampling should be available in increments of 0.15 cm (\1/16\ in), e.g., 0.32 to 1.27 cm (\1/8\ to \1/2\ in), or larger if higher volume sampling trains are used. Each nozzle shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in Section 10.1.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 Probe Liner: Borosilicate glass or quartz shall be used for the probe liner. The probe shall be maintained at a temperature of 120 C [14 C (248 F [25 F).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.3 Pitot Tube: The pitot tube shall be Type S, as described in Section 2.1 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or any other appropriate device. The pitot tube shall be attached to the probe to allow constant monitoring of the stack gas velocity. The impact (high pressure) opening plane of the pitot tube shall be even with or above the nozzle entry plane (see Figure 2-6b, EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A) during sampling. The Type S pitot tube assembly shall have a known coefficient, determined as outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.4 Differential Pressure Gauge: The differential pressure gauge shall be an inclined manometer or equivalent device as described in Section 2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. One manometer shall be used for velocity-head reading and the other for orifice differential pressure readings.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.5 Impingers: The sampling train requires a minimum of four impingers, connected as shown in Figure 1, with ground glass (or equivalent) vacuum-tight fittings. For the first, third, and fourth impingers, use the Greenburg-Smith design, modified by replacing the tip with a 1.3 cm inside diameters (\1/2\ in) glass tube extending to 1.3 cm (\1/2\ in) from the bottom of the flask. For the second impinger, use a Greenburg-Smith impinger with the standard tip. Place a thermometer capable of measuring temperature

to within 1 C (2 F) at the outlet of the fourth impinger for monitoring purposes.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.6 Metering System: The necessary components are a vacuum gauge, leak-free pump, thermometers capable of measuring temperatures within 3 C (5.4 F), dry-gas meter capable of measuring volume to within 1 percent, and related equipment as shown in Figure 1. At a minimum, the pump should be capable of 4 cfm free flow, and the dry gas meter should have a recording capacity of 0-999.9 cu ft with a resolution of 0.005 cu ft. Other metering systems may be used which are capable of maintaining sample volumes to within 2 percent. The metering system may be used in conjunction with a pitot tube to enable checks of isokinetic sampling rates.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.7 Barometer: The barometer may be mercury, aneroid, or other barometer capable of measuring atmospheric pressure to within 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg). In many cases, the barometric reading may be obtained from a nearby National Weather Service Station, in which case the station value (which is the absolute barometric pressure) is requested and an adjustment for elevation differences between the weather station and sampling point is applied at a rate of minus 2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) per 30 m (100 ft) elevation increase (rate is plus 2.5 mm Hg per 30 m (100 ft) of elevation decrease).</p><p class="depth0">6.1.8 Gas Density Determination Equipment: Temperature sensor and pressure gauge (as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.3 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A), and gas analyzer, if necessary (as described in EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). The temperature sensor ideally should be permanently attached to the pitot tube or sampling probe in a fixed configuration such that the top of the sensor extends beyond the leading edge of the probe sheath and does not touch any metal. Alternatively, the sensor may be attached just prior to use in the field. Note, however, that if the temperature sensor is attached in the field, the sensor must be placed in an interference-free arrangement with respect to the Type S pitot openings (see Figure 2-7, EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A). As a second alternative, if a difference of no more than 1 percent in the average velocity measurement is to be introduced, the temperature gauge need not be attached to the probe or pitot tube.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Sample Recovery</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 Probe Liner: Probe nozzle and brushes; bristle brushes with stainless steel wire handles are required. The probe brush shall have extensions of stainless steel, Teflon \TM\, or inert material at least as long as the probe. The brushes shall be properly sized and shaped to brush out the probe liner, the probe nozzle, and the impingers.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 Wash Bottles: One wash bottle is required. Polyethylene, Teflon \TM\, or glass wash bottles may be used for sample recovery.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.3 Graduated Cylinder and/or Balance: A graduated cylinder or balance is required to measure condensed water to the nearest 1 ml or 1 g. Graduated cylinders shall have division not >2 ml. Laboratory balances capable of weighing to [0.5 g are required.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.4 Polyethylene Storage Containers: 500 ml wide-mouth polyethylene bottles are required to store impinger water samples.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.5 Rubber Policeman and Funnel: A rubber policeman and funnel are required to aid the transfer of material into and out of containers in the field.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Sample Analysis</p><p class="depth0">6.3.1 Spectrophotometer--B&L; 70, 710, 2000, etc., or equivalent; 1 cm pathlength cuvette holder.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.2 Disposable polystyrene cuvettes, pathlengh 1 cm, volume of about 4.5 ml.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.3 Pipettors--Fixed-volume Oxford pipet (250 l; 500 l; 1000 l); adjustable volume Oxford or equivalent pipettor 1-5 ml model, set to 2.50 ml.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.4 Pipet tips for pipettors above.</p><p class="depth0">6.3.5 Parafilm, 2  wide; cut into about 1'' squares.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reagents</p><p class="depth0">7.1 High purity water: All references to water in this method refer to high purity water (ASTM Type I water or equivalent). The water purity will dictate the lower limits of formaldehyde quantification.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Silica Gel: Silica gel shall be indicting type, 6-16 mesh. If the silica gel has been used previously, dry at 175 C (350 F) for 2 hours before using. New silica gel may be used as received. Alternatively, other types of desiccants (equivalent or better) may be used.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Crushed Ice: Quantities ranging from 10-50 lbs may be necessary during a sampling run, depending upon ambient temperature. Samples which have been taken must be stored and shipped cold; sufficient ice for this purpose must be allowed.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Quaternary ammonium compound stock solution: Prepare a stock solution of dodecyltrimethylammonium chloride (98 percent minimum assay, reagent grade) by dissolving 1.0 gram in 1000 ml water. This solution contains nominally 1000 g/ml quaternary ammonium compound, and is used as a biocide for some sources which are prone to microbial contamination.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Pararosaniline: Weigh 0.16 grams pararosaniline (free base; assay of 95 percent or greater, C.I. 42500; Sigma P7632 has been found to be acceptable) into a 100 ml flask. Exercise care, since pararosaniline is a dye and will stain. Using a wash bottle with high-purity water, rinse the walls of the flask. Add no more than 25 ml water. Then,

carefully add 20 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the flask. The flask will become warm after the addition of acid. Add a magnetic stir bar to the flask, cap, and place on a magnetic stirrer for approximately 4 hours. Then, add additional water so the total volume is 100 ml. This solution is stable for several months when stored tightly capped at room temperature.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Sodium sulfite: Weigh 0.10 grams anhydrous sodium sulfite into a 100 ml flask. Dilute to the mark with high purity water. Invert 15-20 times to mix and dissolve the sodium sulfite. This solution must be prepared fresh every day.</p><p class="depth0">7.7 Formaldehyde standard solution: Pipet exactly 2.70 ml of 37 percent formaldehyde solution into a 1000 ml volumetric flask which contains about 500 ml of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark with high-purity water. This solution contains nominally 1000 g/ml of formaldehyde, and is used to prepare the working formaldehyde standards. The exact formaldehyde concentration may be determined if needed by suitable modification of the sodium sulfite method (Reference: J.F. Walker, Formaldehyde (Third Edition), 1964.). The 1000 g/ml formaldehyde stock solution is stable for at least a year if kept tightly closed, with the neck of the flask sealed with Parafilm. Store at room temperature.</p><p class="depth0">7.8 Working formaldehyde standards: Pipet exactly 10.0 ml of the 1000 g/ml formaldehyde stock solution into a 100 ml volumetric flask which is about half full of high-purity water. Dilute to the mark with high-purity water, and invert 15-20 times to mix thoroughly. This solution contains nominally 100 g/ml formaldehyde. Prepare the working standards from this 100 g/ml standard solution and using the Oxford pipets:

The 100 g/ml stock solution is stable for 4 weeks if kept refrigerated between analyses. The working standards (0.25-3.00 g/ml) should be prepared fresh every day, consistent with good laboratory practice for trace analysis. If the laboratory water is not of sufficient purity, it may be necessary to prepare the working standards every day. The laboratory must establish that the working standards are stable--DO NOT assume that your working standards are stable for more than a day unless you have verified this by actual testing for several series of working standards.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sample Collection</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Because of the complexity of this method, field personnel should be trained in and experienced with the test procedures in order to obtain reliable results.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Laboratory Preparation</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 All the components shall be maintained and calibrated according to the procedure described in APTD-0576, unless otherwise specified.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Weigh several 200 to 300 g portions of silica gel in airtight containers to the nearest 0.5 g.

As an alternative to preweighing the silica gel, it may instead be weighed directly in the impinger or sampling holder just prior to train assembly.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Preliminary Field Determinations</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 Select the sampling site and the minimum number of sampling points according to EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or other relevant criteria. Determine the stack pressure, temperature, and range of velocity heads using EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. A leak-check of the pitot lines according to Section 3.1 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, must be performed. Determine the stack gas moisture content using EPA Approximation Method 4,40 CFR part 60, appendix A, or its alternatives to establish estimates of isokinetic sampling rate settings. Determine the stack gas dry molecular weight, as described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, Section 3.6. If integrated EPA Method 3, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, sampling is used for molecular weight determination, the integrated bag sample shall be taken simultaneously with, and for the same total length of time as, the sample run.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Select a nozzle size based on the range of velocity heads so that it is not necessary to change the nozzle size in order to maintain isokinetic sampling rates below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). During the run do not change the nozzle. Ensure that the proper differential pressure gauge is chosen for the range of velocity heads encountered (see Section 2.2 of EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A).</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Select a suitable probe liner and probe length so that all traverse points can be sampled. For large stacks, to reduce the length of the probe, consider sampling from opposite sides of the stack.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.4 A minimum of 30 cu ft of sample volume is suggested for emission sources with stack concentrations not greater than 23,000,000 ppbv. Additional sample volume shall be collected as necessitated by the capacity of the water reagent and analytical detection limit constraint. Reduced sample volume may be collected as long as the final concentration of formaldehyde in the stack

sample is greater than 10 (ten) times the detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.5 Determine the total length of sampling time needed to obtain the identified minimum volume by comparing the anticipated average sampling rate with the volume requirement. Allocate the same time to all traverse points defined by EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. To avoid timekeeping errors, the length of time sampled at each traverse point should be an integer or an integer plus 0.5 min.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.6 In some circumstances (e.g., batch cycles) it may be necessary to sample for shorter times at the traverse points and to obtain smaller gas-volume samples. In these cases, careful documentation must be maintained in order to allow accurate calculations of concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Preparation of Collection Train</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 During preparation and assembly of the sampling train, keep all openings where contamination can occur covered with Teflon\TM\ film or aluminum foil until just prior to assembly or until sampling is about to begin.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Place 100 ml of water in each of the first two impingers, and leave the third impinger empty. If additional capacity is required for high expected concentrations of formaldehyde in the stack gas, 200 ml of water per impinger may be used or additional impingers may be used for sampling. Transfer approximately 200 to 300 g of pre-weighed silica gel from its container to the fourth impinger. Care should be taken to ensure that the silica gel is not entrained and carried out from the impinger during sampling. Place the silica gel container in a clean place for later use in the sample recovery. Alternatively, the weight of the silica gel plus impinger may be determined to the nearest 0.5 g and recorded.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 With a glass or quartz liner, install the selected nozzle using a Viton-A O-ring when stack temperatures are <260 C (500 F) and a woven glass-fiber gasket when temperatures are higher. See APTD-0576 for details. Other connection systems utilizing either 316 stainless steel or Teflon\TM\ ferrules may be used. Mark the probe with heat-resistant tape or by some other method to denote the proper distance into the stack or duct for each sampling point.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.4 Assemble the train as shown in Figure 1. During assembly, a very light coating of silicone grease may be used on ground-glass joints of the impingers, but the silicone grease should be limited to the outer portion (see APTD-0576) of the ground-glass joints to minimize silicone grease contamination. If necessary, Teflon\TM\ tape may be used to seal leaks. Connect all temperature sensors to an appropriate potentiometer/display unit. Check all temperature sensors at ambient temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.5 Place crushed ice all around the impingers.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.6 Turn on and set the probe heating system at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperature to stabilize.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Leak-Check Procedures</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 Pre-test Leak-check: Recommended, but not required. If the tester elects to conduct the pre-test leak-check, the following procedure shall be used.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1.1 After the sampling train has been assembled, turn on and set probe heating system at the desired operating temperature. Allow time for the temperature to stabilize. If a Viton-a O-ring or other leak-free connection is used in assembling the probe nozzle to the probe liner, leak-check the train at the sampling site by plugging the nozzle and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum.</p><p class="depth0">Note: A lower vacuum may be used, provided that the lower vacuum is not exceeded during the test.</p><p class="depth0">If a woven glass fiber gasket is used, do not connect the probe to the train during the leak-check. Instead, leak-check the train by first attaching a carbon-filled leak-check impinger to the inlet and then plugging the inlet and pulling a 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. (A lower vacuum may be used if this lower vacuum is not exceeded during the test.) Next connect the probe to the train and leak-check at about 25 mm Hg (1 in Hg) vacuum. Alternatively, leak-check the probe with the rest of the sampling train in one step at 381 mm Hg (15 in Hg) vacuum. Leakage rates in excess of (a) 4 percent of the average sampling rate or (b) 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm), whichever is less, are unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1.2 The following leak-check instructions for the sampling train described in APTD-0576 and APTD-0581 may be helpful. Start the pump with the fine-adjust valve fully open and coarse-valve completely closed. Partially open the coarse-adjust valve and slowly close the fine-adjust valve until the desired vacuum is reached. Do not reverse direction of the fine-adjust valve, as liquid will back up into the train. If the desired vacuum is exceeded, either perform the leak-check at this higher vacuum or end the leak-check, as described below, and start over.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1.3 When the leak-check is completed, first slowly remove the plug from the inlet to the probe. When the vacuum drops to 127 mm (5 in) Hg or less, immediately close the coarse-adjust valve. Switch off the pumping system and reopen the fine-adjust valve. Do not reopen the fine-adjust valve until the coarse-adjust valve has been closed to prevent the liquid in the impingers from being forced backward in the sampling line and silica gel from being entrained backward into the third impinger.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 Leak-checks During Sampling Run:</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2.1 If, during the sampling run, a component change (e.g., impinger) becomes necessary, a leak-check shall be conducted immediately after the interruption of sampling and before the change is made. The leak-check shall be done according to the procedure described in Section 10.3.3, except that it shall be done at a vacuum greater than or equal to the maximum value recorded up to that point in the test. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.0057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable. If a higher leakage rate is obtained, the tester must void the sampling run.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Any correction of the sample volume by calculation reduces the integrity of the pollutant concentration data generated and must be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2.2 Immediately after component changes, leak-checks are optional. If performed, the procedure described in section 8.5.1.1 shall be used.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.3 Post-test Leak-check:</p><p class="depth0">8.5.3.1 A leak-check is mandatory at the conclusion of each sampling run. The leak-check shall be done with the same procedures as the pre-test leak-check, except that the post-test leak-check shall be conducted at a vacuum greater than or equal to the maximum value reached during the sampling run. If the leakage rate is found to be no greater than 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm) or 4 percent of the average sampling rate (whichever is less), the results are acceptable. If, however, a higher leakage rate is obtained, the tester shall record the leakage rate and void the sampling run.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 Sampling Train Operation</p><p class="depth0">8.6.1 During the sampling run, maintain an isokinetic sampling rate to within 10 percent of true isokinetic, below 28 l/min (1.0 cfm). Maintain a temperature around the probe of 120 C [14 C (248  [25 F).</p><p class="depth0">8.6.2 For each run, record the data on a data sheet such as the one shown in Figure 2. Be sure to record the initial dry-gas meter reading. Record the dry-gas meter readings at the beginning and end of each sampling time increment, when changes in flow rates are made, before and after each leak-check, and when sampling is halted. Take other readings required by Figure 2 at least once at each sample point during each time increment and additional readings when significant adjustments (20 percent variation in velocity head readings) necessitate additional adjustments in flow rate. Level and zero the manometer. Because the manometer level and zero may drift due to vibrations and temperature changes, make periodic checks during the traverse.

To begin sampling, remove the nozzle cap, verify that the probe heating system are at the specified temperature, and verify that the pitot tube and probe are properly positioned. Position the nozzle at the first traverse point, with the tip pointing directly into the gas stream. Immediately start the pump and adjust the flow to isokinetic conditions. Nomographs, which aid in the rapid adjustment of the isokinetic sampling rate without excessive computations, are available. These nomographs are designed for use when the Type S pitot tube coefficient is 0.84 [0.02 and the stack gas equivalent density (dry molecular weight) is equal to 29 [4. APTD-0576 details the procedure for using the nomographs. If the stack gas molecular weight and the pitot tube coefficient are outside the above ranges, do not use the nomographs unless appropriate steps are taken to compensate for the deviations.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.4 When the stack is under significant negative pressure (equivalent to the height of the impinger stem), take care to close the coarse-adjust valve before inserting the probe into the stack in order to prevent liquid from backing up through the train. If necessary, a low vacuum on the train may have to be started prior to entering the stack.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.5 When the probe is in position, block off the openings around the probe and stack access port to prevent unrepresentative dilution of the gas stream.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.6 Traverse the stack cross section, as required by EPA Method 1, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A, being careful not to bump the probe nozzle into the stack walls when sampling near the walls or when removing or inserting the probe through the access port, in order to minimize the chance of extracting deposited material.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.7 During the test run, make periodic adjustments to keep the temperature around the probe at the proper levels. Add more ice and, if necessary, salt, to maintain a temperature of <20 C (68 F) at the silica gel outlet.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.8 A single train shall be used for the entire sampling run, except in cases where simultaneous sampling is required in two or more separate ducts or at two or more different locations within the same duct, or in cases where equipment failure necessitates a change of trains. An additional train or trains may also be used for sampling when the capacity of a single train is exceeded.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.9 When two or more trains are used, separate analyses of components from each train shall be performed. If multiple trains have been used because the capacity of a single train would be exceeded, first impingers from each train may be combined, and second impingers from each train may be combined.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.10 At the end of the sampling run, turn off the coarse-adjust valve, remove the probe and nozzle from the stack, turn off the pump, record the final dry gas meter reading, and conduct a post-test leak-check. Also, check the pitot lines as described in EPA Method 2, 40 CFR part 60, appendix A. The lines must pass this leak-check in order to validate the velocity-head data.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.11 Calculate percent isokineticity (see Method 2) to determine whether the run was valid or another test should be made.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Sample Preservation and Handling</p><p class="depth0">8.7.1 Samples from most sources applicable to this method have acceptable holding times using normal handling practices (shipping samples iced, storing in refrigerator at 2 C until analysis). However, forming section stacks and other sources using waste water sprays may be subject to microbial contamination. For these sources, a biocide (quaternary ammonium compound solution) may be added to collected samples to improve sample stability and method ruggedness.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.2 Sample holding time: Samples should be analyzed within 14 days of collection. Samples must be refrigerated/kept cold for the entire period preceding analysis. After

the samples have been brought to room temperature for analysis, any analyses needed should be performed on the same day. Repeated cycles of warming the samples to room temperature/refrigerating/rewarming, then analyzing again, etc., have not been investigated in depth to evaluate if analyte levels remain stable for all sources.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.3 Additional studies will be performed to evaluate whether longer sample holding times are feasible for this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Sample Recovery</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1 Preparation:</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1.1 Proper cleanup procedure begins as soon as the probe is removed from the stack at the end of the sampling period. Allow the probe to cool. When the probe can be handled safely, wipe off all external particulate matter near the tip of the probe nozzle and place a cap over the tip to prevent losing or gaining particulate matter. Do not cap the probe tightly while the sampling train is cooling because a vacuum will be created, drawing liquid from the impingers back through the sampling train.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1.2 Before moving the sampling train to the cleanup site, remove the probe from the sampling train and cap the open outlet, being careful not to lose any condensate that might be present. Remove the umbilical cord from the last impinger and cap the impinger. If a flexible line is used, let any condensed water or liquid drain into the impingers. Cap off any open impinger inlets and outlets. Ground glass stoppers, Teflon \TM\ caps, or caps of other inert materials may be used to seal all openings.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1.3 Transfer the probe and impinger assembly to an area that is clean and protected from wind so that the chances of contaminating or losing the sample are minimized.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1.4 Inspect the train before and during disassembly, and note any abnormal conditions.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1.5 Save a portion of the washing solution (high purity water) used for cleanup as a blank.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2 Sample Containers:</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1 Container 1: Probe and Impinger Catches. Using a graduated cylinder, measure to the nearest ml, and record the volume of the solution in the first three impingers. Alternatively, the solution may be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g. Include any condensate in the probe in this determination. Transfer the combined impinger solution from the graduated cylinder into the polyethylene bottle. Taking care that dust on the outside of the probe or other exterior surfaces does not get into the sample, clean all surfaces to which the sample is exposed (including the probe nozzle, probe fitting, probe liner, first three impingers, and impinger connectors) with water. Use less than 400 ml for the entire waste (250 ml would be better, if possible). Add the rinse water to the sample container.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1.1 Carefully remove the probe nozzle and rinse the inside surface with water from a wash bottle. Brush with a bristle brush and rinse until the rinse shows no visible particles, after which make a final rinse of the inside surface. Brush and rinse the inside parts of the Swagelok (or equivalent) fitting with water in a similar way.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1.2 Rinse the probe liner with water. While squirting the water into the upper end of the probe, tilt and rotate the probe so that all inside surfaces will be wetted with water. Let the water drain from the lower end into the sample container. The tester may use a funnel (glass or polyethylene) to aid in transferring the liquid washes to the container. Follow the rinse with a bristle brush. Hold the probe in an inclined position, and squirt water into the upper end as the probe brush is being pushed with a twisting action through the probe. Hold the sample container underneath the lower end of the probe, and catch any water and particulate matter that is brushed from the probe. Run the brush through the probe three times or more. Rinse the brush with water and quantitatively collect these washings in the sample container. After the brushing, make a final rinse of the probe as describe above.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Two people should clean the probe in order to minimize sample losses. Between sampling runs, brushes must be kept clean and free from contamination.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1.3 Rinse the inside surface of each of the first three impingers (and connecting tubing) three separate times. Use a small portion of water for each rinse, and brush each surface to which the sample is exposed with a bristle brush to ensure recovery of fine particulate matter. Make a final rinse of each surface and of the brush, using water.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1.4 After all water washing and particulate matter have been collected in the sample container, tighten the lid so the sample will not leak out when the container is shipped to the laboratory. Mark the height of the fluid level to determine whether leakage occurs during transport. Label the container clearly to identify its contents.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.1.5 If the first two impingers are to be analyzed separately to check for breakthrough, separate the contents and rinses of the two impingers into individual containers. Care must be taken to avoid physical carryover from the first impinger to the second. Any physical carryover of collected moisture into the second impinger will invalidate a breakthrough assessment.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.2 Container 2: Sample Blank. Prepare a blank by using a polyethylene container and adding a volume of water equal to the total volume in Container 1. Process the blank in the same manner as Container 1.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.3 Container 3: Silica Gel. Note the color of the indicating silica gel to determine whether it has been completely spent

and make a notation of its condition. The impinger containing the silica gel may be used as a sample transport container with both ends sealed with tightly fitting caps or plugs. Ground-glass stoppers or Teflon \TM\ caps maybe used. The silica gel impinger should then be labeled, covered with aluminum foil, and packaged on ice for transport to the laboratory. If the silica gel is removed from the impinger, the tester may use a funnel to pour the silica gel and a rubber policeman to remove the silica gel from the impinger. It is not necessary to remove the small amount of dust particles that may adhere to the impinger wall and are difficult to remove. Since the gain in weight is to be used for moisture calculations, do not use water or other liquids to transfer the silica gel. If a balance is available in the field, the spent silica gel (or silica gel plus impinger) may be weighed to the nearest 0.5 g.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.4 Sample containers should be placed in a cooler, cooled by (although not in contact with) ice. Putting sample bottles in Zip-Lock \TM\ bags can aid in maintaining the integrity of the sample labels. Sample containers should be placed vertically to avoid leakage during shipment. Samples should be cooled during shipment so they will be received cold at the laboratory. It is critical that samples be chilled immediately after recovery. If the source is susceptible to microbial contamination from wash water (e.g. forming section stack), add biocide as directed in section 8.2.5.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2.5 A quaternary ammonium compound can be used as a biocide to stabilize samples against microbial degradation following collection. Using the stock quaternary ammonium compound (QAC) solution; add 2.5 ml QAC solution for every 100 ml of recovered sample volume (estimate of volume is satisfactory) immediately after collection. The total volume of QAC solution must be accurately known and recorded, to correct for any dilution caused by the QAC solution addition.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.3 Sample Preparation for Analysis 8.8.3.1 The sample should be refrigerated if the analysis will not be performed on the day of sampling. Allow the sample to warm at room temperature for about two hours (if it has been refrigerated) prior to analyzing.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.3.2 Analyze the sample by the pararosaniline method, as described in Section 11. If the color-developed sample has an absorbance above the highest standard, a suitable dilution in high purity water should be prepared and analyzed.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Sampling: See EPA Manual 600/4-77-02b for Method 5 quality control.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Analysis: The quality assurance program required for this method includes the analysis of the field and method blanks, and procedure validations. The positive identification and quantitation of formaldehyde are dependent on the integrity of the samples received and the precision and accuracy of the analytical methodology. Quality assurance procedures for this method are designed to monitor the performance of the analytical methodology and to provide the required information to take corrective action if problems are observed in laboratory operations or in field sampling activities.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 Field Blanks: Field blanks must be submitted with the samples collected at each sampling site. The field blanks include the sample bottles containing aliquots of sample recover water, and water reagent. At a minimum, one complete sampling train will be assembled in the field staging area, taken to the sampling area, and leak-checked at the beginning and end of the testing (or for the same total number of times as the actual sampling train). The probe of the blank train must be heated during the sample test. The train will be recovered as if it were an actual test sample. No gaseous sample will be passed through the blank sampling train.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Blank Correction: The field blank formaldehyde concentrations will be subtracted from the appropriate sample formaldehyde concentrations. Blank formaldehyde concentrations above 0.25 g/ml should be considered suspect, and subtraction from the sample formaldehyde concentrations should be performed in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3 Method Blanks: A method blank must be prepared for each set of analytical operations, to evaluate contamination and artifacts that can be derived from glassware, reagents, and sample handling in the laboratory.</p><p class="depth0">10 Calibration</p><p class="depth0">10.1 Probe Nozzle: Probe nozzles shall be calibrated before their initial use in the field. Using a micrometer, measure the inside diameter of the nozzle to the nearest 0.025 mm (0.001 in). Make measurements at three separate places across the diameter and obtain the average of the measurements. The difference between the high and low numbers shall not exceed 0.1 mm (0.004 in). When the nozzle becomes nicked or corroded, it shall be repaired and calibrated, or replaced with a calibrated nozzle before use. Each nozzle must be permanently and uniquely identified.</p><p class="depth0">10.2 Pitot Tube: The Type S pitot tube assembly shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in Section 4 of EPA Method 2, or assigned a nominal coefficient of 0.84 if it is not visibly nicked or corroded and if it meets design and intercomponent spacing specifications.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Metering System</p><p class="depth0">10.3.1 Before its initial use in the field, the metering system shall be calibrated according to the procedure outlined in APTD-0576.

Instead of physically adjusting the dry-gas meter dial readings to correspond to the wet-test meter readings, calibration factors may be used to correct the gas meter dial readings mathematically to the proper values. Before calibrating the metering system, it is suggested that a leak-check be conducted. For metering systems having diaphragm pumps, the normal leak-check procedure will not delete leakages with the pump. For these cases, the following leak-check procedure will apply: Make a ten-minute calibration run at 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm). At the end of the run, take the difference of the measured wet-test and dry-gas meter volumes and divide the difference by 10 to get the leak rate. The leak rate should not exceed 0.00057 m\3\/min (0.02 cfm).</p><p class="depth0">10.3.2 After each field use, check the calibration of the metering system by performing three calibration runs at a single intermediate orifice setting (based on the previous field test). Set the vacuum at the maximum value reached during the test series. To adjust the vacuum, insert a valve between the wet-test meter and the inlet of the metering system. Calculate the average value of the calibration factor. If the calibration has changed by more than 5 percent, recalibrate the meter over the full range of orifice settings, as outlined in APTD-0576.</p><p class="depth0">10.3.3 Leak-check of metering system: The portion of the sampling train from the pump to the orifice meter (see Figure 1) should be leak-checked prior to initial use and after each shipment. Leakage after the pump will result in less volume being recorded than is actually sampled. Use the following procedure: Close the main valve on the meter box. Insert a one-hole rubber stopper with rubber tubing attached into the orifice exhaust pipe. Disconnect and vent the low side of the orifice manometer. Close off the low side orifice tap. Pressurize the system to 13-18 cm (5-7 in) water column by blowing into the rubber tubing. Pinch off the tubing and observe the manometer for 1 min. A loss of pressure on the manometer indicates a leak in the meter box. Leaks must be corrected.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the dry-gas meter coefficient values obtained before and after a test series differ by >5 percent, either the test series must be voided or calculations for test series must be performed using whichever meter coefficient value (i.e., before or after) gives the lower value of total sample volume.</p><p class="depth0">10.4 Probe Heater: The probe heating system must be calibrated before its initial use in the field according to the procedure outlined in APTD-0576. Probes constructed according to APTD-0581 need not be calibrated if the calibration curves in APTD-0576 are used.</p><p class="depth0">10.5 Temperature gauges: Use the procedure in Section 4.3 of EPA Method 2 to calibrate in-stack temperature gauges. Dial thermometers, such as are used for the dry gas meter and condenser outlet, shall be calibrated against mercury-in-glass thermometers. An alternative mercury-free thermometer may be used if the thermometer is, at a minimum, equivalent in terms of performance or suitably effective for the specific temperature measurement application.</p><p class="depth0">10.6 Barometer: Adjust the barometer initially and before each test series to agree to within [2.5 mm Hg (0.1 in Hg) of the mercury barometer. Alternately, if a National Weather Service Station (NWSS) is located at the same altitude above sea level as the test site, the barometric pressure reported by the NWSS may be used.</p><p class="depth0">10.7 Balance: Calibrate the balance before each test series, using Class S standard weights. The weights must be within [0.5 percent of the standards, or the balance must be adjusted to meet these limits.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Procedure for Analysis</p><p class="depth0">The working formaldehyde standards (0.25, 0.50, 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 g/ml) are analyzed and a calibration curve is calculated for each day's analysis. The standards should be analyzed first to ensure that the method is working properly prior to analyzing the samples. In addition, a sample of the high-purity water should also be analyzed and used as a ``0'' formaldehyde standard.</p><p class="depth0">The procedure for analysis of samples and standards is identical: Using the pipet set to 2.50 ml, pipet 2.50 ml of the solution to be analyzed into a polystyrene cuvette. Using the 250 l pipet, pipet 250 l of the pararosaniline reagent solution into the cuvette. Seal the top of the cuvette with a Parafilm square and shake at least 30 seconds to ensure the solution in the cuvette is well-mixed. Peel back a corner of the Parafilm so the next reagent can be added. Using the 250 l pipet, pipet 250 l of the sodium sulfite reagent solution into the cuvette. Reseal the cuvette with the Parafilm, and again shake for about 30 seconds to mix the solution in the cuvette. Record the time of addition of the sodium sulfite and let the color develop at room temperature for 60 minutes. Set the spectrophotometer to 570 nm and set to read in Absorbance Units. The spectrophotometer should be equipped with a holder for the 1-cm pathlength cuvettes. Place cuvette(s) containing high-purity water in the spectrophotometer and adjust to read 0.000 AU.</p><p class="depth0">After the 60 minutes color development period, read the standard and samples in the spectrophotometer. Record the absorbance reading for each cuvette. The calibration curve is calculated by linear regression, with the formaldehyde concentration as the ``x'' coordinate of the pair, and the absorbance reading as the ``y'' coordinate. The procedure is very reproducible, and typically will yield

values similar to these for the calibration curve:
Correlation Coefficient: 0.9999Slope: 0.50Y-Intercept: 0.090
The formaldehyde concentration of the samples can be found by using the trend-line feature of the calculator or computer program used for the linear regression. For example, the TI-55 calculators use the ``X'' key (this gives the predicted formaldehyde concentration for the value of the absorbance you key in for the sample). Multiply the formaldehyde concentration from the sample by the dilution factor, if any, for the sample to give the formaldehyde concentration of the original, undiluted, sample (units will be micrograms/ml).</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Notes on the Pararosaniline Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1.1 The pararosaniline method is temperature-sensitive. However, the small fluctuations typical of a laboratory will not significantly affect the results.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.2 The calibration curve is linear to beyond 4 ``g/ml'' formaldehyde, however, a research-grade spectrophotometer is required to reproducibly read the high absorbance values. Consult your instrument manual to evaluate the capability of the spectrophotometer.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.3 The quality of the laboratory water used to prepare standards and make dilutions is critical. It is important that the cautions given in the Reagents section be observed. This procedure allows quantitation of formaldehyde at very low levels, and thus it is imperative to avoid contamination from other sources of formaldehyde and to exercise the degree of care required for trace analyses.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.4 The analyst should become familiar with the operation of the Oxford or equivalent pipettors before using them for an analysis. Follow the instructions of the manufacturer; one can pipet water into a tared container on any analytical balance to check pipet accuracy and precision. This will also establish if the proper technique is being used. Always use a new tip for each pipetting operation.</p><p class="depth0">11.1.5 This procedure follows the recommendations of ASTM Standard Guide D 3614, reading all solutions versus water in the reference cell. This allows the absorbance of the blank to be tracked on a daily basis.

The compounds are analyzed in the mid-infrared spectral region (about 400 to 4000 cm-1 or 25 to 2.5 m). Suggested analytical regions are given below (Table 1). Slight deviations from these recommended regions may be necessary due to variations in moisture content and ammonia concentration from source to source.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Example Analytical Regions----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Compound                Analytical region (cm-1) FLm - FUm            Potential interferants----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Formaldehyde.....................  2840.93-2679.83.......................

If CO and COS are hundreds of ppm or higher, then CO2 and</p><p class="depth0">moisture interference is reduced. If CO or COS is present at high concentration and the other at low</p><p class="depth0">concentration, then a shorter cell pathlength may be necessary to measure the high concentration component.
1.2.2 This method does not apply when: (a) Polymerization of formaldehyde occurs, (b) moisture condenses in either the sampling system or the instrumentation, and (c) when moisture content of the gas stream is so high relative to the analyte concentrations that it causes severe spectral interference.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Method Range and Sensitivity</p><p class="depth0">1.3.1 The analytical range is a function of instrumental design and composition of the gas stream. Theoretical detection limits depend, in part, on (a) the absorption coefficient of the compound in the analytical frequency region, (b) the spectral resolution, (c) interferometer sampling time, (d) detector sensitivity and response, and (e) absorption pathlength.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.2 Practically, there is no upper limit to the range. The practical lower detection limit is usually higher than the theoretical value, and depends on (a) moisture content of the flue gas, (b) presence of interferants, and (c) losses in the sampling system. In general, a 22 meter pathlength cell in a suitable sampling system can achieve practical detection limits of 1.5 ppm for three compounds (formaldehyde, phenol, and methanol) at moisture levels up to 15 percent by volume. Sources with uncontrolled emissions of CO and COS may require a 4 meter pathlength cell due to high concentration levels. For these two compounds, make sure absorbance of highest concentration component is <1.0.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Data Quality Objectives1.4.1 In designing or configuring the system, the analyst first sets the data quality objectives, i.e., the desired lower detection limit (DLi) and the desired analytical uncertainty (AUi) for each compound. The instrumental parameters (factors b, c, d, and e in Section 1.3.1) are then chosen to meet these requirements, using Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol.1.4.2 Data quality for each application is determined, in part, by measuring the RMS (Root Mean Square) noise level in each analytical spectral region (Appendix C of the FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation) of the absorbance values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value of the region. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol defines the MAUim (minimum analyte uncertainty of the i\th\ analyte in the m\th\ analytical region). The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for which the analytical uncertainty limit (AUi) can be maintained: if the measured analyte concentration is less than MAUi, then data quality is unacceptable.

The atomic motions result in bond deformations (bond stretching and bond-angle bending). The number of fundamental (or independent) vibrational motions depends on the number of atoms (N) in the molecule. At typical testing temperatures, most molecules are in the ground-state vibrational state for most of their fundamental vibrational motions. A molecule can undergo a transition from its ground state (for a particular vibration) to the first excited state by absorbing a quantum of light at a frequency characteristic of the molecule and the molecular motion. Molecules also undergo rotational transitions by absorbing energies in the far-infrared or microwave spectral regions. Rotational transition absorbencies are superimposed on the vibrational absorbencies to give a characteristic shape to each rotational-vibrational absorbance ``band.''</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Most molecules exhibit more than one absorbance band in several frequency regions to produce an infrared spectrum (a characteristic pattern of bands or a ``fingerprint'') that is unique to each molecule. The infrared spectrum of a molecule depends on its structure (bond lengths, bond angles, bond strengths, and atomic masses). Even small differences in structure can produce significantly different spectra.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Spectral band intensities vary with the concentration of the absorbing compound. Within constraints, the relationship between absorbance and sample concentration is linear. Sample spectra are compared to reference spectra to determine the species and their concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Sampling and Analysis</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 Flue gas is continuously extracted from the source, and the gas or a portion of the gas is conveyed to the FTIR gas cell, where a spectrum of the flue gas is recorded.

These reference spectra are available in a permanent soft copy from the EPA spectral library on the EMTIC bulletin board. The source may also prepare reference spectra according to Section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Reference spectra not prepared according to the FTIR Protocol are not acceptable for use in this test method.

The method applies to single and multiple stage paint arrestors or paint arrestor media. The method is applicable to efficiency determinations from 0 to 99 percent. Two test aerosols are used--one liquid phase and one solid phase. Oleic acid, a low-volatility liquid (CAS Number 112-80-1), is used to simulate the behavior of wet paint overspray. The solid-phase aerosol is potassium chloride salt (KCl, CAS Number 7447-40-7) and is used to simulate the behavior of a dry overspray. The method is limited to determination of the initial, clean filtration efficiency of the arrestor. Changes in efficiency (either increase or decrease) due to the accumulation of paint overspray on and within the arrestor are not evaluated.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Efficiency is defined as 1--Penetration (e.g., 70 percent efficiency is equal to 0.30 penetration). Penetration is based on the ratio of the downstream particle concentration to the upstream concentration. It is often more useful, from a mathematical or statistical point of view, to discuss the upstream and downstream counts in terms of penetration rather than the derived efficiency value. Thus, this document uses both penetration and efficiency as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 For a paint arrestor system or subsystem which has been tested by this method, adding additional filtration devices to the system or subsystem shall be assumed to result in an efficiency of at least that of the original system without the requirement for additional testing. (For example, if the final stage of a three-stage paint arrestor system has been tested by itself, then the addition of the other two stages shall be assumed to maintain, as a minimum, the filtration efficiency provided by the final stage alone. Thus, in this example, if the final stage has been shown to meet the filtration requirements of Table 1 of Sec. 63.745 of subpart GG, then the final stage in combination with any additional paint arrestor stages also passes the filtration requirements.)</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 This method applies to the determination of the fractional (i.e., particle-size dependent) aerosol penetration of several types of paint arrestors. Fractional penetration is computed from aerosol concentrations measured upstream and downstream of an arrestor installed in a laboratory test rig. The aerosol concentrations upstream and downstream of the arrestors are measured with an aerosol analyzer that simultaneously counts and sizes the particles in the aerosol stream. The aerosol analyzer covers the particle diameter size range from 0.3 to 10 m in a minimum of 12 contiguous sizing channels. Each sizing channel covers a narrow range of particle diameters. For example, Channel 1 may cover from 0.3 to 0.4 m, Channel 2 from 0.4 to 0.5 m, * * * By taking the ratio of the

downstream to upstream counts on a channel by channel basis, the penetration is computed for each of the sizing channels.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 The upstream and downstream aerosol measurements are made while injecting the test aerosol into the air stream upstream of the arrestor (ambient aerosol is removed with HEPA filters on the inlet of the test rig). This test aerosol spans the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 m and provides sufficient upstream concentration in each of the optical particle counter (OPC) sizing channels to allow accurate calculation of penetration, down to penetrations of approximately 0.01 (i.e., 1 percent penetration; 99 percent efficiency). Results are presented as a graph and a data table showing the aerodynamic particle diameter and the corresponding fractional efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Aerodynamic Diameter--diameter of a unit density sphere having the same aerodynamic properties as the particle in question.</p><p class="depth0">Efficiency is defined as equal to 1--Penetration.</p><p class="depth0">Optical Particle Counter (OPC)--an instrument that counts particles by size using light scattering.

A schematic diagram of a test duct used in the development of the method is shown in Figure 319-1.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR27MR98.008</p><p class="depth0">6.1.1 The test section, paint spray section, and attached transitions are constructed of stainless and galvanized steel. The upstream and downstream ducting is 20 cm diameter polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The upstream transition provides a 7  angle of expansion to provide a uniform air flow distribution to the paint arrestors. Aerosol concentration is

measured upstream and downstream of the test section to obtain the challenge and penetrating aerosol concentrations, respectively. Because the downstream ducting runs back under the test section, the challenge and penetrating aerosol taps are located physically near each other, thereby facilitating aerosol sampling and reducing sample-line length. The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream aerosol probes are designed to yield isokinetic sampling conditions.</p><p class="depth0">6.1.2 The configuration and dimensions of the test duct can deviate from those of Figure 319-1 provided that the following key elements are maintained: the test duct must meet the criteria specified in Table 319-1; the inlet air is HEPA filtered; the blower is on the upstream side of the duct thereby creating a positive pressure in the duct relative to the surrounding room; the challenge air has a temperature between 50  and 100 F and a relative humidity of less than 65 percent; the angle of the upstream transition (if used) to the paint arrestor must not exceed 7 ; the angle of the downstream transition (if used) from the paint arrestor must not exceed 30 ; the test duct must provide a means for mixing the challenge aerosol with the upstream flow (in lieu of any mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters fulfills this requirement); the test duct must provide a means for mixing any penetrating aerosol with the downstream flow (in lieu of any mixing device, a duct length of 15 duct diameters fulfills this requirement); the test section must provide a secure and leak-free mounting for single and multiple stage arrestors; and the test duct may utilize a 180  bend in the downstream duct.</p><p class="depth0">Table 319-1--QC Control Limits------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Frequency and</p><p class="depth0">description         Control limits------------------------------------------------------------------------OPC zero count..............

The aerosol generator is used to produce a stable aerosol covering the particle size range from 0.3 to 10 m diameter. The generator used in the development of this method consists of an air atomizing nozzle positioned at the top of a 0.30-m (12-in.) diameter, 1.3-m (51-in.) tall, acrylic, transparent, spray tower. This tower allows larger sized particles, which would otherwise foul the test duct and sample lines, to fall out of the aerosol. It also adds drying air to ensure that the KCl droplets dry to solid salt particles. After generation, the aerosol passes through an aerosol neutralizer (Kr85 radioactive source) to neutralize any electrostatic charge on the aerosol (electrostatic charge is an unavoidable consequence of most aerosol generation methods). To improve the mixing of the aerosol with the air stream, the aerosol is injected counter to the airflow. Generators of other designs may be used, but they must produce a stable aerosol concentration over the 0.3 to 10 m diameter size range; provide a means of ensuring the complete drying of the KCl aerosol; and utilize a charge neutralizer to neutralize any electrostatic charge on the aerosol. The resultant challenge aerosol must meet the minimum count per channel and maximum concentration criteria of Table 319-1.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Installation of Paint Arrestor. The paint arrestor is to be installed in the test duct in a manner that precludes air bypassing the arrestor. Since arrestor media are often sold unmounted, a mounting frame may be used to provide back support for the media in addition to sealing it into the duct. The mounting frame for 20 in.x20 in. arrestors will have minimum open internal dimensions of 18 in. square. Mounting frames for 24 in.x24 in. arrestors will have minimum open internal dimensions of 22 in. square. The open internal dimensions of the mounting frame shall not be less than 75 percent of the approach duct dimensions.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Optical Particle Counter. The upstream and downstream aerosol concentrations are measured with a high-resolution optical particle counter (OPC). To ensure comparability of test results, the OPC shall utilize an optical design based on wide-angle light scattering and provided a minimum of 12 contiguous particle sizing channels from 0.3 to 10 m diameter (based on response to PSL) where, for each channel, the ratio of the diameter corresponding to the upper channel bound to the lower channel bound must not exceed 1.5.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Aerosol Sampling System. The upstream and downstream sample lines must be made of rigid electrically-grounded metallic tubing having a smooth inside surface, and they must be rigidly secured to prevent movement during testing. The upstream and downstream sample lines are to be nominally identical in geometry. The use of a short length (100 mm maximum) of straight flexible tubing to make the final connection to the OPC is acceptable. The inlet nozzles of the upstream and downstream probes must be sharp-edged and of appropriate entrance diameter to maintain isokinetic sampling within 20 percent of the air velocity.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.1 The sampling system may be designed to acquire the upstream and downstream samples using (a) sequential upstream-downstream sampling with a single OPC, (b) simultaneous upstream and downstream sampling with two OPC's, or (c) sequential upstream-downstream sampling with two OPC's.</p><p class="depth0">6.5.2 When two particle counters are used to acquire the upstream and downstream counts, they must be closely matched in flowrate and optical design.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Airflow Monitor. The volumetric airflow through the system shall be measured with a calibrated orifice plate, flow nozzle, or laminar flow element. The measurement device must have an accuracy of 5 percent or better.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">7.1 The liquid test aerosol is reagent grade, 98 percent pure, oleic acid (Table 319-2). The solid test aerosol is KCl aerosolized from a solution of KCl in water. In addition to the test aerosol, a calibration aerosol of monodisperse polystyrene latex (PSL) spheres is used to verify the calibration of the OPC.</p><p class="depth0">Table 319-2--Properties of the Test and Calibration Aerosols----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Density, g/</p><p class="depth0">Refractive index             cm \3\                  Shape----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Oleic Acid (liquid-phase       1.46 nonabsorbing................         0.89  Spherical.</p><p class="depth0">challenge aerosol).KCl (solid-phase challenge     1.49.............................         1.98  Cubic or agglomerated cubes.</p><p class="depth0">aerosol).PSL (calibration aerosol)....  1.59 nonabsorbing................         1.05  Spherical.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, and Storage</p><p class="depth0">8.1 In this test, all sampling occurs in real-time, thus no samples are collected that require preservation or storage during the test. The paint arrestors are shipped and stored to avoid structural damage or soiling. Each arrestor may be shipped in its original box from the manufacturer or similar cardboard box. Arrestors are stored at the test site in a location that keeps them clean and dry.

The test is performed as a normal penetration test except the paint arrestor is not used. A perfect system would yield a measured penetration of 1 at all particle sizes. Deviations from 1 can occur due to particle losses in the duct, differences in the degree of aerosol uniformity (i.e., mixing) at the upstream and

downstream probes, and differences in particle transport efficiency in the upstream and downstream sampling lines.</p><p class="depth0">11.3 Control Test: 0 Percent Penetration. One 0 percent penetration test must be performed at least monthly during testing. The test is performed by using a HEPA filter rather than a paint arrestor.

This method describes sampling and analytical procedures for extractive emission measurements using Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Detailed analytical procedures for interpreting infrared spectra are described in the ``Protocol for the Use of Extractive Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in Analyses of Gaseous Emissions from Stationary Sources,'' hereafter referred to as the ``Protocol.'' Definitions not given in this method are given in appendix A of the Protocol. References to specific sections in the Protocol are made throughout this Method. For additional information refer to references 1 and 2, and other EPA reports, which describe the use of FTIR spectrometry in specific field measurement applications and validation tests. The sampling procedure described here is extractive. Flue gas is extracted through a heated gas transport and handling system. For some sources, sample conditioning systems may be applicable. Some examples are given in this method.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Sample conditioning systems may be used providing the method validation requirements in Sections 9.2 and 13.0 of this method are met.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Scope and Applicability.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 Analytes. Analytes include hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) for which EPA reference spectra have been developed. Other compounds can also be measured with this method if reference spectra are prepared according to section 4.6 of the protocol.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 Applicability. This method applies to the analysis of vapor phase organic or inorganic compounds which absorb energy in the mid-infrared spectral region, about 400 to 4000 cm-1 (25 to 2.5 m). This method is used to determine compound-specific concentrations in a multi-component vapor phase sample, which is contained in a closed-path gas cell. Spectra of samples are collected using double beam infrared absorption spectroscopy. A computer program is used to analyze spectra and report compound concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 Method Range and Sensitivity. Analytical range and sensitivity depend on the frequency-dependent analyte absorptivity, instrument configuration, data collection parameters, and gas stream composition. Instrument factors include: (a) spectral resolution, (b) interferometer signal averaging time, (c) detector sensitivity and response, and (d) absorption path length.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.1 For any optical configuration the analytical range is between the absorbance values of about .01 (infrared transmittance relative to the background = 0.98) and 1.0(T = 0.1). (For absorbance >1.0 the relation between absorbance and concentration may not be linear.)</p><p class="depth0">1.2.2 The concentrations associated with this absorbance range depend primarily on the cell path length and the sample temperature. An analyte absorbance greater than 1.0, can be lowered by decreasing the optical path length. Analyte absorbance increases with a longer path length. Analyte detection also depends on the presence of other species exhibiting absorbance in the same analytical region. Additionally, the estimated lower absorbance (A) limit(A = 0.01) depends on the root mean square deviation (RMSD) noise in the analytical region.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.3 The concentration range of this method is determined by the choice of optical configuration.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.3.1 The absorbance for a given concentration can be decreased by decreasing the path length or by diluting the sample. There is no practical upper limit to the measurement range.</p><p class="depth0">1.2.3.2 The analyte absorbance for a given concentration may be increased by increasing the cell path length or (to some extent) using a higher resolution. Both modifications also cause a corresponding increased absorbance for all compounds in the sample, and a decrease in the signal throughput. For this reason the practical lower detection range (quantitation limit) usually depends on sample characteristics such as moisture content of the gas, the presence of other interferants, and losses in the sampling system.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Sensitivity. The limit of sensitivity for an optical configuration and integration time is determined using appendix D of the Protocol: Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, (MAU). The MAU depends on the RMSD noise in an analytical region, and on the absorptivity of the analyte in the same region.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Data Quality. Data quality shall be determined by executing Protocol pre-test procedures in appendices B to H of the protocol and post-test procedures in appendices I and J of the protocol.</p><p class="depth0">1.4.1 Measurement objectives shall be established by the choice of detection limit (DLi) and analytical uncertainty (AUi) for each analyte.</p><p class="depth0">1.4.2 An instrumental configuration shall be selected. An estimate of gas composition shall be made based on previous test data, data from a similar source or information gathered in a pre-test site survey. Spectral interferants shall be identified using the selected DLi and AUi and band areas from reference spectra and interferant spectra. The baseline noise of the system shall be measured in each analytical region to determine the MAU of the instrument configuration for each analyte and interferant (MIUi).</p><p class="depth0">1.4.3 Data quality for the application shall be determined, in part, by measuring the RMS (root mean square) noise level in each analytical spectral region (appendix C of the Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the RMSD of the absorbance values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value in the region.</p><p class="depth0">1.4.4 The MAU is the minimum analyte concentration for which the AUi can be maintained; if the measured analyte concentration is less than MAUi then data quality are unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Principle. References 4 through 7 provide background material on infrared spectroscopy and quantitative analysis. A summary is given in this section.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.1 Infrared absorption spectroscopy is performed by directing an infrared beam through a sample to a detector. The frequency-dependent infrared absorbance of the sample is measured by comparing this detector signal (single beam spectrum) to a signal obtained without a sample in the beam path (background).</p><p class="depth0">2.1.2 Most molecules absorb infrared radiation and the absorbance occurs in a characteristic and reproducible pattern. The infrared spectrum measures fundamental molecular properties and a compound can be identified from its infrared spectrum alone.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.3 Within constraints, there is a linear relationship between infrared absorption and compound concentration. If this frequency dependent relationship (absorptivity) is known (measured), it can be used to determine compound concentration in a sample mixture.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.4 Absorptivity is measured by preparing, in the laboratory, standard samples of compounds at known concentrations and measuring the FTIR ``reference spectra'' of these standard samples. These ``reference spectra'' are then used in sample analysis: (1) Compounds are detected by matching sample absorbance bands with bands in reference spectra, and (2) concentrations are measured by comparing sample band intensities with reference band intensities.</p><p class="depth0">2.1.5 This method is self-validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 8.6.2 and 9.0 of this method, and results from a previous method validation study support the use of this method in the application.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Sampling and Analysis. In extractive sampling a probe assembly and pump are used to extract gas from the exhaust of the affected source and transport the sample to the FTIR gas cell. Typically, the sampling apparatus is similar to that used for single-component continuous emission monitor (CEM) measurements.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 The digitized infrared spectrum of the sample in the FTIR gas cell is measured and stored on a computer. Absorbance band intensities in the spectrum are related to sample concentrations by what is commonly referred to as Beer's Law.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.003

In this procedure (section 8.6.2

of this method) an analyte is spiked into the gas stream at the back end of the sample probe. Analyte concentrations in the spiked samples are compared to analyte concentrations in unspiked samples. Since the concentration of the spike is known, this procedure can be used to determine if the sampling system is removing the spiked analyte(s) from the sample stream.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 Reference Spectra Availability. Reference spectra of over 100 HAPs are available in the EPA FTIR spectral library on the EMTIC (Emission Measurement Technical Information Center) computer bulletin board service and at internet address http://info.arnold.af.mil/epa/welcome.htm. Reference spectra for HAPs, or other analytes, may also be prepared according to section 4.6 of the Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Operator Requirements. The FTIR analyst shall be trained in setting up the instrumentation, verifying the instrument is functioning properly, and performing routine maintenance. The analyst must evaluate the initial sample spectra to determine if the sample matrix is consistent with pre-test assumptions and if the instrument configuration is suitable. The analyst must be able to modify the instrument configuration, if necessary.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.1 The spectral analysis shall be supervised by someone familiar with EPA FTIR Protocol procedures.</p><p class="depth0">2.4.2 A technician trained in instrumental test methods is qualified to install and operate the sampling system. This includes installing the probe and heated line assembly, operating the analyte spike system, and performing moisture and flow measurements.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">See appendix A of the Protocol for definitions relating to infrared spectroscopy. Additional definitions are given in sections 3.1 through 3.29.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Analyte. A compound that this method is used to measure. The term ``target analyte'' is also used. This method is multi-component and a number of analytes can be targeted for a test.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Reference Spectrum. Infrared spectrum of an analyte prepared under controlled, documented, and reproducible laboratory conditions according to procedures in section 4.6 of the Protocol. A library of reference spectra is used to measure analytes in gas samples.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Standard Spectrum. A spectrum that has been prepared from a reference spectrum through a (documented) mathematical operation. A common example is de-resolving of reference spectra to lower-resolution standard spectra (Protocol, appendix K to the addendum of this method). Standard spectra, prepared by approved, and documented, procedures can be used as reference spectra for analysis.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Concentration. In this method concentration is expressed as a molar concentration, in ppm-meters, or in (ppm-meters)/K, where K is the absolute temperature (Kelvin). The latter units allow the direct comparison of concentrations from systems using different optical configurations or sampling temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Interferant. A compound in the sample matrix whose infrared spectrum overlaps with part of an analyte spectrum. The most accurate analyte measurements are achieved when reference spectra of interferants are used in the quantitative analysis with the analyte reference spectra. The presence of an interferant can increase the analytical uncertainty in the measured analyte concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Gas Cell. A gas containment cell that can be evacuated. It is equipped with the optical components to pass the infrared beam through the sample to the detector. Important cell features include: path length (or range if variable), temperature range, materials of construction, and total gas volume.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Sampling System. Equipment used to extract the sample from the test location and transport the sample gas to the FTIR analyzer. This includes sample conditioning systems.</p><p class="depth0">3.8 Sample Analysis. The process of interpreting the infrared spectra to obtain sample analyte concentrations. This process is usually automated using a software routine employing a classical least squares (cls), partial least squares (pls), or K- or P-matrix method.</p><p class="depth0">3.9 One hundred percent line. A double beam transmittance spectrum obtained by combining two background single beam spectra. Ideally, this line is equal to 100 percent transmittance (or zero absorbance) at every frequency in the spectrum. Practically, a zero absorbance line is used to measure the baseline noise in the spectrum.</p><p class="depth0">3.10 Background Deviation. A deviation from 100 percent transmittance in any region of the 100 percent line. Deviations greater than [5 percent in an analytical region are unacceptable (absorbance of 0.021 to -0.022). Such deviations indicate a change in the instrument throughput relative to the background single beam.</p><p class="depth0">3.11 Batch Sampling. A procedure where spectra of discreet, static samples are collected. The gas cell is filled with sample and the cell is isolated. The spectrum is collected. Finally, the cell is evacuated to prepare for the next sample.</p><p class="depth0">3.12 Continuous Sampling. A procedure where spectra are collected while sample gas is flowing through the cell at a measured rate.</p><p class="depth0">3.13 Sampling resolution. The spectral resolution used to collect sample spectra.</p><p class="depth0">3.14 Truncation. Limiting the number of interferogram data points by deleting points

farthest from the center burst (zero path difference, ZPD).</p><p class="depth0">3.15 Zero filling. The addition of points to the interferogram. The position of each added point is interpolated from neighboring real data points. Zero filling adds no information to the interferogram, but affects line shapes in the absorbance spectrum (and possibly analytical results).</p><p class="depth0">3.16 Reference CTS. Calibration Transfer Standard spectra that were collected with reference spectra.</p><p class="depth0">3.17 CTS Standard. CTS spectrum produced by applying a de-resolution procedure to a reference CTS.</p><p class="depth0">3.18 Test CTS. CTS spectra collected at the sampling resolution using the same optical configuration as for sample spectra. Test spectra help verify the resolution, temperature and path length of the FTIR system.</p><p class="depth0">3.19 RMSD. Root Mean Square Difference, defined in EPA FTIR Protocol, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">3.20 Sensitivity. The noise-limited compound-dependent detection limit for the FTIR system configuration. This is estimated by the MAU. It depends on the RMSD in an analytical region of a zero absorbance line.</p><p class="depth0">3.21 Quantitation Limit. The lower limit of detection for the FTIR system configuration in the sample spectra. This is estimated by mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra of analytes and interferences from sample spectra, then measuring the RMSD in an analytical region of the subtracted spectrum. Since the noise in subtracted sample spectra may be much greater than in a zero absorbance spectrum, the quantitation limit is generally much higher than the sensitivity. Removing spectral interferences from the sample or improving the spectral subtraction can lower the quantitation limit toward (but not below) the sensitivity.</p><p class="depth0">3.22 Independent Sample. A unique volume of sample gas; there is no mixing of gas between two consecutive independent samples. In continuous sampling two independent samples are separated by at least 5 cell volumes. The interval between independent measurements depends on the cell volume and the sample flow rate (through the cell).</p><p class="depth0">3.23 Measurement. A single spectrum of flue gas contained in the FTIR cell.</p><p class="depth0">3.24 Run. A run consists of a series of measurements. At a minimum a run includes 8 independent measurements spaced over 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">3.25 Validation. Validation of FTIR measurements is described in sections 13.0 through 13.4 of this method. Validation is used to verify the test procedures for measuring specific analytes at a source. Validation provides proof that the method works under certain test conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3.26 Validation Run. A validation run consists of at least 24 measurements of independent samples. Half of the samples are spiked and half are not spiked. The length of the run is determined by the interval between independent samples.</p><p class="depth0">3.27 Screening. Screening is used when there is little or no available information about a source. The purpose of screening is to determine what analytes are emitted and to obtain information about important sample characteristics such as moisture, temperature, and interferences. Screening results are semi-quantitative (estimated concentrations) or qualitative (identification only). Various optical and sampling configurations may be used. Sample conditioning systems may be evaluated for their effectiveness in removing interferences. It is unnecessary to perform a complete run under any set of sampling conditions. Spiking is not necessary, but spiking can be a useful screening tool for evaluating the sampling system, especially if a reactive or soluble analyte is used for the spike.</p><p class="depth0">3.28 Emissions Test. An FTIR emissions test is performed according specific sampling and analytical procedures. These procedures, for the target analytes and the source, are based on previous screening and validation results. Emission results are quantitative. A QA spike (sections 8.6.2 and 9.2 of this method) is performed under each set of sampling conditions using a representative analyte. Flow, gas temperature and diluent data are recorded concurrently with the FTIR measurements to provide mass emission rates for detected compounds.</p><p class="depth0">3.29 Surrogate. A surrogate is a compound that is used in a QA spike procedure (section 8.6.2 of this method) to represent other compounds. The chemical and physical properties of a surrogate shall be similar to the compounds it is chosen to represent. Under given sampling conditions, usually a single sampling factor is of primary concern for measuring the target analytes: for example, the surrogate spike results can be representative for analytes that are more reactive, more soluble, have a lower absorptivity, or have a lower vapor pressure than the surrogate itself.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences</p><p class="depth0">Interferences are divided into two classifications: analytical and sampling.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Analytical Interferences. An analytical interference is a spectral feature that complicates (in extreme cases may prevent) the analysis of an analyte. Analytical interferences are classified as background or spectral interference.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 Background Interference. This results from a change in throughput relative to the single beam background. It is corrected by collecting a new background and proceeding with the test. In severe instances the cause must be identified and corrected. Potential causes include: (1) Deposits on reflective surfaces or transmitting windows, (2) changes in

detector sensitivity, (3) a change in the infrared source output, or (4) failure in the instrument electronics. In routine sampling throughput may degrade over several hours. Periodically a new background must be collected, but no other corrective action will be required.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Spectral Interference. This results from the presence of interfering compound(s) (interferant) in the sample. Interferant spectral features overlap analyte spectral features. Any compound with an infrared spectrum, including analytes, can potentially be an interferant. The Protocol measures absorbance band overlap in each analytical region to determine if potential interferants shall be classified as known interferants (FTIR Protocol, section 4.9 and appendix B). Water vapor and CO2 are common spectral interferants. Both of these compounds have strong infrared spectra and are present in many sample matrices at high concentrations relative to analytes. The extent of interference depends on the (1) interferant concentration, (2) analyte concentration, and (3) the degree of band overlap. Choosing an alternate analytical region can minimize or avoid the spectral interference. For example, CO2 interferes with the analysis of the 670 cm-1 benzene band. However, benzene can also be measured near 3000 cm-1 (with less sensitivity).</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Sampling System Interferences. These prevent analytes from reaching the instrument. The analyte spike procedure is designed to measure sampling system interference, if any.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Temperature. A temperature that is too low causes condensation of analytes or water vapor. The materials of the sampling system and the FTIR gas cell usually set the upper limit of temperature.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Reactive Species. Anything that reacts with analytes. Some analytes, like formaldehyde, polymerize at lower temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.3 Materials. Poor choice of material for probe, or sampling line may remove some analytes. For example, HF reacts with glass components.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.4 Moisture. In addition to being a spectral interferant, condensed moisture removes soluble compounds.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">The hazards of performing this method are those associated with any stack sampling method and the same precautions shall be followed. Many HAPs are suspected carcinogens or present other serious health risks. Exposure to these compounds should be avoided in all circumstances. For instructions on the safe handling of any particular compound, refer to its material safety data sheet. When using analyte standards, always ensure that gases are properly vented and that the gas handling system is leak free. (Always perform a leak check with the system under maximum vacuum and, again, with the system at greater than ambient pressure.) Refer to section 8.2 of this method for leak check procedures. This method does not address all of the potential safety risks associated with its use. Anyone performing this method must follow safety and health practices consistent with applicable legal requirements and with prudent practice for each application.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">Note: Mention of trade names or specific products does not constitute endorsement by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p><p class="depth0">The equipment and supplies are based on the schematic of a sampling system shown in Figure 1. Either the batch or continuous sampling procedures may be used with this sampling system. Alternative sampling configurations may also be used, provided that the data quality objectives are met as determined in the post-analysis evaluation. Other equipment or supplies may be necessary, depending on the design of the sampling system or the specific target analytes.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Sampling Probe. Glass, stainless steel, or other appropriate material of sufficient length and physical integrity to sustain heating, prevent adsorption of analytes, and to transport analytes to the infrared gas cell. Special materials or configurations may be required in some applications. For instance, high stack sample temperatures may require special steel or cooling the probe. For very high moisture sources it may be desirable to use a dilution probe.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Particulate Filters. A glass wool plug (optional) inserted at the probe tip (for large particulate removal) and a filter (required) rated for 99 percent removal efficiency at 1-micron (e.g., Balston'') connected at the outlet of the heated probe.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Sampling Line/Heating System. Heated (sufficient to prevent condensation) stainless steel, polytetrafluoroethane, or other material inert to the analytes.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Gas Distribution Manifold. A heated manifold allowing the operator to control flows of gas standards and samples directly to the FTIR system or through sample conditioning systems. Usually includes heated flow meter, heated valve for selecting and sending sample to the analyzer, and a by-pass vent. This is typically constructed of stainless steel tubing and fittings, and high-temperature valves.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Stainless Steel Tubing. Type 316, appropriate diameter (e.g., \3/8\ in.) and length for heated connections. Higher grade stainless may be desirable in some applications.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Calibration/Analyte Spike Assembly. A three way valve assembly (or equivalent) to introduce analyte or surrogate spikes into the sampling system at the outlet of the

probe upstream of the out-of-stack particulate filter and the FTIR analytical system.</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Mass Flow Meter (MFM). These are used for measuring analyte spike flow. The MFM shall be calibrated in the range of 0 to 5 L/min and be accurate to [2 percent (or better) of the flow meter span.</p><p class="depth0">6.8 Gas Regulators. Appropriate for individual gas standards.</p><p class="depth0">6.9 Polytetrafluoroethane Tubing.

A leak-free pump (e.g., KNF \TM\), with by-pass valve, capable of producing a sample flow rate of at least 10 L/min through 100 ft of sample line. If the pump is positioned upstream of the distribution manifold and FTIR system, use a heated pump that is constructed from materials non-reactive to the analytes. If the pump is located downstream of the FTIR system, the gas cell sample pressure will be lower than ambient pressure and it must be recorded at regular intervals.</p><p class="depth0">6.11 Gas Sample Manifold. Secondary manifold to control sample flow at the inlet to the FTIR manifold. This is optional, but includes a by-pass vent and heated rotameter.</p><p class="depth0">6.12 Rotameter. A 0 to 20 L/min rotameter. This meter need not be calibrated.</p><p class="depth0">6.13 FTIR Analytical System. Spectrometer and detector, capable of measuring the analytes to the chosen detection limit. The system shall include a personal computer with compatible software allowing automated collection of spectra.</p><p class="depth0">6.14 FTIR Cell Pump. Required for the batch sampling technique, capable of evacuating the FTIR cell volume within 2 minutes. The pumping speed shall allow the operator to obtain 8 sample spectra in 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">6.15 Absolute Pressure Gauge.

Capable of measuring the cell temperature to within [2 C.</p><p class="depth0">6.17 Sample Conditioning. One option is a condenser system, which is used for moisture removal. This can be helpful in the measurement of some analytes. Other sample conditioning procedures may be devised for the removal of moisture or other interfering species.</p><p class="depth0">6.17.1 The analyte spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method, the QA spike procedure of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the validation procedure of section 13 of this method demonstrate whether the sample conditioning affects analyte concentrations. Alternatively, measurements can be made with two parallel FTIR systems; one measuring conditioned sample, the other measuring unconditioned sample.</p><p class="depth0">6.17.2 Another option is sample dilution. The dilution factor measurement must be documented and accounted for in the reported concentrations. An alternative to dilution is to lower the sensitivity of the FTIR system by decreasing the cell path length, or to use a short-path cell in conjunction with a long path cell to measure more than one concentration range.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Analyte(s) and Tracer Gas. Obtain a certified gas cylinder mixture containing all of the analyte(s) at concentrations within [2 percent of the emission source levels (expressed in ppm-meter/K). If practical, the analyte standard cylinder shall also contain the tracer gas at a concentration which gives a measurable absorbance at a dilution factor of at least 10:1. Two ppm SF6 is sufficient for a path length of 22 meters at 250 F.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Calibration Transfer Standard(s). Select the calibration transfer standards (CTS) according to section 4.5 of the FTIR Protocol.

Obtain reference spectra for each analyte, interferant, surrogate, CTS, and tracer. If EPA reference spectra are not available, use reference spectra prepared according to procedures in section 4.6 of the EPA FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Three types of testing can be performed: (1) Screening, (2) emissions test, and (3) validation. Each is defined in section 3 of this method. Determine the purpose(s) of the FTIR test. Test requirements include: (a) AUi, DLi, overall fractional uncertainty, OFUi, maximum expected concentration (CMAXi), and tAN for each, (b) potential interferants, (c) sampling system factors, e.g., minimum absolute cell pressure, (Pmin), FTIR cell volume (VSS), estimated sample absorption pathlength, LS', estimated sample pressure, PS', TS', signal integration time (tSS), minimum instrumental linewidth, MIL, fractional error, and (d) analytical regions, e.g., m = 1 to M, lower wavenumber position, FLm, center wavenumber position, FCm, and upper wavenumber position, FUm, plus interferants, upper wavenumber position of the CTS absorption band, FFUm, lower wavenumber position of the CTS absorption band, FFLm, wavenumber range FNU to FNL. If necessary, sample and acquire an initial spectrum. From analysis of this preliminary spectrum determine a suitable operational path length. Set up the sampling train as shown in Figure 1 or use an appropriate alternative configuration. Sections 8.1 through 8.11 of this method provide guidance on pre-test calculations in the EPA protocol, sampling and analytical procedures, and post-test protocol calculations.</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Pretest Preparations and Evaluations. Using the procedure in section 4.0 of the

FTIR Protocol, determine the optimum sampling system configuration for measuring the target analytes. Use available information to make reasonable assumptions about moisture content and other interferences.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 Analytes. Select the required detection limit (DLi) and the maximum permissible analytical uncertainty (AUi) for each analyte (labeled from 1 to i). Estimate, if possible, the maximum expected concentration for each analyte, CMAXi. The expected measurement range is fixed by DLi and CMAXi for each analyte (i).</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 Potential Interferants. List the potential interferants. This usually includes water vapor and CO2, but may also include some analytes and other compounds.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3. Optical Configuration. Choose an optical configuration that can measure all of the analytes within the absorbance range of .01 to 1.0 (this may require more than one path length). Use Protocol sections 4.3 to 4.8 for guidance in choosing a configuration and measuring CTS.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainty (FRUi). The FRU is determined for each analyte by comparing CTS spectra taken before and after the reference spectra were measured. The EPA para-xylene reference spectra were collected on 10/31/91 and 11/01/91 with corresponding CTS spectra ``cts1031a,'' and ``cts1101b.'' The CTS spectra are used to estimate the reproducibility (FRU) in the system that was used to collect the references. The FRU must be -1 CTS spectra in EPA reference library: S3 (cts1101b-cts1031a), and S4 [(cts1101b+cts1031a)/2]. The RMSD (SRMS) is calculated in the subtracted baseline, S3, in the corresponding CTS region from 850 to 1065 cm-1. The area (BAV) is calculated in the same region of the averaged CTS spectrum, S4.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 Known Interferants. Use appendix B of the EPA FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.6 Calculate the Minimum Analyte Uncertainty, MAU (section 1.3 of this method discusses MAU and protocol appendix D gives the MAU procedure). The MAU for each analyte, i, and each analytical region, m, depends on the RMS noise.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.7 Analytical Program. See FTIR Protocol, section 4.10. Prepare computer program based on the chosen analytical technique. Use as input reference spectra of all target analytes and expected interferants. Reference spectra of additional compounds shall also be included in the program if their presence (even if transient) in the samples is considered possible. The program output shall be in ppm (or ppb) and shall be corrected for differences between the reference path length, LR, temperature, TR, and pressure, PR, and the conditions used for collecting the sample spectra. If sampling is performed at ambient pressure, then any pressure correction is usually small relative to corrections for path length and temperature, and may be neglected.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Leak-Check</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Sampling System. A typical FTIR extractive sampling train is shown in Figure 1. Leak check from the probe tip to pump outlet as follows: Connect a 0-to 250-mL/min rate meter (rotameter or bubble meter) to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe, and record the leak rate. The leak rate shall be 4200 mL/min.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Analytical System Leak check. Leak check the FTIR cell under vacuum and under pressure (greater than ambient). Leak check connecting tubing and inlet manifold under pressure.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.1 For the evacuated sample technique, close the valve to the FTIR cell, and evacuate the absorption cell to the minimum absolute pressure Pmin. Close the valve to the pump, and determine the change in pressure [Delta]Pv after 2 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.2 For both the evacuated sample and purging techniques, pressurize the system to about 100 mmHg above atmospheric pressure. Isolate the pump and determine the change in pressure [Delta]Pp after 2 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.3 Measure the barometric pressure, Pb in mmHg.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2.4 Determine the percent leak volume %VL for the signal integration time tSS and for [Delta]Pmax, i.e., the larger of [Delta]Pv or [Delta]Pp, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.004
where 50 = 100% divided by the leak-check time of 2 minutes. 8.2.2.5 Leak volumes in excess of 4 percent of the FTIR system volume VSS are unacceptable.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Detector Linearity. Once an optical configuration is chosen, use one of the procedures of sections 8.3.1 through 8.3.3 to verify that the detector response is linear. If the detector response is not linear, decrease the aperture, or attenuate the infrared beam. After a change in the instrument configuration perform a linearity check until it is demonstrated that the detector response is linear.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.1 Vary the power incident on the detector by modifying the aperture setting. Measure the background and CTS at three instrument aperture settings: (1) at the aperture setting to be used in the testing, (2) at one half this aperture and (3) at twice the proposed testing aperture. Compare the three CTS spectra. CTS band areas shall agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the RMSD noise in the system. If test aperture is the maximum aperture, collect CTS spectrum at maximum aperture, then close the aperture to reduce the IR

throughput by half. Collect a second background and CTS at the smaller aperture setting and compare the spectra again.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.2 Use neutral density filters to attenuate the infrared beam. Set up the FTIR system as it will be used in the test measurements. Collect a CTS spectrum. Use a neutral density filter to attenuate the infrared beam (either immediately after the source or the interferometer) to approximately \1/2\ its original intensity. Collect a second CTS spectrum. Use another filter to attenuate the infrared beam to approximately \1/4\ its original intensity. Collect a third background and CTS spectrum. Compare the CTS spectra. CTS band areas shall agree to within the uncertainty of the cylinder standard and the RMSD noise in the system.</p><p class="depth0">8.3.3 Observe the single beam instrument response in a frequency region where the detector response is known to be zero. Verify that the detector response is ``flat'' and equal to zero in these regions.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Data Storage Requirements. All field test spectra shall be stored on a computer disk and a second backup copy must stored on a separate disk. The stored information includes sample interferograms, processed absorbance spectra, background interferograms, CTS sample interferograms and CTS absorbance spectra. Additionally, documentation of all sample conditions, instrument settings, and test records must be recorded on hard copy or on computer medium. Table 1 gives a sample presentation of documentation.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Background Spectrum. Evacuate the gas cell to 45 mmHg, and fill with dry nitrogen gas to ambient pressure (or purge the cell with 10 volumes of dry nitrogen). Verify that no significant amounts of absorbing species (for example water vapor and CO2) are present. Collect a background spectrum, using a signal averaging period equal to or greater than the averaging period for the sample spectra. Assign a unique file name to the background spectrum. Store two copies of the background interferogram and processed single-beam spectrum on separate computer disks (one copy is the back-up).</p><p class="depth0">8.5.1 Interference Spectra. If possible, collect spectra of known and suspected major interferences using the same optical system that will be used in the field measurements. This can be done on-site or earlier. A number of gases, e.g. CO2, SO2, CO, NH3, are readily available from cylinder gas suppliers.</p><p class="depth0">8.5.2 Water vapor spectra can be prepared by the following procedure. Fill a sample tube with distilled water. Evacuate above the sample and remove dissolved gasses by alternately freezing and thawing the water while evacuating. Allow water vapor into the FTIR cell, then dilute to atmospheric pressure with nitrogen or dry air. If quantitative water spectra are required, follow the reference spectrum procedure for neat samples (protocol, section 4.6). Often, interference spectra need not be quantitative, but for best results the absorbance must be comparable to the interference absorbance in the sample spectra.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 Pre-Test Calibrations</p><p class="depth0">8.6.1 Calibration Transfer Standard. Evacuate the gas cell to 45 mmHg absolute pressure, and fill the FTIR cell to atmospheric pressure with the CTS gas. Alternatively, purge the cell with 10 cell volumes of CTS gas. (If purge is used, verify that the CTS concentration in the cell is stable by collecting two spectra 2 minutes apart as the CTS gas continues to flow. If the absorbance in the second spectrum is no greater than in the first, within the uncertainty of the gas standard, then this can be used as the CTS spectrum.) Record the spectrum.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.2 QA Spike. This procedure assumes that the method has been validated for at least some of the target analytes at the source. For emissions testing perform a QA spike. Use a certified standard, if possible, of an analyte, which has been validated at the source. One analyte standard can serve as a QA surrogate for other analytes which are less reactive or less soluble than the standard. Perform the spike procedure of section 9.2 of this method. Record spectra of at least three independent (section 3.22 of this method) spiked samples. Calculate the spiked component of the analyte concentration. If the average spiked concentration is within 0.7 to 1.3 times the expected concentration, then proceed with the testing. If applicable, apply the correction factor from the Method 301 of this appendix validation test (not the result from the QA spike).</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Sampling. If analyte concentrations vary rapidly with time, continuous sampling is preferable using the smallest cell volume, fastest sampling rate and fastest spectra collection rate possible. Continuous sampling requires the least operator intervention even without an automated sampling system. For continuous monitoring at one location over long periods, Continuous sampling is preferred. Batch sampling and continuous static sampling are used for screening and performing test runs of finite duration. Either technique is preferred for sampling several locations in a matter of days. Batch sampling gives reasonably good time resolution and ensures that each spectrum measures a discreet (and unique) sample volume. Continuous static (and continuous) sampling provide a very stable background over long periods. Like batch sampling, continuous static sampling also ensures that each spectrum measures a unique sample volume. It is essential that the leak check procedure under vacuum (section 8.2 of this method) is passed if the batch sampling procedure is used. It is essential that the leak check procedure

under positive pressure is passed if the continuous static or continuous sampling procedures are used. The sampling techniques are described in sections 8.7.1 through 8.7.2 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.1 Batch Sampling. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 45 mmHg absolute pressure. Fill the cell with exhaust gas to ambient pressure, isolate the cell, and record the spectrum. Before taking the next sample, evacuate the cell until no spectral evidence of sample absorption remains. Repeat this procedure to collect eight spectra of separate samples in 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">8.7.2 Continuous Static Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with 10 cell volumes of sample gas. Isolate the cell, collect the spectrum of the static sample and record the pressure. Before measuring the next sample, purge the cell with 10 more cell volumes of sample gas.</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Sampling QA and Reporting</p><p class="depth0">8.8.1 Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio. Obtain an absorbance spectrum by filling the cell with N2. Measure the RMSD in each analytical region in this absorbance spectrum. Verify that the number of scans used is sufficient to achieve the target MAU.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.2 Assign a unique file name to each spectrum.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.3 Store two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra on separate computer disks.</p><p class="depth0">8.8.4 For each sample spectrum, document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, signal integration time), and the spectral file name. Keep a hard copy of these data sheets.</p><p class="depth0">8.9 Signal Transmittance. While sampling, monitor the signal transmittance. If signal transmittance (relative to the background) changes by 5 percent or more (absorbance = -.02 to .02) in any analytical spectral region, obtain a new background spectrum.</p><p class="depth0">8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run, record another CTS spectrum.</p><p class="depth0">8.11 Post-test QA</p><p class="depth0">8.11.1 Inspect the sample spectra immediately after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was close to the expected (assumed) gas matrix.</p><p class="depth0">8.11.2 Verify that the sampling and instrumental parameters were appropriate for the conditions encountered. For example, if the moisture is much greater than anticipated, it may be necessary to use a shorter path length or dilute the sample.</p><p class="depth0">8.11.3 Compare the pre- and post-test CTS spectra. The peak absorbance in pre- and post-test CTS must be [5 percent of the mean value. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">Use analyte spiking (sections 8.6.2, 9.2 and 13.0 of this method) to verify that the sampling system can transport the analytes from the probe to the FTIR system.</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Spike Materials. Use a certified standard (accurate to [2 percent) of the target analyte, if one can be obtained. If a certified standard cannot be obtained, follow the procedures in section 4.6.2.2 of the FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Spiking Procedure. QA spiking (section 8.6.2 of this method) is a calibration procedure used before testing. QA spiking involves following the spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3 of this method to obtain at least three spiked samples. The analyte concentrations in the spiked samples shall be compared to the expected spike concentration to verify that the sampling/analytical system is working properly. Usually, when QA spiking is used, the method has already been validated at a similar source for the analyte in question. The QA spike demonstrates that the validated sampling/analytical conditions are being duplicated. If the QA spike fails then the sampling/analytical system shall be repaired before testing proceeds. The method validation procedure (section 13.0 of this method) involves a more extensive use of the analyte spike procedure of sections 9.2.1 through 9.2.3 of this method. Spectra of at least 12 independent spiked and 12 independent unspiked samples are recorded. The concentration results are analyzed statistically to determine if there is a systematic bias in the method for measuring a particular analyte. If there is a systematic bias, within the limits allowed by Method 301 of this appendix, then a correction factor shall be applied to the analytical results. If the systematic bias is greater than the allowed limits, this method is not valid and cannot be used.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 Introduce the spike/tracer gas at a constant flow rate of 410 percent of the total sample flow, when possible.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Use the rotameter at the end of the sampling train to estimate the required spike/tracer gas flow rate.</p><p class="depth0">Use a flow device, e.g., mass flow meter ( 2 percent), to monitor the spike flow rate. Record the spike flow rate every 10 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Determine the response time (RT) of the system by continuously collecting spectra of the spiked effluent until the spectrum of the spiked component is constant for 5 minutes. The RT is the interval from the first measurement until the spike becomes constant. Wait for twice the duration of the RT, then collect spectra of two independent spiked gas samples. Duplicate analyses of the spiked concentration shall be within 5 percent of the mean of the two measurements.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3 Calculate the dilution ratio using the tracer gas as follows: where:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.005

The RMSD in the noise must be less than one tenth of the minimum analyte peak absorbance in each analytical region.

Verify the absorbance path length by comparing reference CTS spectra to test CTS spectra. See appendix E of the FTIR Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">10.3 Instrument Resolution.

Evacuate the cell to 45 mmHg. Measure the initial absolute temperature (Ti) and absolute pressure (Pi). Connect a wet test meter (or a calibrated dry gas meter), and slowly draw room air into the cell. Measure the meter volume (Vm), meter absolute temperature (Tm), and meter absolute pressure (Pm); and the cell final absolute temperature (Tf) and absolute pressure (Pf). Calculate the FTIR cell volume VSS, including that of the connecting tubing, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.007</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Data Analysis and Calculations</p><p class="depth0">Analyte concentrations shall be measured using reference spectra from the EPA FTIR spectral library.

Reference spectra can be converted to lower resolution standard spectra (section 3.3 of this method) by truncating the original reference sample and background interferograms. Appendix K of the FTIR Protocol gives specific deresolution procedures. Deresolved spectra shall be transformed using the same apodization function and level of zero filling as the sample spectra.

Various analytical programs are available for relating sample absorbance to a concentration standard. Calculated concentrations shall be verified by analyzing residual baselines after mathematically subtracting scaled reference spectra from the sample spectra. A full description of the data analysis and calculations is contained in the FTIR Protocol (sections 4.0, 5.0, 6.0 and appendices).

The analyte spike procedure of section 9 of this method, the QA spike of section 8.6.2 of this method, and the validation procedure of section 13 of this method are used to evaluate the performance of the sampling system and to quantify sampling system effects, if any, on the measured concentrations. This method is self-validating provided that the results meet the performance requirement of the QA spike in sections 9.0 and 8.6.2 of this method and results from a previous method validation study support the use of this method in the application. Several factors can contribute to uncertainty in the measurement of spiked samples. Factors which can be controlled to provide better accuracy in the spiking procedure are listed in sections 12.2.1 through 12.2.4 of this method.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.1 Flow meter. An accurate mass flow meter is accurate to [1 percent of its span. If a flow of 1 L/min is monitored with such a MFM, which is calibrated in the range of 0-5 L/min, the flow measurement has an uncertainty of 5 percent. This may be improved by re-calibrating the meter at the specific flow rate to be used.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.2 Calibration gas. Usually the calibration standard is certified to within [2 percent. With reactive analytes, such as HCl, the certified accuracy in a commercially available standard may be no better than [5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.3 Temperature. Temperature measurements of the cell shall be quite accurate. If practical, it is preferable to measure sample temperature directly, by inserting a thermocouple into the cell chamber instead of monitoring the cell outer wall temperature.</p><p class="depth0">12.2.4 Pressure. Accuracy depends on the accuracy of the barometer, but fluctuations in pressure throughout a day may be as much as 2.5 percent due to weather variations.</p><p class="depth0">13.0 Method Validation Procedure</p><p class="depth0">This validation procedure, which is based on EPA Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix (A), may be used to validate this method for the analytes in a gas matrix. Validation at one source may also apply to another type of source, if it can be shown that the exhaust gas characteristics are similar at both sources.</p><p class="depth0">13.1 Section 5.3 of Method 301 (40 CFR part 63, appendix A), the Analyte Spike procedure, is used with these modifications.

If process emissions are highly variable, the procedure in section 13.2.3 shall be used.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.1 With a single FTIR instrument and sampling system, begin by collecting spectra of two unspiked samples. Introduce the spike flow into the sampling system and allow 10 cell volumes to purge the sampling system and FTIR cell. Collect spectra of two spiked samples. Turn off the spike and allow 10 cell volumes of unspiked sample to purge the FTIR cell. Repeat this procedure until the 24 (or more) samples are collected.</p><p class="depth0">13.2.2 In batch sampling, collect spectra of 24 distinct samples. (Each distinct sample consists of filling the cell to ambient pressure after the cell has been evacuated.)</p><p class="depth0">13.2.3 Alternatively, a separate probe assembly, line, and sample pump can be used for spiked sample. Verify and document that sampling conditions are the same in both the spiked and the unspiked sampling systems. This can be done by wrapping both sample lines in the same heated bundle. Keep the same flow rate in both sample lines. Measure samples in sequence in pairs. After two spiked samples are measured, evacuate the FTIR cell, and turn the manifold valve so that spiked sample flows to the FTIR cell. Allow the connecting line from the manifold to the FTIR cell to purge thoroughly (the

time depends on the line length and flow rate). Collect a pair of spiked samples. Repeat the procedure until at least 24 measurements are completed.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 Simultaneous Measurements With Two FTIR Systems. If unspiked effluent concentrations of the target analyte(s) vary significantly with time, it may be desirable to perform synchronized measurements of spiked and unspiked sample. Use two FTIR systems, each with its own cell and sampling system to perform simultaneous spiked and unspiked measurements. The optical configurations shall be similar, if possible. The sampling configurations shall be the same. One sampling system and FTIR analyzer shall be used to measure spiked effluent.

Use section 6.3.2.2 of Method 301 of this appendix to evaluate the statistical significance of the bias. If it is determined that the bias is significant, then use section 6.3.3 of Method 301 to calculate a correction factor (CF). Analytical results of the test method are multiplied by the correction factor, if 0.7 4CF 41.3.

In typical method applications the vented sample volume is a small fraction of the source volumetric flow and its composition is identical to that emitted from the source. When analyte spiking is used, spiked pollutants are vented with the extracted sample gas. Approximately 1.6 x 10-4 to 3.2 x 10-4 lbs of a single HAP may be vented to the atmosphere in a typical validation run of 3 hours. (This assumes a molar mass of 50 to 100 g, spike rate of 1.0 L/min, and a standard concentration of 100 ppm). Minimize emissions by keeping the spike flow off when not in use.</p><p class="depth0">15.0 Waste Management</p><p class="depth0">Small volumes of laboratory gas standards can be vented through a laboratory hood.

Addendum to Test Method 320--Protocol for the Use of Extractive Fourier</p><p class="depth0">Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry for the Analyses of Gaseous</p><p class="depth0">Emissions from Stationary Sources</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Introduction</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of this addendum is to set general guidelines for the use of modern FTIR spectroscopic methods for the analysis of gas samples extracted from the effluent of stationary emission sources. This addendum outlines techniques for developing and evaluating such methods and sets basic requirements for reporting and quality assurance procedures.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Nomenclature</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 Appendix A to this addendum lists definitions of the symbols and terms used in this Protocol, many of which have been taken directly from American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) publication E 131-90a, entitled ``Terminology Relating to Molecular Spectroscopy.''</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 Except in the case of background spectra or where otherwise noted, the term ``spectrum'' refers to a double-beam spectrum in units of absorbance vs. wavenumber (cm-1).</p><p class="depth0">1.1.3 The term ``Study'' in this addendum refers to a publication that has been subjected to EPA- or peer-review.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Applicability and Analytical Principle</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Applicability. This Protocol applies to the determination of compound-specific concentrations in single- and multiple-component gas phase samples using double-beam absorption spectroscopy in the mid-infrared band. It does not specifically address other FTIR applications, such as single-beam spectroscopy, analysis of open-path (non-enclosed) samples, and continuous measurement techniques. If multiple spectrometers, absorption cells, or instrumental linewidths are used in such analyses, each distinct operational configuration of the system must be evaluated separately according to this Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Analytical Principle</p><p class="depth0">2.2.1 In the mid-infrared band, most molecules exhibit characteristic gas phase absorption spectra that may be recorded by FTIR systems. Such systems consist of a source of mid-infrared radiation, an interferometer, an enclosed sample cell of known absorption pathlength, an infrared detector, optical elements for the transfer of infrared radiation between components, and gas flow control and measurement components. Adjunct and integral computer systems are used for controlling the instrument, processing the signal, and for performing both Fourier transforms and quantitative analyses of spectral data.</p><p class="depth0">2.2.2 The absorption spectra of pure gases and of mixtures of gases are described by a linear absorbance theory referred to as Beer's Law. Using this law, modern FTIR systems use computerized analytical programs to quantify compounds by comparing the absorption spectra of known (reference) gas samples to the absorption spectrum of the sample gas. Some standard mathematical techniques used for comparisons are classical least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, factor analysis, and partial least squares. Reference A describes several of these techniques, as well as additional techniques, such as differentiation methods, linear baseline corrections, and non-linear absorbance corrections.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 General Principles of Protocol Requirements</p><p class="depth0">The characteristics that distinguish FTIR systems from gas analyzers used in instrumental gas analysis methods (e.g., Methods 6C and 7E of appendix A to part 60 of this chapter) are: (1) Computers are necessary to obtain and analyze data; (2) chemical concentrations can be quantified using previously recorded infrared reference spectra; and (3) analytical assumptions and results, including possible effects of interfering compounds, can be evaluated after the quantitative analysis. The following general principles and requirements of this Protocol are based on these characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Verifiability and Reproducibility of Results. Store all data and document data analysis techniques sufficient to allow an independent agent to reproduce the analytical results from the raw interferometric data.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Transfer of Reference Spectra. To determine whether reference spectra recorded under one set of conditions (e.g., optical bench, instrumental linewidth, absorption pathlength, detector performance, pressure, and temperature) can be used to analyze sample spectra taken under a different set of conditions, quantitatively compare ``calibration transfer standards'' (CTS) and reference spectra as described in this Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">Note: The CTS may, but need not, include analytes of interest). To effect this, record the absorption spectra of the CTS (a) immediately before and immediately after recording reference spectra and (b) immediately after recording sample spectra.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Evaluation of FTIR Analyses. The applicability, accuracy, and precision of FTIR measurements are influenced by a number of interrelated factors, which may be divided into two classes:</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1 Sample-Independent Factors. Examples are system configuration and performance (e.g., detector sensitivity and infrared source output), quality and applicability of reference absorption spectra, and type of mathematical analyses of the spectra. These factors define the fundamental limitations of FTIR measurements for a given system configuration. These limitations may be estimated from evaluations of the system before samples are available. For example, the detection limit for the absorbing compound under a given set of conditions may be estimated from the system noise level and the strength of a particular absorption band. Similarly, the accuracy of measurements may be estimated from the analysis of the reference spectra.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2 Sample-Dependent Factors. Examples are spectral interferants (e.g., water vapor and CO2) or the overlap of spectral features of different compounds and contamination deposits on reflective surfaces or transmitting windows. To maximize the effectiveness of the mathematical techniques used in spectral analysis, identification of interferants (a standard initial step) and analysis of samples (includes effect of other analytical errors) are necessary. Thus, the Protocol requires post-analysis calculation of measurement concentration uncertainties for the detection of these potential sources of measurement error.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Pre-Test Preparations and Evaluations</p><p class="depth0">Before testing, demonstrate the suitability of FTIR spectrometry for the desired application according to the procedures of this section.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Identify Test Requirements. Identify and record the test requirements described in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum. These values set the desired or required goals of the proposed analysis; the description of methods for determining whether these goals are actually met during the analysis comprises the majority of this Protocol.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 Analytes (specific chemical species) of interest. Label the analytes from i = 1 to I.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Analytical uncertainty limit (AUi). The AUi is the maximum permissible fractional uncertainty of analysis for the i\th\ analyte concentration, expressed as a fraction of the analyte concentration in the sample.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3 Required detection limit for each analyte (DLi, ppm). The detection limit is the lowest concentration of an analyte for which its overall fractional uncertainty (OFUi) is required to be less than its analytical uncertainty limit (AUi).</p><p class="depth0">4.1.4 Maximum expected concentration of each analyte (CMAXi, ppm).</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Identify Potential Interferants. Considering the chemistry of the process or results of previous studies, identify potential interferants, i.e., the major effluent constituents and any relatively minor effluent constituents that possess either strong absorption characteristics or strong structural similarities to any analyte of interest. Label them 1 through Nj, where the subscript ``j''

pertains to potential interferants. Estimate the concentrations of these compounds in the effluent (CPOTj, ppm).</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Select and Evaluate the Sampling System. Considering the source, e.g., temperature and pressure profiles, moisture content, analyte characteristics, and particulate concentration), select the equipment for extracting gas samples. Recommended are a particulate filter, heating system to maintain sample temperature above the dew point for all sample constituents at all points within the sampling system (including the filter), and sample conditioning system (e.g., coolers, water-permeable membranes that remove water or other compounds from the sample, and dilution devices) to remove spectral interferants or to protect the sampling and analytical components. Determine the minimum absolute sample system pressure (Pmin, mmHg) and the infrared absorption cell volume (VSS, liter). Select the techniques and/or equipment for the measurement of sample pressures and temperatures.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Select Spectroscopic System. Select a spectroscopic configuration for the application. Approximate the absorption pathlength (LS', meter), sample pressure (PS', kPa), absolute sample temperature TS', and signal integration period (tSS, seconds) for the analysis. Specify the nominal minimum instrumental linewidth (MIL) of the system. Verify that the fractional error at the approximate values PS' and TS' is less than one half the smallest value AUi (see section 4.1.2 of this addendum).</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Select Calibration Transfer Standards (CTS's). Select CTS's that meet the criteria listed in sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, and 4.5.3 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">Note: It may be necessary to choose preliminary analytical regions (see section 4.7 of this addendum), identify the minimum analyte linewidths, or estimate the system noise level (see section 4.12 of this addendum) before selecting the CTS. More than one compound may be needed to meet the criteria; if so, obtain separate cylinders for each compound.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.1 The central wavenumber position of each analytical region shall lie within 25 percent of the wavenumber position of at least one CTS absorption band.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.2 The absorption bands in section 4.5.1 of this addendum shall exhibit peak absorbances greater than ten times the value RMSEST (see section 4.12 of this addendum) but less than 1.5 absorbance units.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.3 At least one absorption CTS band within the operating range of the FTIR instrument shall have an instrument-independent linewidth no greater than the narrowest analyte absorption band. Perform and document measurements or cite Studies to determine analyte and CTS compound linewidths.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.4 For each analytical region, specify the upper and lower wavenumber positions (FFUm and FFLm, respectively) that bracket the CTS absorption band or bands for the associated analytical region. Specify the wavenumber range, FNU to FNL, containing the absorption band that meets the criterion of section 4.5.3 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">4.5.5 Associate, whenever possible, a single set of CTS gas cylinders with a set of reference spectra. Replacement CTS gas cylinders shall contain the same compounds at concentrations within 5 percent of that of the original CTS cylinders; the entire absorption spectra (not individual spectral segments) of the replacement gas shall be scaled by a factor between 0.95 and 1.05 to match the original CTS spectra.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Prepare Reference Spectra</p><p class="depth0">Note: Reference spectra are available in a permanent soft copy from the EPA spectral library on the EMTIC (Emission Measurement Technical Information Center) computer bulletin board; they may be used if applicable.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.1 Select the reference absorption pathlength (LR) of the cell.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.2 Obtain or prepare a set of chemical standards for each analyte, potential and known spectral interferants, and CTS. Select the concentrations of the chemical standards to correspond to the top of the desired range.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.2.1 Commercially-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards for many compounds may be obtained from independent sources, such as a specialty gas manufacturer, chemical company, or commercial laboratory. These standards (accurate to within [2 percent) shall be prepared according to EPA Traceability Protocol (see Reference D) or shall be traceable to NIST standards. Obtain from the supplier an estimate of the stability of the analyte concentration. Obtain and follow all of the supplier's recommendations for recertifying the analyte concentration.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.2.2 Self-Prepared Chemical Standards. Chemical standards may be prepared by diluting certified commercially prepared chemical gases or pure analytes with ultra-pure carrier (UPC) grade nitrogen according to the barometric and volumetric techniques generally described in Reference A, section A4.6.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.3 Record a set of the absorption spectra of the CTS {R1{time} , then a set of the reference spectra at two or more concentrations in duplicate over the desired range (the top of the range must be less than 10 times that of the bottom), followed by a second set of CTS spectra {R2{time} . (If self-prepared standards are used, see section 4.6.5 of this addendum before disposing of any of the standards.) The maximum accepted standard concentration-pathlength product (ASCPP) for each compound shall be higher than the

maximum estimated concentration-pathlength products for both analytes and known interferants in the effluent gas. For each analyte, the minimum ASCPP shall be no greater than ten times the concentration-pathlength product of that analyte at its required detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.4 Permanently store the background and interferograms in digitized form. Document details of the mathematical process for generating the spectra from these interferograms. Record the sample pressure (PR), sample temperature (TR), reference absorption pathlength (LR), and interferogram signal integration period (tSR). Signal integration periods for the background interferograms shall be "tSR. Values of PR, LR, and tSR shall not deviate by more than [1 percent from the time of recording [R1] to that of recording [R2].</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5 If self-prepared chemical standards are employed and spectra of only two concentrations are recorded for one or more compounds, verify the accuracy of the dilution technique by analyzing the prepared standards for those compounds with a secondary (non-FTIR) technique in accordance with sections 4.6.5.1 through 4.6.5.4 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5.1 Record the response of the secondary technique to each of the four standards prepared.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5.2 Perform a linear regression of the response values (dependant variable) versus the accepted standard concentration (ASC) values (independent variable), with the regression constrained to pass through the zero-response, zero ASC point.</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5.3 Calculate the average fractional difference between the actual response values and the regression-predicted values (those calculated from the regression line using the four ASC values as the independent variable).</p><p class="depth0">4.6.5.4 If the average fractional difference value calculated in section 4.6.5.3 of this addendum is larger for any compound than the corresponding AUi, the dilution technique is not sufficiently accurate and the reference spectra prepared are not valid for the analysis.</p><p class="depth0">4.7 Select Analytical Regions. Using the general considerations in section 7 of Reference A and the spectral characteristics of the analytes and interferants, select the analytical regions for the application. Label them m = 1 to M. Specify the lower, center and upper wavenumber positions of each analytical region (FLm, FCm, and FUm, respectively). Specify the analytes and interferants which exhibit absorption in each region.</p><p class="depth0">4.8 Determine Fractional Reproducibility Uncertainties. Using appendix E of this addendum, calculate the fractional reproducibility uncertainty for each analyte (FRUi) from a comparison of [R1] and [R2]. If FRUi >AUi for any analyte, the reference spectra generated in accordance with section 4.6 of this addendum are not valid for the application.</p><p class="depth0">4.9 Identify Known Interferants. Using appendix B of this addendum, determine which potential interferants affect the analyte concentration determinations. Relabel these potential interferant as ``known'' interferants, and designate these compounds from k = 1 to K. Appendix B to this addendum also provides criteria for determining whether the selected analytical regions are suitable.</p><p class="depth0">4.10 Prepare Computerized Analytical Programs</p><p class="depth0">4.10.1 Choose or devise mathematical techniques (e.g, classical least squares, inverse least squares, cross-correlation, and factor analysis) based on equation 4 of Reference A that are appropriate for analyzing spectral data by comparison with reference spectra.</p><p class="depth0">4.10.2 Following the general recommendations of Reference A, prepare a computer program or set of programs that analyzes all of the analytes and known interferants, based on the selected analytical regions (section 4.7 of this addendum) and the prepared reference spectra (section 4.6 of this addendum). Specify the baseline correction technique (e.g., determining the slope and intercept of a linear baseline contribution in each analytical region) for each analytical region, including all relevant wavenumber positions.</p><p class="depth0">4.10.3 Use programs that provide as output [at the reference absorption pathlength (LR), reference gas temperature (TR), and reference gas pressure (PR)] the analyte concentrations, the known interferant concentrations, and the baseline slope and intercept values. If the sample absorption pathlength (LS), sample gas temperature (TS), or sample gas pressure (PS) during the actual sample analyses differ from LR, TR, and PR, use a program or set of programs that applies multiplicative corrections to the derived concentrations to account for these variations, and that provides as output both the corrected and uncorrected values. Include in the report of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) the details of any transformations applied to the original reference spectra (e.g., differentiation), in such a fashion that all analytical results may be verified by an independent agent from the reference spectra and data spectra alone.</p><p class="depth0">4.11 Determine the Fractional Calibration Uncertainty. Calculate the fractional calibration uncertainty for each analyte (FCUi) according to appendix F of this addendum, and compare these values to the fractional uncertainty limits (AUi; see section 4.1.2 of this addendum). If FCUi >AUi, either the reference spectra or analytical programs for that analyte are unsuitable.</p><p class="depth0">4.12 Verify System Configuration Suitability. Using appendix C of this addendum, measure or obtain estimates of the noise level (RMSEST, absorbance) of the FTIR system.

Alternatively, construct the complete spectrometer system and determine the values RMSSm using appendix G of this addendum. Estimate the minimum measurement uncertainty for each analyte (MAUi, ppm) and known interferant (MIUk, ppm) using appendix D of this addendum. Verify that (a) MAUi <(AUi)(DLi), FRUi i, and FCUi i for each analyte and that (b) the CTS chosen meets the requirements listed in sections 4.5.1 through 4.5.5 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Sampling and Analysis Procedure</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Analysis System Assembly and Leak-Test. Assemble the analysis system. Allow sufficient time for all system components to reach the desired temperature. Then, determine the leak-rate (LR) and leak volume (VL), where VL = LR tSS. Leak volumes shall be 44 percent of VSS.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Verify Instrumental Performance. Measure the noise level of the system in each analytical region using the procedure of appendix G of this addendum. If any noise level is higher than that estimated for the system in section 4.12 of this addendum, repeat the calculations of appendix D of this addendum and verify that the requirements of section 4.12 of this addendum are met; if they are not, adjust or repair the instrument and repeat this section.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Determine the Sample Absorption Pathlength</p><p class="depth0">Record a background spectrum. Then, fill the absorption cell with CTS at the pressure PR and record a set of CTS spectra [R3]. Store the background and unscaled CTS single beam interferograms and spectra. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the sample absorption pathlength (LS) for each analytical region. The values LS shall not differ from the approximated sample pathlength LS' (see section 4.4 of this addendum) by more than 5 percent.</p><p class="depth0">5.4 Record Sample Spectrum. Connect the sample line to the source. Either evacuate the absorption cell to an absolute pressure below 5 mmHg before extracting a sample from the effluent stream into the absorption cell, or pump at least ten cell volumes of sample through the cell before obtaining a sample. Record the sample pressure PS. Generate the absorbance spectrum of the sample. Store the background and sample single beam interferograms, and document the process by which the absorbance spectra are generated from these data. (If necessary, apply the spectral transformations developed in section 5.6.2 of this addendum). The resulting sample spectrum is referred to below as SS.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Multiple sample spectra may be recorded according to the procedures of section 5.4 of this addendum before performing sections 5.5 and 5.6 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">5.5 Quantify Analyte Concentrations. Calculate the unscaled analyte concentrations RUAi and unscaled interferant concentrations RUIK using the programs developed in section 4 of this addendum. To correct for pathlength and pressure variations between the reference and sample spectra, calculate the scaling factor, RLPS using equation A.1,[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.012
Calculate the final analyte and interferant concentrations RSAi and RSIk using equations A.2 and A.3,[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.013
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR14JN99.014</p><p class="depth0">5.6 Determine Fractional Analysis Uncertainty. Fill the absorption cell with CTS at the pressure PS. Record a set of CTS spectra [R4]. Store the background and CTS single beam interferograms. Using appendix H of this addendum, calculate the fractional analysis uncertainty (FAU) for each analytical region. If the FAU indicated for any analytical region is greater than the required accuracy requirements determined in sections 4.1.1 through 4.1.4 of this addendum, then comparisons to previously recorded reference spectra are invalid in that analytical region, and the analyst shall perform one or both of the procedures of sections 5.6.1 through 5.6.2 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">5.6.1 Perform instrumental checks and adjust the instrument to restore its performance to acceptable levels. If adjustments are made, repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except for the recording of a sample spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to demonstrate that acceptable uncertainties are obtained in all analytical regions.</p><p class="depth0">5.6.2 Apply appropriate mathematical transformations (e.g., frequency shifting, zero-filling, apodization, smoothing) to the spectra (or to the interferograms upon which the spectra are based) generated during the performance of the procedures of section 5.3 of this addendum. Document these transformations and their reproducibility. Do not apply multiplicative scaling of the spectra, or any set of transformations that is mathematically equivalent to multiplicative scaling. Different transformations may be applied to different analytical regions. Frequency shifts shall be less than one-half the minimum instrumental linewidth, and must be applied to all spectral data points in an analytical region. The mathematical transformations may be retained for the analysis if they are also applied to the appropriate analytical regions of all sample spectra recorded, and if all original sample spectra are digitally stored. Repeat sections 5.3, 5.4 (except the recording of a sample spectrum), and 5.5 of this addendum to demonstrate

that these transformations lead to acceptable calculated concentration uncertainties in all analytical regions.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Post-Analysis Evaluations</p><p class="depth0">Estimate the overall accuracy of the analyses performed in accordance with sections 5.1 through 5.6 of this addendum using the procedures of sections 6.1 through 6.3 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Qualitatively Confirm the Assumed Matrix. Examine each analytical region of the sample spectrum for spectral evidence of unexpected or unidentified interferants. If found, identify the interfering compounds (see Reference C for guidance) and add them to the list of known interferants. Repeat the procedures of section 4 of this addendum to include the interferants in the uncertainty calculations and analysis procedures. Verify that the MAU and FCU values do not increase beyond acceptable levels for the application requirements. Re-calculate the analyte concentrations (section 5.5 of this addendum) in the affected analytical regions.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Quantitatively Evaluate Fractional Model Uncertainty (FMU). Perform the procedures of either section 6.2.1 or 6.2.2 of this addendum:</p><p class="depth0">6.2.1 Using appendix I of this addendum, determine the fractional model error (FMU) for each analyte.</p><p class="depth0">6.2.2 Provide statistically determined uncertainties FMU for each analyte which are equivalent to two standard deviations at the 95 percent confidence level. Such determinations, if employed, must be based on mathematical examinations of the pertinent sample spectra (not the reference spectra alone). Include in the report of the analysis (see section 7.0 of this addendum) a complete description of the determination of the concentration uncertainties.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Estimate Overall Concentration Uncertainty (OCU). Using appendix J of this addendum, determine the overall concentration uncertainty (OCU) for each analyte. If the OCU is larger than the required accuracy for any analyte, repeat sections 4 and 6 of this addendum.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reporting Requirements

A procedure for analyte spiking is included for quality assurance. This method is considered to be self validating provided that the requirements listed in section 9 of this method are followed. The analytical procedures for interpreting infrared spectra from emission measurements are described in the ``Protocol For The Use of Extractive

Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectrometry in Analyses of Gaseous Emissions From Stationary Industrial Sources'', included as an addendum to proposed Method 320 of this appendix (hereafter referred to as the ``FTIR Protocol)''. References 1 and 2 describe the use of FTIR spectrometry in field measurements. Sample transport presents the principal difficulty in directly measuring HCl emissions. This identical problem must be overcome by any extractive measurement method. HCl is reactive and water soluble.

This method can be applied to the determination of HCl concentrations both before and after particulate matter control devices installed at portland cement manufacturing facilities. This method applies to either continuous flow through measurement (with isolated sample analysis) or grab sampling (batch analysis). HCl is measured using the mid-infrared spectral region for analysis (about 400 to 4000 cm-1 or 25 to 2.5 m).

For practical purposes there is no upper limit to the range because the pathlength may be reduced or the sample may be diluted. The lower detection range depends on (1) the absorption coefficient of the compound in the analytical frequency region, (2) the spectral resolution, (3) the interferometer sampling time, (4) the detector sensitivity and response, and (5) the absorption pathlength.</p><p class="depth0">1.3.2 The practical lower quantification range is usually higher than that indicated by the instrument performance in the laboratory, and is dependent upon (1) the presence of interfering species in the exhaust gas (notably H2O), (2) the optical alignment of the gas cell and transfer optics, and (3) the quality of the reflective surfaces in the cell (cell throughput). Under typical test conditions (moisture content of up to 30 percent, 10 meter absorption path length, liquid nitrogen-cooled IR detector, 0.5 cm-1 resolution, and an interferometer sampling time of 60 seconds) a typical lower quantification range for HCl is 0.1 to 1.0 ppm.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Data Quality Objectives</p><p class="depth0">1.4.1 In designing or configuring the analytical system, data quality is determined by measuring of the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the absorbance values within a chosen spectral (analytical) region. The RMSD provides an indication of the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of the spectral baseline. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol (the addendum to Method 320 of this appendix) presents a discussion of the relationship between the RMSD, lower detection limit, DLi, and analytical uncertainty, AUi. It is important to consider the target analyte quantification limit when performing testing with FTIR instrumentation, and to optimize the system to achieve the desired detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">1.4.2 Data quality is determined by measuring the root mean square (RMS) noise level in each analytical spectral region (appendix C of the FTIR Protocol). The RMS noise is defined as the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the absorbance values in an analytical region from the mean absorbance value in the same region. Appendix D of the FTIR Protocol defines the minimum analyte uncertainty (MAU), and how the RMSD is used to calculate the MAU. The MAUim is the minimum concentration of the ith analyte in the mth analytical region for which the analytical uncertainty limit can be maintained.

HCl can also undergo rotation transitions by absorbing energy in the far-infrared spectral region. The rotational transitions are superimposed on the vibrational fundamental to give a series of lines centered at the fundamental vibrational frequency, 2885 cm-\1\. The frequencies of absorbance and the pattern of rotational/vibrational lines are unique to HCl. When this distinct pattern is observed in an infrared spectrum of an unknown sample, it unequivocally identifies HCl as a component of the mixture. The infrared spectrum of HCl is very distinctive and cannot be confused with the spectrum of any other compound. See Reference 6.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Sampling and Analysis.

For measuring HCl the first (sampling) consideration is more critical. Spectral interference from water vapor is not a significant problem except at very high moisture levels and low HCl concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Analytical Interferences.

Water vapor can present spectral interference for FTIR gas analysis of HCl. Therefore, the water vapor in the spectra of kiln gas samples must be accounted for. This means preparing at least one spectrum of a water vapor sample where the moisture concentration is close to that in the kiln gas.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Sampling System Interferences. The principal sampling system interferant for measuring HCl is water vapor. Steps must be taken to ensure that no condensation forms anywhere in the probe assembly, sample lines, or analytical instrumentation. Cold spots anywhere in the sampling system must be avoided. The extent of sampling system bias in the FTIR analysis of HCl depends on concentrations of potential interferants, moisture content of the gas stream, temperature of the gas stream, temperature of sampling system components, sample flow rate, and reactivity of HCl with other species in the gas stream (e.g., ammonia). For measuring HCl in a wet gas stream the temperatures of the gas stream, sampling components, and the sample flow rate are of primary importance. Analyte spiking with HCl is performed to demonstrate the integrity of the sampling system for transporting HCl vapor in the flue gas to the FTIR instrument.

An extractive system maintained at 180 C (360 F) or higher which is capable of directing a total flow of at least 12 L/min to the sample cell is required (References 1 and 2). Insert the probe into the duct or stack at a point representing the average volumetric flow rate and 25 percent of the cross sectional area. Co-locate an appropriate flow monitoring device with the sample probe so that the flow rate is recorded at specified time intervals during emission testing (e.g., differential pressure measurements taken every 10 minutes during each run).</p><p class="depth0">8.6.2 Batch Samples. Evacuate the absorbance cell to 5 Torr (or less) absolute pressure before taking first sample. Fill the cell with kiln gas to ambient pressure and record the infrared spectrum, then evacuate the cell until there is no further evidence of infrared absorption. Repeat this procedure, collecting a total of six separate sample spectra within a 1-hour period.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.3 Continuous Flow Through Sampling. Purge the FTIR cell with kiln gas for a time period sufficient to equilibrate the entire sampling system and FTIR gas cell. The time required is a function of the mechanical response time of the system (determined by performing the system calibration with the CTS gas or equivalent), and by the chemical reactivity of the target analytes. If the effluent target analyte concentration is not variable, observation of the spectral up-date of the flowing gas sample should be performed until equilibration of the sample is achieved. Isolate the gas cell from the sample flow by directing the purge flow to vent. Record the spectrum and pressure of the sample gas. After spectral acquisition, allow the sample gas to purge the cell with at least three volumes of kiln gas. The time required to adequately purge the cell with the required volume of gas is a function of (1) cell volume, (2) flow rate through the cell, and (3) cell design. It is important that the gas introduction and vent for the FTIR cell provides a complete purge through the cell.</p><p class="depth0">8.6.4 Continuous Sampling. In some cases it is possible to collect spectra continuously while the FTIR cell is purged with sample gas. The sample integration time, tss, the sample flow rate through the gas cell, and the sample integration time must be chosen so that the collected data consist of at least 10 spectra with each spectrum being of a separate cell volume of flue gas. Sampling in this manner may only be performed if the native source analyte concentrations do not affect the test results.</p><p class="depth0">8.7 Sample Conditioning</p><p class="depth0">8.7.1 High Moisture Sampling. Kiln gas emitted from wet process cement kilns may contain 3- to 40 percent moisture. Zinc selenide windows or the equivalent should be used when attempting to analyze hot/wet kiln gas under these conditions to prevent dissolution of water soluble window materials (e.g., KBr).</p><p class="depth0">8.7.2 Sample Dilution. The sample may be diluted using an in-stack dilution probe, or an external dilution device provided that the sample is not diluted below the instrument's quantification range. As an alternative to using a dilution probe, nitrogen may be dynamically spiked into the effluent stream in the same manner as analyte spiking. A constant dilution rate shall be maintained throughout the measurement process. It is critical to measure and verify the exact dilution ratio when using a dilution probe or the nitrogen spiking approach. Calibrating the system with a calibration gas containing an appropriate tracer compound will allow determination of the dilution ratio for most measurement systems. The tester shall specify the procedures used to determine the dilution ratio, and include these calibration results in the report.</p><p class="depth0">8.8 Sampling QA, Data Storage and Reporting. See the FTIR Protocol. Sample integration times shall be sufficient to achieve the required signal-to-noise ratio, and all sample spectra should have unique file names. Two copies of sample interferograms and processed spectra will be stored on separate computer media. For each sample spectrum the analyst must document the sampling conditions, the sampling time (while the cell was being filled), the time the spectrum was recorded, the instrumental conditions (path length, temperature, pressure, resolution, integration time), and the spectral file name. A hard copy of these data must be maintained until the test results are accepted.</p><p class="depth0">8.9 Signal Transmittance. Monitor the signal transmittance through the instrumental system. If signal transmittance (relative to the background) drops below 95 percent in any spectral region where the sample does not absorb infrared energy, then a new background spectrum must be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">8.10 Post-test CTS. After the sampling run completion, record the CTS spectrum. Analysis of the spectral band area used for quantification from pre- and post-test CTS spectra should agree to within [5 percent or corrective action must be taken.</p><p class="depth0">8.11 Post-test QA. The sample spectra shall be inspected immediately after the run to verify that the gas matrix composition was

close to the assumed gas matrix, (this is necessary to account for the concentrations of the interferants for use in the analytical analysis programs), and to confirm that the sampling and instrumental parameters were appropriate for the conditions encountered.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">Use analyte spiking to verify the effectiveness of the sampling system for the target compounds in the actual kiln gas matrix. QA spiking shall be performed before and after each sample run. QA spiking shall be performed after the pre- and post-test CTS direct and system calibrations. The system biases calculated from the pre- and post-test dynamic analyte spiking shall be within [30 percent for the spiked surrogate analytes for the measurements to be considered valid. See sections 9.3.1 through 9.3.2 for the requisite calculations. Measurement of the undiluted spike (direct-to-cell measurement) involves sending dry, spike gas to the FTIR cell, filling the cell to 1 atmosphere and obtaining the spectrum of this sample. The direct-to-cell measurement should be performed before each analyte spike so that the recovery of the dynamically spiked analytes may be calculated. Analyte spiking is only effective for assessing the integrity of the sampling system when the concentration of HCl in the source does not vary substantially. Any attempt to quantify an analyte recovery in a variable concentration matrix will result in errors in the expected concentration of the spiked sample. If the kiln gas target analyte concentrations vary by more than [5 percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is greater) in the time required to acquire a sample spectrum, it may be necessary to: (1) Use a dual sample probe approach, (2) use two independent FTIR measurement systems, (3) use alternate QA/QC procedures, or (4) postpone testing until stable emission concentrations are achieved. (See section 9.2.3 of this method). It is recommended that a laboratory evaluation be performed before attempting to employ this method under actual field conditions. The laboratory evaluation shall include (1) performance of all applicable calculations in section 4 of the FTIR Protocol; (2) simulated analyte spiking experiments in dry (ambient) and humidified sample matrices using HCl; and (3) performance of bias (recovery) calculations from analyte spiking experiments. It is not necessary to perform a laboratory evaluation before every field test. The purpose of the laboratory study is to demonstrate that the actual instrument and sampling system configuration used in field testing meets the requirements set forth in this method.</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Spike Materials. Perform analyte spiking with an HCl standard to demonstrate the integrity of the sampling system.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.1 An HCl standard of approximately 50 ppm in a balance of ultra pure nitrogen is recommended. The SF6 (tracer) concentration shall be 2 to 5 ppm depending upon the measurement pathlength. The spike ratio (spike flow/total flow) shall be no greater than 1:10, and an ideal spike concentration should approximate the native effluent concentration.</p><p class="depth0">9.1.2 The ideal spike concentration may not be achieved because the target concentration cannot be accurately predicted prior to the field test, and limited calibration standards will be available during testing. Therefore, practical constraints must be applied that allow the tester to spike at an anticipated concentration. For these tests, the analyte concentration contributed by the HCl standard spike should be 1 to 5 ppm or should more closely approximate the native concentration if it is greater.</p><p class="depth0">9.2 Spike Procedure</p><p class="depth0">9.2.1 A spiking/sampling apparatus is shown in Figure 2. Introduce the spike/tracer gas mixture at a constant flow ([2 percent) rate at approximately 10 percent of the total sample flow. (For example, introduce the surrogate spike at 1 L/min 20 cc/min, into a total sample flow rate of 10 L/min). The spike must be pre-heated before introduction into the sample matrix to prevent a localized condensation of the gas stream at the spike introduction point. A heated sample transport line(s) containing multiple transport tubes within the heated bundle may be used to spike gas up through the sampling system to the spike introduction point. Use a calibrated flow device (e.g., mass flow meter/controller), to monitor the spike flow as indicated by a calibrated flow meter or controller, or alternately, the SF6 tracer ratio may be calculated from the direct measurement and the diluted measurement. It is often desirable to use the tracer approach in calculating the spike/total flow ratio because of the difficulty in accurately measuring hot/wet total flow. The tracer technique has been successfully used in past validation efforts (Reference 1).</p><p class="depth0">9.2.2 Perform a direct-to-cell measurement of the dry, undiluted spike gas. Introduce the spike directly to the FTIR cell, bypassing the sampling system. Fill cell to 1 atmosphere and collect the spectrum of this sample. Ensure that the spike gas has equilibrated to the temperature of the measurement cell before acquisition of the spectra. Inspect the spectrum and verify that the gas is dry and contains negligible CO2. Repeat the process to obtain a second direct-to-cell measurement. Analysis of spectral band areas for HCl from these duplicate measurements should agree to within [5 percent of the mean.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3 Analyte Spiking. Determine whether the kiln gas contains native concentrations

of HCl by examination of preliminary spectra. Determine whether the concentration varies significantly with time by observing a continuously up-dated spectrum of sample gas in the flow-through sampling mode. If the concentration varies by more than [5 percent during the period of time required to acquire a spectra, then an alternate approach should be used. One alternate approach uses two sampling lines to convey sample to the gas distribution manifold. One of the sample lines is used to continuously extract unspiked kiln gas from the source. The other sample line serves as the analyte spike line. One FTIR system can be used in this arrangement. Spiked or unspiked sample gas may be directed to the FTIR system from the gas distribution manifold, with the need to purge only the components between the manifold and the FTIR system. This approach minimizes the time required to acquire an equilibrated sample of spiked or unspiked kiln gas. If the source varies by more than [5 percent (or 5 ppm, whichever is greater) in the time it takes to switch from the unspiked sample line to the spiked sample line, then analyte spiking may not be a feasible means to determine the effectiveness of the sampling system for the HCl in the sample matrix. A second alternative is to use two completely independent FTIR measurement systems. One system would measure unspiked samples while the other system would measure the spiked samples. As a last option, (where no other alternatives can be used) a humidified nitrogen stream may be generated in the field which approximates the moisture content of the kiln gas. Analyte spiking into this humidified stream can be employed to assure that the sampling system is adequate for transporting the HCl to the FTIR instrumentation.</p><p class="depth0">9.2.3.1 Adjust the spike flow rate to approximately 10 percent of the total flow by metering spike gas through a calibrated mass flowmeter or controller. Allow spike flow to equilibrate within the sampling system before analyzing the first spiked kiln gas samples. A minimum of two consecutive spikes are required.

Method 323--Measurement of Formaldehyde Emissions From Natural Gas-Fired</p><p class="depth0">Stationary Sources--Acetyl Acetone Derivitization Method</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Introduction. This method describes the sampling and analysis procedures of the acetyl acetone colorimetric method for measuring formaldehyde emissions in the exhaust of natural gas-fired, stationary combustion sources. This method, which was prepared by the Gas Research Institute (GRI), is based on the Chilled Impinger Train Method for Methanol, Acetone, Acetaldehyde, Methyl Ethyl Ketone, and Formaldehyde (Technical Bulletin No. 684) developed and published by the National Council of the Paper Industry for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc. (NCASI). However, this method has been prepared specifically for formaldehyde and does not include specifications (e.g., equipment and supplies) and procedures (e.g., sampling and analytical) for methanol, acetone, acetaldehyde, and methyl ethyl ketone. To obtain reliable results, persons using this method should have a thorough knowledge of at least Methods 1 and 2 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-1; Method 3 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-2; and Method 4 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A-3.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">1.1.1 Analytes. The only analyte measured by this method is formaldehyde (CAS Number 50-00-0).</p><p class="depth0">1.1.2 Applicability. This method is for analyzing formaldehyde emissions from uncontrolled and controlled natural gas-fired, stationary combustion sources.</p><p class="depth0">1.1.3 Data Quality Objectives. If you adhere to the quality control and quality assurance requirements of this method, then you and future users of your data will be able to assess the quality of the data you obtain and estimate the uncertainty in the measurements.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method. An emission sample from the combustion exhaust is drawn through a midget impinger train containing chilled reagent water to absorb formaldehyde. The formaldehyde concentration in the impinger is determined by reaction with acetyl acetone to form a colored derivative which is measured colorimetrically.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">[Reserved]</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences. The presence of acetaldehyde, amines, polymers of formaldehyde, periodate, and sulfites can cause interferences with the acetyl acetone procedure which is used to determine the formaldehyde concentration. However, based on experience gained from extensive testing of natural gas-fired combustion sources using FTIR to measure a variety of compounds, GRI expects only acetaldehyde to be potentially present when combusting natural gas. Acetaldehyde has been reported to be a significant interference only when present at concentrations above 50 ppmv. However, GRI reports that the concentration of acetaldehyde from gas-fired sources is very low (typically below the FTIR detection limit of around 0.5 ppmv); therefore, the potential positive bias due to acetaldehyde interference is expected to be negligible.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 Prior to applying the method in the field, a site-specific Health and Safety Plan should be prepared. General safety precautions include the use of steel-toed boots, safety glasses, hard hats, and work gloves. In certain cases, facility policy may require the use of fire-resistant clothing while on-site. Since the method involves testing at high-temperature sampling locations, precautions must be taken to limit the potential for exposure to high-temperature gases and surfaces while inserting or removing the sample probe. In warm locations, precautions must also be taken to avoid dehydration.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Potential chemical hazards associated with sampling include formaldehyde, nitrogen oxides (NOX), and carbon monoxide (CO). Formalin solution, used for field spiking, is an aqueous solution containing formaldehyde and methanol. Formaldehyde is a skin, eye, and respiratory irritant and a carcinogen, and should be handled accordingly. Eye and skin contact and inhalation of formaldehyde vapors should be avoided. Natural gas-fired combustion sources can potentially emit CO at toxic concentrations. Care should be taken to minimize exposure to the sample gas while inserting or removing the sample probe. If the work area is enclosed, personal CO monitors should be used to insure that the concentration of CO in the work area is maintained at safe levels.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 Potential chemical hazards associated with the analytical procedures include acetyl acetone and glacial acetic acid. Acetyl acetone is an irritant to the skin and respiratory system, as well as being moderately toxic. Glacial acetic acid is highly corrosive and is an irritant to the skin, eyes, and respiratory system. Eye and skin contact and inhalation of vapors should be avoided. Acetyl acetone and glacial acetic acid have flash points of 41 C (105.8 F) and 43 C (109.4 F), respectively. Exposure to heat or flame should be avoided.</p><p class="depth0">6.0 Equipment and Supplies</p><p class="depth0">6.1 Sampling Probe. Quartz glass probe with stainless steel sheath or stainless steel probe.</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Teflon Tubing. Teflon tubing to connect the sample probe to the impinger train. A heated sample line is not needed since the sample transfer system is rinsed to recover

condensed formaldehyde and the rinsate combined with the impinger contents prior to sample analysis.</p><p class="depth0">6.3 Midget Impingers. Three midget impingers are required for sample collection. The first impinger serves as a moisture knockout, the second impinger contains 20 mL of reagent water, and the third impinger contains silica gel to remove residual moisture from the sample prior to the dry gas meter.</p><p class="depth0">6.4 Vacuum Pump. Vacuum pump capable of delivering a controlled extraction flow rate between 0.2 and 0.4 L/min.</p><p class="depth0">6.5 Flow Measurement Device. A rotameter or other flow measurement device is required to indicate consistent sample flow.</p><p class="depth0">6.6 Dry Gas Meter. A dry gas meter is used to measure the total sample volume collected. The dry gas meter must be sufficiently accurate to measure the sample volume to within 2 percent, calibrated at the selected flow rate and conditions actually encountered during sampling, and equipped with a temperature sensor (dial thermometer, or equivalent) capable of measuring temperature accurately to within 3 C (5.4 F).</p><p class="depth0">6.7 Spectrophotometer. A spectrophotometer is required for formaldehyde analysis, and must be capable of measuring absorbance at 412 nm.</p><p class="depth0">7.0 Reagents and Standards</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Sampling Reagents</p><p class="depth0">7.1.1 Reagent water. Deionized, distilled, organic-free water. This water is used as the capture solution, for rinsing the sample probe, sample line, and impingers at the completion of the sampling run, in reagent dilutions, and in blanks.</p><p class="depth0">7.1.2 Ice. Ice is necessary to pack around the impingers during sampling in order to keep the impingers cold. Ice is also needed for sample transport and storage.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Analysis</p><p class="depth0">7.2.1 Acetyl acetone Reagent. Prepare the acetyl acetone reagent by dissolving 15.4 g of ammonium acetate in 50 mL of reagent water in a 100-mL volumetric flask. To this solution, add 0.20 mL of acetyl acetone and 0.30 mL of glacial acetic acid. Mix the solution thoroughly, then dilute to 100 mL with reagent water. The solution can be stored in a brown glass bottle in the refrigerator, and is stable for at least two weeks.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.2 Formaldehyde. Reagent grade.</p><p class="depth0">7.2.3 Ammonium Acetate</p><p class="depth0">7.2.4 Glacial Acetic Acid</p><p class="depth0">8.0 Sample Collection, Preservation, Storage, and Transport</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Pre-test</p><p class="depth0">8.1.1 Collect information about the site characteristics such as exhaust pipe diameter, gas flow rates, port location, access to ports, and safety requirements during a pre-test site survey. You should then decide the sample collection period per run and the target sample flow rate based on your best estimate of the formaldehyde concentration likely to be present. You want to assure that sufficient formaldehyde is captured in the impinger solution so that it can be measured precisely by the spectrophotometer. You may use Equation 323-1 to design your test program. As a guideline for optimum performance, if you can, design your test so that the liquid concentration (Cl) is approximately 10 times the assumed spectrophotometer detection limit of 0.2 g/mL. However, since actual detection limits are instrument specific, we also suggest that you confirm that the laboratory equipment can meet or exceed this detection limit.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.2 Prepare and then weigh the midget impingers prior to configuring the sampling train. The first impinger is initially dry. The second impinger contains 20 mL of reagent water, and the third impinger contains silica gel that is added before weighing the impinger. Each prepared impinger is weighed and the pre-sampling weight is recorded to the nearest 0.5 gm.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.3 Assemble the sampling train (see Figure 1). Ice is packed around the impingers in order to keep them cold during sample collection. A small amount of water may be added to the ice to improve thermal transfer.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.4 Perform a sampling system leak check (from the probe tip to the pump outlet) as follows: Connect a rotameter to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe and observe the leak rate. The leak rate must be less than 2 percent of the planned sampling rate of 0.2 or 0.4 L/min.</p><p class="depth0">8.1.5 Source gas temperature and static pressure should also be considered prior to field sampling to ensure adequate safety precautions during sampling.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Sample Collection</p><p class="depth0">8.2.1 Set the sample flow rate between 0.2-0.4 L/min, depending upon the anticipated concentration of formaldehyde in the engine exhaust. (You may have to refer to published data for anticipated concentration levels--see References 5 and 6.) If no information is available for the anticipated levels of formaldehyde, use the higher sampling rate of 0.4 L/min.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.2 Record the sampling flow rate every 5 to 10 minutes during the sample collection period.</p><p class="depth0">Note: It is critical that you do not sample at a flow rate higher than 0.4 L/min. Sampling at higher flow rates may reduce formaldehyde collection efficiency resulting in measured formaldehyde concentrations that are less than the actual concentrations.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.3 Monitor the amount of ice surrounding the impingers and add ice as necessary to maintain the proper impinger temperature. Remove excess water as needed to maintain an adequate amount of ice.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.4 Record measured leak rate, beginning and ending times and dry gas meter readings for each sampling run, impinger weights before and after sampling, and sampling flow rates and dry gas meter exhaust temperature every 5 to 10 minutes during the run, in a signed and dated notebook.</p><p class="depth0">8.2.5 If possible, monitor and record the fuel flow rate to the engine and the exhaust oxygen concentration during the sampling period. This data can be used to estimate the engine exhaust flow rate based on the Method 19 approach. This approach, if accurate fuel flow rates can be determined, is preferred for reciprocating IC engine exhaust flow rate estimation due to the pulsating nature of the engine exhaust. The F-Factor procedures described in Method 19 may be used based on measurement of fuel flow rate and exhaust oxygen concentration. One example equation is Equation 323-2.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 Post-test. Perform a sampling system leak-check (from the probe tip to pump outlet). Connect a rotameter to the outlet of the pump. Close off the inlet to the probe and observe the leak rate. The leak rate must be less than 2 percent of the sampling rate. Weigh and record each impinger immediately after sampling to determine the moisture weight gain. The impinger weights are measured before transferring the impinger contents, and before rinsing the sample probe and sample line. The moisture content of the exhaust gas is determined by measuring the weight gain of the impinger solutions and volume of gas sampled as described in Method 4. Rinse the sample probe and sample line with reagent water. Transfer the impinger catch to an amber 40-mL VOA bottle with a Teflon-lined cap. If there is a small amount of liquid in the dropout impinger (<10 mL), the impinger catches can be combined in one 40 mL VOA bottle. If there is a larger amount of liquid in the dropout impinger, use a larger VOA bottle to combine the impinger catches. Rinse the impingers and combine the rinsings from the sample probe, sample line, and impingers with the impinger catch. In general, combined rinse volumes should not exceed 10 mL. However, in cases where a long, flexible extension line must be used to connect the sample probe to the sample box, sufficient water must be used to rinse the connecting line to insure that any sample that may have collected there is recovered. The volume of the rinses during sample recovery should not be excessive as this may result in your having to use a larger VOA bottle. This in turn would raise the detection limit of the method since after combining the rinses with the impinger catches in the VOA bottle, the bottle should be filled with reagent water to eliminate the headspace in the sample vial. Keep the sample bottles over ice until analyzed on-site or received at the laboratory. Samples should be analyzed as soon as possible to minimize possible sample degradation. Based on a limited number of previous analyses, samples held in refrigerated conditions showed some sample degradation over time.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Quality Control Samples</p><p class="depth0">8.4.1 Field Duplicates. During at least one run, a pair of samples should be collected concurrently and analyzed as separate samples. Results of the field duplicate samples should be identified and reported with the sample results. The percent difference in exhaust (stack) concentration indicated by field duplicates should be within 20 percent of their mean concentration. Data are to be flagged as suspect if the duplicates do not meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.2 Spiked Samples. An aliquot of one sample from each source sample set should be spiked at 2 to 3 times the formaldehyde level found in the unspiked sample. It is also recommended that a second aliquot of the same sample be spiked at around half the level of the first spike; however, the second spike is not mandatory. The results are acceptable if the measured spike recovery is 80 to 120 percent. Use Equation 323-4. Data are to be flagged as suspect if the spike recovery do not meet the acceptance criteria.</p><p class="depth0">8.4.3 Field Blank. A field blank consisting of reagent water placed in a clean impinger train, taken to the test site but not sampled, then recovered and analyzed in the same manner as the other samples, should be collected with each set of source samples. The field blank results should be less than 50 percent of the lowest calibration standard used in the sample analysis. If this criteria is not met, the data should be flagged as suspect.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Quality Control

Prepare a stock solution of 10 g/mL formaldehyde. Prepare a series of calibration standards from the stock solution by adding 0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.0, and 1.5 mL of stock solution (corresponding to 0, 1.0, 3.0, 7.0, 10.0, and 15.0 g formaldehyde, respectively) to screw-capped vials. Adjust each vial's volume to 2.0 mL with reagent water. At this point the concentration of formaldehyde in the standards is 0.0, 0.5, 1.5, 3.5, 5.0, and 7.5 g/mL, respectively. Add 2.0 mL of acetyl acetone reagent, thoroughly mix the solution, and place the vials in a water bath (or heating block) at 60 C for 10 minutes. Remove the vials and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer each solution to a cuvette and measure the absorbance at 412 nm using the spectrophotometer. Develop a calibration curve from the analytical results of these standards. The acceptance criteria for the spectrophotometer calibration is a correlation coefficient of 0.99 or higher.

The calibration check standard should not be prepared from the calibration stock solution. The result of the check standard must be within 10 percent of the theoretical value to be acceptable. If the acceptance criteria are not met, the standard must be reanalyzed. If still unacceptable, a new calibration curve must be prepared using freshly prepared standards.</p><p class="depth0">11.0 Analytical Procedure</p><p class="depth0">11.1 Sample Analysis. A 2.0-mL aliquot of the impinger catch/rinsate is transferred to a screw-capped vial. Two mL of the acetyl acetone reagent are added and the solution is thoroughly mixed. Once mixed, the vial is placed in a water bath (or heating block) at 60 C for 10 minutes. Remove the vial and allow to cool to room temperature. Transfer the solution to a cuvette and measure the absorbance using the spectrophotometer at 412 nm. The quantity of formaldehyde present is determined by comparing the sample response to the calibration curve. Use Equation 323-5. If the sample response is out of the calibration range, the sample must be diluted and reanalyzed. Such dilutions must be performed on another aliquot of the original sample before the addition of the acetyl acetone reagent. The full procedure is repeated with the diluted sample.</p><p class="depth0">11.2 Analytical Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">11.2.1 Laboratory Duplicates.

Based on a Method 301 validation using quad train arrangement with post sampling spiking study of the method at a natural gas-fired IC engine, the relative standard deviation of six pairs of unspiked samples was 11.2 percent at a mean stack gas concentration of 16.7 ppmvd.</p><p class="depth0">13.2 Bias.

This data set is too limited to justify using a bias correction factor for future tests at other sources.</p><p class="depth0">13.3 Range. The range of this method for formaldehyde is 0.2 to 7.5 g/mL in the liquid phase. (This corresponds to a range of 0.27 to 10 ppmv in the engine exhaust if sampling at a rate of 0.4 Lpm for 60 minutes and using a 40-mL VOA bottle.)

Based on a sample stability study conducted in conjunction with the method validation, sample degradation for 7- and 14-day hold times does not exceed 2.3 and 4.6 percent, respectively, based on a 95 percent level of confidence.

Appendix C to Part 63--Determination of the Fraction Biodegraded</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Fbio)</em> in a Biological Treatment Unit</p><p class="depth0">I. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">The purpose of this appendix is to define the procedures for an owner or operator to use to calculate the site specific fraction of organic compounds biodegraded (Fbio) in a biological treatment unit. If an acceptable level of organic compounds is destroyed rather than emitted to the air or remaining in the effluent, the biological treatment unit may be used to comply with the applicable treatment requirements without the unit being covered and vented through a closed vent system to an air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0">The determination of Fbio shall be made on a system as it would exist under the rule. The owner or operator should anticipate changes that would occur to the wastewater flow and concentration of organics, to be treated by the biological treatment unit, as a result of enclosing the collection and treatment system as required by the rule.</p><p class="depth0">Unless otherwise specified, the procedures presented in this appendix are designed to be applied to thoroughly mixed treatment units. A thoroughly mixed treatment unit is a unit that is designed and operated to approach or achieve uniform biomass distribution and organic compound concentration throughout the aeration unit by quickly dispersing the recycled biomass and the wastewater entering the unit. Detailed discussion on how to determine if a biological treatment unit is thoroughly mixed can be found in reference 7. Systems that are not thoroughly mixed treatment units should be subdivided into a series of zones that have uniform characteristics within each zone. The number of zones required to characterize a biological treatment system will depend on the design and operation of the treatment system. Detailed discussion on how to determine the number of zones in a biological treatment unit and examples of determination of f bio can be found in reference 8. Each zone should then be modeled as a separate unit. The amount of air emissions and biodegradation from the modeling of these separate zones can then be added to reflect the entire system.</p><p class="depth0">II. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials in wastewater.

Procedures for Determination of fbio</p><p class="depth0">The first step in the analysis to determine if a biological treatment unit may be used without being covered and vented through a closed-vent system to an air pollution control device is to determine the compound-specific fbio. The following procedures may be used to determine fbio:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The EPA Test Method 304A or 304B (appendix A, part 63)--Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Performance data with and without biodegradation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inlet and outlet concentration measurements,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Batch tests,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Multiple zone concentration measurements.</p><p class="depth0">All procedures must be executed so that the resulting fbio is based on the collection system and waste management units being

in compliance with the rule. If the collection system and waste management units meet the suppression requirements at the time of the test, any of the procedures may be chosen. If the collection system and waste management units are not in compliance at the time of the performance test, then only Method 304A, B, or the batch test shall be chosen. If Method 304A, B, or the batch test is used, any anticipated changes to the influent of the full-scale biological treatment unit that will occur after the facility has enclosed the collection system must be represented in the influent feed to the benchtop bioreactor unit, or test unit.</p><p class="depth0">Select one or more appropriate procedures from the five listed above based on the availability of site specific data and the type of mixing that occurs in the unit (thoroughly mixed or multiple mixing zone). If the facility does not have site-specific data on the removal efficiency of its biological treatment unit, then Procedure 1 or Procedure 4 may be used. Procedure 1 allows the use of a benchtop bioreactor to determine the first-order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may elect to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for any regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 4 explains two types of batch tests which may be used to estimate the first order biodegradation rate constant. An owner or operator may elect to assume the first order biodegradation rate constant is zero for any regulated compound(s) present in the wastewater. Procedure 3 would be used if the facility has, or measures to determine, data on the inlet and outlet individual organic compound concentration for the biological treatment unit. Procedure 3 may only be used on a thoroughly mixed treatment unit. Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement test that can be used for units with multiple mixing zones. Procedure 2 is used if a facility has or obtains performance data on a biotreatment unit prior to and after addition of the microbial mass. An example where Procedure 2 could be used is an activated sludge unit where measurements have been taken on inlet and exit concentration of organic compounds in the wastewater prior to seeding with the microbial mass and startup of the unit. The flow chart in figure 1 outlines the steps to use for each of the procedures.</p><p class="depth0">A. Method 304A or 304B (Procedure 1)</p><p class="depth0">If the first procedure is selected, follow the instructions in appendix A of part 63 Method 304A ``Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds (Vented Option)'' or Method 304B ``Method for the Determination of Biodegradation Rates of Organic Compounds (Scrubber Option).'' Method 304A or 304B provides instruction on setting up and operating a self-contained benchtop bioreactor system which is operated under conditions representative of the target full-scale system. Method 304A uses a benchtop bioreactor system with a vent, and uses modeling to estimate any air emissions. Method 304B uses a benchtop bioreactor system which is equipped with a scrubber and is not vented.</p><p class="depth0">There are some restrictions on which method a source may use. If the facility is measuring the rate of biodegradation of compounds that may tend to react or hydrolyze in the scrubber of Method 304B, this method shall not be used and Method 304A is the required method. If a Henry's law value is not available to use with Form V, then Method 304A shall not be used and Method 304B is the required method. When using either method, the feed flow to the benchtop bioreactor shall be representative of the flow and concentration of the wastewater that will be treated by the full-scale biological treatment unit after the collection and treatment system has been enclosed as required under the applicable subpart.</p><p class="depth0">The conditions under which the full-scale biological treatment unit is run establish the operating parameters of Method 304A or 304B. If the biological treatment unit is operated under abnormal operating conditions (conditions outside the range of critical parameters examined and confirmed in the laboratory), the EPA believes this will adversely affect the biodegradation rate and is an unacceptable treatment option. The facility would be making multiple runs of the test method to simulate the operating range for its biological treatment unit. For wide ranges of variation in operating parameters, the facility shall demonstrate the biological treatment unit is achieving an acceptable level of control, as required by the regulation, across the ranges and not only at the endpoints.</p><p class="depth0">If Method 304A is used, complete Form V initially. Form V is used to calculate K1 from the Method 304A results. Form V uses the Henry's law constant to estimate the fraction lost from the benchtop reactor vent. The owner or operator shall use the Henry's law values in Table I. Form V also gives direction for calculating an equivalent KL. Note on Form V if the calculated number for line 11 is greater than the calculated value for line 13, this procedure shall not be used to demonstrate the compound is biodegradable. If line 11 is greater than line 13, this is an indication the fraction emitted from the vent is greater than the fraction biodegraded. The equivalent KL determined on Form V is used in Form II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and fbio must be done following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated values of K1 and KL (equivalent KL), and site-specific parameters of the full-scale bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms II, III, and V must

be completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe and fbio.</p><p class="depth0">If Method 304B is used, perform the method and use the measurements to determine K1, which is the first-order biodegradation rate constant. Form I lists the sequence of steps in the procedure for calculating K1 from the Method 304B results. Once K1 is determined, KL must be calculated by use of mass transfer equations. Form II outlines the procedure to follow for use of mass transfer equations to determine KL. A computer program which incorporates these mass transfer equations may be used. Water7 is a program that incorporates these mass transfer equations and may be used to determine KL. Refer to Form II-A to determine KL, if Water7 or the most recent update to this model is used. In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model version 3.0 or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model version 1.10 or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the biological treatment unit with several stipulations. The programs must be altered to output a KL value which is based on the site-specific parameters of the unit modeled, and the Henry's law values listed in Table I must be substituted for the existing Henry's law values in the programs. Input values used in the model and corresponding output values shall become documentation of the fbio determination. The owner or operator should be aware these programs do not allow modeling of certain units. To model these units, the owner or operator shall use one of the other appropriate procedures as outlined in this appendix. The owner or operator shall not use a default value for KL. The KL value determined by use of these models shall be based on the site-specific parameters of the specific unit. This KL value shall be inserted in Form II (line 6). Estimation of the Fe and fbio must be done following the steps in Form III. Form III uses the previously calculated values of K1 and KL, and site-specific parameters of the full-scale bioreactor as input to the calculations. Forms I, II, and III must be completed for each organic compound in the wastewater to determine Fe and fbio.</p><p class="depth0">B. Performance Data With and Without Biodegradation (Procedure 2)</p><p class="depth0">Procedure 2 uses site-specific performance data that represents or characterizes operation of the unit both with and without biodegradation. As previously mentioned, proper determination of fbio must be made on a system as it would exist under the rule. Using Form IV, calculate KL and K1. After KL and K1 are determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe and fbio for each organic compound present in the wastewater.</p><p class="depth0">C. Inlet and Outlet Concentration Measurements (Procedure 3)</p><p class="depth0">Procedure 3 uses measured inlet and outlet organic compound concentrations for the unit. This procedure may only be used on a thoroughly mixed treatment unit. Again, proper determination of fbio must be made on a system as it would exist under the rule. The first step in using this procedure is to calculate KL using Form II. A computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most recent update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. After KL is determined using field data, complete Form VI to calculate K1. The TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in procedure 304B. After KL and K1 are determined, Form III is used to calculate Fe and fbio for each organic compound.</p><p class="depth0">D. Batch Tests (Procedure 4)</p><p class="depth0">Two types of batch tests which may be used to determine kinetic parameters are: (1) The aerated reactor test and (2) the sealed reactor test. The aerated reactor test is also known as the BOX test (batch test with oxygen addition). The sealed reactor test is also known as the serum bottle test. These batch tests should be conducted only by persons familiar with procedures for determining biodegradation kinetics. Detailed discussions of batch procedures for determining biodegradation kinetic parameters can be found in references 1-4.</p><p class="depth0">For both batch test approaches, a biomass sample from the activated sludge unit of interest is collected, aerated, and stored for no more than 4 hours prior to testing. To collect sufficient data when biodegradation is rapid, it may be necessary to dilute the biomass sample. If the sample is to be diluted, the biomass sample shall be diluted using treated effluent from the activated sludge unit of interest to a concentration such that the biodegradation test will last long enough to make at least six concentration measurements. It is recommended that the tests not be terminated until the compound concentration falls below the limit of quantitation (LOQ). Measurements that are below the LOQ should not be used in the data analysis. Biomass concentrations shall be determined using standard methods for measurement of mixed liquor volatile suspended solids (MLVSS) (reference 5).</p><p class="depth0">The change in concentration of a test compound may be monitored by either measuring the concentration in the liquid or in the reactor headspace. The analytical technique chosen for the test should be as sensitive as possible. For the batch test procedures described in this section, equilibrium conditions must exist between the liquid and gas phases of the experiments because the

data analysis procedures are based on this premise. To use the headspace sampling approach, the reactor headspace must be in equilibrium with the liquid so that the headspace concentrations can be correlated with the liquid concentrations. Before the biodegradation testing is conducted, the equilibrium assumption must be verified. A discussion of the equilibrium assumption verification is given below in sections D.1 and D.2 since different approaches are required for the two types of batch tests.</p><p class="depth0">To determine biodegradation kinetic parameters in a batch test, it is important to choose an appropriate initial substrate (compound(s) of interest) concentration for the test. The outcome of the batch experiment may be influenced by the initial substrate (SO) to biomass (XO) ratio (see references 3, 4, and 6). This ratio is typically measured in chemical oxygen demand (COD) units. When the SO/XO ratio is low, cell multiplication and growth in the batch test is negligible and the kinetics measured by the test are representative of the kinetics in the activated sludge unit of interest. The SO/XO ratio for a batch test is determined with the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.034
Where:
SO/XO = initial substrate to biomass ratio on a</p><p class="depth0">COD basisSi = initial substrate concentration in COD units (g COD/L)X=biomass concentration in the batch test (g MLVSS/L)1.42 = Conversion factor to convert to COD units</p><p class="depth0">For the batch tests described in this section, the SO/XO ratio (on a COD basis) must be initially less than 0.5.</p><p class="depth0">1. Aerated Reactor Test. An aerated draft tube reactor may be used for the biokinetics testing (as an example see Figure 2 of appendix C). Other aerated reactor configurations may also be used. Air is bubbled through a porous frit at a rate sufficient to aerate and keep the reactor uniformly mixed. Aeration rates typically vary from 50 to 200 ml/min for a 1 liter system. A mass flow rate controller is used to carefully control the air flow rate because it is important to have an accurate measure of this rate. The dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that the biodegradation observed will not be DO-limited. Once the air flow rate is established, the test mixture (or compound) of interest is then injected into the reactor and the concentration of the compound(s) is monitored over time. Concentrations may be monitored in the liquid or in the headspace. A minimum of six samples shall be taken over the period of the test. However, it is necessary to collect samples until the compound concentration falls below the LOQ. If liquid samples are collected, they must be small enough such that the liquid volume in the batch reactor does not change by more than 10%.</p><p class="depth0">Before conducting experiments with biomass, it is necessary to verify the equilibrium assumption. The equilibrium assumption can be verified by conducting a stripping experiment using the effluent (no biomass) from the activated sludge unit of interest. Effluent is filtered with a 0.45 um or smaller filter and placed in the draft tube reactor. Air is sparged into the system and the compound concentration in the liquid or headspace is monitored over time. This test with no biomass may provide an estimate of the Henry's law constant. If the system is at equilibrium, the Henry's law constant may be estimated with the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.035
Where:
C=cencentration at time, t (min)CO = concentration at t=0G=volumetric gas flow rate (ml/min)V=liquid volume in the batch reactor (ml)Keq = Henry's law constant (mg/L-gas)/(mg/L-liquid)t=time (min)</p><p class="depth0">A plot of--ln(C/Co) as a function of t will have a slope equal to GKeq/V. The equilibrium assumption can be verified by comparing the experimentally determined Keq for the system to literature values of the Henry's Law constant (including those listed in this appendix). If Keq does not match the Henry's law constant, Keq shall be determined from analysis of the headspace and liquid concentration in a batch system.</p><p class="depth0">The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to both biodegradation and stripping. Biodegradation processes are typically described with a Monod model. This model and a stripping expression are combined to give a mass balance for the aerated draft tube reactor):

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.036
Where:
s=test compound concentration, mg/literG=volumetric gas flow rate, liters/hrKeq = Henry's Law constant measured in the system, (mg/liter</p><p class="depth0">gas)/(mg/liter liquid)V=volume of liquid in the reactor, litersX=biomass concentration (g MLVSS/liter)Qm = maximum rate of substrate removal, mg/g MLVSS/hrKS = Monod biorate constant at half the maximum rate, mg/</p><p class="depth0">liter</p><p class="depth0">Equation App. C-3 can be integrated to obtain the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR22JA01.162
Where:
A=GKeqKs + QmVXB=GKeqSo = test compound concentration at t=0</p><p class="depth0">This equation is used along with the substrate concentration versus time data to determine the best fit parameters (Qm and KS) to describe the biodegradation process in the aerated reactor. If the aerated reactor test is used, the following procedure is used to analyze the data. Evaluate Keq for the compound of interest with Form XI. The concentration in the vented headspace or liquid is measured as a function of time and the data is entered on Form XI. A plot is made from the data and attached to the Form XI. Keq is calculated on Form XI and the results are contrasted with the expected value of Henry's law obtained from Form IX. If the comparison is satisfactory, the stripping constant is calculated from Keq, completing Form XI. The values of Keq may differ because the theoretical value of Keq may not be applicable to the system of interest. If the comparison of the calculated Keq from the form and the expected value of Henry's law is unsatisfactory, Form X can alternatively be used to validate Keq. If the aerated reactor is demonstrated to not be at equilibrium, either modify the reactor design and/or operation, or use another type of batch test.</p><p class="depth0">The compound-specific biorate constants are then measured using Form XII. The stripping constant that was determined from Form XI and a headspace correction factor of 1 are entered on Form XII. The aerated reactor biotest may then be run, measuring concentrations of each compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements using the Keq determined on Form XI and entered on Form XII.</p><p class="depth0">The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to curve fit the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting procedure must be based upon the Equation App. C-4. When curve fitting is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the fitted curve to Form XII.</p><p class="depth0">If the stripping rate constant is relatively large when compared to the biorate at low concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain accurate evaluations of the first-order biorate constant. In these cases, either reducing the stripping rate constant by lowering the aeration rate, or increasing the biomass concentrations should be considered.</p><p class="depth0">The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, fbio. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from Form XII, line 9.</p><p class="depth0">2. Sealed Reactor Test. This test uses a closed system to prevent losses of the test compound by volatilization. This test may be conducted using a serum bottle or a sealed draft tube reactor (for an example see Figure 3 of appendix C). Since no air is supplied, it is necessary to ensure that sufficient oxygen is present in the system. The DO concentration in the system must not fall below 2 mg/liter so that the biodegradation observed will not be DO-limited. As an alternative, oxygen may be supplied by electrolysis as needed to maintain the DO concentration above 2 mg/liter. The reactor contents must be uniformly mixed, by stirring

or agitation using a shaker or similar apparatus. The test mixture (or compound) of interest is injected into the reactor and the concentration is monitored over time. A minimum of six samples shall be taken over the period of the test. However, it is necessary to monitor the concentration until it falls below the LOQ.</p><p class="depth0">The equilibrium assumption must be verified for the batch reactor system. In this case, Keq may be determined by simultaneously measuring gas and liquid phase concentrations at different times within a given experiment. A constant ratio of gas/liquid concentrations indicates that equilibrium conditions are present and Keq is not a function of concentration. This ratio is then taken as the Keq for the specific compound in the test. It is not necessary to measure Keq for each experiment. If the ratio is not constant, the equilibrium assumption is not valid and it is necessary to (1) increase mixing energy for the system and retest for the equilibrium assumption, or (2) use a different type of test (for example, a collapsible volume reactor).</p><p class="depth0">The concentration of a compound decreases in the bioreactor due to biodegradation according to Equation App. C-5:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.038

The disappearance of a compound in the sealed reactor test is slowed because a fraction of the compound is not available for biodegradation because it is present in the headspace. If the compound is almost entirely in the liquid phase, the headspace correction factor is approximately one. If the headspace correction factor is substantially less than one, improved mass transfer or reduced headspace may improve the accuracy of the sealed reactor test. A preliminary sealed reactor test must be conducted to test the equilibrium assumption. As the compound of interest is degraded, simultaneous headspace and liquid samples should be collected and Form X should be used to evaluate Keq. The ratio of headspace to liquid concentrations must be constant in order to confirm that equilibrium conditions exist. If equilibrium conditions are not present, additional mixing or an alternate reactor configuration may be required.</p><p class="depth0">The compound-specific biorate constants are then calculated using Form XII. For the sealed reactor test, a stripping rate constant of zero and the headspace correction factor that was determined from Form X are entered on Form XII. The sealed reactor test may then be run, measuring the concentrations of each compound of interest as a function of time. If headspace concentrations are measured instead of liquid concentrations, then the corresponding liquid concentrations are calculated from the headspace measurements using Keq from Form X and entered on Form XII.</p><p class="depth0">The concentration data on Form XII may contain scatter that can adversely influence the data interpretation. It is possible to

curve fit the concentration data and enter the concentrations on the fitted curve instead of the actual data. If curve fitting is used, the curve-fitting procedure must be based upon Equation App. C-6. When curve fitting is used, it is necessary to attach a plot of the actual data and the fitted curve to Form XII.</p><p class="depth0">If a sealed collapsible reactor is used that has no headspace, the headspace correction factor will equal 1, but the stripping rate constant may not equal 0 due to diffusion losses through the reactor wall. The ratio of the rate of loss of compound to the concentration of the compound in the reactor (units of per hour) must be evaluated. This loss ratio has the same units as the stripping rate constant and may be entered as the stripping rate constant on line 1 of Form XII.</p><p class="depth0">If the loss due to diffusion through the walls of the collapsible reactor is relatively large when compared to the biorate at low concentrations, it may be difficult to obtain accurate evaluations of the first-order biorate constant. In these cases, either replacing the materials used to construct the reactor with materials of low permeability or increasing the biomass concentration should be considered.</p><p class="depth0">The final result of the batch testing is the measurement of a biorate that can be used to estimate the fraction biodegraded, fbio. The number transferred to Form III is obtained from Form XII, line 9.</p><p class="depth0">The number on Form XII line 9 will equal the Monod first-order biorate constant if the full-scale system is operated in the first-order range. If the full-scale system is operated at concentrations above that of the Monod first-order range, the value of the number on line 9 will be somewhat lower than the Monod first-order biorate constant. With supporting biorate data, the Monod model used in Form XII may be used to estimate the effective biorate constant K1 for use in Form III.</p><p class="depth0">If a reactor with headspace is used, analysis of the data using equation App. C-6 is valid only if Vl and Vg do not change more than 10% (i.e., they can be approximated as constant for the duration of the test). Since biodegradation is occurring only in the liquid, as the liquid concentration decreases it is necessary for mass to transfer from the gas to the liquid phase. This may require vigorous mixing and/or reducing the volume in the headspace of the reactor.</p><p class="depth0">If there is no headspace (e.g., a collapsible reactor), equation App. C-6 is independent of V1 and there are no restrictions on the liquid volume. If a membrane or bag is used as the collapsible-volume reactor, it may be important to monitor for diffusion losses in the system. To determine if there are losses, the bag should be used without biomass and spiked with the compound(s) of interest. The concentration of the compound(s) in the reactor should be monitored over time. The data are analyzed as described above for the sealed reactor test.</p><p class="depth0">3. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC). A QA/QC plan outlining the procedures used to determine the biodegradation rate constants shall be prepared and a copy maintained at the source. The plan should include, but may not be limited to:</p><p class="depth0">1. A description of the apparatus used (e.g., size, volume, method of supplying air or oxygen, mixing, and sampling procedures) including a simplified schematic drawing.</p><p class="depth0">2. A description of how biomass was sampled from the activated sludge unit.</p><p class="depth0">3. A description of how biomass was held prior to testing (age, etc.).</p><p class="depth0">4. A description of what conditions (DO, gas-liquid equilibrium, temperature, etc.) are important, what the target values are, how the factors were controlled, and how well they were controlled.</p><p class="depth0">5. A description of how the experiment was conducted, including preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling procedures, monitoring of conditions, etc.</p><p class="depth0">6. A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the precision for that equipment.</p><p class="depth0">7. A description of the analytical procedures used. If appropriate, reference to an ASTM, EPA or other procedure may be used.

A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored.</p><p class="depth0">9. A description of the equations used and their solutions, including a reference to any software used for calculations and/or curve-fitting.</p><p class="depth0">E. Multiple Zone Concentration Measurements (Procedure 5)</p><p class="depth0">Procedure 5 is the concentration measurement method that can be used to determine the fbio for units that are not thoroughly mixed and thus have multiple zones of mixing. As with the other procedures, proper determination of fbio must be made on a system as it would exist under the rule. For purposes of this calculation, the biological unit must be divided \1\ into zones with uniform characteristics within each zone. The number of zones that is used depends on the complexity of the unit. Reference 8, ``Technical Support

Document for the Evaluation of Aerobic Biological Treatment Units with Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a source for further information concerning how to determine the number of zones that should be used for evaluating your unit. The following information on the biological unit must be available to use this procedure: basic unit variables such as inlet and recycle wastewater flow rates, type of agitation, and operating conditions; measured representative organic compound concentrations in each zone and the inlet and outlet; and estimated mass transfer coefficients for each zone.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ This is a mathematical division of the actual unit; not addition of physical barriers.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Reference 8 ``Technical Support Document for the Evaluation of Aerobic Biological Treatment Units with Multiple Mixing Zones,'' is a source for further information concerning how to interpolate the biorates for multiple zones. In units with well-characterized concentration measurements obtained in an initial evaluation of the unit, it may be possible to demonstrate that there is a good correlation of the component concentrations with the locations in the multiple-zone unit. With this good correlation, it may be possible to accurately predict the concentrations in selected zones without actually testing each selected zone. This correlation method may be used for units that have many zones (greater than 5) or where one of the interior zones is not readily accessible for sampling. To use this correlation method of estimating zone concentrations, it is necessary to measure the concentrations in the inlet unit, the exit unit, and sufficient interior units to obtain a correlation of component concentrations with the locations. You cannot use this correlation method of estimating selected zone concentrations if monitoring of each zone is required, or if the accuracy and precision of the correlation is inferior to actual individual sampling error. The accuracy and precision of the correlation may be improved by increasing the number of locations tested. Because the correlation is based on many samples, it should provide an accurate representation of a stable operating system.</p><p class="depth0">The estimated mass transfer coefficient for each compound in each zone is obtained from Form II using the characteristics of each zone. A computer model may be used. If the Water7 model or the most recent update to this model is used, then use Form II-A to calculate KL. The TOXCHEM or BASTE model may also be used to calculate KL for the biological treatment unit, with the stipulations listed in Procedure 304B. Compound concentration measurements for each zone are used in Form XIII to calculate the fbio. A copy of Form XIII is completed for each of the compounds of concern treated in the biological unit.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Calculation of Fbio</p><p class="depth0">At this point, the individual fbios determined by the previously explained procedures must be summed to obtain the total Fbio. To determine the Fbio multiply each compound specific fbio by the compound-specific average mass flow rate of the organic compound in the wastewater stream (see regulation for instruction on calculation of average mass flow rate). Sum these products and divide by the total wastewater stream average mass flow rate of organic compounds.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR17JA97.040
M=compound specific average mass flow rate of the organic compounds in</p><p class="depth0">the wastewater (Mg/Yr)n=number of organic compounds in the wastewater</p><p class="depth0">The Fbio is then used in the applicable compliance equations in the regulation to determine if biodegradation may be used to comply with the treatment standard without covering and venting to an air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">1.

Sec. Appendix E to Part 63--Monitoring Procedure for Nonthoroughly Mixed</p><p class="depth0">Open Biological Treatment Systems at Kraft Pulp Mills Under Unsafe</p><p class="depth0">Sampling Conditions</p><p class="depth0">I. Purpose</p><p class="depth0">This procedure is required to be performed in subpart S of this part, entitled National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants from the Pulp and Paper Industry. Subpart S requires this procedure in Sec. 63.453(p)(3) to be followed during unsafe sampling conditions when it is not practicable to obtain representative samples of hazardous air pollutants (HAP) concentrations from an open biological treatment unit. It is assumed that inlet and outlet HAP concentrations from the open biological treatment unit may be obtained during the unsafe sampling conditions. The purpose of this procedure is to estimate the concentration of HAP within the open biological treatment unit based on information obtained at inlet and outlet sampling locations in units that are not thoroughly mixed and, therefore, have different concentrations of HAP at different locations within the unit.</p><p class="depth0">II. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Biological treatment unit = wastewater treatment unit designed and operated to promote the growth of bacteria to destroy organic materials in wastewater.

Test Procedure for Determination of fbio for Nonthoroughly Mixed</p><p class="depth0">Open Biological Treatment Units Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions</p><p class="depth0">This test procedure is used under unsafe sampling conditions that do not permit practicable sampling of open biological treatment units within the unit itself, but rather relies on sampling at the inlet and outlet locations of the unit. This procedure may be used only under unsafe sampling conditions to estimate fbio. Once the unsafe conditions have passed, then the formal compliance demonstration procedures of fbio based upon measurements within the open biological treatment unit must be completed.</p><p class="depth0">A. Overview of Estimation Procedure</p><p class="depth0">The steps in the estimation procedure include data collection, the estimation of concentrations within the unit, and the use of Form 1 to estimate fbio. The data collection procedure consists of two separate components. The first data collection component demonstrates that the open biological treatment unit can be represented by Monod kinetics and characterizes the effectiveness of the open biological treatment unit as part of the initial performance test, and the second data collection component is used when there are unsafe sampling conditions. These two data collection components are used together in a data calculation procedure based on a Monod kinetic model to estimate the concentrations in each zone of the open biological treatment unit. After the first two components of data collection are completed, the calculation procedures are used to back estimate the zone concentrations, starting with the last zone in the series and ending with the first zone.</p><p class="depth0">B. Data Collection Requirements</p><p class="depth0">This method is based upon modeling the nonthoroughly mixed open biological treatment unit as a series of well-mixed zones with internal recycling between the units and assuming that two Monod biological kinetic parameters can be used to characterize the biological removal rates in each unit. The data collection procedure consists of two separate components. The first data collection component is part of the initial performance test, and the second data collection component is used during unsafe sampling conditions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Initial Performance Test</p><p class="depth0">The objective of the first data collection component is to demonstrate that the open biological treatment unit can be represented by Monod kinetics and to characterize the performance of the open biological treatment unit. An appropriate value of the biorate constant, Ks, is determined using actual sampling data from the open biological treatment unit. This is done during the initial performance test when the open biological treatment unit is operating under normal conditions. This specific Ks value obtained during the initial performance test is used in the calculation procedure to characterize the open biological treatment unit during unsafe sampling conditions. The following open biological treatment unit characterization information is obtained from the first component of the data collection procedure:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of the biorate constant, Ks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The number and characteristics of each zone in the open biological treatment unit (depth, area, characterization parameters for surface aeration, submerged aeration rates, biomass concentration, concentrations of organic compounds, dissolved oxygen (DO), dissolved solids, temperature, and other relevant variables); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The recycle ratio of internal recirculation between the zones. The number of zones and the above characterization of the zones are also used to determine the performance of the unit under the unsafe sampling conditions of concern.</p><p class="depth0">2. Data Collected Under Unsafe Sampling Conditions</p><p class="depth0">In the second data collection component obtained under unsafe sampling conditions, the measured inlet and outlet HAP concentrations and the biomass concentration are obtained for the open biological treatment unit. After the site specific data collection is completed on the day a parameter excursion occurs, the inlet and outlet concentrations are used with the prior open biological treatment unit characterization to estimate the concentrations of HAP in each zone. The following information on the open biological treatment unit must be available in the second data collection component:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Basic unit variables such as inlet and recycle wastewater flow rates, type of agitation, and operating conditions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The value of the inlet and outlet HAP concentrations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The biomass concentration in the open biological treatment unit.</p><p class="depth0">C. One Time Determination of a Single Value of Ks (Initial Performance</p><p class="depth0">Test)</p><p class="depth0">A single value of Ks is calculated using Form 3 for each data set that is collected during the initial performance test. A single composite value of Ks, deemed to be representative of the biological unit, is subsequently selected so that the fbio values calculated by the procedures in this appendix (using this single value of Ks) for the data sets collected during the initial performance test are within 10 percent of the fbio value determined by using Form 1 with these same data sets. The value of Ks meeting these criteria is obtained by the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Determine the median of the Ks values calculated for each data set;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Estimate fbio for each data set using the selected Ks value (Form 1 and Form 2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculate fbio for each data set using Form 1; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Compare the fbio values obtained in steps (2) and (3); if the fbio value calculated using step (2) differs from that calculated using step (3) by more than 10 percent, adjust Ks (decrease Ks if the fbio value is lower than that calculated by Form 1 and vice versa) and repeat this procedure starting at step (2). If a negative value is obtained for the values of Ks, then this negative kinetic constant may not be used with the Monod model. If a negative value of Ks is obtained, this test procedure cannot be used for evaluating the performance of the open biological treatment unit.</p><p class="depth0">D. Confirmation of Monod Kinetics (Initial Performance Test)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confirmation that the unit can be represented by Monod kinetics is made by identifying the following two items:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The zone methanol concentrations measured during the initial performance test; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The zone methanol concentrations estimated by the Multiple Zone Concentrations Calculations Procedure based on inlet and outlet concentrations (Column A of Form 2). For each zone, the concentration in item 1 is compared to the concentration in item 2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each zone, the estimated value of item 2 must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Within 25 percent of item 1 when item 1 exceeds 8 mg/L; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within 2 mg/L of item 1 when item 1 is 8 mg/L or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Successful demonstration that the calculated zone concentrations meet these criteria must be achieved for 80 percent of the performance test data sets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If negative values are obtained for the values of K1 and Ks, then these negative kinetic constants may not be used with the Monod model, even if the criteria are met. If negative values are obtained, this test procedure cannot be used for evaluating the performance of the open biological treatment unit.</p><p class="depth0">E. Determination of KL for Each Zone (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A site-specific liquid-phase mass transfer coefficient (KL) must be obtained for each zone during the unsafe sampling conditions. Do not use a default value for KL. The KL value for each zone must be based on the site-specific parameters of the specific unit. The first step in using this procedure is to calculate KL for each zone in the unit using Form 4. Form 4 outlines the procedure to follow for using mass transfer equations to determine KL. Form 4 identifies the appropriate form to use for providing the detailed calculations to support the estimate of the value of KL. Forms 5 and 6 are used to provide individual compound estimates of KL for quiescent and aerated impoundments, respectively. A computer model may be used to perform the calculations. If the WATER8 model or the most recent update to this model is used, then report the computer model input parameters that you used as an attachment to Form 4. In addition, the Bay Area Sewage Toxics Emission (BASTE) model, version 3.0, or equivalent upgrade and the TOXCHEM (Environment Canada's Wastewater Technology Centre and Environmega, Ltd.) model, version 1.10, or equivalent upgrade may also be used to determine KL for the open biological treatment unit with the following stipulations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The programs must be altered to output a KL value that is based on the site-specific parameters of the unit modeled; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 must be substituted for the existing Henry's law values in the models.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Henry's law value listed in Form 4 may be obtained from the following sources:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Values listed by EPA with temperature adjustment if needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Measured values for the system of concern with temperature adjustment; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Literature values of Henry's law values for methanol, adjusted for temperature if needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Input values used in the model and corresponding output values shall become part of the documentation of the fbio determination. The owner or operator should be aware that these models may not provide equivalent KL values for some types of units. To obtain an equivalent KL value in this situation, the owner or operator shall either use the appropriate procedure on Form 4 or adjust the KL value from the model to the equivalent KL value as described on Form 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Report the input parameters that you used in the computer model on Forms 5, 6, and 7 as an attachment to Form 4. If you have submerged air flow in your unit, you must add the value of KL estimated on Form 7 to the value of KL obtained with Forms 5 and 6 before using the value of KL with Form 2.</p><p class="depth0">F. Estimation of Zone Concentrations (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)</p><p class="depth0">Form 2 is used to estimate the zone concentrations of HAP based on the inlet and outlet data. The value of Ks entered on the form is that single composite value of Ks discussed in section III.C of this appendix. This value of Ks is calculated during the Initial Performance Test (and subsequently updated, if necessary). A unique value of the biorate K1 is entered on line 5 of Form 2, and the inlet concentration is estimated in Column A of Form 2. The inlet concentration is located in the row of Form 2 corresponding to zone 0. If there are three zones in the system, n-3 equals 0 for the inlet concentration row. These estimated zone concentrations are then used in Form 1 to estimate f bio for the treatment unit.</p><p class="depth0">G. Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QA/QC)</p><p class="depth0">A QA/QC plan outlining the procedures used to determine the measured inlet and outlet concentrations during unsafe conditions and how the zone characterization data were obtained during the initial performance test shall be prepared and submitted with the initial performance test report. The plan should include, but may not be limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A description of each of the sampling methods that were used (method, procedures, time, method to avoid losses during sampling and holding, and sampling procedures) including simplified schematic drawings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of how that biomass was sampled from the biotreatment unit, including methods, locations, and times;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A description of what conditions (DO, temperature, etc.) are important, what the target values are in the zones, how the factors were controlled, and how they were monitored. These conditions are primarily used to establish that the conditions of the initial performance test correspond to the conditions of the day in question;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A description of how each analytical measurement was conducted, including preparation of solutions, dilution procedures, sampling procedures, monitoring of conditions, etc;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A description of the analytical instrumentation used, how the instruments were calibrated, and a summary of the accuracy and precision for each instrument;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A description of the test methods used to determine HAP concentrations and other measurements. Section 63.457(c)(3) specifies the test methods that must be used to determine HAP concentrations. During unsafe sampling conditions, you do not have to sample over an extended period of time or obtain more than one sample at each sample point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> A description of how data are captured, recorded, and stored; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A description of the equations used and their solutions for sampling and analysis, including a reference to any software used for calculations and/or curve-fitting.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Calculation of Individual fbio (Unsafe Sampling Conditions)</p><p class="depth0">Use Form 1 with your zone concentration information to estimate the value of f bio under unsafe sampling conditions. Form 1 uses measured concentrations of HAP in the unit inlet and outlet, and Form 1 also uses the estimated concentrations in each zone of the unit obtained from Form 2. This procedure may be used on an open biological treatment unit that has defined zones within the unit. Use Form 1 to determine fbio for each open biological treatment unit as it exists under subpart S of part 63. The first step in using Form 1 is to calculate KL for each zone in the unit using Form 4. Form 7 must also be used if submerged aeration is used. After KL is determined using field data, obtain the concentrations of the HAP in each zone. In this alternative procedure for unsafe sampling conditions, the actual measured concentrations of the HAP in each zone are replaced with the zone concentrations that are estimated with Form 2. After KL and the zone concentrations are determined, Form 1 is used to estimate the overall unit Fe and fbio for methanol.

The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:
Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume.
LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).
HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date (in this case, July 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.
EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following the text.
OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information collection request.

Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements.
PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried. Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to 2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.
``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.
INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)). This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001, or call 202-741-6010.
