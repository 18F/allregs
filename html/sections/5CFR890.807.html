In such cases, the right of conversion may be exercised up to 31 days after the employing office's notice of termination. The former spouse must pay the full premium (employee's and Government's share) during the extended period, exclusive of the 31-day period following the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Termination of enrollment for failure to pay premiums within the time frame established in accordance with Sec. 890.808(d)(1) is retroactive to the end of the last pay period for which payment has been timely received.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A former spouse whose enrollment is terminated under this paragraph may not reenroll.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The enrollment of a former spouse who meets the requirements in Sec. 890.803(a)(3) (iv) or (v) of this part terminates, subject to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion, at midnight of the last day of the pay period in which the earliest of the following events occurs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Former spouse remarries before age 55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Former spouse dies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failure to make an election under Sec. 890.806(m). (1) If the annuity is insufficient to pay the full subscription charge due for the plan in which the former spouse is enrolled, the former spouse may elect one of the two opportunities offered under Sec. 890.806(m) (electing a plan with a full subscription charge that is less than the annuity; or paying premiums directly to the retirement system in accordance with Sec. 890.808(d)). Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section the enrollment of a former spouse who fails to make an election within the specified time frame will be terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the individual was prevented by circumstances beyond his or her control from making an election within the time limit after receipt of the final notice, he or she may request reinstatement of coverage by writing to the retirement system. The retirement system will determine if the individual is eligible for reinstatement of coverage; and, when the determination is

affirmative, the individual's coverage may be reinstated retroactively to the date of termination or prospectively. If the determination is negative, the individual may request reconsideration of the decision from OPM.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the former spouse does not make an election under paragraph (c)(1) of this section and is enrolled in the high option of a plan that has two options, the former spouse is deemed to have elected enrollment in the standard option of the same plan unless the annuity is insufficient to pay the full withholdings for the standard option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Coverage of members of the family.

The cancellation takes effect on the last day of the pay period in which the appropriate request cancelling the enrollment is received by the employing office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A former spouse may suspend enrollment in FEHB for the purpose of enrolling in a Medicare sponsored plan under sections 1833, 1876, or 1851 of the Social Security Act, or to enroll in the Medicaid program or a similar State-sponsored program of medical assistance for the needy, or to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage. To suspend FEHB coverage, documentation of eligibility for coverage under the non-FEHB Program must be submitted to the employing office or retirement system. If the documentation is received within the period beginning 31 days before and ending 31 days after the effective date of the enrollment in the Medicare sponsored plan, or the Medicaid or similar program, or within 31 days before or after the day designated by the former spouse as the day he or she wants to suspend FEHB coverage to use Peace Corps or CHAMPVA or TRICARE (including the Uniformed Services Family Health Plan) or TRICARE-for-Life coverage instead of FEHB coverage, then the suspension will be effective at the end of the day before the effective date of the enrollment or the end of the day before the day designated. Otherwise, the suspension is effective the first day of the first pay period that begins after the date the employing office or retirement system receives the documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The former spouse and family members, if any, are not entitled to the temporary extension of coverage for conversion or to convert to an individual contract for health benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A former spouse who cancels his or her enrollment for any reason may not later reenroll in the FEHB Program.
