                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basic data. In computing the AAPCC, CMS uses the U.S. per capita  incurred cost and adjusts it by the factors specified in paragraph (c)  of this section to establish an AAPCC for each class of Medicare  enrollees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advance notice to the HMO or CMP. Before the beginning of a  contract period, CMS informs the HMO or CMP of the specific adjustment  factors it will use in computing the AAPCC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment factors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Geographic. CMS makes an adjustment to  reflect the relative level of Medicare expenditures for beneficiaries  who reside in the HMO's or CMP's geographic area (or a similar area).  This adjustment is based   on reimbursement for Medicare covered services and uses the most  accurate and timely data that pertain to the HMO's or CMP's geographic  area and that is available to CMS when it makes the determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enrollment. CMS makes a further adjustment to remove the cost  effect of all area Medicare beneficiaries who are enrolled in the HMO or  CMP or another HMO or CMP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Age, sex, and disability status. CMS makes adjustments to  reflect the age and sex distribution and the disability status of the  HMO's or CMP's enrollees based on Medicare program experience and  available data that indicate cost differences that result from those  factors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other relevant factors. If accurate data are available and  appropriate, CMS makes adjustments to reflect welfare and institutional  status and other relevant factors.
