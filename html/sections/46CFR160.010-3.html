                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Design and performance. To obtain Coast Guard approval, an inflatable buoyant apparatus must comply with subpart 160.151, with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Canopy requirements (IMO LSA Code, Chapter IV/4.1.1.5 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 160.010-1 of this subpart)). It does not need a canopy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capacity (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.1.2.1). The carrying capacity must be not less than four persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Floor insulation (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.2.2). The floor may be uninsulated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Stability (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.5.4). It does not need stability pockets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Righting (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.5.2). A reversible one does not need arrangements for righting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> One with a capacity of 13 or more persons must be reversible, with the floor arranged between the buoyancy chambers so that the apparatus can, floating either side up, accommodate the number of persons for which it is approved. One with a capacity of 12 or fewer persons must either be reversible in the same manner, or be designed so that it can be readily righted by one person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> One with a capacity of 25 or more persons must be provided with self-bailing floor drains. If the floor of a reversible one includes one or more drains, each drain must be arranged to completely drain the floor of water when the device is fully loaded, and must prevent water from flowing back onto the floor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the buoyancy tubes are not vivid reddish orange, vivid yellow, or a fluorescent color of a similar hue, panels of such hue must be secured to the buoyancy chambers so that a minimum of 1 m\2\ (11 ft\2\) is visible from above the

apparatus when it is floating either side up.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Boarding ramp (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.4.1). Boarding ramps are not required if the combined cross-section diameter of the buoyancy chambers is 500 millimeters (mm) (19.5 in.) or less. An apparatus with a combined cross-section diameter greater than 500 mm (19.5 in.) requires boarding ramps as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For an apparatus with a capacity of less than 25 persons, at least one ramp must be provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an apparatus with a capacity of 25 or more persons, at least two ramps must be provided; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The boarding ramps required by this paragraph must allow persons to board with either side of a reversible apparatus floating up, or the full number of ramps required must be installed on each side.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Boarding ladder (IMO LSA Code, chapter IV/4.2.4.2). Boarding ladders must be provided on each inflatable buoyant apparatus as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> One ladder must be provided on each apparatus with a capacity of less than 25 persons, except that, for an apparatus with a capacity of 13 or more persons that is not equipped with a boarding ramp, two ladders must be provided.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Two ladders must be provided on each apparatus with a capacity of 25 or more persons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The ladders required by this paragraph must allow persons to board with either side of a reversible apparatus floating up, or the full number of ladders required must be installed on each side.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> One or more exterior canopy lamps meeting the requirements of 46 CFR 160.151-15(n) must be provided such that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On a non-reversible inflatable buoyant apparatus, one lamp is mounted so that it is on the uppermost surface of the floating apparatus; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On a reversible apparatus, two lamps are mounted so that one lamp is on the uppermost surface of the apparatus, whichever side is floating up.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Equipment. All equipment required by this paragraph must be either packed in a container accessible to the occupants, or otherwise secured to the apparatus. Duplicate equipment must be provided, for each side of a reversible inflatable buoyant apparatus, if the equipment is not accessible from both sides. In lieu of the equipment specified in Sec. 160.151-7(b) and (IMO LSA Code, Chapter IV/4.1.5), each apparatus must be provided with--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Rescue quoit and heaving line. One rescue quoit and a heaving line as described in Sec. 160.151-21(a) on each apparatus with a capacity of less than 25 persons; or two on each apparatus for a capacity of 25 or more persons. The heaving line(s) must be mounted adjacent to a boarding ramp (or boarding ladder, if no ramps are installed), and ready for immediate use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Knives. Two buoyant safety knives ready for use near the painter attachment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Bailer. One bailer as described in Sec. 160.151-21(c) on each apparatus with a capacity of less than 25 persons; or two bailers on each apparatus with a capacity of 25 or more persons, except that no bailers are necessary if both sides of the floor of a reversible apparatus are equipped with drains;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sponge. One sponge as described in Sec. 160.151-21(d) on each apparatus with a capacity of less than 25 persons, or two sponges on each apparatus with a capacity of 25 or more persons;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Paddles.
