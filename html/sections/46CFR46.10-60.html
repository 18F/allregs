                            <p class="depth0">The Director, Field Operations (DFO) or the Coast Guard District Commander may detain a passenger vessel for a survey if there is reason to believe that such a vessel is proceeding on her journey in excess of the draft allowed by the regulations in this part as indicated by the vessel's load lines certified on the safety certificate, load line certificate, or otherwise. The Coast Guard District Commander may detain a passenger vessel if it is so loaded as to be manifestly unsafe to proceed to sea. Except as otherwise required by this section, Sec. 42.07-60 of this subchapter applies to all passenger vessels assigned load lines under the load line acts and the regulations of this subchapter.
