                                Sec.  250.427  What are the requirements for pressure integrity tests?

                            <p class="depth0">You must conduct a pressure integrity test below the surface casing  or liner and all intermediate casings or liners. The District Manager  may require you to run a pressure-integrity test at the conductor casing  shoe if warranted by local geologic conditions or the planned casing  setting depth. You must conduct each pressure integrity test after  drilling at least 10 feet but no more than 50 feet of new hole below the  casing shoe. You must test to either the formation leak-off pressure or  to an equivalent drilling fluid weight if identified in an approved APD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must use the pressure integrity test and related hole- behavior observations, such as pore-pressure test results, gas-cut  drilling fluid, and well kicks to adjust the drilling fluid program and  the setting depth of the next casing string. You must record all test  results and hole-behavior observations made during the course of  drilling related to formation integrity and pore pressure in the  driller's report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> While drilling, you must maintain the safe drilling margin  identified in the approved APD. When you cannot maintain this safe  margin, you must suspend drilling operations and remedy the situation.</p>
