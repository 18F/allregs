The CCC also will provide for follow-up audit activity to ensure that any excess profits are found and refunded to NASA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NASA has waived the requirement for the submission of certified cost or pricing data when contracting for Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program Phase II contracts.
