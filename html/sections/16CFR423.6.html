                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to textile wearing apparel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturers and importers must attach care labels so that they  can be seen or easily found when the product is offered for sale to  consumers. If the product is packaged, displayed, or folded so that  customers cannot see or easily find the label, the care information must  also appear on the outside of the package or on a hang tag fastened to  the product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this section. If either  washing or drycleaning can be used on the product, the label need have  only one of these instructions. If the product cannot be cleaned by any  available cleaning method without being harmed, the label must so state.  [For example, if a product would be harmed both by washing and by  drycleaning, the label might say ``Do not wash--do not dryclean,'' or  ``Cannot be successfully cleaned.''] The instructions for washing and  drycleaning are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Washing, drying, ironing, bleaching and warning instructions  must follow these requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Washing. The label must state whether the product should be  washed by hand or machine. The label must also state a water  temperature--in terms such as cold, warm, or hot--that may be used.  However, if the regular use of hot water up to 145 degrees F (63 degrees  C) will not harm the product, the label need not mention any water  temperature. [For example, Machine wash means hot, warm or cold water  can be used.]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Drying. The label must state whether the product should be  dried by machine or by some other method. If machine drying is called  for, the label must also state a drying temperature that may be used.  However, if the regular use of a high temperature will not harm the  product, the label need not mention any drying temperature. [For  example, Tumble dry means that a high, medium, or low temperature  setting can be used.]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ironing. Ironing must be mentioned on a label only if it will  be needed on a regular basis to preserve the appearance of the product,  or if it is required under paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section,  Warnings. If ironing is mentioned, the label must also state an ironing  temperature that may be used. However, if the regular use of a hot iron  will not harm the product, the label need not mention any ironing  temperature.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Bleaching. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If all commercially available bleaches can  safely be used on a regular basis, the label need not mention bleaching.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If all commercially available bleaches would harm the product  when used on a regular basis, the label must say ``No bleach'' or ``Do  not bleach.''</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If regular use of chlorine bleach would harm the product, but  regular use of a non-chlorine bleach would not, the label must say  ``Only non-chlorine bleach, when needed.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Warnings. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If there is any part of the prescribed washing  procedure   which consumers can reasonably be expected to use that would harm the  product or others being washed with it in one or more washings, the  label must contain a warning to this effect. The warning must use words  ``Do not,'' ``No,'' ``Only,'' or some other clear wording. [For example,  if a shirt is not colorfast, its label should state ``Wash with like  colors'' or ``Wash separately.'' If a pair of pants will be harmed by  ironing, its label should state ``Do not iron.'']</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Warnings are not necessary for any procedure that is an  alternative to the procedure prescribed on the label. [For example, if  an instruction states ``Dry flat,'' it is not necessary to give the  warning ``Do not tumble dry.'']</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drycleaning--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General. If a drycleaning instruction is  included on the label, it must also state at least one type of solvent  that may be used. However, if all commercially available types of  solvent can be used, the label need not mention any types of solvent.  The terms ``Drycleanable'' or ``Commercially Dryclean'' may not be used  in an instruction. [For example, if drycleaning in perchlorethylene  would harm a coat, the label might say ``Professionally dryclean:  fluorocarbon or petroleum.'']</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Warnings. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If there is any part of the drycleaning procedure  which consumers or drycleaners can reasonably be expected to use that  would harm the product or others being cleaned with it, the label must  contain a warning to this effect. The warning must use the words ``Do  not,'' ``No,'' ``Only,'' or some other clear wording. [For example, the  drycleaning process normally includes moisture addition to solvent up to  75% relative humidity, hot tumble drying up to 160 degrees F and  restoration by steam press or steam-air finish. If a product can be  drycleaned in all solvents but steam should not be used, its label  should state ``Professionally dryclean. No steam.'']</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Warnings are not necessary to any procedure which is an  alternative to the procedure prescribed on the label. [For example, if  an instruction states ``Professionally dryclean, fluorocarbon,'' it is  not necessary to give the warning ``Do not use perchlorethylene.'']</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A manufacturer or importer must establish a reasonable basis for  care information by processing prior to sale:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reliable evidence that the product was not harmed when cleaned  reasonably often according to the instructions on the label, including  instructions when silence has a meaning. [For example, if a shirt is  labeled ``Machine wash. Tumble dry. Cool iron.,'' the manufacturer or  importer must have reliable proof that the shirt is not harmed when  cleaned by machine washing (in hot water), with any type of bleach,  tumble dried (at a high setting), and ironed with a cool iron]; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reliable evidence that the product or a fair sample of the  product was harmed when cleaned by methods warned against on the label.  However, the manufacturer or importer need not have proof of harm when  silence does not constitute a warning. [For example, if a shirt is  labeled ``Machine wash warm. Tumble dry medium'', the manufacturer need  not have proof that the shirt would be harmed if washed in hot water or  dried on high setting]; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Reliable evidence, like that described in paragraph (c)(1) or  (2) of this section, for each component part of the product in  conjunction with reliable evidence for the garment as a whole; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reliable evidence that the product or a fair sample of the  product was successfully tested. The tests may simulate the care  suggested or warned against on the label; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reliable evidence of current technical literature, past  experience, or the industry expertise supporting the care information on  the label; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Other reliable evidence.
