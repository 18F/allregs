                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before engaging in outside employment, with or without  compensation, an employee, other than a special Government employee,  must obtain written approval from the supervising TVA vice president or  designee. The written request shall be submitted through the employee's  supervisor or human resource office and shall, at a minimum, identify  the employer or other person for whom the services are to be provided,  as well as the duties, hours of work, and compensation involved in the  proposed outside employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval under paragraph (a) of this section shall be granted  only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to  involve conduct prohibited by statute or Federal regulation, including 5  CFR part 2635.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Vice presidents or other officers of TVA may, after consultation  with the Designated Agency Ethics Official, exempt specified classes of  employees from this section based upon a determination that the official  duties of employees in the class are such that their outside employment  activities are not likely to raise issues of compliance with 5 CFR part  2635.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For purposes of this section, employment means any form of non- Federal employment or business relationship involving the provision of  services by the employee. It includes, but is not limited to, personal  services as an officer, director, employee, agent, attorney, consultant,  contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, or speaker. It includes  writing when done under an arrangement with another person for  production or publication of the written product. It does not, however,  include participation in the activities of a nonprofit charitable,  religious, professional, social, fraternal, educational, recreational,  public service, or civic organization, unless such activities involve  the provision of professional services or advice or are for compensation  other than reimbursement for actual expenses.</p><p class="depth2">PARTS 7902	7999 [RESERVED]</p>
