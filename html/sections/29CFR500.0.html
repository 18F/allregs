Prior judgments and final orders obtained under FLCRA continue in effect as stated in Sec. 500.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> These regulations include provisions necessitated by the Immigration Reform and Control Act's (IRCA) amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). IRCA amended MSPA to remove section 106 thereof prohibiting the employment of illegal aliens. Matters concerning certificate actions or the assessment of civil money penalties, for a violation of section 106 of MSPA which occurred prior to June 1, 1987, continue through final administrative determination as stated in Sec. 500.147.
