This authority may not be used in situations of extensive duration or  for periods of interrupted or suspended operations such as ordinarily  would be covered by the scheduling of leave, furlough, or the assignment  of other work. Insofar as practicable, each administrative order issued  under this subpart shall provide benefits for regular employees paid at  daily, hourly, or piecework rates similar to those provided for  employees paid at annual rates.</p>
