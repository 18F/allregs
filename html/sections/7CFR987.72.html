                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for payment. Each handler shall pay to the Committee  upon demand, on all dates he has certified as meeting the requirements  for marketable dates and utility dates utilized in product outlets  including the eligible portion of any field-run dates certified and set  aside or disposed of pursuant to Sec. 987.45(f), his pro rata share of  all expenses which the Secretary finds are reasonable and likely   to be incurred by the Committee during each crop year. Should the  condition arise wherein the utility portion of dates handled in certain  other outlets should not be, in the opinion of the Committee, subject to  the payment of assessments on that portion, the Committee may recommend  and the Secretary approve by rulemaking, such exclusion. Each handler's  pro rata share shall be the rate of assessment per hundredweight fixed  by the Secretary. At any time during or after a crop year the Secretary  may increase such assessment rate to secure sufficient funds to cover  unanticipated expenses or a deficit in assessable poundage. Any such  increase shall apply to all assessable poundage of the crop year. The  Committee may accept payments of assessments in advance and may borrow  money in any amount not to exceed 10 percent of the estimated expenses  set forth in its budget for the then crop year. The assessment weight of  pitted dates shall be determined by dividing the weight of such dates by  a divisor established by the Committee with the approval of the  Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Delinquent payments. Any assessment not paid by a handler within  a period of time prescribed by the Committee may be subject to an  interest or late payment charge, or both. The period of time, rate of  interest, and late payment charge shall be as recommended by the  Committee and approved by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Surplus expenses. The Committee is authorized to use temporarily  funds derived from assessments collected pursuant to paragraph (a) of  this section to defray expenses incurred in disposing of surplus dates.  All such expenses shall be deducted from the proceeds obtained by the  Committee from such disposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Operating reserve. The Committee, with the approval of the  Secretary, may establish and maintain during one or more crop years an  operating monetary reserve in an amount not to exceed the average of one  year's expenses incurred during the most recent five preceding crop  years, except that an established reserve need not be reduced to conform  to any recomputed average. Funds in reserve shall be available for use  by the Committee for expenses authorized pursuant to Sec. 987.71.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Refunds. Funds held by the Committee at the conclusion of the  crop year in excess of the crop year's expenses, including reserve  requirements, may be used to defray expenses for no more than the  ensuing four months, and thereafter within a reasonable time the  Committee shall credit, or upon demand, refund the aforesaid excess to  handlers who contributed to such excess: Provided, That the excess due  any handler may be applied, in whole or in part, by the Committee to any  outstanding obligation due the Committee from such handler. A handler's  share of the excess funds shall be the amount of assessments he paid in  excess of his actual pro rata share of the expenses, including reserve  requirements, of the Committee for the preceding crop year. Upon  termination of this subpart any money in possession of the Committee  shall be distributed in such manner as the Secretary may direct:  Provided, That, to the extent practicable, such funds shall be returned  pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
