                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calibrate the FID and HFID hydrocarbon analyzer as described in  this section. Operate the HFID to a set point [5.5 C between 185 and  197 C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Initial and periodic optimization of detector response. Prior to  introduction into service and at least annually thereafter, adjust the  FID and HFID hydrocarbon analyzer for optimum hydrocarbon response as  specified by this paragraph. Alternative methods yielding equivalent  results may be used, if approved in advance by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Follow good engineering practices for initial instrument start- up and basic operating adjustment using the appropriate fuel (see  Sec. 91.312) and purified synthetic air or zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One of the following procedures is required for FID or HFID  optimization:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The procedure outlined in Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE)  paper No. 770141, ``Optimization of Flame Ionization Detector for  Determination of Hydrocarbons in Diluted Automobile Exhaust''; author,  Glenn D. Reschke. This procedure has been incorporated by reference. See  Sec. 91.6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The HFID optimization procedures outlined in 40 CFR part 1065,  subpart D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Alternative procedures may be used if approved in advance by  the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> After the optimum flow rates have been determined, they are  recorded for future reference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to introduction into  service and monthly thereafter, or within one month prior to the  certification test, calibrate the FID or HFID hydrocarbon analyzer on  all normally used instrument ranges, using the steps in this paragraph.  Use the same flow rate and pressures as when analyzing samples.  Introduce calibration gases directly at the analyzer. An optional method  for dilute sampling described in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart F, may be  used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Zero the hydrocarbon analyzer with purified synthetic air or  zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each used operating range with calibration gases  having nominal concentrations between 10 and 90 percent of that range. A  minimum of six evenly spaced points covering at least 80 percent of the  10 to 90 percent range (64 percent) is required (see following table).     ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example calibration points (percent)      Acceptable for calibration? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70....................

Yes 10, 30, 50, 70, 90........................  No, though equally spaced</p><p class="depth0">and entire range covered, a</p><p class="depth0">minimum of six points is</p><p class="depth0">needed ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For each range calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares  best-fit straight line is two percent or less of the value at each data  point, calculate concentration values by use of a single calibration  factor for that range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any  point, use the best-fit non-linear equation which represents the data to  within two percent of each test point to determine concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Zero the analyzer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Span the analyzer with the 21 percent oxygen blend.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Recheck zero response. If it has changed more than 0.5 percent  of full scale repeat paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section to  correct the problem.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Introduce the 5 percent and 10 percent oxygen interference check  gases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Recheck the zero response. If it has changed more than [1  percent of full scale, repeat the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Calculate the percent of oxygen interference (designated as  percent O2 I) for each mixture in paragraph (d)(4) of this  section according to the following equation:  percent O2 I = (B - Analyzer response (ppm C))/B x 100  [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]  Where:  A=hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the span gas used in paragraph</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> of this section. B=hydrocarbon concentration (ppmC) of the oxygen interference check</p><p class="depth0">gases used in paragraph (d)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The percent of oxygen interference (designated as percent  O2 I) must be less than [three percent for all required  oxygen interference check gases prior to testing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If the oxygen interference is greater than the specifications,  incrementally adjust the air flow above and below the manufacturer's  specifications, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this  section for each flow.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the oxygen interference is greater than the specification  after adjusting the air flow, vary the fuel flow and thereafter the  sample flow, repeating paragraphs (d)(1) through (d)(7) of this section  for each new setting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> If the oxygen interference is still greater than the  specifications, repair or replace the analyzer, FID fuel, or burner air  prior to testing. Repeat this section with the repaired or replaced  equipment or gases.  [61 FR 52102, Oct. 4, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 40451, July 13, 2005]</p>
