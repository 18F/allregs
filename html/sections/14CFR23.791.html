Signs that notify when seat belts should be fastened must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When illuminated, be legible to each person seated in the passenger compartment under all probable lighting conditions; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Be installed so that a flightcrew member can, when seated at the flightcrew member's station, turn the illumination on and off.
