Partial distributions,  other than the transfers referred to in Sec. 190.06 and paragraph  (d)(2) of this section, made prior to the final net equity determination  date must be made pursuant to a preliminary plan of distribution  approved by the court, upon notice to the parties and to all customers,  which plan requires adequate security to the debtor's estate for the  nonrecovery of any overpayments by the trustee and distributes an equal  percentage of net equity to all public customers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Margin payments. The trustee may make margin payments on behalf  of any account which do not exceed the funded balance of that account.
