                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The request for MAC review must be filed with the MAC or  appropriate ALJ hearing office. The request for review must be in  writing and may be made on a standard form. A written request that is  not made on a standard form is accepted if it contains the beneficiary's  name; Medicare health insurance claim number; the specific service(s) or  item(s) for which the review is requested; the specific date(s) of  service; the date of the ALJ's decision or dismissal order, if any; if  the party is requesting escalation from the ALJ to the MAC, the hearing  office in which the appellant's request for hearing is pending; and the  name and signature of the party or the representative of the party; and  any other information CMS may decide.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The request for review must identify the parts of the ALJ action  with which the party requesting review disagrees and explain why he or  she disagrees with the ALJ's decision, dismissal, or other determination  being appealed. For example, if the party requesting review believes  that the ALJ's action is inconsistent with a statute, regulation, CMS  Ruling, or other authority, the request for review should explain why  the appellant believes the action is inconsistent with that authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The MAC will limit its review of an ALJ's actions to those  exceptions raised by the party in the request for review, unless the  appellant is an unrepresented beneficiary. For purposes of this section  only, we define a representative as anyone who has accepted an  appointment as the beneficiary's representative, except a member of the  beneficiary's family, a legal guardian, or an individual who routinely  acts on behalf of the beneficiary, such as a family member or friend who  has a power of attorney.
