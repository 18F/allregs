For example, in the case of wagers accepted on a horse race, the daily record shall show separately the gross amount of each class or type of wagers (straight bets, parlays, ``if'' bets, etc.) accepted on each horse in the race. Similarly, in the case of the numbers game, the daily record shall show the gross amount of each class or type of wager accepted on each number.
