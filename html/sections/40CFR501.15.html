                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. All State programs under this part must  have legal authority to implement each of the following provisions and  must be administered in conformance with each, except that States are  not precluded from omitting or modifying any provisions to impose more  stringent requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Confidentiality of information. Claims of confidentiality will  be denied for the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name and address of any permit applicant or permittee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Permit applications, permits, and sewage sludge data. This  includes information submitted on the permit application forms  themselves and any attachments used to supply information required by  the forms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Duration of permits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> NPDES permits issued to treatment works  treating domestic sewage pursuant to section 405(f) of the CWA will be  effective for a fixed term not to exceed five years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Non-NPDES Permits issued to treatment works treating domestic  sewage pursuant to section 405(f) of the CWA will be effective for a  fixed term not to exceed ten years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Schedules of compliance--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. The permit may, when  appropriate, specify a schedule of compliance leading to compliance with  the CWA and the requirements of this part. Any schedules of compliance  under this section must require compliance as soon as possible, but not  later than any applicable statutory deadline under the CWA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interim dates. If a permit establishes a schedule of compliance  which exceeds one year from the date of permit issuance, the schedule  must set forth interim requirements and the date for their achievement,  as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reporting. The permit must be written to require that no later  than 14 days following each interim date and the final date of  compliance, the permittee must notify the Director in writing of its  compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final requirements, or  submit progress reports if paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of this section is  applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)</em> through (xii) of this section. The Director of an  approved state program that chooses to receive electronic documents must  satisfy the requirements of 40 CFR part 3--(Electronic reporting).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Conditions applicable to all permits. In addition to permit  conditions which must be developed on a case-by-case basis in order to  meet applicable requirements of 40 CFR part 503, paragraphs (a)(1)  through (a)(3) of this section, and permit conditions developed on a  case-by-case basis using best professional judgment to protect public  health and the environment from the adverse effects of toxic pollutants  in sewage sludge, all permits must contain the following permit  conditions (or comparable conditions as provided for in the Memorandum  of Agreement):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Duty to comply. The permittee must comply with all conditions of  this permit. Any permit noncompliance constitutes a violation of the  Clean Water Act and is grounds for enforcement action; for permit  termination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or denial of a  permit renewal application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with sludge standards. The permittee shall comply  with standards for sewage sludge use or disposal established under  section 405(d) of the CWA (40 CFR part 503) within the time provided in  the regulations that establish such standards, even if this permit has  not yet been modified to incorporate the standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> CWA penalties. Section 309 of the Clean Water Act (CWA) sets out  penalties applicable to persons who violate the Act's requirements. For  example, section 309(d) provides that any person who violates a permit  condition implementing sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, 318, or 405 of  the Clean Water Act is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $25,000  per day for each violation. Such violations also may be subject to  administrative penalties assessed by the Administrator pursuant to  section 309(g) of the CWA. Any person who negligently violates permit  conditions implementing sections 301, 302, 306, 307, 308, or 405 of the  Clean Water Act is subject to a fine not less than $2,500 nor more than  $25,000 per day of violation or by imprisonment for not more than 1  year, or both. Any person who knowingly violates a permit condition  implementing sections 301, 302, 304, 307, 308, or 405 shall be punished  by a fine not less than $5000 nor more than $50,000 per day of  violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 3 years or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Need to halt or reduce activity not a defense. It shall not be a  defense for a permittee in an enforcement action that it would have been  necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to maintain  compliance with the conditions of this permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Duty to mitigate. The permittee shall take all reasonable steps  to minimize or prevent sludge use or disposal in violation of this  permit which has a reasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human  health or the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Proper operation and maintenance. The permittee shall at all  times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of  treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed or  used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of this  permit. Proper operation and maintenance also includes adequate  laboratory controls and appropriate quality assurance procedures. This  provision requires the operation of back-up or auxiliary facilities or  similar systems which are installed by a permittee only when the  operation is necessary to achieve compliance with the conditions of the  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Permit actions. This permit may be modified, revoked and  reissued, or terminated for cause. The filing of a request by the  permittee for a permit modification, revocation and reissuance, or  termination, or a notification of planned changes or anticipated  noncompliance does not stay any permit condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Duty to provide information. The permittee shall furnish to the  Director, within a reasonable time, any information which the Director  may request to determine whether cause exists for modifying, revoking  and reissuing, or terminating this permit or to determine compliance  with this permit.

The permittee shall allow the Director, or  an authorized representative, upon the presentation of credentials and  other documents as may be required by law, to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Enter upon the permittee's premises where a regulated facility  or activity is located or conducted, or where records must be kept under  the conditions of this permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Have access to and copy, at reasonable times, any records that  must be kept under the conditions of this permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inspect at reasonable times any facilities, equipment  (including monitoring and control equipment), practices, or operations  regulated or required under this permit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sample or monitor at reasonable times, for the purposes of  assuring permit compliance or as otherwise authorized by the Clean Water  Act, any substances, parameters or practices at any location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Monitoring and records. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The permittee must monitor and  report monitoring results as specified elsewhere in this permit with a  frequency dependent on the nature and effect of its sludge use or  disposal practices. At a minimum, this will be as required by 40 CFR  part 503.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Samples and measurements taken for the purpose of monitoring  shall be representative of the monitored activity. The permittee shall  retain records of all monitoring information, copies   of all reports required by this permit, and records of all data used to  complete the application for this permit, for a period of at least five  years from the date of the sample, measurement, report or application,  or longer as required by 40 CFR part 503. This period may be extended by  request of the Director at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Records of monitoring information shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date, exact place, and time of sampling or measurements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The individual(s) who perfored the sampling or measurements;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date(s) analyses were performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The individual(s) who performed the analyses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The analytical techniques or methods used; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The results of such analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Monitoring must be conducted according to test procedures  specified in 40 CFR part 503 or 136 unless other test procedures have  been specified in this permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The Clean Water Act provides that any person who knowingly  falsifies, tampers with, or renders inaccurate any monitoring device or  method required to be maintained under this permit shall, upon  conviction, be punished for the first conviction by a fine of not more  than $10,000 or by imprisonment for not more than 2 years per violation,  or by both. Subsequent convictions for the same offense are punishable  by a fine of not more than $20,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment  of not more than 4 years, or both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Signatory requirements. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> All applications, reports, or  information submitted to the Director shall be signed and certified  according to the provisions of 40 CFR 122.22.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The CWA provides that any person who knowingly makes any false  statement, representation, or certification in any record or other  document submitted or required to be maintained under this permit shall,  upon conviction, be punished for the first conviction by a fine of not  more than $10,000 per violation, or by imprisonment for not more than 2  years per violation, or by both. Subsequent convictions shall be  punishable by a fine of not more than $20,000 per day of violation or by  imprisonment of not more than 4 years, or by both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Notice requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Planned changes. The permittee shall  give notice to the Director as soon as possible of any planned physical  alterations or additions to the permitted facility, or significant  changes planned in the permittee's sludge disposal practice, where such  alterations, additions, or changes may justify the application of permit  conditions that are different from or absent in the existing permit,  including notification of additional disposal sites not reported during  the permit application process or not reported pursuant to an approved  land application plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give advance  notice to the Director of any planned changes in the permitted facility  or activity which may result in noncompliance with permit requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transfers. This permit is not transferable to any person  except after notice to the Director. The Director may require  modification or revocation and reissuance of the permit to change the  name of the permittee and incorporate such other requirements as may be  necessary under the CWA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other noncompliance reporting. The permittee shall report all  instances of noncompliance. Reports of noncompliance shall be submitted  with the permittee's next self monitoring report or earlier. if  requested by the Director or if required by an applicable standard for  sewage sludge use or disposal or condition of this permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other information.

If a standard for sewage sludge use or disposal  applicable to permittee's use or disposal methods is promulgated under  section 405(d) of the CWA before the expiration of this permit, and that  standard is more stringent than the sludge pollutant limits or  acceptable management practices authorized in this permit, or controls a   pollutant or practice not limited in this permit, this permit may be  promptly modified or revoked and reissued to conform to the standard for  sludge use or disposal promulgated under section 405(d) of the CWA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Duty to reapply. If the permittee wishes to continue an  activity regulated by the this permit after the expiration date of this  permit, the permittee must apply for a new permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Indian Tribes can satisfy the criminal enforcement authority  requirements of this section under Sec. 501.25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Permit actions. All State programs under this part shall have  the legal authority to implement the following provisions as a minimum  and must be administered in conformance with each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Transfer of permits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Transfers by modification. Except as  provided in paragraph (ii) of this section, a permit may be transferred  by the permittee to a new owner or operator only if the permit has been  modified or revoked and reissued to identify the new permittee and  incorporate such other requirements as may be necessary to assure  compliance with the CWA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic transfers. As an alternative to transfers under  paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section, the State Director may authorize  automatic transfer of any sludge permit to a new permittee if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The current permittee notifies the Director at least 30 days in  advance of the proposed transfer date in paragraph (c)(1)(ii)(B) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The notice includes a written agreement between the existing and  new permittees containing a specific date for transfer of permit  responsibility, coverage, and liability between them; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Director does not notify the existing permittee and the  proposed new permittee of his or her intent to modify or revoke and  reissue the permit.

If  cause exists, the Director may modify or revoke and reissue the permit  and may request an updated application if necessary. When a permit is  modified, only the conditions subject to a modification are reopened. If  a permit is revoked and reissued, the entire permit is reopened and  subject to revision and the permit is reissued for a new term. A draft  permit must be prepared and other procedures in Sec. 501.15(d) followed.  If cause does not exist under this section, the Director shall not  modify or revoke and reissue the permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Causes for modification.

There are material and substantial alterations or  additions to the permitted facility or activity which occurred after  permit issuance which justify the application of permit conditions that  are different from or absent in the existing permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Information. The Director has received new information. Permits  may be modified during their terms for this cause only if the  information was not available at the time of permit issuance (other than  revised regulations, guidance, or test methods) and would have justified  the application of different permit conditions at the time of issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> New regulations. New regulations have been promulgated under  section 405(d) of the CWA, or the standards or regulations on which the  permit was based have been changed by promulgation of amended standards  or regulations or by judicial decision after the permit was issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Compliance schedules. The Director determines good cause exists  for modification of a compliance schedule, such as an Act of God,  strike, flood, or   materials shortage or other events over which the permittee has little  or no control and for which there is no reasonable available remedy.  However, in no case may a compliance schedule be modified to extend  beyond an applicable CWA statutory deadline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Land application plans. When required by a permit condition to  incorporate a land application plan for beneficial reuse of sewage  sludge, to revise an existing land application plan, or to add a land  application plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The following are causes to modify or alternatively, revoke  and reissue, a permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cause exists for termination under Sec. 501.15(c)(3) and the  Director determines that modification or revocation and reissuance is  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The Director has received notification (as required in the  permit, see Sec. 501.15(b)(12)(iii)) of a proposed transfer of the  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Termination of permits. The following are causes for terminating  a permit during its term, or for denying a permit renewal application:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Noncompliance by the permittee with any condition of the permit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The permittee's failure in the application or during the permit  issuance process to disclose fully all relevant facts, or the  permittee's misrepresentation of any relevant facts at any time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A determination that the permitted activity endangers human  health or the environment and can only be regulated to acceptable levels  by permit modification or termination; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A change in any condition that requires either a temporary or a  permanent reduction or elimination of any activity controlled by the  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Permit procedures.
