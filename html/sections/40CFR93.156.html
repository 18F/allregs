This comment period may be concurrent with any other public involvement, such as occurs in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. If the action has multi-regional or national impacts (e.g., the action will cause emission increases in excess of the de minimis levels identified in Sec. 93.153(b) in three or more of EPA's Regions), the Federal agency, as an alternative to publishing separate notices, can publish a notice in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Federal agency must document its response to all the comments received on its draft conformity determination under Sec. 93.154 and make the comments and responses available, subject to the limitation in paragraph (e) of this section, upon request by any person regarding a specific Federal action, within 30 days of the final conformity determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Federal agency must make public its final conformity determination under Sec. 93.154 for a Federal action by placing a notice by prominent advertisement in a daily newspaper of general circulation in the area affected by the action within 30 days of the final conformity determination.
