                                Sec. 140.80  Disclosure of information pursuant to a subpoena or summons.

                            <p class="depth0">The Commission shall provide notice to any person who has submitted  information to the Commission when a summons or subpoena seeking the  submitted information is received by the Commission. Notice ordinarily  will be provided by mailing a copy of the summons or subpoena to the  last known home or business address of the person who submitted the  information. However, under circumstances which would make notice by  mail unduly burdensome or costly, notice of the existence of the summons  or subpoena may be affected by alternative means such as publication in  the Federal Register. The Commission will not disclose such information  until the expiration of at least fourteen days from the date of mailing,  or such other notice as is given. This section shall not apply to   (a) Congressional subpoenas or Congressional requests for information,  (b) information which is considered by the Commission to be public  information, or (c) information as to which the submitter has waived the  notice provision of this section.  [49 FR 4464, Feb. 7, 1984]    Sec. 140.81  [Reserved]</p>
