The individual or organization is no longer entitled to access as a matter of law under the Privacy Act, 5 U.S.C. 552a, and 38 U.S.C. 5701 and 7332.

However, in such case, the Regional Office shall offer the individual or organization an opportunity to respond to the charges immediately after the temporary suspension.
