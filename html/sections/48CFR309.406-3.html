When an apparent cause for debarment becomes known, the initiating official shall prepare a report containing the information required by 309.470-2, along with a written recommendation, and forward it through appropriate acquisition channels, including the HCA, to the Associate DAS for Acquisition in accordance with 309.470-1. The debarring official shall initiate an investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision making process. The debarring official shall review the results of the investigation, if any, and make a written determination whether or not debarment procedures shall commence. The ASFR/OGAPA/DA shall promptly send a copy of the determination through appropriate acquisition channels to the initiating official and the Contracting Officer. If the debarring official determines that debarment procedures shall commence, the debarring official shall consult with OGC-GLD and then notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c). If the proposed action is not based on a conviction or judgment and the contractor's submission in response to the notice raises a genuine dispute over facts material to the proposed debarment, the debarring official shall arrange for fact-finding hearings and take the necessary action specified in FAR 9.406-3(b)(2). The debarring official shall also ensure that written findings of facts are prepared and shall base the debarment decisions on the facts as found, after considering information and argument submitted by the contractor and any other information in the administrative record. The OGC-GLD shall represent HHS at any fact-finding hearing and may present witnesses for HHS and question any witnesses presented by the contractor.</p>
