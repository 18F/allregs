                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Fees pursuant to the FOIA shall be assessed  according to the schedule contained in paragraph (b) of this section for  services rendered by the Office in responding to and processing requests  for records under this part. All fees so assessed shall be charged to  the requester, except when the charging of fees is limited under  paragraph (c) of this section or when a waiver or reduction of fees is  granted under paragraph (d) of this section. The Office shall collect  all applicable fees before making copies of requested records available  to a requester. Requesters shall pay fees by check or money order made  payable to the Treasury of the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charges. In responding to requests under this part, the  following fees shall be assessed, unless a waiver or reduction of fees  has been granted pursuant to paragraph (d) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Search. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No search fee shall be assessed with respect to  requests by educational institutions, noncommercial scientific  institutions, and representatives of the news media (as defined in  paragraphs (j)(6), (j)(7), and (j)(8) of this section, respectively).  Search fees shall be assessed with respect to all other requests,  subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this section. The Office  may assess fees for time spent searching even if it fails to locate any  respective record or when records located are subsequently determined to  be entirely exempt from disclosure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each quarter hour spent by clerical personnel in searching  for and retrieving a requested record, the fee shall be $2.25. When the  search and retrieval cannot be performed entirely by clerical  personnel--for example, when the identification of records within the  scope of the request requires the use of professional personnel--the fee  shall be $4.50 for each quarter hour of search time spent by such  professional personnel. When the time of managerial personnel is  required, the fee shall be $7.50 for each quarter hour of time spent by  such managerial personnel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For computer searches of records, which may be undertaken  through the use of existing programming, requesters shall be charged the  actual direct costs of conducting the search, although certain  requesters (as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section) shall be  entitled to the cost equivalent of two hours of manual search time  without charge. These direct costs shall include the cost of operating a  central processing unit for that portion of operating time that is  directly attributable to searching for records responsive to a request,  as well as the costs of operator/programmer salary apportionable to the  search (at no more than $4.50 per quarter hour of time so spent). The  Office is not required to alter or develop programming to conduct a  search.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Duplication. Duplication fees shall be assessed with respect to  all requesters, subject to the limitations of paragraph (c) of this  section. For a paper photocopy of a record (no more than one copy of  which need be supplied), the fee shall be $0.10 per page. For other  methods of duplication, the Office shall charge the actual direct costs  of duplicating a record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review. Review fees shall be assessed with respect to only those  requesters who seek records for a commercial use, as defined in  paragraph (j)(5) of this section. For each quarter hour spent by agency  personnel in reviewing a requested record for possible disclosure, the  fee shall be $4.50, except   that when the time of professional personnel is required, the fee shall  be $7.50 for each quarter hour of time spent by such managerial  personnel. Review fees shall be assessed only for the initial record  review, i.e., all of the review undertaken when the Office analyzes the  applicability of a particular exemption to a particular record or record  portion at the initial request level. No charge shall be assessed for  review at the administrative appeal level of an exemption already  applied. However, records or record portions withheld pursuant to an  exemption that is subsequently determined not to apply may be reviewed  again to determine the applicability of other exemptions not previously  considered. The costs of such a subsequent review are properly  assessable, particularly when that review is made necessary by a change  of circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations on charging fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No search or review fee shall  be charged for a quarter-hour period unless more than half of that  period is required for search or review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except for requesters seeking records for a commercial use (as  defined in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), the Office shall provide  without charge</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The first 100 pages of duplication (or its cost equivalent), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The first two hours of search (or its cost equivalent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever a total fee calculated under this section is $8.00 or  less, no fee shall be charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of paragraphs (c) (2) and (3) of this section  work together. For requesters other than those seeking records for a  commercial use, no fee shall be charged unless the cost of search in  excess of two hours plus the cost of duplication in excess of 100 pages  exceeds $8.00.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Waiver or reduction of fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records responsive to a request  under the FOIA shall be furnished without charge or at a charge reduced  below that established under paragraph (b) of this section when the  Officer determines, based upon information provided by a requester in  support of a fee waiver request or otherwise made known to the Office,  that disclosure of the requested information is in the public interest  because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding  of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily  in the commercial interest of the requester. Requests for a waiver or  reduction of fees shall be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In order to determine whether the first fee waiver requirement  is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is in the  public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to  public understanding of the operations or activities of government--the  Office shall consider the following four factors in sequence:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested  records concerns ``the operations or activities of the government.'' The  subject matter of the requested records, in the context of the request,  must specifically concern the identifiable operations of the federal  government--with a connection that is direct and clear, not remote or  attenuated. Furthermore, the records must be sought for their  informative value with respect to those government operations or  activities; a request for access to records for their intrinsic  informational content alone would not satisfy this threshold  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The informative value of the information to be disclosed:  Whether the disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding  or government operations or activities. The disclosable portions of  requested records must be meaningfully informative or specific  governmental operations or activities in order to hold potential for  contributing to increased public understanding of those operations and  activities. The disclosure of information that already is in the public  domain, in either a duplicative or a substantially identical form, would  not be likely to contribute to such understanding, as nothing new would  be added to the public record.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the  public likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the  requested information will contribute to ``public understanding.'' The  disclosure must contribute to the understanding of the public at large,  as opposed to the individual understanding of the requester or a narrow   segment of identified persons. A requester's identity and  qualifications--e.g., expertise in the subject area and ability and  intention to convey effectively information to the general public-- should be considered. It reasonably may be presumed that a  representative of the news media (as defined in paragraph (j)(8) of this  section) who has access to the means of public dissemination readily  will be able to satisfy this consideration. Requests from libraries or  other record repositories (or requesters who intend merely to  disseminate information to such institutions) shall be analyzed, like  those of other requesters, to identify a particular person who  represents that he actually will use the requested information in  scholarly or other analytic work and then disseminate it to the general  public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The significance of the contribution to public understanding:  Whether the disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to  public understanding of government operations or activities. The  public's understanding of the subject matter in question, as compared to  the level of public understanding existing prior to the disclosure, must  be likely to be enhanced by the disclosure to a significant extent. The  Office shall not make separate value judgments as to whether  information, even though it in fact would contribute significantly to  public understanding of the operations or activities of the government,  is ``important'' enough to be made public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In order to determine whether the second fee waiver requirement  is met--i.e., that disclosure of the requested information is not  primarily in the commercial interest of the requester--the Office shall  consider the following two factors in sequence:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest: Whether  the requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by the  requested disclosure. The Office shall consider all commercial interests  of the requester (with reference to the definition of ``commercial use''  in paragraph (j)(5) of this section), or any person on whose behalf the  requester may be acting, but shall consider only those interests that  would be furthered by the requested disclosure. In assessing the  magnitude of identified commercial interests, consideration shall be  given the role that such FOIA-disclosed information plays with respect  to those commercial interests, as well as to the extent to which FOIA  disclosures serve those interests overall. Requesters shall be given a  reasonable opportunity in the administrative process to provide  information bearing upon this consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The primary interest in disclosure: Whether the magnitude of  the identified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently  large, in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that  disclosure is ``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.''  A fee waiver or reduction is warranted only when, once the ``public  interest'' standard set out in paragraph (d)(2) of this section is  satisfied, that public interest can fairly be regarded as greater in  magnitude than that of the requester's commercial interest in  disclosure. The Office shall ordinarily presume that, where a news media  requester has satisfied the ``public interest'' standard, that will be  the interest primarily served by disclosure to that requester.  Disclosure to data brokers or others who compile and market governmental  information for direct economic return shall not be presumed to serve  primarily the ``public interest.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When only a portion of the requested records satisfies both of  the requirements for a waiver or reduction of fees under this paragraph,  a waiver or reduction shall be granted only as to that portion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Requests for the waiver or reduction of fees shall address each  of the factors listed in paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, as  they apply to each record request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notice of anticipated fees in excess of $25.00. When the Office  determines or estimates that the fees to be assessed under this section  may amount to more than $25.00, the Office shall notify the requester as  soon as practicable of the actual or estimated amount of the fees,  unless the requester has indicated in advance his willingness to pay  fees as high as those anticipated. (If only a portion of the fee can be  estimated readily, the Office shall advise the requester that the  estimated fee may be   only a portion of the total fee.) In cases when a requester has been  notified that actual or estimated fees may amount to more than $25.00,  the request will be deemed not to have been received until the requester  has agreed to pay the anticipated total fee. A notice to the requester  pursuant to this paragraph shall offer him the opportunity to confer  with Office personnel in order to reformulate his request to meet his  needs at a lower cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Aggregating requests. When the Office reasonably believes that a  requester or a group of requesters acting in concert is attempting to  divide a request into a series of requests for the purpose of evading  the assessment of fees, the Office may aggregate any such requests and  charge accordingly. The Office may presume that multiple requests of  this type made within a 30-day period have been made in order to evade  fees. When requests are separated by a longer period, the Office shall  aggregate them only when there exists a solid basis for determining that  such aggregation is warranted, e.g., when the requests involve clearly  related matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not  be aggregated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Advance payments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the Office estimates that a total fee  to be assessed under this section is likely to exceed $250.00, it may  require the requester to make an advance payment of an amount up to the  entire estimated fee before beginning to process the request, except  when it receives a satisfactory assurance of full payment from a  requester with a history of prompt payment or where a fee waiver, or  reduction of fees, has been requested. In the case where a fee waiver or  reduction of fees has been requested, the requester shall submit the  advance payment, if required by the agency. This prepayment will not  affect the Office's responsibility for speedy determination of the fee  waiver, or reduction of fees, nor be deemed in derogation of the request  for the fee waiver or reduction of fees. If the agency approves the fee  waiver, or reduction of fees, the appropriate sum will be reimbursed to  the requester, with no accumulated interest, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a requester has previously failed to pay a records access  fee within 30 days of the date of billing, the Office may require the  requester to pay the full amount owned, plus any applicable interest (as  provided for in paragraph (h) of this section), and to make an advance  payment of the full amount of may estimated fee before the Office begins  to process a new request or continues to process a pending request from  that requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For requests other than those described in paragraphs (g) (1)  and (2) of this section, the Office shall not require the requester to  make an advance payment, i.e., a payment made before work is commenced  or continued on a request. Payment owed for work already completed is  not an advance payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a component acts under paragraphs (g) (1) or (2) of this  section, the administrative time limits prescribed in subsection (a)(6)  of the FOIA for the processing of an initial request or an appeal, plus  permissible extensions of these time limits, shall be deemed not to  begin to run until the Office has received payment of the assessed fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Charging interest. The Office may assess interest charges on an  unpaid bill starting on the 31st day following the day on which the bill  was sent to the requester. Once a fee payment has been received by the  Office, even if not processed, the accrual of interest shall be stayed.  Interest charges shall be assessed at the rate prescribed in section  3717 of title 31 U.S.C. and shall accrue from the date of the billing.  The Office shall follow the provisions of the Debt Collection Act of  1982, Public Law 97-265 (Oct. 25, 1982), 96 Stat. 1749, and its  implementing procedures, including the use of consumer reporting  agencies, collection agencies, and offset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Other statutes specifically providing for fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fee  schedule of this section does not apply with respect to the charging of  fees under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of  fees for particular types of records--i.e., any statute that  specifically requires a government printing entity such as the  Government Printing Office or the National Technical Information Service  to set and collect fees for   particular types of records--in order to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Serve both the general public and private sector organizations  by conveniently making available government information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that groups and individuals pay the cost of publications  and other services that are for their special use so that these costs  are not borne by the general taxpaying public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operate an information-dissemination activity on a self- sustaining basis to the extent possible; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Return revenue to the Treasury for defraying, wholly or in  part, appropriated funds used to pay the cost of disseminating  government information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When records responsive to requests are maintained for  distribution by agencies operating statutorily based fee schedule  programs, the Office shall inform requesters of the steps necessary to  obtain records from those sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Definitions. For the purpose of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term direct costs means those expenditures that the Office  actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the case of  commercial use requesters, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA  request. Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee  performing the work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16  percent of that rate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating  duplicating machinery. Not included in direct costs are overhead  expenses such as costs of space and heating or lighting of the facility  in which the records are stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term search includes all time spent looking for material  that is responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line  identification of material within documents. The Office shall ensure,  however, that searches are undertaken in the most efficient and least  expensive manner reasonably possible; thus, for example, the Office  shall not engage in line-by-line search when merely duplicating an  entire document would be quicker and less expensive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term duplication refers to the process of making a copy of a  record necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take the  form of paper copy, microfilm, audio-visual materials, or machine- readable documentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk), among others. The  copy provided shall be in a form that is reasonably usable by  requesters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The term review refers to the process of examining a record  located in response to a request in order to determine whether any  portion of it is permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing  any record for disclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise  it and otherwise prepare it for release, although review costs shall be  recoverable even where there ultimately is no disclosure of a record.  Review time does not include time spent resolving general legal or  policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The term commercial use in the context of a request refers to a  request from or on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or  purpose that furthers the commercial, trade, or profit interests of the  requester or the person on whose behalf the request is made, which can  include furthering those interests through litigation. The Office shall  determine, as well as reasonably possible, the use to which a requester  will put the records requested. When the circumstances of a request  suggest that the requester will put the records sought to a commercial  use, either because of the nature of the request itself or because the  Office otherwise has reasonable cause to doubt a requester's stated use,  the Office shall provide the requester a reasonable opportunity to  submit further clarification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The term educational institution refers to a preschool, a public  or private elementary or secondary school, an institution of graduate  higher education, and institution of professional education, and an  institution of vocational education, which operates a program or  programs of scholarly research. To be eligible for inclusion in this  category, a requester must show that the request is being made as  authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institution and  that the records are not sought for a commercial use, but are   sought in furtherance of scholarly research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The term noncommercial scientific institution refers to an  institution that is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term  is referenced in paragraph (j)(5) of this section, and which is operated  solely for the purpose of conducting scientific research, the results of  which are not intended to promote any particular product or industry. To  be eligible for inclusion in this category, a requester must show that  the request is being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a  qualifying institution and that the records are not sought for a  commercial use, but are sought in furtherance of scientific research.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The term representative of the news media refers to any person  actively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated to  publish or broadcast news to the public. The term news means information  that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the  public. Examples of news media entities include television or radio  stations broadcasting to the public at large, and publishers of  periodicals (but only in those instances when they can qualify as  disseminators of ``news'') who make their products available for  purchase or subscription by the general public. For ``freelance''  journalists to be regarded as working for a news organization, they must  demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that  organization; a publication contract would be the clearest proof, but  the Office shall also look to the past publication record of a requester  in making this determination. To be eligible for inclusion in this  category, a requester also must not be seeking the requested records for  a commercial use. In this regard, a request for records supporting the  news dissemination function of the requester shall not be considered to  be for a commercial use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Charges for other services and materials. Apart from the other  provisions of this section, when the Office elects, as a matter of  administrative discretion, to comply with a request for a special  service or materials, such as certifying that records are true copies or  sending them other than by ordinary mail, the actual direct costs of  providing the service or materials shall be charged.</p>
