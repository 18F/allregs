This does not apply to actions categorically excluded. For all policy-making actions not categorically excluded, the head of the office or administration shall comply with the requirements of this part. Thus, for such actions, the office or administration head shall assume the responsibilities that a Regional Administrator assumes for a FEMA action in his/her respective region. For such policy-making actions taken by the Administrator of FEMA, the Environmental Officer shall assume the responsibilities that a Regional Administrator assumes for a FEMA action in his/her respective region.
