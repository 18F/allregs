                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Confidential Commercial Information obtained by the NCPC from a  Submitter shall be disclosed under the FOIA only in accordance with the  requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Submitter of Confidential Commercial Information shall use  good-faith efforts to designate, by appropriate markings, either at the  time of submission or at a reasonable time thereafter, any portions of  its submission that it considers to be protected from disclosure under  Exemption 4 of the FOIA. These designations will expire ten years after  the date of the submission unless the Submitter requests, and provides  justification for, a longer designation period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice shall be given to a Submitter of a FOIA Request for  potential Confidential Commercial Information if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requested information has been designated in good faith by  the Submitter as Confidential Commercial Information eligible for  protection from disclosure under Exemption 4 of the FOIA; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NCPC has reason to believe the requested information is  Confidential Commercial Information protected from disclosure under  Exemption 4 of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subject to the requirements of paragraphs (c) and (g) of this  section, the NCPC shall provide a Submitter with prompt written notice  of a FOIA Request or administrative appeal that seeks the Submitter's  Confidential Commercial Information. The notice shall give the Submitter  an opportunity to object to disclosure of any specified portion of that  Confidential Commercial Information pursuant to paragraph (e) of this  section. The notice shall either describe the Confidential Commercial  Information Requested or include copies of the Requested Records or  portions thereof containing the Confidential Commercial Information.  When notice to a large number of Submitters is required, NCPC may  provide notification by posting or publishing the notice in a place  reasonably likely to accomplish the intent of the notice requirement  such as a newspaper, newsletter, the NCPC Web site, or the Federal  Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The NCPC shall allow a Submitter a reasonable time to respond to  the notice described in paragraph (d) of this section and shall specify  within the notice the time period for response. If a Submitter has any  objection to disclosure, it shall submit a detailed written statement.  The statement must specify all grounds for withholding any portion of  the Confidential Commercial Information under any exemption of the FOIA  and, in the case of Exemption 4, it must show why the Confidential  Commercial Information is a trade secret or commercial or financial  information that is privileged or confidential. If the Submitter fails  to respond to the notice within the specified time, the NCPC shall  consider this failure to respond as no objection to disclosure of the  Confidential Commercial Information on the part of the Submitter, and  NCPC shall proceed to release the requested information. A statement  provided by the Submitter that is not received by NCPC until after the  NCPC's disclosure decision has been made shall not be considered by the  NCPC. Information provided by a Submitter under this paragraph may  itself be subject to disclosure under the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The NCPC shall consider a Submitter's objections and specific  grounds for nondisclosure in deciding whether to disclose Confidential  Commercial Information. Whenever the NCPC decides to disclose  Confidential Commercial Information over the the objection of a  Submitter, the NCPC shall give the Submitter written notice, which shall  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement of the reason(s) why each of the Submitter's  disclosure objections was not sustained;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of the Confidential Commercial Information to be  disclosed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A specified disclosure date, which shall be a reasonable time  subsequent to the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The notice requirements of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section shall not apply if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The NCPC determines that the Confidential Commercial Information  is exempt under FOIA;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Confidential Commercial Information has been published  lawfully or has been officially made available to the public;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Confidential Commercial Information's disclosure is required  by statute (other than the FOIA) or by a regulation issued in accordance  with   the requirements of Executive Order 12600 (Predisclosure Notification  Procedures for Confidential Commercial Information); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The designation made by the Submitter under paragraph (b) of  this section appears obviously frivolous in which case the NCPC shall,  within a reasonable time prior to a specified disclosure date, give the  Submitter written notice of any final decision to disclose the  Confidential Commercial Information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Whenever a Requester files a lawsuit seeking to compel the  disclosure of Confidential Commercial Information, the NCPC shall  promptly notify the Submitter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whenever the NCPC provides a Submitter with notice and an  opportunity to object to disclosure under paragraph (d) of this section,  the NCPC shall also notify the Requester. Whenever the NCPC notifies a  Submitter of its intent to disclose Requested Information under  paragraph (f) of this section, the NCPC shall also notify the Requester.  Whenever a Submitter files a lawsuit seeking to prevent the disclosure  of Confidential Commercial Information, the NCPC shall notify the  Requester.</p>
