                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A Certificate of Origin must be employed to certify that a textile or apparel article being exported from a CBTPA beneficiary country to the United States qualifies for the preferential treatment referred to in Sec. 10.221. The Certificate of Origin must be prepared by the exporter in the CBTPA beneficiary country in the form specified in paragraph (b) of this section. Where the CBTPA beneficiary country exporter is not the producer of the article, that exporter may complete and sign a Certificate of Origin on the basis of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Its reasonable reliance on the producer's written representation that the article qualifies for preferential treatment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A completed and signed Certificate of Origin for the article voluntarily provided to the exporter by the producer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Form of Certificate. The Certificate of Origin referred to in paragraph (a) of this section must be in the following format:

If there is more than one producer, attach a list stating the legal name and address (including country) of all additional producers. If this information is confidential, it is acceptable to state ``available to Customs upon request'' in block 2. If the producer and the exporter are the same, state ``same'' in block 2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Block 3 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the importer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In block 4, insert the letter that designates the preference group which applies to the article according to the description contained in the CFR provision cited on the Certificate for that group;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Block 5 should provide a full description of each article. The description should be sufficient to relate it to the invoice description and to the description of the article in the international Harmonized System. Include the invoice number as shown on the commercial invoice or, if the invoice number is not known, include another unique reference number such as the shipping order number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Blocks 6 through 10 must be completed only when the block in question calls for information that is relevant to the preference group identified in block 4;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Block 6 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the fabric producer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Block 7 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the yarn producer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Block 8 should state the legal name and address (including country) of the thread producer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Block 9 should state the name of the folklore article or should state that the article is handloomed or handmade of handloomed fabric;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Block 10 should be completed if the article described in block 5 incorporates a fabric or yarn described in preference group G and should state the name of the fabric or yarn that has been considered as being in short supply in the NAFTA or that has been designated as not available in commercial quantities in the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Block 11 must contain the signature of the exporter or of the exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Block 15 should reflect the date on which the Certificate was completed and signed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Block 16 should be completed if the Certificate is intended to cover multiple shipments of identical articles as described in block 5 that are imported into the United States during a specified period of up to one year (see Sec. 10.226(b)(4)(ii)). The ``from'' date is the date on which the Certificate became applicable to the article covered by the blanket Certificate (this date may be prior to the date reflected in block 15). The ``to'' date is the date on which the blanket period expires; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The Certificate may be printed and reproduced locally. If more space is needed to complete the Certificate, attach a continuation sheet.
