                            <p class="depth0">EPA will gather a panel of experts in analysis of chemical matrices  for HDDs/HDFs to review the protocols for testing submitted to EPA. The  panel members will be employees of EPA and/or of other U.S. Government  agencies who have had experience in analysis of chemical matrices and/or  chemical wastes for HDDs/HDFs. The panel will recommend to the Director,  EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics, whether the protocol  submitted is likely to allow analysis down to the target LOQs, or if  not, whether the protocol represents a good faith effort on the part of  the tester to achieve the   lowest possible LOQs. The final determination to accept or reject the  protocol will be made by the Director, Office of Pollution Prevention  and Toxics. EPA will review the submitted protocols as rapidly as  possible and will complete the review within 90 days after receipt. EPA  may require submission of revised protocols. Comments and  recommendations will be transmitted to the submitter, and if revisions  are required, a final protocol must be submitted to EPA within 90 days  after EPA transmits such recommendations.</p>
