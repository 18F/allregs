                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Agencies should establish and maintain appropriate follow-up  procedures to protect the Government's interest and to check that  subject inventions are identified and disclosed, and when appropriate,  patent applications are filed, and that the Government's rights therein  are established and protected. Follow-up activities for contracts that  include a clause referenced   in 27.304-2 should be coordinated with the appropriate agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The contracting officer administering the contract (or other  representative specifically designated in the contract for this purpose)  is responsible for receiving invention disclosures, reports,  confirmatory instruments, notices, requests, and other documents and  information submitted by the contractor pursuant to a patent rights  clause.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For other than confirmatory instruments, if the contractor fails  to furnish documents or information as called for by the clause within  the time required, the contracting officer shall promptly request the  contractor to supply the required documents or information. If the  failure persists, the contracting officer shall take appropriate action  to secure compliance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the contractor does not furnish confirmatory instruments  within 6 months after filing each patent application, or within 6 months  after submitting the invention disclosure if the application has been  previously filed, the contracting officer shall request the contractor  to supply the required documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The contracting officer shall promptly furnish all invention  disclosures, reports, confirmatory instruments, notices, requests, and  other documents and information relating to patent rights clauses to  legal counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting activities should establish appropriate procedures  to detect and correct failures by the contractor to comply with its  obligations under the patent rights clauses, such as failures to  disclose and report subject inventions, both during and after contract  performance. Government effort to review and correct contractor  compliance with its patent rights obligations should be directed  primarily toward contracts that are more likely to result in subject  inventions significant in number or quality. These contracts include  contracts of a research, developmental, or experimental nature;  contracts of a large dollar amount; and any other contracts when there  is reason to believe the contractor may not be complying with its  contractual obligations. Other contracts may be reviewed using a spot- check method, as feasible. Appropriate follow-up procedures and  activities may include the investigation or review of selected contracts  or contractors by those qualified in patent and technical matters to  detect failures to comply with contract obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Follow-up activities should include, where appropriate, use of  Government patent personnel--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To interview agency technical personnel to identify novel  developments made in contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To review technical reports submitted by contractors with  cognizant agency technical personnel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To check the Official Gazette of the United States Patent and  Trademark Office and other sources for patents issued to the contractor  in fields related to its Government contracts; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> To have cognizant Government personnel interview contractor  personnel regarding work under the contract involved, observe the work  on site, and inspect laboratory notebooks and other records of the  contractor related to work under the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a contractor or subcontractor does not have a clear  understanding of its obligations under the clause, or its procedures for  complying with the clause are deficient, the contracting officer should  explain to the contractor its obligations. The withholding of payments  provision (if any) of the patent rights clause may be invoked if the  contractor fails to meet the obligations required by the patents rights  clause. Significant or repeated failures by a contractor to comply with  the patent rights obligation in its contracts shall be documented and  made a part of the general file (see 4.801(c)(3)).</p>
