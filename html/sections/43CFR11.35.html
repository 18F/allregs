                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the authorized official determines under Sec. 11.34 that a  type A procedure is available, the authorized official must then decide  whether to use that procedure or use type B procedures. The authorized  official must make this decision by weighing the difficulty of  collecting site-specific data against the suitability of the averaged  data and simplifying assumptions in the type A procedure for the release  being assessed. The authorized official may use type B procedures if  they can be performed at a reasonable cost and if the increase in  accuracy provided by those procedures outweighs the increase in  assessment costs. Section 1, Volume I of the NRDAM/CME technical  document (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 11.18) lists the  simplifying assumptions made in the NRDAM/CME. Volumes III through IV of  the NRDAM/CME technical document list the data in the NRDAM/CME. Section  1, Volume I of the NRDAM/GLE technical document (incorporated by  reference, see Sec. 11.18) lists the simplifying assumptions made in  the NRDAM/GLE. Volume III of the NRDAM/GLE technical document lists the  data in the NRDAM/GLE.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The authorized official must use type B procedures rather than a  type A procedure whenever a potentially responsible party:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submits a written request for use of type B procedures along  with documentation of the reasons supporting the request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advances all reasonable costs of using type B procedures within  a time frame acceptable to the authorized official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there is no available type A procedure, the authorized  official must use type B procedures to calculate all damages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, the  authorized official may change the type of procedure used in light of  comments received on the Assessment Plan. [See Sec. 11.32(e)(2) to  determine if the authorized official must provide for additional public  review.] However, if the authorized official decides to use type B  procedures in lieu of a type A procedure, and cannot confirm exposure  under Sec. 11.37, the authorized official may not then use a type A  procedure.
