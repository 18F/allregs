                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed at 2014.201-670(c), the contracting officer shall  insert the following provision in applicable invitations for bids  (paragraph ``(f)'' of this provision is optional):</p><p class="depth0">Bid Evaluation (JAN 1993)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Award will be made to that responsive, responsible bidder within  the meaning of FAR Subpart 9.1 whose total bid amount, as set forth by  the bidder in Section B of this Invitation for Bid (IFB), constitutes  the lowest overall evaluated final contract price to the Government  based upon the requirements for the schedule. Bids will be evaluated for  purposes of award by first ascertaining the sum of the total amount for  each of the items specified in Section B of this solicitation. This will  constitute the bidder's ``Total Bid Amount.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bidders shall insert a definite price or indicate ``no charge''  in the blank space provided for each item and/or sub-item listed in  Section B. Unless expressly provided for in the bid, no additional  charge will be allowed for work performed under the contract other than  the unit prices stipulated for each item and/or sub-item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any bid which is materially unbalanced as to price for the  separate items specified in Section B of this IFB may be rejected as  nonresponsive. An unbalanced bid is defined as one which is based on  prices which, in the opinion of the NRC, are significantly less than  cost for some work and/or prices that may be significantly overstated  for other work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Separation charges, in any form, are not solicited. Bids  containing charges for discontinuance, termination, failure to exercise  an option, or for any other purpose will cause the bid to be rejected as  nonresponsive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A preaward on-site survey of the bidder's facilities, equipment,  etc., in accordance with FAR 9.105 and 9.106, may be made by  representatives of the Commission for the purpose of determining whether  the bidder is responsible within the meaning of FAR 9.1, and whether the  bidder possesses qualifications that are conducive to the production of  work that will meet the requirements, specifications, and provisions of  this contract. If requested by the Commission, the prospective  contractor may also be required to submit statements within * hours  after receiving the request:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Concerning their ability to meet any of the minimum standards  set forth in FAR 9.104,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Samples of work, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Names and addresses of additional clients, Government agencies,  and/or commercial firms which the bidder is now doing or had done  business with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (b) of this section, the award of any  contract resulting from this solicitation will be made on an ``all or  none'' basis. Thus, bids submitted on fewer than the items listed in  Section B of this IFB, or on fewer than the estimated quantity, will  cause the bid to be rejected as nonresponsive.</p><p class="depth2">*To be inserted into solicitation.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)</p>
