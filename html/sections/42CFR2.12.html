                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restrictions on disclosure. The restrictions on  disclosure in   these regulations apply to any information, whether or not recorded,  which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Would identify a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser either  directly, by reference to other publicly available information, or  through verification of such an identification by another person; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is drug abuse information obtained by a federally assisted drug  abuse program after March 20, 1972, or is alcohol abuse information  obtained by a federally assisted alcohol abuse program after May 13,  1974 (or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by a  federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program after that date as part  of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date) for the  purpose of treating alcohol or drug abuse, making a diagnosis for that  treatment, or making a referral for that treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restriction on use. The restriction on use of information to  initiate or substantiate any criminal charges against a patient or to  conduct any criminal investigation of a patient (42 U.S.C. 290ee-3(c),  42 U.S.C. 290dd-3(c)) applies to any information, whether or not  recorded which is drug abuse information obtained by a federally  assisted drug abuse program after March 20, 1972, or is alcohol abuse  information obtained by a federally assisted alcohol abuse program after  May 13, 1974 (or if obtained before the pertinent date, is maintained by  a federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program after that date as  part of an ongoing treatment episode which extends past that date), for  the purpose of treating alcohol or drug abuse, making a diagnosis for  the treatment, or making a referral for the treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Federal assistance. An alcohol abuse or drug abuse program is  considered to be federally assisted if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and (c)(2) of this section relating to the  Veterans' Administration and the Armed Forces);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It is being carried out under a license, certification,  registration, or other authorization granted by any department or agency  of the United States including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Certification of provider status under the Medicare program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Authorization to conduct methadone maintenance treatment (see  21 CFR 291.505); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Registration to dispense a substance under the Controlled  Substances Act to the extent the controlled substance is used in the  treatment of alcohol or drug abuse;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is supported by funds provided by any department or agency of  the United States by being:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A recipient of Federal financial assistance in any form,  including financial assistance which does not directly pay for the  alcohol or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral activities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conducted by a State or local government unit which, through  general or special revenue sharing or other forms of assistance,  receives Federal funds which could be (but are not necessarily) spent  for the alcohol or drug abuse program; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It is assisted by the Internal Revenue Service of the Department  of the Treasury through the allowance of income tax deductions for  contributions to the program or through the granting of tax exempt  status to the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Veterans' Administration. These regulations do  not apply to information on alcohol and drug abuse patients maintained  in connection with the Veterans' Administration provisions of hospital  care, nursing home care, domiciliary care, and medical services under  title 38, United States Code. Those records are governed by 38 U.S.C.  4132 and regulations issued under that authority by the Administrator of  Veterans' Affairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Armed Forces. These regulations apply to any information  described in paragraph (a) of this section which was obtained by any  component of the Armed Forces during a period when the patient was  subject to the Uniform Code of Military Justice except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any interchange of that information within the Armed Forces; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any interchange of that information between the Armed Forces  and   those components of the Veterans Administration furnishing health care  to veterans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Communication within a program or between a program and an  entity having direct administrative control over that program. The  restrictions on disclosure in these regulations do not apply to  communications of information between or among personnel having a need  for the information in connection with their duties that arise out of  the provision of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of  alcohol or drug abuse if the communications are</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Within a program or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Between a program and an entity that has direct administrative  control over the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Qualified Service Organizations. The restrictions on disclosure  in these regulations do not apply to communications between a program  and a qualified service organization of information needed by the  organization to provide services to the program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Crimes on program premises or against program personnel. The  restrictions on disclosure and use in these regulations do not apply to  communications from program personnel to law enforcement officers  which--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are directly related to a patient's commission of a crime on the  premises of the program or against program personnel or to a threat to  commit such a crime; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are limited to the circumstances of the incident, including the  patient status of the individual committing or threatening to commit the  crime, that individual's name and address, and that individual's last  known whereabouts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Reports of suspected child abuse and neglect. The restrictions  on disclosure and use in these regulations do not apply to the reporting  under State law of incidents of suspected child abuse and neglect to the  appropriate State or local authorities. However, the restrictions  continue to apply to the original alcohol or drug abuse patient records  maintained by the program including their disclosure and use for civil  or criminal proceedings which may arise out of the report of suspected  child abuse and neglect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability to recipients of information--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Restriction on  use of information. The restriction on the use of any information  subject to these regulations to initiate or substantiate any criminal  charges against a patient or to conduct any criminal investigation of a  patient applies to any person who obtains that information from a  federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse program, regardless of the  status of the person obtaining the information or of whether the  information was obtained in accordance with these regulations. This  restriction on use bars, among other things, the introduction of that  information as evidence in a criminal proceeding and any other use of  the information to investigate or prosecute a patient with respect to a  suspected crime. Information obtained by undercover agents or informants  (see Sec.  2.17) or through patient access (see Sec.  2.23) is subject  to the restriction on use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restrictions on disclosures--Third party payers, administrative  entities, and others. The restrictions on disclosure in these  regulations apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Third party payers with regard to records disclosed to them by  federally assisted alcohol or drug abuse programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Entities having direct administrative control over programs  with regard to information communicated to them by the program under  Sec.  2.12(c)(3); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Persons who receive patient records directly from a federally  assisted alcohol or drug abuse program and who are notified of the  restrictions on redisclosure of the records in accordance with Sec.   2.32 of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Explanation of applicability--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coverage. These regulations  cover any information (including information on referral and intake)  about alcohol and drug abuse patients obtained by a program (as the  terms ``patient'' and ``program'' are defined in Sec.  2.11) if the  program is federally assisted in any manner described in Sec.  2.12(b).  Coverage includes, but is not limited to, those treatment or  rehabilitation programs, employee assistance programs, programs within  general hospitals, school-based programs, and private practitioners who  hold themselves out as   providing, and provide alcohol or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or  referral for treatment. However, these regulations would not apply, for  example, to emergency room personnel who refer a patient to the  intensive care unit for an apparent overdose, unless the primary  function of such personnel is the provision of alcohol or drug abuse  diagnosis, treatment or referral and they are identified as providing  such services or the emergency room has promoted itself to the community  as a provider of such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal assistance to program required. If a patient's alcohol  or drug abuse diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment is not  provided by a program which is federally conducted, regulated or  supported in a manner which constitutes Federal assistance under Sec.   2.12(b), that patient's record is not covered by these regulations.  Thus, it is possible for an individual patient to benefit from Federal  support and not be covered by the confidentiality regulations because  the program in which the patient is enrolled is not federally assisted  as defined in Sec.  2.12(b). For example, if a Federal court placed an  individual in a private for-profit program and made a payment to the  program on behalf of that individual, that patient's record would not be  covered by these regulations unless the program itself received Federal  assistance as defined by Sec.  2.12(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information to which restrictions are applicable. Whether a  restriction is on use or disclosure affects the type of information  which may be available. The restrictions on disclosure apply to any  information which would identify a patient as an alcohol or drug abuser.  The restriction on use of information to bring criminal charges against  a patient for a crime applies to any information obtained by the program  for the purpose of diagnosis, treatment, or referral for treatment of  alcohol or drug abuse. (Note that restrictions on use and disclosure  apply to recipients of information under Sec.  2.12(d).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> How type of diagnosis affects coverage. These regulations cover  any record of a diagnosis identifying a patient as an alcohol or drug  abuser which is prepared in connection with the treatment or referral  for treatment of alcohol or drug abuse. A diagnosis prepared for the  purpose of treatment or referral for treatment but which is not so used  is covered by these regulations. The following are not covered by these  regulations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Diagnosis which is made solely for the purpose of providing  evidence for use by law enforcement authorities; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A diagnosis of drug overdose or alcohol intoxication which  clearly shows that the individual involved is not an alcohol or drug  abuser (e.g., involuntary ingestion of alcohol or drugs or reaction to a  prescribed dosage of one or more drugs).
