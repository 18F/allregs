                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The definition of domestic service employment contained in Sec.  552.3 is derived from the regulations issued under the Social Security  Act (20 CFR 404.1057) and from ``the generally accepted meaning'' of the  term. Accordingly, the term includes persons who are frequently referred  to as ``private household workers.'' See. S. Rep. 93-690, p. 20. The  domestic service must be performed in or about a private home whether  that home is a fixed place of abode or a temporary dwelling as in the  case of an individual or family traveling on vacation. A separate and  distinct dwelling maintained by an individual or a family in an  apartment house, condominium or hotel may constitute a private home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employees employed in dwelling places which are primarily  rooming or boarding houses are not considered domestic service  employees. The places where they work are not private homes but  commercial or business establishments. Likewise, employees employed in  connection with a business or professional service which is conducted in  a home (such as a real estate, doctor's, dentist's or lawyer's office)  are not domestic service employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In determining the total hours worked, the employer must include  all time the employee is required to be on the premises or on duty and  all time the employee is suffered or permitted to work. Special rules  for live-in domestic service employees are set forth in Sec. 552.102.  [40 FR 7405, Feb. 20, 1975, as amended at 60 FR 46768, Sept. 8, 1995; 78  FR 60557, Oct. 1, 2013]</p>
