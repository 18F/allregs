Unless the Secretary disagrees with the order as drafted for his or her signature by the examiner, as provided in Sec. 47.19(d), the Secretary shall issue as his or her order the order so prepared by the examiner. If the Secretary deems it advisable to do so, the Secretary may direct that the order be served upon the parties as a tentative order and that the parties be allowed such period of time, not to exceed 20 days, as the Secretary may specify, within which to file exceptions thereto and written argument or briefs in support of such exceptions.
