                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Entry of articles brought into the United States temporarily  and claimed to be exempt from duty under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII,  Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), unless covered  by an A.T.A. carnet or a TECRO/AIT carnet as provided in part 114 of  this chapter, shall be made on Customs Form 3461 or 7533, supported by  the documentation required by Sec. 142.3 of this chapter. However, when  Sec. 10.36 or Sec. 10.36a is applicable, or the aggregate value of the  article is not over $250, the form prescribed for the informal entry of  importations by mail, in baggage, or by other means, may be used. When  entry is made on Customs Form 3461 or 7533, an entry summary, Customs  Form 7501, shall be filed within 10 days after time of entry, in  accordance with subpart B, part 142 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If Customs Form 7501 is filed at time of entry, it shall serve  as both the entry and entry summary, and Customs Form 3461 or 7533 shall  not be required. Customs Form 7501 shall be in original only, except for  entries under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS, which require a duplicate  copy for statistical purposes. When articles are entered under an A.T.A.  carnet or a TECRO/AIT carnet, the importation voucher of the carnet  shall serve as the entry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In addition to the data usually shown on a regular consumption  entry summary, each temporary importation bond entry summary shall  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The HTSUS subheading number under which entry is claimed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the use to be made of the articles in sufficient  detail to enable the port director to determine whether they are  entitled to entry as claimed, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A declaration that the articles are not to be put to any other  use and that they are not imported for sale or sale on approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The port director, if he is satisfied as to the importer's  identity and good faith, may admit a vehicle or craft brought in by a  nonresident to take part in a race or other specific contest for which  no money purse is awarded, under the provisions of subheading  9813.00.35, HTSUS, without formal entry or security for exportation. If  at the time of arrival it appears that the article is likely to remain  in the United States beyond 90 days, formal entry and bond shall be  taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When any article has been admitted without formal entry or  security for exportation and the importer thereafter desires to prolong  his stay beyond 90 days, an entry covering the article and security for  its exportation shall be accepted at any port where the article may be  presented for entry. The time during which the imported article may  remain in the United States under the entry shall be computed from the  date of its original arrival in the United States. The estimated duties  for the purpose of fixing the amount of any bond required by paragraph  (f) of this section shall be the estimated duties which would have been  required to be deposited had the article been entered under an ordinary  consumption entry on the date of the original arrival.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The entry or invoice shall: (1) Describe each article in detail;  (2) set forth the value of each article; and (3) set forth any marks or  numbers thereon or other distinguishing features thereof. In the case of  a vehicle, aircraft, or pleasure boat entered under subheading  9813.00.05, HTSUS and Sec. 10.36a, the registration number, and engine  or motor number, and the body number (if available) shall also be shown  on the entry. Examination of the imported articles shall be made  whenever the circumstances warrant, and occasionally in any event to an  extent which will enable the Customs officer to determine that the  importation is in agreement with the invoice or entry as to identity and  quantity and for the purpose of accepting the entry under the applicable  provisions of   Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS. No examination for the purpose of  appraisement and no appraisement of the articles shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> With the exceptions stated herein, a bond shall be given on  Customs Form 301, containing the bond conditions set forth in Sec.  113.62 of this chapter, in an amount equal to double the duties,  including fees, which it is estimated would accrue (or such larger  amount as the port director shall state in writing or by the electronic  equivalent to the entrant is necessary to protect the revenue) had all  the articles covered by the entry been entered under an ordinary  consumption entry. In the case of samples solely for use in taking  orders entered under subheading 9813.00.20, HTSUS, motion-picture  advertising films entered under subheading 9813.00.25, HTSUS, and  professional equipment, tools of trade and repair components for such  equipment or tools entered under subheading 9813.00.50, HTSUS, the bond  required to be given shall be in an amount equal to 110 percent of the  estimated duties, including fees, determined at the time of entry. If  appropriate a carnet, under the provisions of part 114 of this chapter,  may be filed in lieu of a bond on Customs Form 301 (containing the bond  conditions set forth in Sec. 113.62 of this chapter). Cash deposits in  the amount of the bond may be accepted in lieu of sureties. When the  articles are entered under subheading 9813.00.05, 9813.00.20, or  9813.00.50, HTSUS without formal entry, as provided for in Sec. Sec.  10.36 and 10.36a, or the amount of the bond taken under any subheading  of Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS, is less than $25, the bond shall  be without surety or cash deposit, and the bond shall be modified to so  indicate. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision of this  paragraph, in the case of professional equipment necessary for carrying  out the business activity, trade or profession of a business person,  equipment for the press or for sound or television broadcasting,  cinematographic equipment, articles imported for sports purposes and  articles intended for display or demonstration, if brought into the  United States by a resident of Canada, Mexico, Singapore, Chile,  Morocco, Australia, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, the  Dominican Republic, Costa Rica, Bahrain, Oman, Peru, the Republic of  Korea, Colombia, or Panama and entered under Chapter 98, Subchapter  XIII, HTSUS, no bond or other security will be required if the entered  article is a good originating, within the meaning of General Notes 12,  25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, and 35, HTSUS, in the country of  which the importer is a resident.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Claim for free entry under Chapter 98, Subchapter XIII, HTSUS  may be made for articles of any character described therein which have  been previously entered under any other provision of law and the entry  amended accordingly upon compliance with the requirements of this  section, provided the articles have not been released from CBP custody,  or even though released from CBP custody if it is established that the  original entry was made on the basis of a clerical error, mistake of  fact, or other inadvertence within the meaning of section 514(a), Tariff  Act of 1930, as amended, and was brought to the attention of CBP within  the time limits of that section. If an entry is so amended, the period  of time during which the merchandise may remain in the customs territory  of the United States under bond shall be computed from the date of  importation. In the case of articles covered by an informal mail entry,  such a claim may be made within a reasonable time either before or after  the articles have been released from CBP custody.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After the entry and bond have been accepted, the articles may be  released to the importer. The entry shall not be liquidated as the  transaction does not involve liquidated duties. However, a TIB importer  may be required to file an entry for consumption and pay duties, or pay  liquidated damages under its bond for a failure to do so, in the case of  merchandise imported under subheading 9813.00.05, HTSUS, and  subsequently exported to Canada or Mexico (see Sec. 181.53 of this  chapter).
