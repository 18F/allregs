                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determination by the Administrator. The Administrator has  determined that the application of one or more of the designated  phytosanitary measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section to certain  fruits and vegetables mitigates the risk posed by those commodities, and  that such articles may be moved interstate subject to one or more of  those measures, as provided in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section.  The name and origin of all fruits and vegetables authorized movement  under this section, as well as the applicable requirements for their  movement, may be found on the Internet at http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ import_export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads/hawaii.pdf or http:// www.aphis.usda.gov/import_export/plants/manuals/ports/downloads/ puerto_rico.pdf. Fruits or vegetables that require phytosanitary  measures other than one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures  cited in paragraph (b) of this section may only be moved in accordance  with applicable requirements in Sec. 318.13-3 and regulated article- specific requirements contained elsewhere in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Designated phytosanitary measures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fruits and vegetables  are inspected in the State of origin or in the first State of arrival.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fruits and vegetables originated from a pest-free area in  the State of origin and the grower from which the fruit or vegetable  originated has entered into a compliance agreement with the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The fruits and vegetables are treated in accordance with part  305 of this chapter and the treatment is certified by an inspector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The fruits and vegetables articles are inspected and certified  in the State of origin by an inspector and have been found free of one  or more specific quarantine pests identified by risk analysis as likely  to follow the pathway.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The fruits and vegetables are moved as commercial consignments  only.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The fruits and vegetables may be distributed only within a  defined area and the boxes or containers in which the fruit or  vegetables are distributed must be marked to indicate the applicable  distribution restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fruits and vegetables authorized for interstate movement under  this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Previously approved fruits and vegetables. Fruits and  vegetables that were authorized movement under this subpart either  administratively or by specific regulation as of February 17, 2009 and  that were subject only to one or more of the designated phytosanitary  measures cited in paragraph (b) of this section and the general  requirements of Sec. 318.13-3 may continue to be moved interstate under  the same requirements that applied before February 17, 2009, except as  provided in paragraph (d) of this section. The interstate movement  conditions for those fruits and vegetables that were authorized movement  under this subpart subject to additional measures beyond the designated  measures in paragraph (b) of this section can be found in Sec. 318.13- 16 or one of the commodity-specific sections in this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables that do not  meet the criteria in paragraph (c)(1) of this section may be authorized  movement under this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pest risk analysis. The risk posed by the particular article  from a specified State has been evaluated and publicly communicated as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Availability of pest risk analysis. APHIS published in the  Federal Register, for a public comment period of 60 days, a notice  announcing the availability of a pest risk analysis that evaluated the  risks associated with the movement of the particular fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Determination of risk; factors considered. The Administrator  determined, and announced in the notice referred to in the previous  paragraph, that, based on the information available, the application of  one or more of the designated phytosanitary measures described in  paragraph (b) of this section is sufficient to mitigate the risk that  plant pests or noxious weeds could be introduced into or disseminated  elsewhere within the United States by the fruit or vegetable. In order  for the Administrator to make the determination described in this  paragraph, he or she   must conclude based on the information presented in the risk analysis  for the fruit or vegetable that the risk posed by each quarantine pest  associated with the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin is  mitigated by one or more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with the fruit or  vegetable in the State of origin, but the pest can be easily detected  via inspection in the State of origin or in the State of first arrival;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pest freedom. No quarantine pests are known to be associated  with the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, or a quarantine pest  is associated with the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin but the  fruit or vegetable originates from an area that meets the requirements  of Sec. 318.13-5 for pest freedom;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effectiveness of treatment. A quarantine pest is associated with  the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the  pest can be reduced by applying an approved post-harvest treatment to  the fruit or vegetable;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Predeparture inspection. A quarantine pest is associated with  the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the fruit or  vegetable is subject to predeparture inspection;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Commercial consignments. A quarantine pest is associated with  the fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the  pest can be reduced by commercial practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Limited distribution. A quarantine pest is associated with the  fruit or vegetable in the State of origin, but the risk posed by the  pest can be reduced by limiting distribution of the fruit or vegetable  and labeling boxes containing the fruit or vegetable with those  distribution instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Administrator's decision. The Administrator will announce his  or her decision in a subsequent Federal Register notice. If appropriate,  APHIS would begin allowing the interstate movement of the fruits or  vegetables subject to requirements specified in the notice because:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> No comments were received on the pest risk analysis;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The comments on the pest risk analysis revealed that no changes  to the pest risk analysis were necessary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Changes to the pest risk analysis were made in response to  public comments, but the changes did not affect the overall conclusions  of the analysis and the Administrator's determination of risk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amendment of interstate movement requirements. If, after  February 17, 2009, the Administrator determines that one or more of the  designated phytosanitary measures is not sufficient to mitigate the risk  posed by any fruit or vegetable authorized interstate movement under  this section, APHIS will prohibit or further restrict the interstate  movement of the fruit or vegetable pending resolution of the situation.  If APHIS concludes that a permanent change to the interstate movement  requirements of a particular fruit or vegetable is necessary, APHIS will  also publish a notice in the Federal Register advising the public of its  finding. The notice will specify the amended interstate movement  requirements, provide an effective date for the change, and invite  public comment on the subject.
