                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At any time after the filing of a complaint, a party may move,  with or without supporting affidavits (which, for purposes of this part,  shall include declarations under penalty of perjury), for a summary  decision on any issue in the hearing. The other party may, within 30  days after service of the motion, which may be extended for an  additional 10 days for good cause, serve opposing affidavits or  countermove for summary decision.</p><p class="depth2">The presiding officer may set the matter for argument and call for  the submission of briefs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The presiding officer shall grant the motion if the pleadings,  affidavits, and other material filed in the record, or matters  officially noticed, show that there is no genuine issue as to any  material fact and that the party is entitled to summary decision as a  matter of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Affidavits shall set forth only such facts as would be  admissible in evidence and shall show affirmatively that the affiant is  competent to testify to the matters stated. When a motion for summary  decision is made and supported as provided in this regulation, a   party opposing the motion may not rest on mere allegations or denials or  general descriptions of positions and contentions; affidavits or other  responses must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine  issue of material fact for the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, on motion under this section, a summary decision is not  rendered on all issues or for all the relief asked, and if additional  facts need to be developed, the presiding officer will issue an order  specifying the facts that appear without substantial controversy and  directing further evidentiary proceedings on facts still at issue. The  facts specified not to be at issue shall be deemed established.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 17.18, a party may not obtain  interlocutory review by the entity deciding the appeal (currently the  DAB) of a partial summary decision of the presiding officer. A review of  final summary decisions on all issues may be had through the procedure  set forth in Sec. 17.47.</p>
