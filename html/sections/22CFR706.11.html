                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How to submit. To make a request for  records not covered under Section 706.10, a requester must submit a  written request to OPIC's FOIA Office either by mail to Overseas Private  Investment Corporation, 1100 New York Avenue NW., Washington, DC 20527  or electronic mail to FOIA@opic.gov. The envelope or subject line should  read ``Freedom of Information Request'' to ensure proper routing. The  request is considered received by OPIC upon actual receipt by OPIC's  FOIA Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records about oneself. A requester who is making a request for  records about himself or herself must verify his or her identity by  providing a notarized statement or a statement under 28 U.S.C. 1746, a  law that permits statements to be made under penalty of perjury as a  substitute for notarization, stating that the requester is the person he  or she claims to be.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records about a third party. Where a request for records  pertains to a third party, a requester may receive greater access by  submitting a notarized authorization signed by that individual, a  declaration by that individual made in compliance with the requirements  set forth in 28 U.S.C. 1746 authorizing disclosure of the records to the  requester, proof of guardianship, or proof that the individual is  deceased (e.g., a copy of a death certificate or an obituary). OPIC may  require a requester to supply additional information if necessary in  order to verify that a particular individual has consented to  disclosure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of records sought. Requesters must describe the  records sought in sufficient detail to enable OPIC personnel to locate  them with a reasonable amount of effort. To the extent possible,  requesters should include specific information that may assist OPIC in  identifying the requested   records, such as the project name, contract number, date or date range,  country, title, name, author, recipient, subject matter of the record,  or reference number. In general, requesters should include as much  detail as possible about the specific records or the types of records  sought. If a requester fails to reasonably describe the records sought,  OPIC will inform the requester what additional information is needed or  why the request is deficient. Any time you spend clarifying your request  in response to OPIC's inquiry is excluded from the 20 working-day period  (or any extension of this period) that OPIC has to respond to your  request. Requesters who are attempting to reformulate or modify such a  request may discuss their request with a FOIA Officer or a FOIA Public  Liaison. When a requester fails to provide sufficient detail after  having been asked to clarify a request OPIC shall notify the requester  that the request has not been properly made and that no further action  will be taken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Format. You may state the format (paper copies, electronic  scans, etc.) in which you would like OPIC to provide the requested  records. If you do not state a preference, you will receive any released  records in the format most convenient to OPIC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Requester information. You must include your name, mailing  address, and telephone number. You may also provide your electronic mail  address, which will allow OPIC to contact you quickly to discuss your  request and respond to your request electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fees. You must state your willingness to pay fees under these  regulations or, alternately, your willingness to pay up to a specified  limit. If you believe that you qualify for a partial or total fee waiver  under Sec. 706.24 you should request a waiver and provide justification  as required by Sec. 706.24. If your request does not contain a  statement of your willingness to pay fees or a request for a fee waiver,  OPIC will consider your request an agreement to pay up to $25.00 in  fees.</p>
