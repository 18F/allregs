                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and purpose. This section requires each insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets to submit periodically to the FDIC a plan for the resolution of such institution in the event of its failure. This section also establishes the rules and requirements regarding the submission and content of a resolution plan as well as procedures for review by the FDIC of a resolution plan. This section requires a covered insured depository institution to submit a resolution plan that should enable the FDIC, as receiver, to resolve the institution under Sections 11 and 13 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (``FDI Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1821 and 1823, in a manner that ensures that depositors receive access to their insured deposits within one business day of the institution's failure (two business days if the failure occurs on a day other than Friday), maximizes the net present value return from the sale or disposition of its assets and minimizes the amount of any loss realized by the creditors in the resolution. This rule is intended to ensure that the FDIC has access to all of the material information it needs to resolve efficiently a covered insured depository institution in the event of its failure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--(1) Affiliate has the same meaning given such term in Section 3(w)(6) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Affiliate has the same meaning given such term in Section 3(w)(6) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(w)(6).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Company has the same meaning given such term in Sec. 362.2(d) of the FDIC's Regulations, 12 CFR 362.2(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Core business lines means those business lines of the covered insured depository institution (``CIDI''), including associated operations, services, functions and support, that, in the view of the CIDI, upon failure would result in a material loss of revenue, profit, or franchise value.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Covered insured depository institution (``CIDI'') means an insured depository institution with $50 billion or more in total assets, as determined based upon the average of the institution's four most recent Reports of Condition and Income or Thrift Financial Reports, as applicable to the insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Critical services means services and operations of the CIDI, such as servicing, information technology support and operations, human resources and personnel that are necessary to continue the day-to-day operations of the CIDI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Foreign-based company means any company that is not incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Insured depository institution shall have the meaning given such term in Section 3(c)(2) of the FDI Act, 12 U.S.C. 1813(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Material entity means a company that is significant to the activities of a critical service or core business line.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Parent company means the company that controls, directly or indirectly, an insured depository institution.
