                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contingency is that part of a budget estimate of future costs (typically of large construction projects, IT systems, or other items as approved by the HHS awarding agency) which is associated with possible events or conditions arising from causes the precise outcome of which is indeterminable at the time of estimate, and that experience shows will likely result, in aggregate, in additional costs for the approved activity or project. Amounts for major project scope changes, unforeseen risks, or extraordinary events may not be included.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> It is permissible for contingency amounts other than those excluded in paragraph (a) of this section to be explicitly included in budget estimates, to the extent they are necessary to improve the precision of those estimates. Amounts must be estimated using broadly-accepted cost estimating methodologies, specified in the budget documentation of the Federal award, and accepted by the HHS awarding agency. As such, contingency amounts

are to be included in the Federal award. In order for actual costs incurred to be allowable, they must comply with the cost principles and other requirements in this part (see also Sec. Sec. 75.300 through 75.309 of subpart D of this part and 75.403); be necessary and reasonable for proper and efficient accomplishment of project or program objectives, and be verifiable from the non-Federal entity's records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payments made by the HHS awarding agency to the non-Federal entity's ``contingency reserve'' or any similar payment made for events the occurrence of which cannot be foretold with certainty as to the time or intensity, or with an assurance of their happening, are unallowable, except as noted in Sec. Sec. 75.431 and 75.447.</p>
