To qualify for an uninspected fishing  industry vessel endorsement, the applicant must satisfy the training and  examination requirements of Sec. 11.201(h)(1) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An applicant for an endorsement as master of uninspected fishing  industry vessels must have 4 years of total service on ocean or near- coastal routes. Service on Great Lakes or inland waters may substitute  for up to 2 years of the required service. One year of the required  service must have been as master, mate, or equivalent position while  holding a license or MMC endorsement as master or mate of self-propelled  vessels, or master or mate (pilot) of towing vessels, or OUPV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To qualify for an endorsement for less than 500 GRT, at least 2  years of the required service, including the 1 year as master, mate, or  equivalent, must have been on vessels of 50 GRT or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To qualify for an endorsement for less than 1,600 GRT, at least  2 years of the required service, including the 1 year as master, mate,  or equivalent, must have been on vessels of 100 GRT or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To qualify for an endorsement for more than 1,600 GRT, but not  more than 5,000 GRT, the vessel tonnage upon which the 4 years of  required service was obtained will be used to compute the tonnage. The  endorsement is limited to the maximum tonnage on which at least 25  percent of the required service was obtained or 150 percent of the  maximum tonnage on which at least 50 percent of the service was  obtained, whichever is higher. Limitations are in multiples of 1,000  GRT, using the next higher figure when an intermediate tonnage is  calculated. An endorsement as master of uninspected fishing industry  vessels authorizing service on vessels more than 1,600 GRT also requires  1 year as master, mate, or equivalent on vessels of 100 GRT or more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The tonnage limitation for this endorsement may be raised using  one of the following methods but cannot exceed 5,000 GRT.

Service on Great Lakes or inland waters may substitute  for up to 18 months of the required service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To qualify for an endorsement of less than 500 GRT, at least 1  year of the required service must have been on vessels of 50 GRT or  more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To qualify for an endorsement of less than 1,600 GRT, at least 1  year of the required service must have been on vessels of 100 GRT or  more.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To qualify for an endorsement of more than 1,600 GRT, but not  more than 5,000 GRT, the vessel tonnage upon which the 3 years of  required service was obtained will be used to compute the tonnage.
