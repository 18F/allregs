                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this section is to reduce collisions at highway-rail grade crossings in the ten States that have had the most highway-rail grade crossing collisions, on average, during the calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008. This section does not restrict any other State, or other entity, from adopting a highway-rail grade crossing action plan. This section also does not restrict any of the States required to develop action plans under this section from adopting a highway-rail grade crossing action plan with additional or more stringent requirements not inconsistent with this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application. This section applies to the ten States that have had the most highway-rail grade crossing collisions, on average, during the calendar years 2006, 2007, and 2008.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Action plans. (1) The ten identified States shall each develop a State highway-rail grade crossing action plan and submit such a plan to FRA for review and approval not later than August 27, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State highway-rail grade crossing action plan shall:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify specific solutions for improving safety at crossings, including highway-rail grade crossing closures or grade separations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Focus on crossings that have experienced multiple accidents or are at high risk for such accidents; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Cover a five-year time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Review and approval.

A State shall correct all deficiencies within 30 days following receipt of written notice from FRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> FRA may condition the awarding of any grants under 49 U.S.C. 20158, 20167, or 22501 to an identified State on the development of an FRA approved State highway-rail grade crossing action plan.
