                            <p class="depth0">A deviation of more than 5 percent between the estimates upon which  a certificate of commitment has been issued and the report of final  payment of the proceeds of the loan, or a change in the identity of the  property upon which the original appraisal was based, will invalidate  the certificate of commitment unless such deviation or change be  approved by the Secretary. Any deviation in excess of 5 percent or  change in the identity of the property upon which the original appraisal  was based must be supported by a new or supplemental appraisal of  reasonable value: Provided, That substitution of materials of equal or  better quality and value approved by the veteran and the designated  appraiser shall not be deemed a ``change in the identity of the  property'' within the purview of this section. A deviation not in excess  of 5 percent will not require the prior approval of the Secretary.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 3703(c)(1))</p>
