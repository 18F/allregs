Whenever doing so would be conducive to the efficient and expeditious conduct of the proceeding, the presiding officer may convene a conference to hear argument and issue a ruling on any disputes that may arise under these rules. The ruling, whether written or delivered on the record at a conference, may specify any measures, including the following to assure proper conduct of the proceeding or to protect any party or deponent from annoyance, expense, embarrassment or oppression:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> That depositions shall not be taken or that interrogatories shall not be answered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> That certain matters shall not be inquired into.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> That the scope of the examination or interrogatories shall be limited to certain matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> That depositions may be taken only at some designated time or place, or before an officer, other than that stated in the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> That depositions may be taken only by written interrogatories or only upon oral examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> That, after being sealed, the deposition shall be opened only by order of the presiding officer.
