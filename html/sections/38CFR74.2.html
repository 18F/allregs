                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ownership and control. A small business concern must be  unconditionally owned and controlled by one or more eligible veterans,  service-disabled veterans or surviving spouses, have completed the  online Vendor Information Pages database forms at http://   www.VetBiz.gov, and has been examined by VA's Center for Veterans  Enterprise. Such businesses appear in the VIP database as ``verified.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Good character. Veterans, service-disabled veterans and  surviving spouses with ownership interests in VetBiz verified businesses  must have good character. Debarred or suspended concerns or concerns  owned or controlled by debarred or suspended persons are ineligible for  VetBiz VIP Verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> False statements. If, during the processing of an application,  CVE determines that an applicant has knowingly submitted false  information, regardless of whether correct information would cause CVE  to deny the application, and regardless of whether correct information  was given to CVE in accompanying documents, CVE will deny the  application. If, after verifying the Participant's eligibility, CVE  discovers that false information has been knowingly submitted by a firm,  CVE will remove the ``verified'' status from the VIP database and notify  the business by phone and mail. Whenever CVE determines that the  applicant submitted false information, the matter will be referred to  the Office of Inspector General for review. In addition, the CVE will  request that debarment proceedings be initiated by the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Federal financial obligations. Neither a firm nor any of its  eligible individuals that fails to pay significant financial obligations  owed to the Federal Government, including unresolved tax liens and  defaults on Federal loans or other Federally assisted financing, is  eligible for VetBiz VIP Verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) Protest Decisions. Any  firm registered in the VetBiz VIP database that is found to be  ineligible due to an SBA protest decision or other negative finding will  be immediately removed from the VetBiz VIP database. Until such time as  CVE receives official notification that the firm has proven that it has  successfully overcome the grounds for the determination or that the SBA  decision is overturned on appeal, the firm will not be eligible to  participate in the 38 U.S.C. 8127 program.</p>
