resources available for the project, the amount of grant funds necessary for completion, and for mining grant applications, the recommendations of the Mine Health Research Advisory Committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Secretary may evaluate and approve two or more concurrent applications, each dealing with one or more specified aspects of the project, and make two or more concurrent grant awards for the project. This may be necessary when a project involves a number of different but related problems, activities, or disciplines which would require evaluation by different groups, or when support for a project could be more effectively administered by separate handling of various aspects of the project.</p>
