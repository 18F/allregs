                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Where pressure retaining components having different thicknesses are welded together as is often the case when making branch connections, the preheat and postheat treatment requirements of Table 56.85-10 apply to the thicker of the components being joined. Postweld heat treatment is required for Classes I, I-L, II-L, and systems. It is not required for Class II piping. Refer to Sec. 56.50-105(a)(3) for exceptions in Classes I-L and II-L systems and to paragraph (b) of this section for Class I systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All buttwelded joints in Class I piping shall be postweld heated as required by Table 56.85-10. The following exceptions are permitted:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> High pressure salt water piping systems used in tank cleaning operations; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gas supply piping of carbon or carbon molybdenum steel used in gas turbines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All complicated connections including manifolds shall be stress-relieved in a furnace as a whole as required by Table 56.85-10 before being taken aboard ship for installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The postheating treatment selected for parts of an assembly must not adversely affect other components.

Heating a fabricated assembly as a complete unit is usually desirable; however, the size or shape of the unit or the adverse effect of a desired treatment on one or more components where dissimilar materials are involved may dictate alternative procedures. For example, it may be heated as a section of the assembly before the attachment of others or local circumferential-band heating of welded joints in accordance with 46 CFR 56.85-10, Table 56.85-10 Note (12) and 46 CFR 56.85-15(j)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Postheating treatment of welded joints between dissimilar metals having different postheating requirements must be established in the qualified welding procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)-(h)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> For those materials listed under P-1, when the wall thickness of the thicker of the two abutting ends, after their preparation, is less than three-fourths inch, the weld needs no postheating treatment. In all cases, where the nominal wall thickness is three-fourths inch or less, postheating treatment is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> (1)-(2) [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)-(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In local postheat treatment the entire band must be brought up to uniform specified temperature over the complete circumference of the pipe section, with a gradual diminishing of the temperature outward from the edges of the band.
