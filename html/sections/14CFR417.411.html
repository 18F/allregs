                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A launch operator must define a safety clear zone that confines  the adverse effects of each operation involving a public hazard or  launch location hazard. A launch operator's safety clear zones must  satisfy the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A launch operator must establish a safety clear zone that  accounts for the potential blast, fragment, fire or heat, toxic and  other hazardous energy or material potential of the associated systems  and operations. A launch operator must base a safety clear zone on the  following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a possible explosive event, base a safety clear zone on the  worst case event, regardless of the fault tolerance of the system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a possible toxic event, base a safety clear zone on the  worst case event. A launch operator must have procedures in place to  maintain public safety in the event toxic releases reach beyond the  safety clear zone; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a material handling operation, base a safety clear zone on  a worst case event for that operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A launch operator must establish a safety clear zone when the  launch vehicle is in a launch command configuration with the flight  safety systems fully operational and on internal power.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A launch operator must establish restrictions that prohibit  public access to a safety clear zone during a hazardous operation. A  safety clear zone may extend to areas beyond the launch location  boundaries if local agreements provide for restricting public access to  such areas and a launch operator verifies that the safety clear zone is  clear of the public during the hazardous operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A launch operator's procedures must verify that the public is  outside of a safety clear zone prior to a launch operator beginning a  hazardous operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A launch operator must control a safety clear zone to ensure no  public access during the hazardous operation. Safety clear zone controls  include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Use of security guards and equipment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Physical barriers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Warning signs, and other types of warning devices.</p>
