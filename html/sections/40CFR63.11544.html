nonferrous metal melted in non-foundry melting operations are not included in determining the annual metal melt production for existing affected sources or the annual metal melt capacity for new affected sources.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you own or operate a melting operation at an aluminum, copper or other nonferrous foundry as of February 9, 2009, you must determine if you are subject to this rule based on your facility's annual metal melt production for calendar year 2010.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If you construct or reconstruct a melting operation at an aluminum, copper or other nonferrous foundry after February 9, 2009, you must determine if you are subject to this rule based on your facility's annual metal melt capacity at startup.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If your foundry with an existing melting operation increases production after calendar year 2010 such that the annual metal melt production equals or exceeds 600 tpy, you must submit a written notification of applicability to the Administrator within 30 days after the end of the calendar year and comply within 2 years after the date of the notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If your foundry with a new melting operation increases capacity after startup such that the annual metal melt capacity equals or exceeds 600 tpy, you must submit a written notification of applicability to the Administrator within 30 days after the capacity increase year and comply at the time of the capacity increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart applies to each new or existing affected source located at an aluminum, copper or other nonferrous foundry that is an area source as defined by Sec. 63.2.
