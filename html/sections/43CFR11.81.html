Sec. 11.82, 11.83, and 11.84 of this part to develop the Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The authorized official shall list the methodologies he expects to use to determine the costs of all actions considered within the selected alternative and, where relevant, the compensable value of the lost services through the recovery period associated with the selected alternative. The methodologies to use in determining costs and compensable value are described in Sec. 11.83 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> The Restoration and Compensation Determination Plan shall be part of the Assessment Plan developed in subpart B of this part.
