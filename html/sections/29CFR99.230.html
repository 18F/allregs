                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowable costs. Unless prohibited by law, the cost of audits  made in accordance with the provisions of this part are allowable  charges to Federal awards. The charges may be considered a direct cost  or an allocated indirect cost, as determined in accordance with the  provisions of applicable OMB cost principles circulars, the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR)(48 CFR parts 30 and 31), or other  applicable cost principles or regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unallowable costs. A non-Federal entity shall not charge the  following to a Federal award:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The cost of any audit under the Single Audit Act Amendments of  1996 (31 U.S.C. 7501 et seq.) not conducted in accordance with this  part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of auditing a non-Federal entity which has Federal  awards expended of less than $300,000 per year (or $500,000 for fiscal  years ending after December 31, 2003) and is thereby exempted under  Sec. 99.200(d) from having an audit conducted under this part. However,  this does not prohibit a pass-through entity from charging Federal  awards for the cost of limited scope audits to monitor its subrecipients  in accordance with Sec. 99.400(d)(3), provided the subrecipient does  not have a single audit. For purposes of this part, limited scope audits  only include agreed-upon procedures engagements conducted in accordance  with either the AICPA's generally accepted auditing standards or  attestation standards, that are paid for and arranged by a pass-through  entity and address only one or more of the following types of compliance  requirements: activities allowed or unallowed; allowable costs/cost  principles; eligibility; matching; level of effort; earmarking; and,  reporting.
