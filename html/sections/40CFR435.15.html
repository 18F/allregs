Sec. Appendix 1 to Subpart A of Part 435--Static Sheen Test (EPA Method</p><p class="depth0">1617)</p><p class="depth0">1. Scope and Application</p><p class="depth0">This method is to be used as a compliance test for the ``no discharge of free oil'' requirement for discharges of drilling fluids, drill cuttings, produced sand, and well treatment, completion and workover fluids. ``Free oil'' refers to any oil contained in a waste stream that when discharged will cause a film or sheen upon or a discoloration of the surface of the receiving water.</p><p class="depth0">2. Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">15-mL samples of drilling fluids or well treatment, completion, and workover fluids, and 15-g samples (wet weight basis) of drill cuttings or produced sand are introduced into ambient seawater in a container having an air-to-liquid interface area of 1000 cm\2\ (155.5 in\2\). Samples are dispersed within the container and observations made no more than one hour later to ascertain if these materials cause a sheen, iridescence, gloss, or increased reflectance on the surface of the test seawater. The occurrence of any of these visual observations will constitute a demonstration that the tested material contains ``free oil,'' and therefore results in a prohibition of its discharge into receiving waters.</p><p class="depth0">3. Interferences</p><p class="depth0">Residual ``free oil'' adhering to sampling containers, the magnetic stirring bar used to mix the sample, and the stainless steel spatula used to mix the sample will be the principal sources of contamination problems. These problems should only occur if improperly washed and cleaned equipment are used for the test. The use of disposable equipment minimizes the potential for similar contamination from pipettes and the test container.</p><p class="depth0">4. Apparatus, Materials, and Reagents</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Apparatus</p><p class="depth0">4.1.1 Sampling Containers: 1-liter polyethylene beakers and 1-liter glass beakers.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.2 Graduated cylinder: 100-mL graduated cylinder required only for operations where predilution of mud discharges is required.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.3 Plastic disposable weighing boats.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.4 Triple-beam scale.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.5 Disposable pipettes: 25-mL disposable pipettes.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.6 Magnetic stirrer and stirring bar.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.7 Stainless steel spatula.</p><p class="depth0">4.1.8 Test container: Open plastic container whose internal cross-section parallel to its opening has an area of 1000 cm\2\[50 cm\2\ (155.5 [7.75 in\2\), and a depth of at least 13 cm (5 inches) and no more than 30 cm (11.8 inches).</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Materials and Reagents.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.1 Plastic liners for the test container: Oil-free, heavy-duty plastic trash can liners that do not inhibit the spreading of an oil film. Liners must be of sufficient size to completely cover the interior surface of the test container. Permittees must determine an appropriate local source of liners that do not inhibit the spreading of 0.05 mL of diesel fuel added to the lined test container under the test conditions and protocol described below.</p><p class="depth0">4.2.2 Ambient receiving water.</p><p class="depth0">5. Calibration</p><p class="depth0">None currently specified.</p><p class="depth0">6. Quality Control Procedures</p><p class="depth0">None currently specified.</p><p class="depth0">7. Sample Collection and Handling</p><p class="depth0">7.1 Sampling containers must be thoroughly washed with detergent, rinsed a minimum of three times with fresh water, and allowed to air dry before samples are collected.</p><p class="depth0">7.2 Samples of drilling fluid to be tested shall be taken at the shale shaker after cuttings have been removed. The sample volume should range between 200 mL and 500 mL.</p><p class="depth0">7.3 Samples of drill cuttings will be taken from the shale shaker screens with a clean spatula or similar instrument and placed in a glass beaker. Cuttings samples shall be collected prior to the addition of any washdown water and should range between 200 g and 500 g.</p><p class="depth0">7.4 Samples of produced sand must be obtained from the solids control equipment from which the discharge occurs on any given day and shall be collected prior to the addition of any washdown water; samples should range between 200 g and 500 g.</p><p class="depth0">7.5 Samples of well treatment, completion, and workover fluids must be obtained from the holding facility prior to discharge; the sample volume should range between 200 mL and 500 mL.</p><p class="depth0">7.6 Samples must be tested no later than 1 hour after collection.</p><p class="depth0">7.7 Drilling fluid samples must be mixed in their sampling containers for 5 minutes prior to the test using a magnetic bar stirrer. If predilution is imposed as a permit condition, the sample must be mixed at the same ratio with the same prediluting water as the discharged muds and stirred for 5 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">7.8 Drill cuttings must be stirred and well mixed by hand in their sampling containers prior to testing, using a stainless steel spatula.</p><p class="depth0">8. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">8.1 Ambient receiving water must be used as the ``receiving water'' in the test. The temperature of the test water shall be as close as practicable to the ambient conditions in the receiving water, not the room temperature of the observation facility. The test container must have an air-to-liquid interface area of 1000 [50 cm\2\. The surface of the water should be no more than 1.27 cm (.5 inch) below the top of the test container.</p><p class="depth0">8.2 Plastic liners shall be used, one per test container, and discarded afterwards. Some liners may inhibit spreading of added oil; operators shall determine an appropriate local source of liners that do not inhibit the spreading of the oil film.</p><p class="depth0">8.3 A 15-mL sample of drilling fluid or well treatment, completion, and workover fluids must be introduced by pipette into the test container 1 cm below the water surface. Pipettes must be filled and discharged with test material prior to the transfer of test material and its introduction into test containers. The test water/test material mixture must be stirred using the pipette to distribute the test material homogeneously throughout the test water. The pipette must be used only once for a test and then discarded.</p><p class="depth0">8.4 Drill cuttings or produced sand should be weighed on plastic weighing boats; 15-g samples must be transferred by scraping test material into the test water with a stainless steel spatula. Drill cuttings shall not be prediluted prior to testing. Also, drilling fluids and cuttings will be tested separately. The weighing boat must be immersed in the test water and scraped with the spatula to transfer any residual material to the test container. The drill cuttings or produced sand must be stirred with the spatula to an even distribution of solids on the bottom of the test container.</p><p class="depth0">8.5 Observations must be made no later than 1 hour after the test material is transferred to the test container. Viewing points above the test container should be made from at least three sides of the test container, at viewing angles of approximately 60[deg] and 30[deg] from the horizontal. Illumination of the test container must be representative of adequate lighting for a working environment to conduct routine laboratory procedures. It is recommended that the water surface of the test container be observed under a fluorescent light source such as a dissecting microscope light. The light source shall be positioned above and directed over the entire surface of the pan.</p><p class="depth0">8.6 Detection of a ``silvery'' or ``metallic'' sheen or gloss, increased reflectivity, visual color, iridescence, or an oil slick on the water surface of the test container surface shall constitute a demonstration of ``free oil.'' These visual observations include patches, streaks, or sheets of such altered surface characteristics. If the free oil content of the sample approaches or exceeds 10%, the water surface of the test container may lack color, a sheen, or iridescence, due to the increased thickness of the film; thus, the observation for an oil slick is required. The surface of the test container shall not be disturbed in any manner that reduces the size of any sheen or slick that may be present.</p><p class="depth0">If an oil sheen or slick occurs on less than one-half of the surface area after the sample is introduced to the test container, observations will continue for up to 1 hour. If the sheen or slick increases in size and covers greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container during the observation period, the discharge of the material shall cease. If the sheen or slick does not increase in size to cover greater than one-half of the test container surface area after one hour of observation, discharge may continue and additional sampling is not required.</p><p class="depth0">If a sheen or slick occurs on greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container after the test material is introduced, discharge of the tested material shall cease. The permittee may retest the material causing the sheen or slick. If subsequent tests do not result in a sheen or slick covering greater than one-half of the surface area of the test container, discharge may continue.

For test samples containing mineral oil or diesel oil, glassware should be washed with petroleum ether to assure removal of all residual oil.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If the glassware with nytex cups soaks in the acid solution longer than 24 hours, then an equally long deionized water soak should be performed.</p><p class="depth0">II-B. Test Seawater Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Diluent seawater and exposure seawater samples are prepared by filtration through a 1.0 micrometer filter prior to analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Artificial seawater may be used as long as the seawater has been prepared by standard methods or ASTM methods, has been properly ``seasoned,'' filtered, and has been diluted with distilled water to the same specified 20[2 ppt salinity and 20[2 [deg]C temperature as the ``natural'' seawater.</p><p class="depth0">II-C. Sample Preparation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The pH of the mud shall be tested prior to its use. If the pH is less than 9, if black spots have appeared on the walls of the sample container, or if the mud sample has a foul odor, that sample shall be discarded. Subsample a manageable aliquot of mud from the well-mixed original sample. Mix the mud and filtered test seawater in a volumetric mud-to-water ratio of 1 to 9. This is best done by the method of volumetric displacement in a 2-L, large mouth, graduated Erlenmeyer flask. Place 1000 mL of seawater into the graduated Erlenmeyer flask. The mud subsample is then carefully added via a powder funnel to obtain a total volume of 1200 mL. (A 200 mL volume of the mud will now be in the flask).</p><p class="depth0">The 2-L, large mouth, graduated Erlenmeyer flask is then filled to the 2000 mL mark with 800 mL of seawater, which produces a slurry with a final ratio of one volume drilling mud to nine volumes water. If the volume of SPP required for testing or analysis exceeds 1500 to 1600 mL, the initial volumes should be proportionately increased. Alternatively, several 2-L drill mud/water slurries may be prepared as outlined above and combined to provide sufficient SPP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mix this mud/water slurry with magnetic stirrers for 5 minutes. Measure the pH and, if necessary, adjust (decrease) the pH of the slurry to within 0.2 units of the seawater by adding 6N HCl while stirring the slurry. Then, allow the slurry to settle for 1 hour. Record the amount of HCl added.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At the end of the settling period, carefully decant (do not siphon) the Suspended Particulate Phase (SPP) into an appropriate container. Decanting the SPP is one continuous action. In some cases no clear interface will be present; that is, there will be no solid phase that has settled to the bottom. For those samples the entire SPP solution should be used when preparing test concentrations. However, in those cases when no clear interface is present, the sample must be remixed for five minutes. This insures the homogeneity of the mixture prior to the preparation of the test concentrations. In other cases, there will be samples with two or more phases, including a solid phase. For those samples, carefully and continuously decant the supernatant until the solid phase on the bottom of the flask is reached. The decanted solution is defined to be 100 percent SPP. Any other concentration of SPP refers to a percentage of SPP that is obtained by volumetrically mixing 100 percent SPP with seawater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> SPP samples to be used in toxicity tests shall be mixed for 5 minutes and must not be preserved or stored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Measure the filterable and unfilterable residue of each SPP prepared for testing. Measure the dissolved oxygen (DO) and pH of the SPP. If the DO is less than 4.9 ppm, aerate the SPP to at least 4.9 ppm which is 65 percent of saturation. Maximum allowable aeration time is 5 minutes using a generic commercial air pump and air stone. Neutralize the pH of the SPP to a pH 7.8 [.1 using a dilute HCl solution. If too much acid is added to lower the pH saturated NaOH may be used to raise the pH to 7.8 [.1 units. Record the amount of acid or NaOH needed to lower/raise to the appropriate pH. Three repeated DO and pH measurements are needed to insure homogeneity and stability of the SPP. Preparation of test concentrations may begin after this step is complete.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Add the appropriate volume of 100 percent SPP to the appropriate volume of seawater to obtain the desired SPP concentration. The control is seawater only. Mix all concentrations and the control for 5 minutes by using magnetic stirrers. Then, the animals shall be randomly selected and placed in the dishes in order to begin the 96-hour toxicity test.
III. Guidance for Performing Suspended Particulate Phase Toxicity Tests</p><p class="depth0">Using Mysidopsis bahia</p><p class="depth0">III-A. Apparatus</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each definitive test consists of 18 test containers: 3 replicates of a control and 5 SPP dilutions. Test containers should be Pyrex or equivalent glass. For definitive tests, 5 SPP dilutions with 3 replicates of at least 500 ml each are required. Twenty mysids per replicate, 360 per definitive test are required.</p><p class="depth0">III-B. Sample Collection Preservation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Drilling muds and water samples are collected and stored, and the suspended particulate phase prepared as described in section 1-C.</p><p class="depth0">III-C. Species Selection</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Suspended Particulate Phase (SPP) tests on drilling muds shall utilize the test species Mysidopsis bahia. Test animals shall be 3 to 6 days old on the first day of exposure. Whatever the source of the animals, collection and handling should be as gentle as possible. Transportation to the laboratory should be in well-aerated water from the animal culture site at the temperature and salinity from which they were cultured. Methods for handling, acclimating, and sizing bioassay organisms given by Borthwick [1] and Nimmo [2] shall be followed in matters for which no guidance is given here.</p><p class="depth0">III-D. Experimental Conditions</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Suspended particulate phase (SPP) tests should be conducted at a salinity of 20 [2 ppt. Experimental temperature should be 20 [2 [deg]C. Dissolved oxygen in the SPP shall be raised to or maintained above 65 percent of saturation prior to preparation of the test concentrations. Under these conditions of temperature and salinity, 65 percent saturation is a DO of 5.3 ppm. Beginning at Day 0-before the animals are placed in the test containers DO, temperature, salinity, and pH shall be measured every 24 hours. DO should be reported in milligrams per liter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aeration of test media is required during the entire test with a rate estimated to be 50-140 cubic centimeters/minute. This air flow to each test dish may be achieved through polyethylene tubing (0.045-inch inner diameter and 0.062-inch outer diameter) by a small generic aquarium pump. The delivery method, surface area of the aeration stone, and flow characteristics shall be documented. All treatments, including control, shall be the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Light intensity shall be 1200 microwatts/cm \2\ using cool white fluorescent bulbs with a 14-hr light and 10-hr dark cycle. This light/dark cycle shall also be maintained during the acclimation period and the test.</p><p class="depth0">III-E. Experimental Procedure</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Wash all glassware with detergent, rinse five times with tap water, rinse once with acetone, rinse several times with distilled or deionized water, place in a clean 10 percent HCl acid bath for a minimum of 4 hours, rinse five times with tap water, and then rinse five times with distilled water.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Establish the definitive test concentrations based on results of a range finding test or based on prior experience and knowledge of the mud system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Twenty organisms are exposed in each test dish. Nytex cups shall be inserted into every test dish prior to adding the animals. These ``nylon mesh screen'' nytex holding cups are fabricated by gluing a collar of 363-micrometer mesh nylon screen to a 15-centimeter wide Petri dish with silicone sealant. The nylon screen collar is approximately 5 centimeters high. The animals are then placed into the test concentration within the confines of the Nytex cups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Individual organisms shall be randomly assigned to treatment. A randomization procedure is presented in section V of this protocol. Make every attempt to expose animals of approximately equal size. The technique described by Borthwick [1], or other suitable substitutes, should be used for transferring specimens. Throughout the test period, mysids shall be fed daily with approximately 50 Artemia (brine shrimp) nauplii per mysid. This will reduce stress and decrease cannibalism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Cover the dishes, aerate, and incubate the test containers in an appropriate test chamber. Positioning of the test containers holding various concentrations of test solution should be randomized if incubator arrangement indicates potential position difference. The test medium is not replaced during the 96-hour test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Observations may be attempted at 4, 6 and 8 hours; they must be attempted at 0, 24, 48, and 72 hours and must be made at 96 hours. Attempts at observations refers to placing a test dish on a light table and visually counting the animals. Do not lift the ``nylon mesh screen'' cup out of the test dish to make the observation. No unnecessary handling of the animals should occur during the 96 hour test period. DO and pH measurements must also be made at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Take and replace the test medium necessary for the DO and pH measurements outside of the nytex cups to minimize stresses on the animals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> At the end of 96 hours, all live animals must be counted. Death is the end point, so the number of living organisms is recorded. Death is determined by lack of spontaneous movement. All crustaceans molt at regular intervals, shedding a complete exoskeleton. Care should be taken not to count an exoskeleton. Dead animals might decompose or be eaten between observations. Therefore, always count living, not dead animals. If daily observations are made, remove dead organisms and molted exoskeletons with a pipette or forceps. Care must be taken not to disturb living organisms and to minimize the amount of liquid withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Methods for Positive Control Tests (Reference Toxicant)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sodium lauryl sulfate (dodecyl sodium sulfate) is used as a reference toxicant for the positive control. The chemical used should be approximately 95 percent pure. The source, lot number, and percent purity shall be reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Test methods are those used for the drilling fluid tests, except that the test material was prepared by weighing one gram sodium lauryl sulfate on an analytical balance, adding the chemical to a 100-milliliter volumetric flask, and bringing the flask to volume with deionized water. After mixing this stock solution, the test mixtures are prepared by adding 0.1 milliliter of the stock solution for each part per million desired to one liter of seawater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The mixtures are stirred briefly, water quality is measured, animals are added to holding cups, and the test begins. Incubation and monitoring procedures are the same as those for the drilling fluids.</p><p class="depth0">V. Randomization Procedure</p><p class="depth0">V-A. Purpose and Procedure</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The purpose of this procedure is to assure that mysids are impartially selected and randomly assigned to six test treatments (five drilling fluid or reference toxicant concentrations and a control) and impartially counted at the end of the 96-hour test. Thus, each test setup, as specified in the randomization procedure, consists of 3 replicates of 20 animals for each of the six treatments, i.e., 360 animals per test. Figure 1 is a flow diagram that depicts the procedure schematically and should be reviewed to understand the over-all operation. The following tasks shall be performed in the order listed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Mysids are cultured in the laboratory in appropriate units. If mysids are purchased, go to Task 3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Remove mysids from culture tanks (6, 5, 4, and 3 days before the test will begin, i.e., Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday if the test will begin on Monday) and place them in suitably large maintenance containers so that they can swim about freely and be fed.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Not every detail (the definition of suitably large containers, for example) is provided here. Training and experience in aquatic animal culture and testing will be required to successfully complete these tests.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC01MY92.114</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Remove mysids from maintenance containers and place all animals in a single container. The intent is to have homogeneous test population of mysids of a known age (3-6 days old).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For each toxicity test, assign two suitable containers (500-milliliter (mL) beakers are recommended) for mysid separation/enumeration. Label each container (A1, A2, B1, B2, and C1, C2, for example, if two drilling fluid tests and a reference toxicant test are to be set up on one day). The purpose of this task is to allow the investigator to obtain a close estimate of the number of animals available for testing and to prevent unnecessary crowding of the mysids while they are being counted and assigned to test containers. Transfer the mysids from the large test population container to the labeled separation and enumeration containers but do not place more than 200 mysids in a 500-mL beaker. Be impartial in transferring the mysids; place approximately equal numbers of animals (10-15 mysids is convenient) in each container in a cyclic manner rather than placing the maximum number each container at one time.</p><p class="depth0">Note: It is important that the animals not be unduly stressed during this selection and assignment procedure. Therefore, it will probably be necessary to place all animals (except the batch immediately being assigned to test containers) in mesh cups with flowing seawater or in large volume containers with aeration. The idea is to provide the animals with near optimal conditions to avoid additional stress.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Place the mysids from the two labeled enumeration containers assigned to a specific test into one or more suitable containers to be used as counting dishes (2-liter Carolina dishes are suggested). Because of the time required to separate, count, and assign mysids, two or more people may be involved in completing this task. If this is done, two or more counting dishes may be used, but the investigator must make sure that approximately equal numbers of mysids from each labeled container are placed in each counting dish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> By using a large-bore, smooth-tip glass pipette, select mysids from the counting dish(es) and place them in the 36 individually numbered distribution containers (10-ml beakers are suggested). The mysids are assigned two at a time to the 36 containers by using a randomization schedule similar to the one presented below. At the end of selection/assignment round 1, each container will contain two mysids; at the end of round 2, they will contain four mysids; and so on until each contains ten mysids.</p><p class="depth0">Example of a Randomization Schedule------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Place mysid in the numberedSelection/assignment round (2 mysids each)   distribution containers in</p><p class="depth0">the random order shown------------------------------------------------------------------------1.........................................  8, 21, 6, 28, 33, 32, 1, 3,</p><p class="depth0">10, 9, 4, 14, 23, 2, 34,</p><p class="depth0">22, 36, 27, 5, 30, 35, 24,</p><p class="depth0">12, 25, 11, 17, 19, 26, 31,</p><p class="depth0">7, 20, 15, 18, 13, 16, 29.2.........................................  35, 18, 5, 12, 32, 34, 22,</p><p class="depth0">3, 9, 16, 26, 13, 20, 28,</p><p class="depth0">6, 21, 24, 30, 8, 31, 7,</p><p class="depth0">23, 2, 15, 25, 17, 1, 11,</p><p class="depth0">27, 4, 19, 36, 10, 33, 14,</p><p class="depth0">29.3.........................................  7, 19, 14, 11, 34, 21, 25,</p><p class="depth0">27, 17, 18, 6, 16, 29, 2,</p><p class="depth0">32, 10, 4, 20, 3, 9, 1, 5,</p><p class="depth0">28, 24, 31, 15, 22, 13, 33,</p><p class="depth0">26, 36, 12, 8, 30, 35, 23.4.........................................  30, 2, 18, 5, 8, 27, 10, 25,</p><p class="depth0">4, 20, 26, 15, 31, 36, 35,</p><p class="depth0">23, 11, 29, 16, 17, 28, 1,</p><p class="depth0">33, 14, 9, 34, 7, 3, 12,</p><p class="depth0">22, 21, 6, 19, 24, 32, 13.5.........................................  34, 28, 16, 17, 10, 12, 1,</p><p class="depth0">36, 20, 18, 15, 22, 2, 4,</p><p class="depth0">19, 23, 27, 29, 25, 21, 30,</p><p class="depth0">3, 9, 33, 32, 6, 14, 11,</p><p class="depth0">35, 24, 26, 7, 31, 5, 13,</p><p class="depth0">8.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Transfer mysids from the 36 distribution containers to 18 labeled test containers in random order.

A new random schedule should be followed in Tasks 6 and 7 for each test.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If a partial toxicity test is conducted, the procedures described above are appropriate and should be used to prepare the single test concentration and control, along with the reference toxicant test.</p><p class="depth0">V-B. Data Analysis and Interpretation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Complete survival data in all test containers at each observation time shall be presented in tabular form. If greater than 10 percent mortality occurs in the controls, all data shall be discarded and the experiment repeated. Unacceptably high control mortality indicates the presence of important stresses on the organisms other than the material being tested, such as injury or disease, stressful physical or chemical conditions in the containers, or improper handling, acclimation, or feeding. If 10 percent mortality or less occurs in the controls, the data may be evaluated and reported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A definitive, full bioassay conducted according to the EPA protocol is used to estimate the concentration that is lethal to 50 percent of the test organisms that do not die naturally. This toxicity measure is known as the median lethal concentration, or LC-50. The LC-50 is adjusted for natural mortality or natural responsiveness. The maximum likelihood estimation procedure with the adjustments for natural responsiveness as given by D.J. Finney, in Probit Analysis 3rd edition, 1971, Cambridge University Press, chapter 7, can be used to obtain the probit model estimate of the LC-50 and the 95 percent fiducial (confidence) limits for the LC-50. These estimates are obtained using the logarithmic transform of the concentration. The heterogeneity factor (Finney 1971, pages 70-72) is not used. For a test material to pass the toxicity test, according to the requirements stated in the offshore oil and gas extraction industry BAT effluent limitations and NSPS, the LC-50, adjusted for natural responsiveness, must be greater than 3 percent suspended particulate phase (SPP) concentration by volume unadjusted for the 1 to 9 dilution. Other toxicity test models may be used to obtain toxicity estimates provided the modeled mathematical expression for the lethality rate must increase continuously with concentration. The lethality rate is modeled to increase with concentration to reflect an assumed increase in toxicity with concentration even though the observed lethality may not increase uniformly because of the unpredictable animal response fluctuations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The range finding test is used to establish a reasonable set of test concentrations in order to run the definitive test. However, if the lethality rate changes rapidly over a narrow range of concentrations, the range finding assay may be too coarse to establish

an adequate set of test concentrations for a definitive test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The EPA Environmental Research Laboratory in Gulf Breeze, Florida prepared a Research and Development Report entitled Acute Toxicity of Eight Drilling Fluids to Mysid Shrimp (Mysidopsis bahia), May 1984 EPA-600/3-84-067. The Gulf Breeze data for drilling fluid number 1 are displayed in Table 1 for purposes of an example of the probit analysis described above. The SAS Probit Procedure (SAS Institute, Statistical Analysis System, Cary, North Carolina, 1982) was used to analyze these data. The 96-hour LC50 adjusted for the estimated spontaneous mortality rate is 3.3 percent SPP with 95 percent limits of 3.0 and 3.5 percent SPP with the 1 to 9 dilution.

Appendix 3 to Subpart A of Part 435--Procedure for Mixing Base</p><p class="depth0">Fluids With Sediments (EPA Method 1646)</p><p class="depth0">This procedure describes a method for amending uncontaminated and nontoxic (control) sediments with the base fluids that are used to formulate synthetic-based drilling fluids and other non-aqueous drilling fluids. Initially, control sediments shall be press-sieved through a 2000 micron mesh sieve to remove large debris. Then press-sieve the sediment through a 500 micron sieve to remove indigenous organisms that may prey on the test species or otherwise confound test results. Homogenize control sediment to limit the effects of settling that

may have occurred during storage. Sediments should be homogenized before density determinations and addition of base fluid to control sediment. Because base fluids are strongly hydrophobic and do not readily mix with sediment, care must be taken to ensure base fluids are thoroughly homogenized within the sediment. All concentrations are weight-to-weight (mg of base fluid to kg of dry control sediment). Sediment and base fluid mixing shall be accomplished by using the following method.</p><p class="depth0">1. Determine the wet to dry ratio for the control sediment by weighing approximately 10 g subsamples of the screened and homogenized wet sediment into tared aluminum weigh pans. Dry sediment at 105 [deg]C for 18-24 h. Remove sediment and cool in a desiccator until a constant weight is achieved. Re-weigh the samples to determine the dry weight. Determine the wet/dry ratio by dividing the net wet weight by the net dry weight:
[Wet Sediment Weight (g)]/[Dry Sediment Weight (g)] = Wet to Dry Ratio [1]</p><p class="depth0">2. Determine the density (g/mL) of the wet control or dilution sediment. This shall be used to determine total volume of wet sediment needed for the various test treatments.
[Mean Wet Sediment Weight (g)]/[Mean Wet Sediment Volume (mL)] = Wet Sediment Density (g/mL) [2]</p><p class="depth0">3. To determine the amount of base fluid needed to obtain a test concentration of 500 mg base fluid per kg dry sediment use the following formulas:</p><p class="depth0">Determine the amount of wet sediment required:
[Wet Sediment Density (g/mL)] x [Volume of Sediment Required per Concentration (mL)] = Weight Wet Sediment Required per Conc. (g) [3]</p><p class="depth0">Determine the amount of dry sediment in kilograms (kg) required for each concentration:
{[Wet Sediment per Concentration (g)]/[Mean Wet to Dry Ratio]{time}  x (1kg/1000g) = Dry Weight Sediment (kg) [4]</p><p class="depth0">Finally, determine the amount of base fluid required to spike the control sediment at each concentration:
[Conc. Desired (mg/kg)] x [Dry Weight Sediment (kg)] = Base Fluid Required (mg) [5]</p><p class="depth0">For spiking test substances other than pure base fluids (e.g., whole mud formulations), determine the spike amount as follows:
[Conc. Desired (mL/kg)] x [Dry Weight Sediment (kg)] x [Test Substance Density (g/mL)] = Test Substance Required (g) [6]</p><p class="depth0">4. For primary mixing, place appropriate amounts of weighed base fluid into stainless mixing bowls, tare the vessel weight, then add sediment and mix with a high-shear dispersing impeller for 9 minutes. The concentration of base fluid in sediment from this mix, rather than the nominal concentration, shall be used in calculating LC5. values.</p><p class="depth0">5. Tests for homogeneity of base fluid in sediment are to be performed during the procedure development phase. Because of difficulty of homogeneously mixing base fluid with sediment, it is important to demonstrate that the base fluid is evenly mixed with sediment. The sediment shall be analyzed for total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) using EPA Methods 3550A and 8015M, with samples taken both prior to and after distribution to replicate test containers. Base-fluid content is measured as TPH. After mixing the sediment, a minimum of three replicate sediment samples shall be taken prior to distribution into test containers. After the test sediment is distributed to test containers, an additional three sediment samples shall be taken from three test containers to ensure proper distribution of base fluid within test containers. Base-fluid content results shall be reported within 48 hours of mixing. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. If base-fluid content results are not within the 20% CV limit, the test sediment shall be remixed. Tests shall not begin until the CV is determined to be below the maximum limit of 20%. During the test, a minimum of three replicate containers shall be sampled to determine base-fluid content during each sampling period.</p><p class="depth0">6. Mix enough sediment in this way to allow for its use in the preparation of all test concentrations and as a negative control. When commencing the sediment toxicity test, range-finding tests may be required to determine the concentrations that produce a toxic effect if these data are otherwise unavailable. The definitive test shall bracket the LC5., which is the desired endpoint. The results for the base fluids shall be reported in mg of base fluid per kg of dry sediment.</p><p class="depth0">References</p><p class="depth0">American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). 1996.

Sec. Appendix 4 to Subpart A of Part 435--Protocol for the Determination</p><p class="depth0">of Degradation of Non-Aqueous Base Fluids in a Marine Closed Bottle</p><p class="depth0">Biodegradation Test System: Modified ISO 11734:1995 (EPA Method 1647)</p><p class="depth0">1.0. Summary of EPA Method 1647</p><p class="depth0">a. This method determines the anaerobic degradation potential of mineral oils, paraffin oils and non-aqueous fluids (NAF) in sediments. These substrates are base fluids for formulating offshore drilling fluids. The test evaluates base fluid biodegradation rates by monitoring gas production due to microbial degradation of the test fluid in natural marine sediment.</p><p class="depth0">b. The test procedure places a mixture of marine/estuarine sediment, test substrate (hydrocarbon or controls) and seawater into clean 120 mL (150 mL actual volume) Wheaton serum bottles. The test is run using four replicate serum bottles containing 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight concentration of test substrate in sediment. The use of resazurin dye solution (1 ppm) evaluates the anaerobic (redox) condition of the bottles (dye is blue when oxygen is present, reddish in low oxygen conditions and colorless if oxygen free). After capping the bottles, a nitrogen sparge removes air in the headspace before incubation begins. During the incubation period, the sample should be kept at a constant temperature of 29 [1 [deg]C. Gas production and composition is measured approximately every two weeks. The samples need to be brought to ambient temperature before making the measurements. Measure gas production using a pressure gauge. Barometric pressure is measured at the time of testing to make necessary volume adjustments.</p><p class="depth0">c. ISO 11734:1995 specifies that total gas is the standard measure of biodegradation. While modifying this test for evaluating biodegradation of NAFs, methane was also monitored and found to be an acceptable method of evaluating biodegradation. Section 7 contains the procedures used to follow biodegradation by methane production. Measurement of either total gas or methane production is permitted. If methane is followed, determine the composition of the gas by using gas chromatography (GC) analysis at each sampling. At the end of the test when gas production stops, or at around 275 days, an analysis of sediment for substrate content is possible. Common methods which have been successfully used for analyzing NAFs from sediments are listed in Section 8.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 System Requirements</p><p class="depth0">This environmental test system has three phases, spiked sediment, overlying seawater, and a gas headspace. The sediment/test compound mixture is combined with synthetic sea water and transferred into 120-mL serum bottles. The total volume of sediment/sea water mixture in the bottles is 75 mL. The volume of the sediment layer will be approximately 50 mL, but the exact volume of the sediment will depend on sediment characteristics (wet:dry ratio and density). The amount of synthetic sea water will be calculated to bring the total volume in the bottles to 75 mL. The test systems are maintained at a temperature of 29 [1 [deg]C during incubation. The test systems are brought to ambient temperatures prior to measuring pressure or gas volume.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Sample Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The concentration of base fluids are at least 2,000 mg carbon test material/kg dry sediment. Carbon concentration is determined by theoretical composition based on the chemical formula or by chemical analysis by ASTM D5291-96. Sediments with positive, intermediate and negative control substances as well as a C16-C18 internal olefin type base fluid will be run in conjunction with test materials under the same conditions. The positive control is ethyl oleate (CAS 111-62-6), the intermediate control is 1-hexadecene (CAS 629-73-2), and the negative control is squalane (CAS 111-01-3). Controls must be of analytical grade or the highest grade available. Each test control concentration should be prepared according to the mixing procedure described in Section 3.1.</p><p class="depth0">b. Product names will be used for examples or clarification in the following text. Any use of trade or product names in this publication is for descriptive use only, and does not constitute endorsement by EPA or the authors.</p><p class="depth0">2.2. Seawater Requirements</p><p class="depth0">Synthetic seawater at a salinity of 25 [1 ppt should be used for the test. The synthetic seawater should be prepared by mixing a commercially available artificial seawater mix, into high purity distilled or de-ionized water. The seawater should be aerated and allowed to age for approximately one month prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">2.3. Sediment Requirements</p><p class="depth0">a. The dilution sediment must be from a natural estuarine or marine environment and be free of the compounds of interest. The collection location, date and time will be documented and reported. The sediment is prepared by press-sieving through a 2,000-micron mesh sieve to remove large debris, then press-sieving through a 500-micron sieve to

remove indigenous organisms that may confound test results. The water content of the sediment should be less than 60% (w/w) or a wet to dry ratio of 2.5. The sediment should have a minimum organic matter content of 3% (w/w) as determined by ASTM D2974-07a (Method A and D and calculate organic matter as in Section 8.3 of method ASTM D2974-07a).</p><p class="depth0">b. To reduce the osmotic shock to the microorganisms in the sediment the salinity of the sediment's pore water should be between 20-30 ppt. Sediment should be used for testing as soon as possible after field collection. If required, sediment can be stored in the dark at 4 [deg]C with 3-6 inches of overlying water in a sealed container for a maximum period of 2 months prior to use.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Test Set Up</p><p class="depth0">The test is set up by first mixing the test or control substrates into the sediment inoculum, then mixing in seawater to make a pourable slurry. The slurry is then poured into serum bottles, which are then flushed with nitrogen and sealed.</p><p class="depth0">3.1. Mixing Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Because base fluids are strongly hydrophobic and do not readily mix with sediments, care must be taken to ensure base fluids are thoroughly homogenized within the sediment. All concentrations are weight-to-weight comparisons (mg of base fluid to kg of dry control sediment). Sediment and base fluid mixing will be accomplished by using the following method.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1. Determine the wet to dry weight ratio for the control sediment by weighing approximately 10 sub-samples of approximately 1 g each of the screened and homogenized wet sediment into tared aluminum weigh pans. Dry sediment at 105 [deg]C for 18-24 h. Remove the dried sediments and cool in a desiccator. Repeat the drying, cooling, and weighing cycle until a constant weight is achieved (within 4% of previous weight). Re-weigh the samples to determine the dry weight. Calculate the mean wet and dry weights of the 10 sub samples and determine the wet/dry ratio by dividing the mean wet weight by the mean dry weight using Equation 5-1. This is required to determine the weight of wet sediment needed to prepare the test samples.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.008</p><p class="depth0">3.1.2. Determine the density (g/ml) of the wet sediment. This will be used to determine total volume of wet sediment needed for the various test treatments. One method is to tare a 5 ml graduated cylinder and add about 5 ml of homogenized sediment. Carefully record the volume then weigh this volume of sediment. Repeat this a total of three times. To determine the wet sediment density, divide the weight by volume per the following formula:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.009</p><p class="depth0">3.1.3. Determine the amount of base fluid to be spiked into wet sediment in order to obtain the desired initial base fluid concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight. An amount of wet sediment that is the equivalent of 30 g of dry sediment will be added to each bottle. A typical procedure is to prepare enough sediment for 8 serum bottles (3 bottles to be sacrificed at the start of the test, 4 bottles incubated for headspace analysis, and enough extra sediment for 2 extra bottles). Extra sediment is needed because some of the sediment will remain coated onto the mixing bowl and utensils. Experience with this test may indicate that preparing larger volumes of spiked sediment is a useful practice, then the following calculations should be adjusted accordingly.</p><p class="depth0">a. Determine the total weight of dry sediment needed to add 30 g dry sediment to 8 bottles. If more bottles are used then the calculations should be modified accordingly. For example:

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.010</p><p class="depth0">b. Determine the weight of base fluid, in terms of carbon, needed to obtain a final base fluid concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight. For example:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.011</p><p class="depth0">c. i. Convert from mg of carbon to mg of base fluid. This calculation will depend on the % fraction of carbon present in the molecular structure of each base fluid. For the control fluids, ethyl oleate is composed of 77.3% carbon, hexadecene is composed of 85.7% carbon, and squalane is composed of 85.3% carbon. The carbon fraction of each base fluid should be supplied by the manufacturer or determined before use. ASTM D5291-96 or equivalent will be used to determine composition of fluid.</p><p class="depth0">ii. To calculate the amount of base fluid to add to the sediment, divide the amount of carbon (480 mg) by the percent fraction of carbon in the fluid.</p><p class="depth0">iii. For example, the amount of ethyl oleate added to 240 g dry weight sediment can be calculated from the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.012</p><p class="depth0">iv. Therefore, add 621 mg of ethyl oleate to 240 g dry weight sediment for a final concentration of 2,000 mg carbon/kg sediment dry weight.</p><p class="depth0">3.1.4. Mix the calculated amount of base fluid with the appropriate weight of wet sediment.</p><p class="depth0">a. Use the wet:dry ratio to convert from g sediment dry weight to g sediment wet weight, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.013</p><p class="depth0">b. i. Weigh the appropriate amount of base fluid (calculated in Section 3.1.3.c) into stainless mixing bowls, tare the vessel weight, then add the wet sediment calculated in Equation 5, and mix with a high shear dispersing impeller for 9 minutes.</p><p class="depth0">ii. The sediment is now mixed with synthetic sea water to form a slurry that will be transferred into the bottles.</p><p class="depth0">3.2. Creating Seawater/Sediment Slurry</p><p class="depth0">Given that the total volume of sediment/sea water slurry in each bottle is to be 75 mL, determine the volume of sea water to add to the wet sediment.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1. If each bottle is to contain 30 g dry sediment, calculate the weight, and then the volume, of wet sediment to be added to each bottle.

[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.014</p><p class="depth0">3.2.4. Convert the wet sediment weight from Equation 6 into a volume using the sediment density.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.016</p><p class="depth0">3.2.5. Determine the amount of sea water to mix with the wet sediment.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.017</p><p class="depth0">Mix sea water thoroughly with wet sediment to form a sediment/sea water slurry.</p><p class="depth0">3.3. Bottling the Sediment Seawater Slurry</p><p class="depth0">The total volume of sediment/sea water slurry in each bottle is to be 75 mL. Convert the volume (mL) of sediment/sea water slurry into a weight (g) using the density of the sediment and the seawater.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.018</p><p class="depth0">This should provide each bottle with 30 g dry sediment in a total volume of 75 mL.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.4. Putting the sediment:seawater slurry in the serum bottles.</p><p class="depth0">a. Note: The slurry will need to be constantly stirred to keep the sediment suspended.</p><p class="depth0">b. Place a tared serum bottle on a balance and add the appropriate amount of slurry to the bottle using a funnel. Once the required slurry is in the bottle remove the funnel, add 2-3 drops (25 L) of a 1 gram/L resazurin dye stock solution. Cap the bottle with a butyl rubber stopper (Bellco Glass, Part 2048-11800) and crimp with an aluminum seal (Bellco Glass Part 2048-11020).</p><p class="depth0">c. Using a plastic tube with a (23-gauge, 1-inch long) needle attached to one side and a nitrogen source to the other, puncture the serum cap with the needle. Puncture the serum cap again with a second needle to sparge the bottle's headspace of residual air for two minutes. The nitrogen should be flowing at no more than 100 mL/min to encourage gentle displacement of oxygenated air with nitrogen. Faster nitrogen flow rates would cause mixing and complete oxygen removal would take much longer. Remove the nitrogen needle first to avoid any initial pressure problems. The second (vent) needle should be removed within 30 seconds of removing the nitrogen needle.</p><p class="depth0">d. Triplicate blank test systems are prepared, with similar quantities of sediment and seawater without any base fluid. Incubate in the dark at a constant temperature of 29 [1 [deg]C.</p><p class="depth0">e. Record the test temperature. The test duration is dependent on base fluid performance, but at a maximum should be no more than 275 days. Stop the test after all base fluids have achieved a plateau of gas production. At termination, base fluid concentrations can be verified in the terminated samples by extraction and GC analysis according to Section 8.</p><p class="depth0">4.0. Concentration Verification Chemical Analyses</p><p class="depth0">a. Because of the difficulty of homogeneously mixing base fluid with sediment, it is important to demonstrate that the base fluid is evenly mixed within the sediment sea water slurry that was added to each bottle. Of the seven serum bottles set up for each test or control condition, three are randomly selected for concentration verification analyses. These should be immediately placed at 4 [deg]C and a sample of sediment from each bottle should be analyzed for base fluid content as soon as possible. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. The results should show recovery of at least 70% of the spiked base fluid. Use an appropriate analytical procedure described in Section 8 to perform the extractions and analyses. If any set of sediments fail the criteria for concentration verification, then the corrective action for that set of sediments is also outlined in Section 8.</p><p class="depth0">b. The nominal concentrations and the measured concentrations from the three bottles selected for concentration verification should be reported for the initial test concentrations. The coefficient of variation (CV) for the replicate samples must be less than 20%. If base fluid content results are not within the 20% CV limit, the test must be stopped and restarted with adequately mixed sediment.</p><p class="depth0">5.0. Gas Monitoring Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Biodegradation is measured by total gas as specified in ISO 11734:1995. Methane production can also be tracked and is described in Section 7.</p><p class="depth0">5.1. Total Gas Monitoring Procedures</p><p class="depth0">Bottles should be brought to room temperature before readings are taken. a. The bottles are observed to confirm that the resazurin has not oxidized to pink or blue. Total gas production in the culture bottles should be measured using a pressure transducer (one source is Biotech International). The pressure readings from test and control cultures are evaluated against a calibration curve created by analyzing the pressure created by known additions of gas to bottles established identically to the culture bottles. Bottles used for the standard curve contain 75 mL of water, and are sealed with the same rubber septa and crimp cap seals used for the bottles containing sediment. After the bottles used in the standard curve have been sealed, a syringe needle inserted through the septa is used to equilibrate the pressure inside the bottles to the outside atmosphere. The syringe needle is removed and known volumes of air are injected into the headspace of the bottles. Pressure readings provide a standard curve relating the volume of gas injected into the bottles and headspace pressure. No less than three points may be used to generate the standard curve. A typical standard curve may use 0, 1, 5, 10, 20 and 40 mL of gas added to the standard curve bottles.</p><p class="depth0">b. The room temperature and barometric pressure (to two digits) should be recorded at the time of sampling. One option for the barometer is Fisher Part 02-400 or 02-401. Gas production by the sediment is expressed in terms of the volume (mL) of gas at standard temperature (0 [deg]C = 273 [deg]K) and pressure (1 atm = 30 inches of Hg) using Eq. 16.

An estimate can be made of the total volume of anaerobic gas that will be produced in the bottles. The gas production measured for each base fluid can be expressed as a percent of predicted total anaerobic gas production.</p><p class="depth0">5.1.1. Calculate the total amount of carbon in the form of the base fluid present in each bottle.</p><p class="depth0">a. Each bottle is to contain 30 g dry weight sediment. The base fluid concentration is 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry weight sediment. Therefore:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.021</p><p class="depth0">5.1.2. Theory states that anaerobic microorganisms will convert 1 mole of carbon substrate into 1 mole of total anaerobic gas production.</p><p class="depth0">a. Calculate the number of moles of carbon in each bottle.</p><p class="depth0">b. The molecular weight of carbon is 12 (i.e., 1 mole of carbon = 12 g). Therefore, the number of moles of carbon in each bottle can be calculated.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.022</p><p class="depth0">5.1.3. Calculate the predicted volume of anaerobic gas.</p><p class="depth0">One mole of gas equals 22.4 L (at standard temperature and pressure), therefore,[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.023</p><p class="depth0">5.2. Gas Venting</p><p class="depth0">a. If the pressure in the serum bottle is too great for the pressure transducer or syringe, some of the excess gas must be wasted. The best method to do this is to vent the excess gas right after measurement. To do this, remove the barrel from a 10-mL syringe and fill it \1/3\ full with water. This is then inserted into the bottle through the stopper using a small diameter (high gauge) needle. The excess pressure is allowed to vent through the water until the bubbles stop. This allows equalization of the pressure inside the bottle to atmospheric without introducing oxygen. The amount of gas vented (which is equal to the volume determined that day) must be kept track of each time the bottles are vented. A simple way to do this in a spreadsheet format is to have a separate column in which cumulative vented gas is tabulated. Each time the volume of gas in the cultures is analyzed, the total gas produced is equal to the gas in the culture at that time plus the total of the vented gas.</p><p class="depth0">b. To keep track of the methane lost in the venting procedure, multiply the amount of gas vented each time by the corrected % methane determined on that day. The answer gives the volume of methane wasted. This must be added into the cumulative totals similarly to the total gas additions.</p><p class="depth0">6.0. Test Acceptability and Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">6.1. Test Acceptability</p><p class="depth0">At day 275 or when gas production has plateaued, whichever is first, the controls are evaluated to confirm that the test has been performed appropriately. In order for

this modification of the closed bottle biodegradation test to be considered acceptable, all the controls must meet the biodegradation levels indicated in Table 1. The intermediate control hexadecene must produce at least 30% of the theoretical gas production. This level may be reexamined after two years and more data has been generated.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Test Acceptability Criteria----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Concentration                      Percent biodegradability as a function of gas measurement----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Squalane negative      Hexadecene intermediate</p><p class="depth0">Positive control             control                   control----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2,000 mg carbon/kg.................  =60%         <=5% theoretical......  =30%</p><p class="depth0">theoretical.                                    theoretical.----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">6.2 Interpretation</p><p class="depth0">a. In order for a fluid to pass the closed bottle test, the biodegradation of the base fluid as indicated by the total amount of total gas (or methane) generated once gas production has plateaued (or at the end of 275 days, which ever is first) must be greater than or equal to the volume of gas (or methane) produced by the reference standard (internal elefin or ester).</p><p class="depth0">b. The method for evaluating the data to determine whether a fluid has passed the biodegradation test must use the equations:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.024

Methane Measurement</p><p class="depth0">7.1. Methane Monitoring Procedures</p><p class="depth0">a. The use of total gas production alone may result in an underestimation of the actual metabolism occurring since CO2 is slightly soluble in water. An acceptable alternative method is to monitor methane production and total gas production. This is easily done using GC analysis. A direct injection of headspace gases can be made into a GC using almost any packed or capillary column with an FID detector. Unless volatile fuels or solvents are present in the test material or the inocula, the only component of the headspace gas that can be detected using an FID detector is methane. The percent methane in the headspace gas is determined by comparing the response of the sample injections to the response from injections of known percent methane standards. The percent methane is corrected for water vapor saturation using Eq. 21 and then converted to a volume of dry methane using Eq. 22.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.025

The total volume of serum bottles sold as 125 mL bottles (Wheaton) is 154.8 mL.</p><p class="depth0">c. The volumes of methane produced are then compared to the volumes of methane in the controls to determine if a significant inhibition of methane production or a significant increase of methane production has been observed. Effective statistical analyses are important, as variability in the results is common due to the heterogeneity of the inoculum's source. It is also common to observe that the timing of the initiation of culture activity is not equal in all of the cultures. Expect a great variability over the period when the cultures are active, some replicates will start sooner than others, but all of the replicates should eventually reach similar levels of base fluid degradation and methane production.</p><p class="depth0">7.2. Expected Methane Production Calculations</p><p class="depth0">a. The amount of methane expected can be calculated using the equation of Symons and Buswell (Eq. 23). In the case of complete mineralization, all of the carbon will appear as wither CO2 or CH4, thus the total moles of gas produced will be equal to the total moles of carbon in the parent molecule. The use of the Buswell equation allows you to calculate the effects the redox potential will have on the distribution of the products in methanogenic cultures. More reduced electron donors will allow the production of more methane, while more oxidized electron donors will cause a production of more carbon dioxide.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.027</p><p class="depth0">b. An example calculation of the expected methane volume in a culture fed 2,000 mg/kg hexadecene is as follows. The application of Symons and Buswell's equation reveals that hexadecene (C16H32) will yield 4 moles of CO2 and 12 moles of CH4. Assuming 30 g of dry sediment are added to the bottles with 2,334 mg hexadecene/kg dry sediment (i.e., equivalent to 2,000 mg carbon/kg dry sediment) the calculation is as follows.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR18MY12.028</p><p class="depth0">c. By subtracting the average amount of methane in control bottles from the test bottles and then dividing by the expected volume an evaluation of the completion of the process may be conducted.</p><p class="depth0">8.0. Concentration Verification Analysis</p><p class="depth0">The Concentration Verification analysis is required at the beginning of the test to ensure homogeneity and confirm that the required amount of fluid was delivered to the sediments at the start of the test.</p><p class="depth0">8.1. Three samples per fluid need to be analyzed and achieve <=20% Coefficient of Variability and an average of =70% to <=120% of fluid delivered to sediment.</p><p class="depth0">8.2. If a third party performs the analysis, then the laboratory should be capable of delivering the homogeneity data within seven days, in order to identify any samples that do not meet the homogeneity requirement as quickly as possible.</p><p class="depth0">8.3. If one sediment/fluid set, out a multiple set batch of samples, fails these criteria, then that one set of samples must be discarded and a fresh set of spiked sediment prepared, started, and analyzed to ensure homogeneity. The same stock sediment is used to prepare the replacement set(s). The remaining sets do not need to be re-mixed or restarted.</p><p class="depth0">8.4. The re-mixed set(s) will need to be run the additional days as appropriate to ensure that the total number of days is the same for all sets of bottles, even though the specific days are not aligned.</p><p class="depth0">8.5. Re-mixing of bottle sets can be performed multiple times as a result of a failure of the analytical criteria, until the holding time for the stock sediment has expired (60 days). If the problem set(s) has not fallen within the acceptable analytical criteria by then, it must not be part of the batch of bottles run. If the problem batch is one of the controls, and those controls were not successfully prepared when the sediment holding time expired, then the entire test must be restarted.</p><p class="depth0">9.0 Program Quality Assurance and Quality Control</p><p class="depth0">9.1 Calibration</p><p class="depth0">9.1.1.

Each laboratory that uses this method must generate acceptable results using the procedures described in Sections 7, 9.2, and 12 of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Summary of Method</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Analysis of NAF for crude oil contamination is a step-wise process. The analyst first performs a qualitative assessment of the presence or absence of crude oil in the sample. If crude oil is detected during this qualitative assessment, the analyst must perform a quantitative analysis of the crude oil concentration.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 A sample of NAF is centrifuged to obtain a solids free supernate.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 The test sample is prepared by removing an aliquot of the solids free supernate, spiking it with internal standard, and analyzing it using GC/MS techniques. The components are separated by the gas chromatograph and detected by the mass spectrometer.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Qualitative identification of crude oil contamination is performed by comparing the Total Ion Chromatograph (TIC) scans and Extracted Ion Profile (EIP) scans of test sample to that of uncontaminated base fluids, and examining the profiles for chromatographic signatures diagnostic of oil contamination.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 The presence or absence of crude oil contamination observed in the full scan profiles and selected extracted ion profiles determines further sample quantitation and reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 If crude oil is detected in the qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis must be performed by calibrating the GC/MS using a designated NAF spiked with known concentrations of a designated oil.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Quality is assured through reproducible calibration and testing of GC/MS system and through analysis of quality control samples.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">3.1 A NAF is one in which the continuous--phase is a water immiscible fluid such

as an oleaginous material (e.g., mineral oil, enhance mineral oil, paraffinic oil, or synthetic material such as olefins and vegetable esters).</p><p class="depth0">3.2 TIC--Total Ion Chromatograph.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 EIP--Extracted Ion Profile.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 TCB--1,3,5-trichlorobenzene is used as the internal standard in this method.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 SPTM--System Performance Test Mix standards are used to establish retention times and monitor detection levels.</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Interferences and Limitations</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Solvents, reagents, glassware, and other sample processing hardware may yield artifacts and/or elevated baselines causing misinterpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 All Materials used in the analysis shall be demonstrated to be free from interferences by running method blanks. Specific selection of reagents and purification of solvents by distillation in all-glass systems may be required.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Glassware shall be cleaned by rinsing with solvent and baking at 400 [deg]C for a minimum of 1 hour.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Interferences may vary from source to source, depending on the diversity of the samples being tested.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Variations in and additions of base fluids and/or drilling fluid additives (emulsifiers, dispersants, fluid loss control agents, etc.) might also cause interferences and misinterpretation of chromatograms.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Difference in light crude oils, medium crude oils, and heavy crude oils will result in different responses and thus different interpretation of scans and calculated percentages.</p><p class="depth0">5.0 Safety</p><p class="depth0">5.1 The toxicity or carcinogenicity of each reagent used in this method has not been precisely determined; however each chemical shall be treated as a potential health hazard. Exposure to these chemicals should be reduced to the lowest possible level.</p><p class="depth0">5.2 Unknown samples may contain high concentration of volatile toxic compounds. Sample containers should be opened in a hood and handled with gloves to prevent exposure. In addition, all sample preparation should be conducted in a fume hood to limit the potential exposure to harmful contaminates.</p><p class="depth0">5.3 This method does not address all safety issues associated with its use. The laboratory is responsible for maintaining a safe work environment and a current awareness file of OSHA regulations regarding the safe handling of the chemicals specified in this method.

Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435--Determination of the Amount of</p><p class="depth0">Non-Aqueous Drilling Fluid (NAF) Base Fluid From Drill Cuttings by a Retort Chamber (Derived From API Recommended Practice 13B-2) (EPA Method</p><p class="depth0">1674)</p><p class="depth0">1. Description</p><p class="depth0">a. This procedure is specifically intended to measure the amount of non-aqueous drilling fluid (NAF) base fluid from cuttings generated during a drilling operation. This procedure is a retort test which measures all oily material (NAF base fluid) and water released from a cuttings sample when heated in a calibrated and properly operating ``Retort'' instrument.</p><p class="depth0">b. In this retort test a known mass of cuttings is heated in the retort chamber to vaporize the liquids associated with the sample. The NAF base fluid and water vapors are then condensed, collected, and measured in a precision graduated receiver.</p><p class="depth0">Note: Obtaining a representative sample requires special attention to the details of sample handling (e.g., location, method, frequency). See Addendum A and B for minimum requirements for collecting representative samples. Additional sampling procedures in a given area may be specified by the NPDES permit controlling authority.</p><p class="depth0">2. Equipment</p><p class="depth0">a.

Liquid receiver (10-cm\3\, 20-cm\3\)--the 10-cm\3\ and 20-cm\3\ receivers are specially designed cylindrical glassware with rounded bottom to facilitate cleaning and funnel-shaped top to catch falling drops. For compliance monitoring under the NPDES program, the analyst shall use the 10-cm\3\ liquid receiver with 0.1 ml graduations to achieve greater accuracy.</p><p class="depth0">1.

This is (V), cm\3\.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If an emulsion interface is present between the oil and water phases, heating the interface may break the emulsion. As a suggestion, remove the retort assembly from the heating jacket by grasping the condenser. Carefully heat the receiver along the emulsion band by gently touching the receiver for short intervals with the hot retort assembly. Avoid boiling the liquids. After the emulsion interface is broken, allow the liquid receiver to cool. Read the water volume at the lowest point of the meniscus.</p><p class="depth0">l.

Addendum A to Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435--Sampling of Cuttings</p><p class="depth0">Discharge Streams for use with API Recommended Practice 13B-2</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Sampling Locations</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Each NAF-cuttings waste stream that discharges into the ocean shall be sampled and analyzed as detailed in appendix 7. NAF-cuttings discharges to the ocean may include discharges from primary shakers, secondary shakers, cuttings dryer, fines removal unit, accumulated solids, and any other cuttings separation device whose NAF-cuttings waste is discharged to the ocean. NAF-cuttings wastestreams not directly discharged to the ocean (e.g., NAF-cuttings generated from shake shakers and sent to a cuttings dryer for additional processing) do not require sampling and analysis.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 The collected samples shall be representative of each NAF-cuttings discharge. Operators shall conduct sampling to avoid the serious consequences of error (i.e., bias or inaccuracy). Operators shall collect NAF-cuttings samples near the point of origin and before the solids and liquid fractions of the stream have a chance to separate from one another. For example, operators shall collect shale shaker NAF-cuttings samples at the point where NAF-cuttings are coming off the shale shaker and not from a holding container downstream where separation of larger particles from the liquid can take place.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 Operators shall provide a simple schematic diagram of the solids control system and sample locations to the NPDES permit controlling authority.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Type of Sample and Sampling Frequency</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Each NAF-cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids discharge has an associated mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fraction (X) for each sampling interval (see Section 2.4 of this addendum). Operators shall collect a single discrete NAF-cuttings sample for each NAF-cuttings waste stream discharged to the ocean during every sampling interval.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 Operators shall use measured depth in feet from the Kelly bushing when samples are collected.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 The NAF-cuttings samples collected for the mass fraction analysis (see Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) shall also be used for the retort analysis (see Equations 1-5, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Operators shall collect and analyze at least one set of NAF-cuttings samples per day while discharging. Operators engaged in fast drilling (i.e., greater than 500 linear NAF feet advancement of drill bit per day) shall collect and analyze one set of NAF-cuttings samples per 500 linear NAF feet of footage drilled. Operators are not required to collect and analyze more than three sets of NAF-cuttings samples per day (i.e., three sampling intervals). Operators performing zero discharge of all NAF-cuttings (i.e., all NAF cuttings, fines, or accumulated solids retained for no discharge) shall use the following periods to count sampling intervals:

(1) One sampling interval per day when drilling is less than 500 linear NAF feet advancement of drill bit per day; and (2) one sampling interval per 500 linear NAF feet of footage drilled with a maximum of three sampling intervals per day.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 The operator shall measure the individual masses (Fi, kg) and sum total mass (G, kg) (see Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) over a representative period of time (e.g., <10 minutes) during steady-state conditions for each sampling interval (see Section 2.4 of this addendum). The operator shall ensure that all NAF-cuttings are capture for mass analysis during the same sampling time period (e.g., <10 minutes) at approximately the same time (i.e., all individual mass samples collected within one hour of each other).</p><p class="depth0">2.6 Operators using Best Management Practices (BMPs) to control NAF-cuttings discharges shall follow the procedures in Addendum B to appendix 7 of subpart A of 40 CFR 435.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Sample Size and Handling</p><p class="depth0">3.1 The volume of each sample depends on the volumetric flow rate (cm\3\/s) of the NAF-cuttings stream and the sampling time period (e.g., <10 minutes). Consequently, different solids control equipment units producing different NAF-cuttings waste streams at different volumetric flow rates will produce different size samples for the same period of time. Operators shall use appropriately sized sample containers for each NAF-cuttings waste stream to ensure no NAF-cuttings are spilled during sample collection. Operators shall use the same time period (e.g., <10 minutes) to collect NAF-cuttings samples from each NAF-cuttings waste stream. Each NAF-cuttings sample size shall be at least one gallon. Operators shall clearly mark each container to identify each NAF-cuttings sample.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Operators shall not decant, heat, wash, or towel the NAF-cuttings to remove NAF base fluid before mass and retort analysis.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Operators shall first calculate the mass of each NAF-cuttings sample and perform the mass ratio analysis (see Equation 6, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part). Operators with only one NAF-cuttings discharge may skip this step (see Section 4.c.4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Operators shall homogenize (e.g., stirring, shaking) each NAF-cuttings sample prior to placing a sub-sample into the retort cup. The bottom of the NAF-cuttings sample container shall be examined to be sure that solids are not sticking to it.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Operators shall then calculate the NAF base fluid retained on cuttings using the retort procedure (see Equations 1-5, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part). Operators shall start the retort analyses no more than two hours after collecting the first individual mass sample for the sampling interval .</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Operators shall not discharge any sample before successfully completing the mass and retort analyses [i.e., mass balance requirements (see Section 4.b, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) are satisfied]. Operators shall immediately re-run the retort analyses if the mass balance requirements (see Equation 4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part) are not within a tolerance of 5% (see Section 4.b, Equation 4, appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).</p><p class="depth0">4.0 Calculations</p><p class="depth0">4.1 Operators shall calculate a set of mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings values (%BF) and mass NAF-cuttings discharge fractions (X) for each NAF-cuttings waste stream (see Section 1.1 of this addendum) for each sampling interval (see Section 2.4 of this addendum) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">4.2 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each individual NAF-cuttings sample: (1) Date and time of NAF-cuttings sample collection; (2) time period of NAF-cuttings sample collection (see Section 3.1 of this addendum); (3) mass and volume of each NAF-cuttings sample; (4) measured depth (feet) at NAF-cuttings sample collection (see Section 2.2 of this addendum); (5) respective linear feet of hole drilled represented by the NAF-cuttings sample (feet); and (6) the drill bit diameter (inches) used to generate the NAF-cuttings sample cuttings.</p><p class="depth0">4.3 Operators shall calculate a single total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BFT) for each sampling interval (see Section 2.4 of this addendum) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">4.4 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each total mass percent NAF base fluid retained on cuttings value (%BFT) for each NAF-cuttings sampling interval: (1) Date and starting and stopping times of NAF-cuttings sample collection and retort analyses; (2) measured depth of well (feet) at start of NAF-cuttings sample collection (see Section 2.2 of this addendum); (3) respective linear feet of hole drilled represented by the NAF-cuttings sample (feet); (4) the drill bit diameter (inches) used to generate the NAF-cuttings sample cuttings; and (5) annotation when zero discharge of NAF-cuttings is performed.</p><p class="depth0">4.5 Operators shall calculate the weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BFwell) using the procedures outlined in appendix 7 of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">4.6 Operators shall tabulate the following data for each weighted mass ratio averaged over all NAF well sections (%BFwell) for each NAF well: (1) Starting and stopping dates of NAF well sections; (2) measured depth (feet)

of all NAF well sections; (3) total number of sampling intervals (see Section 2.4 and Section 2.6 of this addendum); (4) number of sampling intervals tabulated during any zero discharge operations; (5) total volume of zero discharged NAF-cuttings over entire NAF well sections; and (6) identification of whether BMPs were employed (see Addendum B of appendix 7 of subpart A of this part).</p><p class="depth0">Addendum B to Appendix 7 to Subpart A of Part 435--Best Management</p><p class="depth0">Practices (BMPs) for use with API Recommended Practice 13B-2</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Overview of BMPs</p><p class="depth0">1.1 Best Management Practices (BMPs) are inherently pollution prevention practices. BMPs may include the universe of pollution prevention encompassing production modifications, operational changes, material substitution, materials and water conservation, and other such measures.
