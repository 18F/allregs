                                Sec. 1201.22  Filing an appeal and responses to appeals.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Place of filing. Appeals, and responses to those appeals, must be filed with the appropriate Board regional or field office. See Sec. 1201.4(d) of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time of filing. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, an appeal must be filed no later than 30 days after the effective date, if any, of the action being appealed, or 30 days after the date of the appellant's receipt of the agency's decision, whichever is later. Where an appellant and an agency mutually agree in writing to attempt to resolve their dispute through an alternative dispute resolution process prior to the timely filing of an appeal, however, the time limit for filing the appeal is extended by an additional 30 days--for a total of 60 days. A response to an appeal must be filed within 20 days of the date of the Board's acknowledgment order. The time for filing a submission under this section is computed in accordance with Sec. 1201.23 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The time limit prescribed by paragraph (b)(1) of this section for filing an appeal does not apply where a law or regulation establishes a different time limit or where there is no applicable time limit. No time limit applies to appeals under the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (Pub. L. 103-353), as amended; see part 1208 of this title. See part 1208 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to appeals under the Veterans Employment Opportunities Act (Pub. L. 105-339). See part 1209 of this title for the statutory filing time limits applicable to whistleblower appeals and stay requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An appellant is responsible for keeping the agency informed of his or her current home address for purposes of receiving the agency's decision, and correspondence which is properly addressed and sent to the appellant's address via postal or commercial delivery is presumed to have been duly delivered to the addressee. While such a presumption may be overcome under the circumstances of a particular case, an appellant may not avoid service of a properly addressed and mailed decision by intentional or negligent conduct which frustrates actual service. The appellant may also be deemed to have received the agency's decision if it was received by a designated representative or a person of suitable age and discretion residing with the appellant. The following examples illustrate the application of this rule:</p><p class="depth0">Example A: An appellant who fails to pick up mail delivered to his or her post office box may be deemed to have received the agency decision.</p><p class="depth0">Example B: An appellant who did not receive his or her mail while in the hospital may overcome the presumption of actual receipt.</p><p class="depth0">Example C: An appellant may be deemed to have received an agency decision received by his or her roommate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Timeliness of appeals. If a party does not submit an appeal within the time set by statute, regulation, or order of a judge, it will be dismissed as untimely filed unless a good reason for the delay is shown. The judge will provide the party an opportunity to show why the appeal should not be dismissed as untimely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Method of filing an appeal. Filing of an appeal must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under Sec. 1201.14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Filing a response. Filing of a response must be made with the appropriate Board office by commercial or personal delivery, by facsimile, by mail, or by electronic filing under Sec. 1201.14.
