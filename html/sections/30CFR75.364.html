                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Worked-out areas. (1) At least every 7 days, a certified person shall examine unsealed worked-out areas where no pillars have been recovered by traveling to the area of deepest penetration; measuring methane and oxygen concentrations and air quantities and making tests to determine if the air is moving in the proper direction in the area. The locations of measurement points where tests and measurements will be performed shall be included in the mine ventilation plan and shall be adequate in number and location to assure ventilation and air quality in the area. Air quantity measurements shall also be made where the air enters and leaves the worked-out area. An alternative method of evaluating the ventilation of the area may be approved in the ventilation plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least every 7 days, a certified person shall examine unsealed worked-out areas where no pillars have been recovered by traveling to the area of deepest penetration; measuring methane and oxygen concentrations and air quantities and making tests to determine if the air is moving in the proper direction in the area.

Measurements of methane and oxygen concentrations and air quantities and a test to determine if the air is moving in the proper direction shall be made at the measurement point locations specified in the mine ventilation plan to determine the effectiveness of the bleeder system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In lieu of the requirements of paragraphs (a)(2)(i) and (iii) of this section, an alternative method of evaluation may be specified in the ventilation plan provided the alternative method results in proper evaluation of the effectiveness of the bleeder system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hazardous conditions and violations of mandatory health or safety standards. At least every 7 days, an examination for hazardous conditions and violations of the mandatory health or safety standards referenced in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall be made by a certified person designated by the operator at the following locations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In at least one entry of each intake air course, in its entirety, so that the entire air course is traveled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In at least one entry of each return air course, in its entirety, so that the entire air course is traveled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In each longwall or shortwall travelway in its entirety, so that the entire travelway is traveled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> At each seal along return and bleeder air courses and at each seal along intake air courses not examined under Sec. 75.360(b)(5).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In each escapeway so that the entire escapeway is traveled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> On each working section not examined under Sec. 75.360(b)(3) during the previous 7 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> At each water pump not examined during a preshift examination conducted during the previous 7 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Weekly examinations shall include examinations to identify violations of the standards listed below:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sec. Sec. 75.202(a) and 75.220(a)(1)--roof control;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sec. Sec. 75.333(h) and 75.370(a)(1)--ventilation, methane;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sec.
