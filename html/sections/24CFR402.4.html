Renewal without a Restructuring Plan will be considered  sufficient if the rents after renewal would be sufficient to maintain  both adequate debt service coverage on the HUD-insured or HUD-held  mortgage and necessary replacement reserves to ensure the long-term  physical integrity of the project, taking into account any comments  received under Sec. 401.502(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If HUD or the PAE determines that renewal under this section  would be sufficient, HUD will not require a Restructuring Plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If HUD or the PAE determines that renewal under this section  would not be sufficient, HUD or the PAE may require a Restructuring Plan  before the owner's request for contract renewal will be given further  consideration.
