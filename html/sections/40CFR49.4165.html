Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for enclosed combustors and utility flares:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each enclosed combustor or utility flare, the owner or operator must follow the manufacturer's written operating instructions, procedures and maintenance schedule to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For each enclosed combustor or utility flare, the owner or operator must ensure there is sufficient capacity to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 98.0 percent for the minimum and maximum natural gas volumetric flow rate and BTU content routed to the device;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each enclosed combustor or utility flare must be operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 98.0 percent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator must ensure that each utility flare is designed and operated in accordance with the requirements of 40 CFR 60.18(b) for such flares, except for Sec. 60.18(c)(2) and (f)(2) for those utility flares operated with an electronically controlled automatic igniter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The owner or operator must ensure that each enclosed combustor is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A model demonstrated by a manufacturer to the meet the VOC destruction efficiency requirements of Secs. 49.4161 through 49.4168 using the procedure specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOO at Sec. 60.5413(d) by the due date of the first annual report as specified in Sec. 49.4168(b); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrated to meet the VOC destruction efficiency requirements of Secs. 49.4161 through 49.4168 using EPA approved performance test methods specified in 40 CFR part 60, subpart OOOO at Sec. 60.5413(b) by the due date of the first annual report as specified in Sec. 49.4168(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator must ensure that each enclosed combustor and utility flare is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operated properly at all times that produced natural gas and/or natural gas emissions are routed to it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Operated with a liquid knock-out system to collect any condensable vapors (to prevent liquids from going through the control device);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Equipped with a flash-back flame arrestor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Equipped with one of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A continuous burning pilot flame.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An electronically controlled automatic igniter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Equipped with a monitoring system for continuous recording of the parameters that indicate proper operation of each enclosed combustor, utility flare, continuous burning pilot flame, and electronically controlled automatic igniter, such as a chart recorder, data logger or similar devices;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Maintained in a leak-free condition; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Operated with no visible smoke emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pit Flares. Each owner or operator must meet the following requirements for pit flares:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator must develop written operating instructions, operating procedures and maintenance schedules to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions from the pit flare based on the site-specific design.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator must only use a pit flare for the following operations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To control produced natural gas and natural gas emissions during well completion operations or recompletion operations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To control produced natural gas and natural gas emissions in the event that natural gas recovered for pipeline injection must be diverted to a backup control device because injection is temporarily infeasible and there is no operational enclosed combustor or utility flare at the oil and natural gas production facility. Use of the pit flare for this situation is limited to a maximum of 500 hours in any twelve (12) consecutive months; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Control of standing, working, breathing, and flashing losses from the produced oil storage tanks and any

produced water storage tank interconnected with the produced oil storage tanks if the uncontrolled potential VOC emissions from the aggregate of all produced oil storage tanks and produced water storage tanks interconnected with produced oil storage tanks is less than, and reasonably expected to remain below, 20 tons in any consecutive 12-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator must only use the pit flare under the following conditions and limitations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pit flare is operated to reduce the mass content of VOC in the produced natural gas and natural gas emissions routed to it by at least 90.0 percent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pit flare is operated in accordance with the site-specific written operating instructions, operating procedures, and maintenance schedules to ensure good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The pit flare is operated with no visible smoke emissions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The pit flare is equipped with an electronically controlled automatic igniter;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The pit flare is visually inspected for the presence of a flame anytime produced natural gas or natural gas emissions are being routed to it. Should the flame fail, the flame must be relit as soon as safely possible and the electronically controlled automatic igniter must be repaired or replaced before the pit flare is utilized again; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The owner or operator does not deposit or cause to be deposited into a flare pit any oil field fluids or oil and natural gas wastes other than those designed to go to the pit flare.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Other Control Devices.
