                                Sec.  1.121  Manner of making amendments in applications.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications. Amendments in applications, other than reissue applications, are made by filing a paper, in compliance with Sec.  1.52, directing that specified amendments be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specification. Amendments to the specification, other than the claims, computer listings (Sec.  1.96) and sequence listings (Sec.  1.825), must be made by adding, deleting or replacing a paragraph, by replacing a section, or by a substitute specification, in the manner specified in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amendment to delete, replace, or add a paragraph. Amendments to the specification, including amendment to a section heading or the title of the invention which are considered for amendment purposes to be an amendment of a paragraph, must be made by submitting:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An instruction, which unambiguously identifies the location, to delete one or more paragraphs of the specification, replace a paragraph with one or more replacement paragraphs, or add one or more paragraphs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The full text of any replacement paragraph with markings to show all the changes relative to the previous version of the paragraph. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being

placed within double brackets if strike-through cannot be easily perceived;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The full text of any added paragraphs without any underlining; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The text of a paragraph to be deleted must not be presented with strike-through or placed within double brackets. The instruction to delete may identify a paragraph by its paragraph number or include a few words from the beginning, and end, of the paragraph, if needed for paragraph identification purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amendment by replacement section. If the sections of the specification contain section headings as provided in Sec.  1.77(b), Sec.  1.154(b), or Sec.  1.163(c), amendments to the specification, other than the claims, may be made by submitting:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A reference to the section heading along with an instruction, which unambiguously identifies the location, to delete that section of the specification and to replace such deleted section with a replacement section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A replacement section with markings to show all changes relative to the previous version of the section. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being placed within double brackets if strike-through cannot be easily perceived.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amendment by substitute specification. The specification, other than the claims, may also be amended by submitting:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An instruction to replace the specification; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A substitute specification in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.125(b) and (c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reinstatement of previously deleted paragraph or section. A previously deleted paragraph or section may be reinstated only by a subsequent amendment adding the previously deleted paragraph or section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Presentation in subsequent amendment document. Once a paragraph or section is amended in a first amendment document, the paragraph or section shall not be re-presented in a subsequent amendment document unless it is amended again or a substitute specification is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Claims. Amendments to a claim must be made by rewriting the entire claim with all changes (e.g., additions and deletions) as indicated in this subsection, except when the claim is being canceled. Each amendment document that includes a change to an existing claim, cancellation of an existing claim or addition of a new claim, must include a complete listing of all claims ever presented, including the text of all pending and withdrawn claims, in the application. The claim listing, including the text of the claims, in the amendment document will serve to replace all prior versions of the claims, in the application. In the claim listing, the status of every claim must be indicated after its claim number by using one of the following identifiers in a parenthetical expression: (Original), (Currently amended), (Canceled), (Withdrawn), (Previously presented), (New), and (Not entered).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Claim listing. All of the claims presented in a claim listing shall be presented in ascending numerical order. Consecutive claims having the same status of ``canceled'' or ``not entered'' may be aggregated into one statement (e.g., Claims 1-5 (canceled)). The claim listing shall commence on a separate sheet of the amendment document and the sheet(s) that contain the text of any part of the claims shall not contain any other part of the amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When claim text with markings is required. All claims being currently amended in an amendment paper shall be presented in the claim listing, indicate a status of ``currently amended,'' and be submitted with markings to indicate the changes that have been made relative to the immediate prior version of the claims. The text of any added subject matter must be shown by underlining the added text. The text of any deleted matter must be shown by strike-through except that double brackets placed before and after the deleted characters may be used to show deletion of five or fewer consecutive characters. The text of any deleted subject matter must be shown by being placed within double brackets if strike-

through cannot be easily perceived. Only claims having the status of ``currently amended,'' or ``withdrawn'' if also being amended, shall include markings. If a withdrawn claim is currently amended, its status in the claim listing may be identified as ``withdrawn--currently amended.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When claim text in clean version is required. The text of all pending claims not being currently amended shall be presented in the claim listing in clean version, i.e., without any markings in the presentation of text. The presentation of a clean version of any claim having the status of ``original,'' ``withdrawn'' or ``previously presented'' will constitute an assertion that it has not been changed relative to the immediate prior version, except to omit markings that may have been present in the immediate prior version of the claims of the status of ``withdrawn'' or ``previously presented.'' Any claim added by amendment must be indicated with the status of ``new'' and presented in clean version, i.e., without any underlining.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When claim text shall not be presented; canceling a claim. (i) No claim text shall be presented for any claim in the claim listing with the status of ``canceled'' or ``not entered.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No claim text shall be presented for any claim in the claim listing with the status of ``canceled'' or ``not entered.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Cancellation of a claim shall be effected by an instruction to cancel a particular claim number. Identifying the status of a claim in the claim listing as ``canceled'' will constitute an instruction to cancel the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reinstatement of previously canceled claim. A claim which was previously canceled may be reinstated only by adding the claim as a ``new'' claim with a new claim number.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Drawings. One or more application drawings shall be amended in the following manner: Any changes to an application drawing must be in compliance with Sec.  1.84 or, for a nonprovisional international design application, in compliance with Sec. Sec.  1.84(c) and 1.1026 and must be submitted on a replacement sheet of drawings which shall be an attachment to the amendment document and, in the top margin, labeled ``Replacement Sheet.'' Any replacement sheet of drawings shall include all of the figures appearing on the immediate prior version of the sheet, even if only one figure is amended. Any new sheet of drawings containing an additional figure must be labeled in the top margin as ``New Sheet.'' All changes to the drawings shall be explained, in detail, in either the drawing amendment or remarks section of the amendment paper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, may be included. The marked-up copy must be clearly labeled as ``Annotated Sheet'' and must be presented in the amendment or remarks section that explains the change to the drawings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A marked-up copy of any amended drawing figure, including annotations indicating the changes made, must be provided when required by the examiner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure consistency. The disclosure must be amended, when required by the Office, to correct inaccuracies of description and definition, and to secure substantial correspondence between the claims, the remainder of the specification, and the drawings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No new matter. No amendment may introduce new matter into the disclosure of an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Exception for examiner's amendments. Changes to the specification, including the claims, of an application made by the Office in an examiner's amendment may be made by specific instructions to insert or delete subject matter set forth in the examiner's amendment by identifying the precise point in the specification or the claim(s) where the insertion or deletion is to be made. Compliance with paragraphs (b)(1), (b)(2), or (c) of this section is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Amendment sections. Each section of an amendment document (e.g., amendment to the claims, amendment to the specification, replacement drawings, and remarks) must begin on a separate sheet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Amendments in reissue applications. Any amendment to the description and claims in reissue applications must be made in accordance with Sec.  1.173.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Amendments in reexamination proceedings. Any proposed amendment to the description and claims in patents involved in reexamination proceedings must be made in accordance with Sec.  1.530.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Amendments in provisional applications. Amendments in provisional applications are not usually made. If an amendment is made to a provisional application, however, it must comply with the provisions of this section. Any amendments to a provisional application shall be placed in the provisional application file but may not be entered.
