If the reemployed annuitant's annuity, at  the time he or she applies for supplemental annuity, is reduced to  provide a survivor benefit for a spouse, (or, for FERS annuitants only,  a former spouse), the supplemental annuity will be reduced by 10  percent, and the survivor annuities increased, if the annuitant was  retired under CSRS, by 55 percent of the supplemental annuity, and if  the annuitant was retired under FERS, by 50 percent of the supplemental  annuity, unless the reemployed annuitant notifies OPM at the time of  application that he or she does not wish to have such reductions and  increases effected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Creditable service. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All actual reemployment service  performed after the date of retirement on a full-time or part-time basis  may be credited in the computation of a supplemental annuity provided--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the reemployment service was performed on or after October  1, 1982, retirement deductions were withheld or, for CSRS annuitants, a  deposit has been paid under the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 8334;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The reemployment service was not performed subject to another  retirement system, except when the deductions under the other retirement  system have been refunded and a deposit paid to OPM, where the law so  permits, or benefits under the other retirement system have been waived  in favor of CSRS or FERS benefits; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The reemployment service has not been used in the computation  of another supplemental or redetermined annuity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A period of reemployment service during which annuitant status  continues and annuity is paid, and which   is excluded from the normal annuity offset from pay by special statutory  provision, cannot be credited in the computation of a supplemental  annuity or any subsequent annuity entitlement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Commencing date. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in clause (2) of this  subparagraph, the supplemental annuity commences on the earlier of the  first day of the month following--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The day the annuitant is separated from reemployment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The day the annuitant is converted to an intermittent status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The supplemental annuity of a FERS annuitant, and the  supplemental annuity of a CSRS reemployed annuitant who has not elected  FERS coverage and who was--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Involuntarily separated from the reemployment service (except by  removal for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Involuntarily converted to an intermittent status, or;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Separated from reemployment service, or converted to  intermittent status, after serving 3 days or less in the month of such  separation or conversion--shall commence on the earlier of the day after  separation from reemployment service, the effective date of conversion  to intermittent status, or the day after the date pay ceases.</p>
