A vessel that is  eligible to fish in the sablefish primary season may fish in the DTL  fishery for sablefish once that vessels' primary season sablefish  limit(s) have been taken, or after the close of the primary season,  whichever occurs earlier. A vessel's primary season cumulative limit(s)  are considered to be taken when the total amount remaining is less than  the daily trip limit for sablefish north of 36[deg] N. lat., if one is  specified, in Table 2 (North) and Table 2 (South) to this subpart. If no  daily limit is specified, the primary season cumulative limit(s) are  considered to be taken when the total amount remaining is less than 300  pounds. Any subsequent sablefish landings by that vessel will be subject  to the restrictions and limits of the limited entry DTL fishery for  sablefish for the remainder of the fishing year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No vessel may land sablefish against both its primary season  cumulative sablefish limits and against the DTL fishery limits within  the same 24 hour period of 0001 hours local time to 2400 hours local  time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Vessels registered for use with a limited entry, fixed gear  permit that does not have a sablefish endorsement may fish in the  limited entry, DTL fishery for as long as that fishery is open during  the fishing year, subject to routine management measures imposed under  Sec. 660.60(c), Subpart C.
