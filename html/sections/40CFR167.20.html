                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Who must register. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any establishment where a pesticidal  product is produced must be registered with the Agency. This requirement  does not apply to custom blenders as defined in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any establishment where a substance is produced must be  registered with the Agency if the producer intends the substance to be  used as an active ingredient of a pesticide, or has actual or  constructive knowledge that the substance will be used by any person as  an active ingredient of a pesticide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any domestic establishment producing a pesticidal product for  export, or any unregistered pesticide, or any foreign establishment  producing a pesticidal product for import into the United States must be  registered. Also, any establishment, either foreign or   domestic, which produces a pesticidal product for use under an  Experimental Use Permit, FIFRA section 18 Emergency Exemption or section  24(c) Special Local Needs registration, must be registered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information required. An applicant for establishment  registration must submit the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and address of the company.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The type of ownership (individual, partnership, cooperative  association, corporation, or any organized group of persons whether  incorporated or not).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name and address of each producing establishment for which  registration is sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When to apply. An application for establishment registration  must be submitted, and an establishment registration number must be  assigned by the Agency, before any production may occur at an  establishment. In the case of an establishment which has not previously  been required to be registered and is not currently registered, the  producer must apply for establishment registration by submitting an  application within 180 days after the effective date of this regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Assignment of establishment registration number. The Agency will  return incomplete or inaccurately completed applications to the  applicant. If the application is complete and accurate, the Agency will  register the establishment and assign a registration number to the  establishment. The establishment registration number will be entered on  the application, and a copy of the application will be returned to the  applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amendment. If at any time after the first report there is a  change in the information required to be submitted under paragraph (b)  of this section, that new information must be reported to EPA, in  writing on letterhead stationery or on forms supplied by the Agency,  within 30 days after such change occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Duration of registration. Establishment registration will remain  effective provided pesticide reports are submitted annually pursuant to  the requirements of this part. Failure to submit a report may result in  termination of establishment registration, civil and/or criminal penalty  assessments.
