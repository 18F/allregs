                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Carbon dioxide, solid (dry ice) when shipped by itself or when used  as a refrigerant for other commodities, may be carried only if the  operator has made suitable arrangements based on the aircraft type, the  aircraft ventilation rates, the method of packing and stowing, whether  animals will be carried on the same flight and other factors. The  operator must ensure that the ground staff is informed that the dry ice  is being loaded or is on board the aircraft. For arrangements between  the shipper and operator, see Sec. 173.217 of this subchapter. Where dry  ice is contained in a unit load device (ULD) or other type of pallet  prepared by a single shipper in accordance with Sec. 173.217 and the  operator after the acceptance adds additional dry ice, the operator must  ensure that the information provided to the Pilot-in-Command and the  marking on the ULD when used as a packaging reflects that revised  quantity of dry ice.
