                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who may file. Any person seeking an exemption from the PCB processing and distribution in commerce prohibitions imposed by section 6(e)(3)(A)(ii) of TSCA may file a petition for exemption. Petitions must be submitted on an individual basis for each processor, distributor, seller or individual affected by the 1979 processing and distribution in commerce prohibitions, except as described in paragraphs (a) (1) through (9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Processing and distribution in commerce of PCB-contaminated transformer dielectric fluid. Persons who process or distribute in commerce dielectric fluid containing 50 ppm or greater PCB (but less than 500 ppm PCB) for use in PCB-Contaminated Transformers may submit a single consolidated petition on behalf of any number of petitioners. The name and address of each petitioner must be stated in the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contaminated substances and mixtures--processing. Persons who process the same chemical substance or the same mixture containing 50 ppm or greater PCB as an impurity or contaminant may submit a consolidated petition if the chemical substance or mixture is processed for the same use by each person represented by the petition. For example, persons who process a PCB-contaminated pigment into printing inks may combine their petitions into one petition. The name and address of each petitioner must be stated in the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contaminated substances and mixtures--distribution in commerce. Persons who distribute in commerce the same chemical substance or the same mixture containing 50 ppm or greater PCB as an impurity or contaminant may submit a consolidated petition if the chemical substance or mixture is distributed in commerce for a common use. Such a petition is not required to name each person who distributes in commerce the chemical substance or mixture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> PCB capacitor distribution for purposes of repair. Persons who distribute in commerce PCB capacitors for servicing (repair) of PCB Equipment may submit a single consolidated petition on behalf of any number of petitioners engaged in such distribution in commerce for purposes of repair. The name of each petitioner need not be stated in the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Small quantities for research and development. Persons who process or distribute in commerce small quantities of PCBs for research and development may submit a single consolidated petition. The name and address of each petitioner must be stated in the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Microscopy. Persons who process or distribute in commerce PCBs for use as a mounting medium in microscopy

may submit a single consolidated petition on behalf of any number of petitioners. The name and address of each petitioner must be stated in the petition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Processing of PCB Articles into PCB Equipment. A person who processes (incorporates) PCB Articles (such as small PCB Capacitors) into PCB Equipment may submit a petition on behalf of himself and all persons who further process or distribute in commerce PCB Equipment built by the petitioner. For example, a builder of motors who places small PCB Capacitors in the motors may submit a petition on behalf of all persons who process or incorporate motors built by the petitioner into other pieces of PCB Equipment and all those who sell the equipment. Such a petition is not required to identify the persons who distribute in commerce or further process the PCB Equipment. A separate petition must be filed, however, by each processor of PCB Articles into PCB Equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Processing of PCB Equipment into other PCB Equipment. A person who processes (incorporates) PCB Equipment into other PCB Equipment may submit a petition on behalf of himself and all persons who further process or distribute in commerce PCB Equipment built by the petitioner. Such a petition is not required to identify the persons who distribute in commerce or further process the PCB Equipment. If a petition has been filed under paragraph (a)(7) of this section by the builder of the original PCB Equipment, no other petition is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Distribution of PCB Equipment. Distributors in commerce of PCB Equipment may submit a consolidated petition on behalf of persons who distribute in commerce PCB Equipment of one type (such as air conditioners). The petition is not required to name the persons who distribute in commerce the affected PCB Equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Where to file. All petitions pertaining to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> PCB use, which includes storage for use or reuse, manufacture, processing related to manufacture and use, and distribution in commerce related to use or processing for use, must be submitted to: OPPT Document Control Officer (7407T), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> PCB disposal, which includes cleanup, storage for disposal, processing related to disposal, distribution in commerce related to disposal or processing for disposal, and decontamination, must be submitted to: Document Control Officer, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery (5305P), Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20460-0001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Content of petition.
