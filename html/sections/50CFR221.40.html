Unless the ALJ orders otherwise, a party that  fails to attend or participate in a conference, after being served with  reasonable notice of its time and place, waives all objections to any  agreements reached in the conference and to any consequent orders or  rulings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Scope. During a conference, the ALJ may dispose of any  procedural matters related to the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Order. Within 2 days after the conclusion of each conference,  the ALJ must issue an order that recites any agreements reached at the  conference and any rulings made by the ALJ during or as a result of the  conference.</p>
