Nothing in this part 135 prescribes specific methods of procurement. However, neither section 3 nor the requirements of this part 135 supersede the general requirement of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner. Consistent with 24 CFR 85.36(c)(2), section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages, to the maximum extent feasible, a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Nothing in this part 135 prescribes specific methods of procurement. However, neither section 3 nor the requirements of this part 135 supersede the general requirement of 24 CFR 85.36(c) that all procurement transactions be conducted in a competitive manner. Consistent with 24 CFR 85.36(c)(2), section 3 is a Federal statute that expressly encourages, to the maximum extent feasible, a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Flexible Subsidy Program. Multifamily project mortgagors in the Flexible Subsidy Program are not required to utilize the methods of procurement in 24 CFR 85.36(d), and are not permitted to utilize methods of procurement that would result in their award of a contract to a business concern that submits a bid higher than the lowest responsive bid. A multifamily project mortgagor, however, must ensure that, to the greatest extent feasible, the procurement practices it selects provide preference to section 3 business concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procurement standards for other recipients (OMB Circular No. A-110). Nothing in this part prescribes specific methods of procurement for grants and other agreements with institutions of higher education, hospitals, and other nonprofit organizations. Consistent with the requirements set forth in OMB Circular No. A-110, section 3 is a

Federal statute that expressly encourages a geographic preference in the evaluation of bids or proposals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Federal labor standards provisions. Certain construction contracts are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wages determined under Davis-Bacon Act (40 U.S.C. 276a--276a-7) and implementing U.S. Department of Labor regulations in 29 CFR part 5. Additionally, certain HUD-assisted rehabilitation and maintenance activities on public and Indian housing developments are subject to compliance with the requirement to pay prevailing wage rates, as determined or adopted by HUD, to laborers and mechanics employed in this work. Apprentices and trainees may be utilized on this work only to the extent permitted under either Department of Labor regulations at 29 CFR part 5 or for work subject to HUD-determined prevailing wage rates, HUD policies and guidelines. These requirements include adherence to the wage rates and ratios of apprentices or trainees to journeymen set out in ``approved apprenticeship and training programs,'' as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approved apprenticeship and trainee programs. Certain apprenticeship and trainee programs have been approved by various Federal agencies. Approved apprenticeship and trainee programs include: an apprenticeship program approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training of the Department of Labor, or a State Apprenticeship Agency, or an on-the-job training program approved by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, in accordance with the regulations at 29 CFR part 5; or a training program approved by HUD in accordance with HUD policies and guidelines, as applicable. Participation in an approved apprenticeship program does not, in and of itself, demonstrate compliance with the regulations of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compliance with Executive Order 11246. Certain contractors covered by this part are subject to compliance with Executive Order 11246, as amended by Executive Order 12086, and the Department of Labor regulations issued pursuant thereto (41 CFR chapter 60) which provide that no person shall be discriminated against on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in all phases of employment during the performance of Federal or Federally assisted construction contracts.</p>
