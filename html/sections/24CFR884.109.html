                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Funding of adjustments. Housing assistance payments will be made  in increased amounts commensurate with Contract Rent adjustments under  this paragraph, up to the maximum amount authorized under the Contract.  (See Sec. Sec. 884.104 and 884.105).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Automatic annual adjustments. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic Annual Adjustment  Factors will be determined by HUD at least annually; interim revisions  may be made as market conditions warrant. Such Factors and the basis for  their determination will be published in the Federal Register. These  published Factors will be reduced appropriately by HUD where utilities  are paid directly by Families.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On each anniversary date of the Contract, the Contract Rents  shall be adjusted by applying the applicable Automatic Annual Adjustment  Factor   most recently published by HUD. Contract Rents may be adjusted upward or  downward, as may be appropriate; however, in no case shall the adjusted  rents be less than the Contract Rents on the effective date of the  Contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special additional adjustments. Special additional adjustments  shall be granted, when approved by HUD, to reflect increases in the  actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the Contract  Units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real  property taxes, utility rates, or similar costs (i.e., assessments, and  utilities not covered by regulated rates), but only if and to the extent  that the Owner clearly demonstrates that such general increases have  caused increases in the Owner's operating costs which are not adequately  compensated for by automatic annual adjustments. The Owner shall submit  to HUD financial statements which clearly support the increase.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overall limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this  part, adjustments as provided in this section shall not result in  material differences between the rents charged for assisted and  comparable unassisted units, as determined by HUD: Provided, however,  That this limitation shall not be construed to prohibit differences in  rents between assisted and comparable unassisted units to the extent  that such differences may have existed with respect to the initial  Contract Rents.</p>
