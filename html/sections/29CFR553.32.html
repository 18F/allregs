                                Sec. 553.32  Other FLSA exemptions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> There are other exemptions from the minimum wage and/or overtime  requirements of the FLSA which may apply to certain employees of public  agencies. The following sections provide a discussion of some of the  major exemptions which may be applicable. This list is not  comprehensive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(20)</em> provides a complete  overtime pay exemption for any employee of a public agency engaged in  fire protection or law enforcement activities, if the public agency  employs less than five employees in such activities. (See subpart C of  this part.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Section 13(a)(1) of the Act provides an exemption from both the  minimum wage and overtime pay requirements for any employee employed in  a bona fide executive, administrative, professional, or outside sales  capacity, as these terms are defined and delimited in part 541 of this  title. An employee will qualify for exemption if he or she meets all of  the pertinent tests relating to duties, responsibilities, and salary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Section 7(j) of the Act provides that a hospital or residential  care establishment may, pursuant to a prior agreement or understanding  with an employee or employees, adopt a fixed work period of 14  consecutive days for the purpose of computing overtime pay in lieu of  the regular 7-day workweek. Workers employed under section 7(j) must  receive not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay  for all hours worked over 8 in any workday, and over 80 in the 14-day  work period. (See Sec. 778.601 of this title.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 13(a)(3) of the Act provides a minimum wage and overtime   pay exemption for any employee employed by an amusement or recreational  establishment if (1) it does not operate for more than 7 months in any  calendar year or (2) during the preceding calendar year, its average  receipts for any 6 months of such year were not more than 33\1/3\  percent of its average receipts for the other 6 months of such year. In  order to meet the requirements of section 13(a)(3)(B), the establishment  in the previous year must have received at least 75 percent of its  income within 6 months. The 6 months, however, need not be 6 consecutive  months. State and local governments operate parks and recreational areas  to which this exemption may apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Section 13(b)(1) of the Act provides an exemption from the  overtime pay requirements for ``Any employee with respect to whom the  Secretary of Transportation has power to establish qualifications and  maximum hours of service pursuant to the provisions of section 204 of  the Motor Carrier Act, 1935.'' (recodified at section 3102, 49 U.S.C.).  With regard to State or local governments, this overtime pay exemption  may affect mass transit systems engaged in interstate commerce. This  exemption is applicable to drivers, driver's helpers, loaders, and  mechanics employed by a common carrier whose activities directly affect  the safety of operation of motor vehicles in the transportation on the  public highways of passengers or property. (See part 782 of this title.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Section 7(n) of the Act provides that, for the purpose of  computing overtime pay, the hours of employment of a mass transit  employee do not include the time spent in charter activities if (1)  pursuant to a prior agreement the time is not to be so counted, and (2)  such charter activities are not a part of the employee's regular  employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Additional overtime pay exemptions which may apply to emloyees  of public agencies are contained in sections 13(b)(2) (employees of  certain common carriers by rail), 13(b)(9) (certain employees of small  market radio and television stations), and section 13(b)(12) (employees  in agriculture) of the Act. Further, section 13(a)(6) of the Act  provides a minimum wage and overtime pay exemption for agricultural  employees who work on small farms.
