                            <p class="depth0">After reviewing the recommendations of the Regional Administrator or  his designee, the Administrator shall within 30 days of receipt of the  recommendations and administrative record initiate consultation with the  Chief of Engineers, the owner of record, and, where applicable, the  State and the applicant, if any. They shall have 15 days to notify the  Administrator of their intent to take corrective action to prevent an  unacceptable adverse effect(s), satisfactory to the Administrator.  Within 60 days of receipt of the recommendations and record, the  Administrator shall make a final determination affirming, modifying, or  rescinding the recommended determination. The final determination shall  describe the satisfactory corrective action, if any, make findings, and  state the reasons for the final determination. Notice of such final  determination shall be published as provided in Sec. 231.3, and shall  be given to all persons who participated in the public hearing. Notice  of the Administrator's final determination shall also be published in  the Federal Register. For purposes of judicial review, a final  determination constitutes final agency action under section 404(c) of  the Act.</p>
