                            <p class="depth0">The legislative history of the exemption is explicit that the  exemption applies only to an employee who is employed ``primarily'' as  an announcer, news editor, or chief engineer. Thus the Senate Report  states: ``The exemption is specifically limited to those employees who  are employed primarily in the named occupations * * *'' (S. Rept. 145,  87th Cong., 1st sess., p. 37). No specific rule can be established for  determining whether in any given case an employee is employed  ``primarily'' in the named occupations. Generally, however, where an  employee spends more than half of the hours he works in a workweek in a  named occupation, he will be considered to be primarily employed in such  occupation during that workweek. The answer will necessarily depend upon  the facts in each case.</p>
