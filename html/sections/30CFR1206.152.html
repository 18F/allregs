                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies to the valuation of all gas that is not  processed and all gas that is processed but is sold or otherwise  disposed of by the lessee pursuant to an arm's-length contract prior to  processing (including all gas where the lessee's arm's-length contract  for the sale of that gas prior to processing provides for the value to  be determined on the basis of a percentage of the purchaser's proceeds  resulting from processing the gas). This section also applies to  processed gas that must be valued prior to processing in accordance with  Sec. 1206.155 of this part. Where the lessee's contract includes a  reservation of the right to process the gas and the lessee exercises  that right, Sec. 1206.153 of this part shall apply instead of this  section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of production, for royalty purposes, of gas subject to  this subpart shall be the value of gas determined under this section  less applicable allowances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The value of gas sold under an arm's-length contract is  the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee except as provided in  paragraphs (b)(1)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section. The lessee shall  have the burden of demonstrating that its contract is arm's-length. The  value which the lessee reports, for royalty purposes, is subject to  monitoring, review, and audit. For purposes of this section, gas which  is sold or otherwise transferred to the lessee's marketing affiliate and  then sold by the marketing affiliate pursuant to an arm's-length  contract shall be valued in accordance with this paragraph based upon  the sale by the marketing affiliate. Also, where the lessee's arm's- length contract for the sale of gas prior to processing provides for the  value to be determined based upon a percentage of the purchaser's  proceeds resulting from processing the gas, the value of production, for  royalty purposes, shall never be less than a value equivalent to 100  percent of the value of the residue gas attributable to the processing  of the lessee's gas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In conducting reviews and audits, ONRR will examine whether the  contract reflects the total consideration actually transferred either  directly or indirectly from the buyer to the seller for the gas. If the  contract does not reflect the total consideration, then the ONRR may  require that the gas sold pursuant to that contract be valued in  accordance with paragraph (c) of this section. Value may not be less  than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee, including the additional  consideration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the ONRR determines that the gross proceeds accruing to the  lessee   pursuant to an arm's-length contract do not reflect the reasonable value  of the production because of misconduct by or between the contracting  parties, or because the lessee otherwise has breached its duty to the  lessor to market the production for the mutual benefit of the lessee and  the lessor, then ONRR shall require that the gas production be valued  pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) or (c)(3) of this section, and in  accordance with the notification requirements of paragraph (e) of this  section. When ONRR determines that the value may be unreasonable, ONRR  will notify the lessee and give the lessee an opportunity to provide  written information justifying the lessee's value.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> How to value over-delivered volumes under a cash-out program.  This paragraph applies to situations where a pipeline purchases gas from  a lessee according to a cash-out program under a transportation  contract. For all over-delivered volumes, the royalty value is the price  the pipeline is required to pay for volumes within the tolerances for  over-delivery specified in the transportation contract. Use the same  value for volumes that exceed the over-delivery tolerances even if those  volumes are subject to a lower price under the transportation contract.  However, if ONRR determines that the price specified in the  transportation contract for over-delivered volumes is unreasonably low,  the lessee must value all over-delivered volumes under paragraph (c)(2)  or (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this  section, the value of gas sold pursuant to a warranty contract shall be  determined by ONRR, and due consideration will be given to all valuation  criteria specified in this section. The lessee must request a value  determination in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section for gas  sold pursuant to a warranty contract; provided, however, that any value  determination for a warranty contract in effect on the effective date of  these regulations shall remain in effect until modified by ONRR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ONRR may require a lessee to certify that its arm's-length  contract provisions include all of the consideration to be paid by the  buyer, either directly or indirectly, for the gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The value of gas subject to this section which is not sold  pursuant to an arm's-length contract shall be the reasonable value  determined in accordance with the first applicable of the following  methods:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gross proceeds accruing to the lessee pursuant to a sale  under its non-arm's-length contract (or other disposition other than by  an arm's-length contract), provided that those gross proceeds are  equivalent to the gross proceeds derived from, or paid under, comparable  arm's-length contracts for purchases, sales, or other dispositions of  like-quality gas in the same field (or, if necessary to obtain a  reasonable sample, from the same area). In evaluating the comparability  of arm's-length contracts for the purposes of these regulations, the  following factors shall be considered: price, time of execution,  duration, market or markets served, terms, quality of gas, volume, and  such other factors as may be appropriate to reflect the value of the  gas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A value determined by consideration of other information  relevant in valuing like-quality gas, including gross proceeds under  arm's-length contracts for like-quality gas in the same field or nearby  fields or areas, posted prices for gas, prices received in arm's-length  spot sales of gas, other reliable public sources of price or market  information, and other information as to the particular lease operation  or the saleability of the gas; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A net-back method or any other reasonable method to determine  value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, except  paragraph (h) of this section, if the maximum price permitted by Federal  law at which gas may be sold is less than the value determined pursuant  to this section, then ONRR shall accept such maximum price as the value.  For purposes of this section, price limitations set by any State or  local government shall not be considered as a maximum price permitted by  Federal law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where the value is determined pursuant to paragraph (c) of  this section, the lessee shall retain all data relevant to the  determination of royalty value. Such data shall be subject to review and  audit, and ONRR will direct a lessee to use a different value if it  determines that the reported value is inconsistent with the requirements  of these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Federal lessee will make available upon request to the  authorized ONRR or State representatives, to the Office of the Inspector  General of the Department of the Interior, or other person authorized to  receive such information, arm's-length sales and volume data for like- quality production sold, purchased or otherwise obtained by the lessee  from the field or area or from nearby fields or areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If ONRR determines that a lessee has not properly determined  value, the lessee shall pay the difference, if any, between royalty  payments made based upon the value it has used and the royalty payments  that are due based upon the value established by ONRR. The lessee shall  also pay interest on that difference computed pursuant to Sec. 1218.54  of this chapter. If the lessee is entitled to a credit, ONRR will  provide instructions for the taking of that credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The lessee may request a value determination from ONRR. In that  event, the lessee shall propose to ONRR a value determination method,  and may use that method in determining value for royalty purposes until  ONRR issues its decision. The lessee shall submit all available data  relevant to its proposal. The ONRR shall expeditiously determine the  value based upon the lessee's proposal and any additional information  ONRR deems necessary. In making a value determination ONRR may use any  of the valuation criteria authorized by this subpart. That determination  shall remain effective for the period stated therein. After ONRR issues  its determination, the lessee shall make the adjustments in accordance  with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, under no  circumstances shall the value of production for royalty purposes be less  than the gross proceeds accruing to the lessee for lease production,  less applicable allowances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> The lessee must place gas in marketable condition and market the  gas for the mutual benefit of the lessee and the lessor at no cost to  the Federal Government. Where the value established under this section  is determined by a lessee's gross proceeds, that value will be increased  to the extent that the gross proceeds have been reduced because the  purchaser, or any other person, is providing certain services the cost  of which ordinarily is the responsibility of the lessee to place the gas  in marketable condition or to market the gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Value shall be based on the highest price a prudent lessee can  receive through legally enforceable claims under its contract. If there  is no contract revision or amendment, and the lessee fails to take  proper or timely action to receive prices or benefits to which it is  entitled, it must pay royalty at a value based upon that obtainable  price or benefit. Contract revisions or amendments shall be in writing  and signed by all parties to an arm's-length contract. If the lessee  makes timely application for a price increase or benefit allowed under  its contract but the purchaser refuses, and the lessee takes reasonable  measures, which are documented, to force purchaser compliance, the  lessee will owe no additional royalties unless or until monies or  consideration resulting from   the price increase or additional benefits are received. This paragraph  shall not be construed to permit a lessee to avoid its royalty payment  obligation in situations where a purchaser fails to pay, in whole or in  part or timely, for a quantity of gas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Notwithstanding any provision in these regulations to the  contrary, no review, reconciliation, monitoring, or other like process  that results in a redetermination by ONRR of value under this section  shall be considered final or binding as against the Federal Government  or its beneficiaries until the audit period is formally closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Certain information submitted to ONRR to support valuation  proposals, including transportation or extraordinary cost allowances, is  exempted from disclosure by the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.  Sec. 552, or other Federal law. Any data specified by law to be  privileged, confidential, or otherwise exempt will be maintained in a  confidential manner in accordance with applicable law and regulations.  All requests for information about determinations made under this  subpart are to be submitted in accordance with the Freedom of  Information Act regulation of the Department of the Interior, 43 CFR  part 2.
