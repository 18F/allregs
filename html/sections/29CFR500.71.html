                                Sec. 500.71  Utilization of only registered farm labor contractors.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The Act prohibits any person from utilizing the services of a farm  labor contractor to supply migrant or seasonal agricultural workers  without first taking reasonable steps to determine that the farm labor  contractor possesses a valid Certificate of Registration, issued  pursuant to the Act, which authorizes the activity for which the  contractor is to be utilized. This prohibition also applies to a farm  labor contractor who wishes to utilize the services of another farm  labor contractor (see Sec. 500.41). In making the determination about a  contractor's registration status, a person may rely upon the  contractor's possession of a Certificate of Registration which on its  face is valid and which authorizes the activity for which the contractor  is utilized. A person has the alternative to confirm the contractor's  registration through the central registry maintained by the United  States Department of Labor.</p>
