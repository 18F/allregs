                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Breathing zone measurement requirement. The CPDM shall be  capable of measuring respirable dust within the personal breathing zone  of the miner whose exposure is being monitored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accuracy. The ability of a CPDM to determine the true  concentration of respirable coal mine dust at the end of a shift shall  be established through testing that demonstrates the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For full-shift measurements of 8 hours or more, a 95 percent  confidence that the recorded measurements are   within 25 percent of the true respirable dust  concentration, as determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over a  concentration range from 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m\3\; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For intra-shift measurements of less than 8 hours, a 95 percent  confidence that the recorded measurements are within 25 percent of the true respirable dust concentration, as  determined by CMDPSU reference measurements, over the concentration  range equivalent to 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m\3\ for an 8-hour period.\1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\1\ The equivalent dust concentration range to the 8-hour range of  0.2 - 4 mg/m\3\ is calculated by multiplying this 8-hour range by the  dividend of eight hours divided by the duration of the intrashift  measurement specified in units of hours. For example, for a measurement  taken at exactly one hour into the shift, the 8-hour equivalent dust  concentration range would be a one-hour average concentration range of:  8 hours/1 hour x (0.2 - 4 mg/m\3\) = 1.6 - 32 mg/m\3\; for a two-hour  measurement, the applicable concentration range would be calculated as:  8 hours/2 hours x (0.2 - 4 mg/m\3\) = 0.8 - 16 mg/m\3\; for a 4-hours  measurement, the equivalent range would be: 0.4 - 8 mg/m\3\; * * * etc.  A CPDM must perform accurately, as specified, for intrashift  measurements within such equivalent concentration ranges. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reliability of measurements. The CPDM shall meet the accuracy  requirements under paragraph (b) of this section, regardless of the  variation in density, composition, size distribution of respirable coal  mine dust particles, and the presence of water spray mist in coal mines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Precision. The precision of the CPDM shall be established  through testing to determine the variability of multiple measurements of  the same dust concentration, as defined by the relative standard  deviation of the distribution of measurements. The relative standard  deviation shall be less than 0.1275 without bias for both full-shift  measurements of 8 hours or more, and for intra-shift measurements of  less than 8 hours within the dust concentration range equivalent to 0.2  to 4.0 mg/m\3\ for an 8-hour period, as specified under paragraph (b)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bias. The bias of the CPDM measurements shall be limited such  that the uncorrectable discrepancy between the mean of the distribution  of measurements and the true dust concentration being measured during  testing shall be no greater than 10 percent. Bias must be constant over  the range of dust concentration levels tested, 0.2 to 4.0 mg/m\3\ for an  8-hour sampling period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Testing conditions. Laboratory and mine testing of the CPDM for  accuracy, precision, bias, and reliability under diverse environmental  conditions (as defined under Sec. 74.7(e) and (g)) shall be determined  using the NIOSH testing procedure, ``Continuous Personal Dust Monitor  Accuracy Testing,'' June 23, 2008, available at: http://www.cdc.gov/ niosh/mining/pubs/pubreference/outputid3076.htm. All testing results  shall be submitted to NIOSH in writing on the application filed under  Sec. 74.11.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons must proceed in accordance with NIOSH testing procedure  ``Continuous Personal Dust Monitor Accuracy Testing,'' June 23, 2008.
