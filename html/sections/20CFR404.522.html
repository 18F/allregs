                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification by overpaid individual. An overpaid individual who  receives a notice as described in Sec. 404.521 has the right to present  evidence that all or part of the overpayment is not past due or not  legally enforceable. To exercise this right, the individual must notify  us and present evidence regarding the overpayment within 60 calendar  days from the date of our notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Act and we have not yet determined whether we can  grant the waiver request. If the overpaid individual asks us to waive  collection of the overpayment, we may ask that evidence to support the  request be submitted to us.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of the evidence. After a timely submission of evidence by  the overpaid individual, we will consider all available evidence related  to the overpayment. If the overpaid individual has not requested a  waiver we   will make findings based on a review of the written record, unless we  determine that the question of indebtedness cannot be resolved by a  review of the documentary evidence. If the overpaid individual has asked  us to make a waiver determination and our records do not show that after  an oral hearing we had previously determined that he was at ``fault'' in  accepting the overpayment, we will not deny the waiver request without  first scheduling an oral hearing.
