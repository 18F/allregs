                            <p class="depth0">A Mexico-domiciled motor carrier granted permanent operating  authority must have its vehicles inspected by Commercial Vehicle Safety  Alliance (CVSA)-certified inspectors every three months and display a  current inspection decal attesting to the successful completion of such  an inspection for at least three consecutive years after receiving  permanent operating authority from the FMCSA.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Subpart E of Part 365--Explanation of Pre-</p><p class="depth0">Authorization Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria for Mexico-Domiciled</p><p class="depth0">Motor Carriers</p><p class="depth0">I. General</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 350 of the Fiscal Year 2002 DOT Appropriations Act (Pub.  L. 107-87) directed the FMCSA to perform a safety audit of each Mexico- domiciled motor carrier before the FMCSA grants the carrier provisional  operating authority to operate beyond United   States municipalities and commercial zones on the United States-Mexico  international border.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FMCSA will decide whether it will conduct the safety audit  at the Mexico-domiciled motor carrier's principal place of business in  Mexico or at a location specified by the FMCSA in the United States, in  accordance with the statutory requirements that 50 percent of all safety  audits must be conducted onsite and on-site inspections cover at least  50 percent of estimated truck traffic in any year. All records and  documents must be made available for examination within 48 hours after a  request is made. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays are excluded  from the computation of the 48-hour period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The safety audit will include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Verification of available performance data and safety management  programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verification of a controlled substances and alcohol testing  program consistent with part 40 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verification of the carrier's system of compliance with hours- of-service rules in part 395 of this subchapter, including recordkeeping  and retention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verification of proof of financial responsibility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Review of available data concerning the carrier's safety  history, and other information necessary to determine the carrier's  preparedness to comply with the Federal Motor Carrier Safety  Regulations, parts 382 through 399 of this subchapter, and the Federal  Hazardous Material Regulations, parts 171 through 180 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Inspection of available commercial motor vehicles to be used  under provisional operating authority, if any of these vehicles have not  received a decal required by Sec. 385.103(c) of this subchapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Evaluation of the carrier's safety inspection, maintenance, and  repair facilities or management systems, including verification of  records of periodic vehicle inspections;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Verification of drivers' qualifications, including confirmation  of the validity of the Licencia de Federal de Conductor of each driver  the carrier intends to assign to operate under its provisional operating  authority; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> An interview of carrier officials to review safety management  controls and evaluate any written safety oversight policies and  practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To successfully complete the safety audit, a Mexico-domiciled  motor carrier must demonstrate to the FMCSA that it has the required  elements in paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4), (7), and (8) above and other  basic safety management controls in place which function adequately to  ensure minimum acceptable compliance with the applicable safety  requirements. The FMCSA developed a ``safety audit evaluation  criteria,'' which uses data from the safety audit and roadside  inspections to determine that each applicant for provisional operating  authority has basic safety management controls in place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The safety audit evaluation process developed by the FMCSA is  used to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evaluate basic safety management controls and determine if each  Mexico-domiciled carrier and each driver is able to operate safely in  the United States beyond municipalities and commercial zones on the  United States-Mexico international border; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify motor carriers and drivers who are having safety  problems and need improvement in their compliance with the FMCSRs and  the HMRs, before FMCSA grants the carriers provisional operating  authority to operate beyond United States municipalities and commercial  zones on the United States-Mexico international border.</p><p class="depth0">II. Source of the Data for the Safety Audit Evaluation Criteria</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FMCSA's evaluation criteria are built upon the operational  tool known as the safety audit. The FMCSA developed this tool to assist  auditors and investigators in assessing the adequacy of a Mexico- domiciled carrier's basic safety management controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The safety audit is a review of a Mexico-domiciled motor  carrier's operation and is used to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine if a carrier has the basic safety management controls  required by 49 U.S.C. 31144;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Meet the requirements of section 350 of the DOT Appropriations  Act; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event that a carrier is found not to be in compliance  with applicable FMCSRs and HMRs, the safety audit can be used to educate  the carrier on how to comply with U.S. safety rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Documents such as those contained in driver qualification files,  records of duty status, vehicle maintenance records, and other records  are reviewed for compliance with the FMCSRs and HMRs. Violations are  cited on the safety audit. Performance-based information, when  available, is utilized to evaluate the carrier's compliance with the  vehicle regulations. Recordable accident information is also collected.</p><p class="depth0">III. Overall Determination of the Carrier's Basic Safety Management</p><p class="depth0">Controls</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The carrier will not be granted provisional operating authority  if the FMCSA fails to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Verify a controlled substances and alcohol testing program  consistent with part 40 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verify a system of compliance with hours-of-service rules of  this subchapter, including recordkeeping and retention;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Verify proof of financial responsibility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Verify records of periodic vehicle inspections; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Verify drivers' qualifications of each driver the carrier  intends to assign to operate under such authority, as required by parts  383 and 391 of this subchapter, including confirming the validity of  each driver's Licencia de Federal de Conductor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the FMCSA confirms each item under III (a)(1) through (5)  above, the carrier will be granted provisional operating authority,  except if FMCSA finds the carrier has inadequate basic safety management  controls in at least three separate factors described in part IV below.  If FMCSA makes such a determination, the carrier's application for  provisional operating authority will be denied.</p><p class="depth0">IV. Evaluation of Regulatory Compliance</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> During the safety audit, the FMCSA gathers information by  reviewing a motor carrier's compliance with ``acute'' and ``critical''  regulations of the FMCSRs and HMRs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acute regulations are those where noncompliance is so severe as  to require immediate corrective actions by a motor carrier regardless of  the overall basic safety management controls of the motor carrier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Critical regulations are those where noncompliance relates to  management and/or operational controls. These are indicative of  breakdowns in a carrier's management controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The list of the acute and critical regulations, which are used  in determining if a carrier has basic safety management controls in  place, is included in Appendix B, VII. List of Acute and Critical  Regulations to part 385 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Noncompliance with acute and critical regulations are indicators  of inadequate safety management controls and usually higher than average  accident rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Parts of the FMCSRs and the HMRs having similar characteristics  are combined together into six regulatory areas called ``factors.'' The  regulatory factors, evaluated on the adequacy of the carrier's safety  management controls, are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Factor 1--General: Parts 387 and 390;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Factor 2--Driver: Parts 382, 383 and 391;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Factor 3--Operational: Parts 392 and 395;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Factor 4--Vehicle: Part 393, 396 and inspection data for the  last 12 months;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Factor 5--Hazardous Materials: Parts 171, 177, 180 and 397; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Factor 6--Accident: Recordable Accident Rate per Million Miles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For each instance of noncompliance with an acute regulation, 1.5  points will be assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For each instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation, 1  point will be assessed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle Factor. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When at least three vehicle inspections are  recorded in the Motor Carrier Management Information System (MCMIS)  during the twelve months before the safety audit or performed at the  time of the review, the Vehicle Factor (part 396) will be evaluated on  the basis of the Out-of-Service (OOS) rates and noncompliance with acute  and critical regulations. The results of the review of the OOS rate will  affect the Vehicle Factor as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the motor carrier has had at least three roadside inspections  in the twelve months before the safety audit, and the vehicle OOS rate  is 34 percent or higher, one point will be assessed against the carrier.  That point will be added to any other points assessed for discovered  noncompliance with acute and critical regulations of part 396 to  determine the carrier's level of safety management control for that  factor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the motor carrier's vehicle OOS rate is less than 34  percent, or if there are less than three inspections, the determination  of the carrier's level of safety management controls will only be based  on discovered noncompliance with the acute and critical regulations of  part 396.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Over two million inspections occur on the roadside each year in  the United States. This vehicle inspection information is retained in  the MCMIS and is integral to evaluating motor carriers' ability to  successfully maintain their vehicles, thus preventing them from being  placed OOS during roadside inspections. Each safety audit will continue  to have the requirements of part 396, Inspection, Repair, and  Maintenance, reviewed as indicated by the above explanation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Accident Factor. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the five regulatory factors,  a sixth factor is included in the process to address the accident  history of the motor carrier. This factor is the recordable accident  rate, which the carrier has experienced during the past 12 months.  Recordable accident, as defined in 49 CFR 390.5, means an accident  involving a commercial motor vehicle operating on a public road in  interstate or intrastate commerce which results in a fatality; a bodily  injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives  medical treatment away from the scene of the accident; or one or more  motor vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the accident  requiring the motor vehicle to be transported away from the scene by a  tow truck or other motor vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Experience has shown that urban carriers, those motor carriers  operating entirely within a radius of less than 100 air miles (normally  urban areas), have a higher exposure to accident situations because of  their environment and normally have higher accident rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The recordable accident rate will be used in determining the  carrier's basic safety management controls in Factor 6, Accident. It  will be used only when a carrier incurs two   or more recordable accidents within the 12 months before the safety  audit. An urban carrier (a carrier operating entirely within a radius of  100 air miles) with a recordable rate per million miles greater than 1.7  will be deemed to have inadequate basic safety management controls for  the accident factor. All other carriers with a recordable accident rate  per million miles greater than 1.5 will be deemed to have inadequate  basic safety management controls for the accident factor. The rates are  the result of roughly doubling the United States national average  accident rate in Fiscal Years 1994, 1995, and 1996.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The FMCSA will continue to consider preventability when a new  entrant contests the evaluation of the accident factor by presenting  compelling evidence that the recordable rate is not a fair means of  evaluating its accident factor. Preventability will be determined  according to the following standard: ``If a driver, who exercises normal  judgment and foresight, could have foreseen the possibility of the  accident that in fact occurred, and avoided it by taking steps within  his/her control which would not have risked causing another kind of  mishap, the accident was preventable.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Factor Ratings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following table shows the five  regulatory factors, parts of the FMCSRs and HMRs associated with each  factor, and the accident factor. Each carrier's level of basic safety  management controls with each factor is determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Factor 1--General: Parts 390 and 387;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Factor 2--Driver: Parts 382, 383, and 391;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Factor 3--Operational: Parts 392 and 395;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Factor 4--Vehicle: Parts 393, 396 and the Out of Service Rate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Factor 5--Hazardous Materials: Part 171, 177, 180 and 397; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Factor 6--Accident: Recordable Accident Rate per Million Miles;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For paragraphs IV (k)(1)(i) through (v) (Factors 1 through 5),  if the combined violations of acute and or critical regulations for each  factor is equal to three or more points, the carrier is determined not  to have basic safety management controls for that individual factor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For paragraphs IV (k)(1)(vi), if the recordable accident rate is  greater than 1.7 recordable accidents per million miles for an urban  carrier (1.5 for all other carriers), the carrier is determined to have  inadequate basic safety management controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Notwithstanding FMCSA verification of the items listed in part  III (a)(1) through (5) above, if the safety audit determines the carrier  has inadequate basic safety management controls in at least three  separate factors described in part IV, the carrier's application for  provisional operating authority will be denied. For example, FMCSA  evaluates a carrier finding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One instance of noncompliance with a critical regulation in part  387 scoring one point for Factor 1;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Two instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in part  382 scoring three points for Factor 2;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Three instances of noncompliance with critical regulations in  part 396 scoring three points for Factor 4; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Three instances of noncompliance with acute regulations in parts  171 and 397 scoring four and one-half (4.5) points for Factor 5.</p><p class="depth3">Under this example, the carrier will not receive provisional  operating authority because it scored three or more points for Factors  2, 4, and 5 and FMCSA determined the carrier had inadequate basic safety  management controls in at least three separate factors.
