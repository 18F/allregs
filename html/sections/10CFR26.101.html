If the reading is greater than 0.00, take the EBT out of service and proceed with the test using another EBT.

Collection procedures may not require collectors to calculate an average or otherwise combine results from two or more breath specimens to determine the confirmatory test result.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an EBT that meets the requirements of Sec. 26.91(b) and (c) was used for the initial alcohol test, the same EBT may be used for confirmatory testing.</p>
