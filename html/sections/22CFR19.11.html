                                Sec. 19.11  Survivor benefits.

Sec. 19.11-1  Kinds of survivor benefits.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If a participant or former participant dies in active service or after retirement, regular survivor annuities are payable under terms of this section to an eligible surviving spouse, former spouse or child. Also, if all rights to annuity and survivor annuity terminate prior to exhaustion of the participant's lump-sum credit, a lump-sum payment is made pursuant to Sec. 19.13. In addition to the above, an additional survivor annuity, and a supplemental survivor annuity may be payable to an eligible survivor under Sec. Sec. 19.10-5 and 19.10-6, respectively. If any participant or former participant makes an election, files a spousal agreement or becomes subject to a court order to provide a regular survivor annuity for a spouse or former spouse and does not subsequently become entitled to leave a survivor annuity under these regulations (because of separation from the Service and withdrawal of contributions, death after separation but before commencement of a deferred annuity, or for any other reason), none will be paid and such election, spousal agreement or court order to provide such survivor annuity will have no force or effect.


Sec. 19.11-2  Regular survivor annuity for a former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Divorce prior to retirement. If a participant or former participant is divorced prior to commencement of annuity, any former spouse shall be entitled to a pro rata share of such a principal's maximum regular survivor annuity (based on service performed prior to the first date the principal becomes

eligible for an annuity following the divorce) unless a different amount is elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the divorce becomes final or at the time of the retirement, whichever occurs first, or unless a different amount is specified by a court prior to the death of the principal. The principal's annuity shall be reduced at the commencing date under Sec. 19.10-2 in order to provide the survivor annuity committed to the former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Divorce after retirement. In the event an annuitant is divorced after retirement (commencement of annuity), the maximum survivor annuity that may be provided for that former spouse is limited to the amount provided for that person at the time of retirement. Within that limit, the former spouse is entitled to a pro rata share of the participant's maximum survivor benefit (based on service performed prior to the divorce) unless a different amount was elected in a spousal agreement filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement, or in the case of retirement before February 15, 1981, filed with PER/ER/RET within 12 months after the divorce becomes final, or unless a different amount is specified by a court prior to the death of the principal. For this purpose, a joint election filed with PER/ER/RET at the time of retirement is considered a spousal agreement. If the survivor annuity for the former spouse is reduced at the time of the divorce (because the pro rata share or the amount specified in a spousal agreement or court order is less than the amount elected at retirement), the principal's annuity shall be recomputed and paid, effective on the date the survivor benefit is reduced, as if the lower amount had been elected at the outset of retirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Death or remarriage of former spouse and transfer of survivor benefit to a spouse. Remarriage below age 60 or death of a former spouse while a principal is alive will disqualify the former spouse for benefits under this section. In the event of such a remarriage or death of a former spouse, the portion of a principal's survivor annuity committed to that person will become available for transfer to any spouse. If such a remarriage or death of the former spouse occurs after the principal's annuity commences, any reduction in the principal's annuity for that former spouse will be discontinued effective at the beginning of the first month following the remarriage or death unless the annuitant elects to provide or to increase a survivor benefit for a spouse. Such an election may be made within one year after the annuitant receives notice of the remarriage or death of his/her former spouse. The Department (PER/ER/RET) and the annuitant shall each notify the other promptly whenever either receives independent notice of such a remarriage or death. If an election to transfer survivor benefits to a spouse is not made by the annuitant, his/her annuity will be recomputed and paid as if there had been no reduction for the discontinued survivor benefit. If an annuity is so recomputed and an election is subsequently made to designate as beneficiary a spouse to whom married for at least one year at the time the election is made, the principal's annuity shall be restored retroactively to its former, lower rate and then adjusted by cost-of-living increases that have occured since the date of the first recomputation. If an election is made for a spouse when the marriage has not yet lasted a year, the procedures in Sec. 19.10-4 shall be followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Amount of survivor annuity. The amount of a regular survivor annuity is determined under Sec. 19.11-3(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for election of survivor annuity for a person who is a former spouse on February 15, 1981. (1) Any participant, or former participant eligible for a deferred annuity which has not yet commenced, who, on February 15, 1981 has a former spouse, may at any time prior to commencement of annuity, elect, with the consent of any spouse to whom married at the time of the election, to receive a reduced annuity and provide a regular survivor annuity for such former spouse. Such survivor annuity shall be limited by Sec. 19.10-2(b). An election under this paragraph for a former spouse will reduce the amount of any regular survivor annuity that may subsequently be provided for any spouse or other former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any former participant in receipt of an annuity who has a former spouse on February 15, 1981 and who has not committed his/her entire annuity as a base for a regular survivor annuity for a spouse or any other former spouse, may, prior to December 31, 1982, designate any portion of the uncommitted base as the base for a regular survivor annuity for such former spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The annuity of a former participant making an election under this paragraph shall be reduced under Sec. 19.10-2(a) effective February 15, 1981, or from its commencing date if later.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An election under this paragraph shall be made by filing a spousal agreement with PER/ER/RET under Sec. 19.7. A spousal agreement to provide a regular survivor annuity under this paragraph for a former spouse may be revoked or amended after its acceptance by PER/ER/RET as in accordance with the Act and these regulations, only by agreement of the parties up to the last day allowed by this paragraph for filing such an agreement. Thereafter, it is irrevocable. If a participant dies in service after having filed a valid election under this section, a survivor annuity will be paid to an eligible former suriving spouse in accordance with the terms of the election.


Sec. 19.11-3  Regular survivor annuity for a spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In the absence of a joint election or a spousal agreement to the contrary, a participant or former participant who is separated from active service on or after February 15, 1981 who is married at the commencement of his/her annuity shall provide a regular survivor annuity for a spouse under Sec. 19.10-2 equal to the maximum amount that remains available under limitations stated in paragraph (b) of that section after allowing for any commitment of a regular survivor annuity for a former spouse who has not remarried prior to age 60 and who is alive on the date the former participant becomes eligible for an annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A regular survivor annuity is also payable to a surviving spouse for whom a principal elected an annuity under Sec. 19.10-3, Sec. 19.10-4, or Sec. 19.11-2(c) following a marriage after comencement of his/her annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of a regular survivor annuity equals 55 percent of the base designated for the benefit at the time the principal's annuity commenced, adjusted by the total percentage of cost-of-living increases the principal was receiving at death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A survivor annuity is payable to a surviving spouse only if that person was married to the principal at the time of his/her death or if the spouse became a former spouse under the definition in Sec. 19.2(k).
[46 FR 12958, Feb. 19, 1981. Redesignated and amended at 46 FR 18970, Mar. 27, 1981]


Sec. 19.11-4  Procedure in event a spouse or former spouse is missing.</p><p class="depth0">If a participant or former participant has a spouse or former spouse whose whereabouts are unknown, such participant may elect to reduce or eliminate the share of a regular survivor annuity provided for that person under Sec. 19.11-2 or Sec. 19.11-3 by filing an affidavit with PER/ER/RET stating that his/her spouse or former spouse is missing and giving full name, last known address, date last heard from, circumstances of the disappearance and a description of the effort that has been made to locate the individual. Thereafter, the participant shall take such additional steps to locate the missing person as may be directed by PER/ER/RET. That Office shall also attempt to locate the missing person by sending a letter to the individual's last known address given in the Department's files, to the address given on the affidavit, and, if a Social Security number is known, to the Social Security Administration for forwarding. The election and affidavit may be filed at any time before commencement of annuity. It must remain on file with PER/ER/RET for at least one year before being given irrevocable effect by the Department. If the annuity to the former participant becomes effective prior to the expiration of this one year period, the annuity shall be computed and paid without reference to the election filed under this section. Following this one-year period, or at the commencement of annuity, if later, if the missing person has not been located, the affidavit may be reaffirmed by the participant, after which an election by the participant to reduce or

eliminate the share of regular survivor annuity for the missing person shall be given irrevocable effect by the Department. If the annuity to the former participant has commenced, it shall be recomputed and paid retroactively to give effect to any election made under this section.


Sec. 19.11-5  Commencement, termination and adjustment of annuities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An annuity payable from the Fund to a surviving spouse or former spouse begins on the day after the participant or annuitant dies and stops on the last day of the month before the survivor's (1) marriage before age 60, or (2) death. If a survivor annuity is terminated because of remarriage, the annuity is restored at the same rate effective on the date such remarriage is terminated, provided any lump-sum paid upon termination of the annuity is returned to the Fund. The termination of a surviving spouse annuity due to remarriage does not apply to a survivor annuitant who is a surviving spouse of a participant who died in service or retired before October 1, 1976, unless elected following a marriage after retirement under circumstances described in Sec. 19.10-3 or Sec. 19.10-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A surviving spouse or former spouse shall not become entitled to a survivor annuity or to the restoration of a survivor annuity payable from the Fund unless the survivor elects to receive it instead of any other survivor annuity to which entitled under this or any other retirement system for Government employees. (For this purpose, neither the Social Security system nor the military retirement system is considered a retirement system for Government employees.) This restriction does not apply to a survivor annuitant who is a surviving spouse of a participant who died in service or retired before October 1, 1976, unless the survivor annuity was elected under circumstances described in Sec. 19.10-3 or Sec. 19.10-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A child's annuity begins on the day after the participant dies, or if a child is not then qualified, on the first day of the month in which the child becomes eligible. A child's annuity shall terminate on the last day of the month which precedes the month in which eligibility ceases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Regular and supplemental survivor annuities to a spouse or former spouse of an annuitant described in Sec. Sec. 19.11-2, 19.11-3 and 19.10-6(b) are increased from their effective date by the cumulative percentage of cost-of-living increases the annuitant was receiving under section 826 of the Act at death. All annuities payable to survivors on the date a cost-of-living adjustment becomes effective are increased by that percentage except (1) the first increase to a surviving spouse of a participant who dies in service shall be pro rated and (2) additional survivor annuities under Sec. 19.10-5 when the spousal agreement authorizing the annuity makes no provision for cost-of-living increases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The annuity of survivors becomes effective as specified in this section but is not paid until the survivor submits Form JF-38, Application for Death Benefits, supported by such proof as may be required, for example, death, marriage, and/or divorce certificates. In the event that such is not submitted during an otherwise eligible beneficiary's lifetime, no annuity is due or payable to the beneficiary's estate.

Sec. 19.11-6  Death during active duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Annuity for surviving former spouse. In the event a participant dies before separation from the Service and leaves a former spouse, such former spouse is entitled to a regular survivor annuity under Sec. 19.11-2 computed as if the participant had retired on the date of death unless a court order or spousal agreement is on file in the Department waiving such entitlement or providing for some other computation, or unless the former spouse had been found missing and an election filed under the procedures of Sec. 19.11-4 waiving a survivor benefit for that person. Any assumed service authorized to be used under paragraph (b) of this section in computing the annuity for a surviving spouse may not be counted as ``years of marriage'' when determining whether the previous spouse qualifies as a ``former spouse'' under the definition in Sec. 19.2(k) or when computing the pro

rata share under Sec. 19.2(s). A former spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity under Sec. 19.10-5 provided death occurs on or after the effective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Annuity for surviving spouse. If a participant who has at least 19 months of civilian service credit toward retirement under the System, excluding extra service credited for unhealthful post duty in accordance with section 816 of the Act, dies before separation from the Service, and is survived by a spouse as defined in Sec. 19.2(v) such survivor shall be entitled to an annuity equal to 55 percent of the annuity computed in accordance with Sec. 19.10-1 less any annuity payable to a former spouse under paragraph a. If the participant had less than three years of creditable civilian service at the time of death, the survivor annuity is computed on the basis of the average salary for the entire period of such service. If, at time of death, the participant had less than 20 years of creditable service, the annuity shall be computed on the assumption that the participant has had 20 years of service, but such additional service credit shall in no case exceed the difference between the participant's age on the date of death and age 65. A spouse is entitled to an additional survivor annuity under Sec. 19.10-5 provided death occurs on or after the effective date of a spousal agreement providing for the additional annuity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Annuity for a child or children. If a participant described in paragraph (b) of this section is survived by a child or children, each surviving child is entitled to an annuity as described in Sec. 19.11-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Annuity changes. Annuities based on a death in service are subject to the provisions of Sec. 19.11-5 governing commencement, adjustment, termination and resumption of annuities.


Sec. 19.11-7  Annuity payable to surviving child or children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If a participant who has at least 18 months of civilian service credit under the System dies in service, or if an annuitant who was a former participant dies, annuities are payable to a surviving child or children, as defined in Sec. 19.2(e) as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When survived by spouse and child or children. If a principal is survived by a wife or husband and by a child or children, in addition to any other annuity, there shall be paid to or on behalf of each child an annuity equal to the smallest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $900</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $2,700 divided by the number of children--adjusted under paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When survived by a child or children but no spouse. If the principal is not survived by a wife or husband, but by a child or children, each surviving child shall be paid an annuity equal to the smallest of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $1,080</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> $3,240 divided by the number of children--adjusted under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Adjusted rates. In order to reflect cost-of-living increases, the amounts referred to in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) are increased from the commencing date of the annuity to each child by the cumulative percentage of all cost-of-living increases that have occurred under 5 U.S.C. 8340 since October 31, 1969.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Recomputation of annuity for child or children. If a surviving wife or husband dies or the annuity of a child is terminated, the annuities of any remaining children shall be recomputed and paid as though such spouse or child had not survived the participant. If the annuity to a surviving child who has not been receiving an annuity is initiated or resumed, the annuities of any other children shall be recomputed and paid from that date as though the annuities to all currently eligible children in the family were then being initiated.


Sec. 19.11-8  Required elections between survivor benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Bar against concurrent payment under this Act and Workers' Compensation Act. Except as stated below, survivor annuities and survivors' compensation for work injuries under 5 U.S.C. 8102 are not payable concurrently if both are based on the death of the same employee. A survivor entitled to both must elect which of the two benefits he/she prefers. Should all eligible survivors of a deceased employee

elect to receive the compensation benefit rather than the survivor annuity, their rights to the latter are terminated and, if the lump-sum credit has not been exhausted, a lump-sum payment will become due under Sec. 19.13. The one exception to this rule occurs when a widow or widower is being paid the balance of a scheduled compensation award under 5 U.S.C. 8107 due the deceased employee. If so, the widow or widower may receive the survivor annuity and compensation award concurrently.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Election between survivor annuity and social security benefits. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 417 (a) and (e), survivors who are eligible for annuity which is based in part on military service performed by a principal between September 16, 1940, and December 31, 1956, and also for survivor benefits under the Social Security system, may elect to have the military service credited toward the Social Security benefit. In practice, the survivors should apply for both benefits, ask the Department and the Social Security Administration for statements showing the amount of each benefit, and then make their election of where to credit the military service. If Social Security benefits are elected, the rights of all survivors to a foreign service annuity are terminated.</p>
