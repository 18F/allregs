Any person who submits a filing for which a fee is established in this part must pay the currently effective fee unless a waiver is granted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Formula. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the formula for determining each fee is the work months dedicated to the given fee category for the six fiscal years 1987 through 1992 or all years prior to FY 93 for which data are available divided by the number of actual completions in the six fiscal years 1987 through 1992 or all years prior to FY 93 for which data are available multiplied by the average monthly employee cost in the most recent fiscal year for which data are available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> With respect to the fees charged to pipelines filing pursuant to Sec. 381.207(a), the fee for the first year will be $1,000. The formula for the fee in future years will be the work months from the immediately prior year divided by the number of actual completions in that year multiplied by the average monthly employee cost in

the most recent fiscal year for which data are available. With the addition of future years, the formula for Sec. 381.207(a) fees will be updated to include that year as part of the base period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date of fee. Any fee updated under this section is effective on the thirtieth day after publication in the Federal Register of the revised sections in this part, unless otherwise specified in the Federal Register notice.
