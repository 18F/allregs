                            <p class="depth0">Section 1605 of the Recovery Act prohibits use of recovery funds for  a   project for the construction, alteration, maintenance, or repair of a  public building or public work unless all of the iron, steel, and  manufactured goods used in the project are produced in the United  States. The law requires that this prohibition be applied in a manner  consistent with U.S. obligations under international agreements, and it  provides for waiver under three circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Iron, steel, or relevant manufactured goods are not produced in  the United States in sufficient and reasonably available quantities and  of a satisfactory quality;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Inclusion of iron, steel, or manufactured goods produced in the  United States will increase the cost of the overall project by more than  25 percent; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applying the domestic preference would be inconsistent with the  public interest.</p>
