                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. OTPs must provide treatment in accordance with the  standards in this section and must comply with these standards as a  condition of certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative and organizational structure. An OTP's  organizational structure and facilities shall be adequate to ensure  quality patient care and to meet the requirements of all pertinent  Federal, State, and local laws and regulations. At a minimum, each OTP  shall formally designate a program sponsor and medical director. The  program sponsor shall agree on behalf of the OTP to adhere to all  requirements set forth in this part and any regulations regarding the  use of opioid agonist treatment medications in the treatment of opioid  addiction which may be promulgated in the future. The medical director  shall assume responsibility for administering all medical services  performed by the OTP. In addition, the medical director shall be  responsible for ensuring that the OTP is in compliance with all  applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuous quality improvement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An OTP must maintain current  quality assurance and quality control plans that include, among other  things, annual reviews of program policies and procedures and ongoing  assessment of patient outcomes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An OTP must maintain a current ``Diversion Control Plan'' or  ``DCP'' as part of its quality assurance program that contains specific  measures to reduce the possibility of diversion of controlled substances  from legitimate treatment use and that assigns specific responsibility  to the medical and administrative staff of the OTP for carrying out the  diversion control measures and functions described in the DCP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Staff credentials. Each person engaged in the treatment of  opioid addiction must have sufficient education, training, and  experience, or any combination thereof, to enable that person to perform  the assigned functions. All physicians, nurses, and other licensed  professional care providers, including addiction counselors, must comply  with the credentialing requirements of their respective professions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Patient admission criteria--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance treatment. An OTP  shall maintain current procedures designed to ensure that patients are  admitted to maintenance treatment by qualified personnel who have  determined, using accepted medical criteria such as those listed in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders (DSM-IV), that  the person is currently addicted to an opioid drug, and that the person  became addicted at least 1 year before admission for treatment. In  addition, a program physician shall ensure that each patient voluntarily  chooses maintenance treatment and that all relevant facts concerning the  use of the opioid drug are clearly and adequately explained to the  patient, and that each patient provides informed written consent to  treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance treatment for persons under age 18. A person under  18 years of age is required to have had two documented unsuccessful  attempts at short-term detoxification or drug-free treatment within a  12-month period to be eligible for maintenance treatment. No person  under 18 years of age may be admitted to maintenance treatment unless a  parent, legal guardian, or responsible adult designated by the relevant  State authority consents in writing to such treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintenance treatment admission exceptions. If clinically  appropriate, the program physician may waive the requirement of a 1-year  history of addiction under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, for  patients released from penal institutions (within 6 months after  release), for pregnant patients (program physician must certify  pregnancy), and for previously treated patients (up to 2 years after  discharge).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Detoxification treatment. An OTP shall maintain current  procedures that are designed to ensure that patients are admitted to  short- or long-term detoxification treatment by qualified personnel,  such as a program physician, who determines that such treatment is  appropriate for the specific patient by applying established diagnostic  criteria. Patients with two or more unsuccessful detoxification episodes  within a 12-month period must be   assessed by the OTP physician for other forms of treatment. A program  shall not admit a patient for more than two detoxification treatment  episodes in one year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Required services--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. OTPs shall provide adequate  medical, counseling, vocational, educational, and other assessment and  treatment services. These services must be available at the primary  facility, except where the program sponsor has entered into a formal,  documented agreement with a private or public agency, organization,  practitioner, or institution to provide these services to patients  enrolled in the OTP. The program sponsor, in any event, must be able to  document that these services are fully and reasonably available to  patients.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Initial medical examination services. OTPs shall require each  patient to undergo a complete, fully documented physical evaluation by a  program physician or a primary care physician, or an authorized  healthcare professional under the supervision of a program physician,  before admission to the OTP. The full medical examination, including the  results of serology and other tests, must be completed within 14 days  following admission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Special services for pregnant patients. OTPs must maintain  current policies and procedures that reflect the special needs of  patients who are pregnant. Prenatal care and other gender specific  services or pregnant patients must be provided either by the OTP or by  referral to appropriate healthcare providers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Initial and periodic assessment services. Each patient accepted  for treatment at an OTP shall be assessed initially and periodically by  qualified personnel to determine the most appropriate combination of  services and treatment. The initial assessment must include preparation  of a treatment plan that includes the patient's short-term goals and the  tasks the patient must perform to complete the short-term goals; the  patient's requirements for education, vocational rehabilitation, and  employment; and the medical, psychosocial, economic, legal, or other  supportive services that a patient needs. The treatment plan also must  identify the frequency with which these services are to be provided. The  plan must be reviewed and updated to reflect that patient's personal  history, his or her current needs for medical, social, and psychological  services, and his or her current needs for education, vocational  rehabilitation, and employment services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Counseling services. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> OTPs must provide adequate substance  abuse counseling to each patient as clinically necessary. This  counseling shall be provided by a program counselor, qualified by  education, training, or experience to assess the psychological and  sociological background of patients, to contribute to the appropriate  treatment plan for the patient and to monitor patient progress.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> OTPs must provide counseling on preventing exposure to, and the  transmission of, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease for each  patient admitted or readmitted to maintenance or detoxification  treatment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> OTPs must provide directly, or through referral to adequate  and reasonably accessible community resources, vocational  rehabilitation, education, and employment services for patients who  either request such services or who have been determined by the program  staff to be in need of such services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Drug abuse testing services. OTPs must provide adequate testing  or analysis for drugs of abuse, including at least eight random drug  abuse tests per year, per patient in maintenance treatment, in  accordance with generally accepted clinical practice. For patients in  short-term detoxification treatment, the OTP shall perform at least one  initial drug abuse test. For patients receiving long-term detoxification  treatment, the program shall perform initial and monthly random tests on  each patient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Recordkeeping and patient confidentiality. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OTPs shall  establish and maintain a recordkeeping system that is adequate to  document and monitor patient care. This system is required to comply  with all Federal and State reporting requirements relevant to opioid  drugs approved for use in treatment of opioid addiction. All records are  required to be kept confidential in   accordance with all applicable Federal and State requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OTPs shall include, as an essential part of the recordkeeping  system, documentation in each patient's record that the OTP made a good  faith effort to review whether or not the patient is enrolled any other  OTP. A patient enrolled in an OTP shall not be permitted to obtain  treatment in any other OTP except in exceptional circumstances. If the  medical director or program physician of the OTP in which the patient is  enrolled determines that such exceptional circumstances exist, the  patient may be granted permission to seek treatment at another OTP,  provided the justification for finding exceptional circumstances is  noted in the patient's record both at the OTP in which the patient is  enrolled and at the OTP that will provide the treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Medication administration, dispensing, and use. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OTPs must  ensure that opioid agonist treatment medications are administered or  dispensed only by a practitioner licensed under the appropriate State  law and registered under the appropriate State and Federal laws to  administer or dispense opioid drugs, or by an agent of such a  practitioner, supervised by and under the order of the licensed  practitioner. This agent is required to be a pharmacist, registered  nurse, or licensed practical nurse, or any other healthcare professional  authorized by Federal and State law to administer or dispense opioid  drugs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OTPs shall use only those opioid agonist treatment medications  that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration under section 505  of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355) for use in  the treatment of opioid addiction. In addition, OTPs who are fully  compliant with the protocol of an investigational use of a drug and  other conditions set forth in the application may administer a drug that  has been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration under an  investigational new drug application under section 505(i) of the Federal  Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act for investigational use in the treatment of  opioid addiction. Currently the following opioid agonist treatment  medications will be considered to be approved by the Food and Drug  Administration for use in the treatment of opioid addiction:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Methadone;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Levomethadyl acetate (LAAM); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Buprenorphine and buprenorphine combination products that have  been approved for use in the treatment of opioid addiction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> OTPs shall maintain current procedures that are adequate to  ensure that the following dosage form and initial dosing requirements  are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Methadone shall be administered or dispensed only in oral form  and shall be formulated in such a way as to reduce its potential for  parenteral abuse.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each new patient enrolled in a program, the initial dose of  methadone shall not exceed 30 milligrams and the total dose for the  first day shall not exceed 40 milligrams, unless the program physician  documents in the patient's record that 40 milligrams did not suppress  opiate abstinence symptoms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> OTPs shall maintain current procedures adequate to ensure that  each opioid agonist treatment medication used by the program is  administered and dispensed in accordance with its approved product  labeling. Dosing and administration decisions shall be made by a program  physician familiar with the most up-to-date product labeling. These  procedures must ensure that any significant deviations from the approved  labeling, including deviations with regard to dose, frequency, or the  conditions of use described in the approved labeling, are specifically  documented in the patient's record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Unsupervised or ``take-home'' use. To limit the potential for  diversion of opioid agonist treatment medications to the illicit market,  opioid agonist treatment medications dispensed to patients for  unsupervised use shall be subject to the following requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any patient in comprehensive maintenance treatment may receive a  single take-home dose for a day that the clinic is closed for business,  including Sundays and State and Federal holidays.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment program decisions on dispensing opioid treatment  medications to patients for unsupervised use   beyond that set forth in paragraph (i)(1) of this section, shall be  determined by the medical director. In determining which patients may be  permitted unsupervised use, the medical director shall consider the  following take-home criteria in determining whether a patient is  responsible in handling opioid drugs for unsupervised use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Absence of recent abuse of drugs (opioid or nonnarcotic),  including alcohol;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regularity of clinic attendance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Absence of serious behavioral problems at the clinic;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Absence of known recent criminal activity, e.g., drug dealing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Stability of the patient's home environment and social  relationships;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Length of time in comprehensive maintenance treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Assurance that take-home medication can be safely stored  within the patient's home; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Whether the rehabilitative benefit the patient derived from  decreasing the frequency of clinic attendance outweighs the potential  risks of diversion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> through (vi) of this section do not apply to  buprenorphine and buprenorphine products listed under paragraph  (h)(2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(1)</em> of this section) is limited to a single  dose each week and the patient shall ingest all other doses under  appropriate supervision as provided for under the regulations in this  subpart.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the second 90 days of treatment, the take-home supply  (beyond that of paragraph (i)(1) of this section) are two doses per  week.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the third 90 days of treatment, the take-home supply  (beyond that of paragraph (i)(1) of this section) are three doses per  week.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the remaining months of the first year, a patient may be  given a maximum 6-day supply of take-home medication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> After 1 year of continuous treatment, a patient may be given a  maximum 2-week supply of take-home medication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> After 2 years of continuous treatment, a patient may be given a  maximum one-month supply of take-home medication, but must make monthly  visits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No medications shall be dispensed to patients in short-term  detoxification treatment or interim maintenance treatment for  unsupervised or take-home use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> OTPs must maintain current procedures adequate to identify the  theft or diversion of take-home medications, including labeling  containers with the OTP's name, address, and telephone number. Programs  also must ensure that take-home supplies are packaged in a manner that  is designed to reduce the risk of accidental ingestion, including child- proof containers (see Poison Prevention Packaging Act, Public Law 91-601  (15 U.S.C. 1471 et seq.)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Interim maintenance treatment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The program sponsor of a  public or nonprofit private OTP may place an individual, who is eligible  for admission to comprehensive maintenance treatment, in interim  maintenance treatment if the individual cannot be placed in a public or  nonprofit private comprehensive program within a reasonable geographic  area and within 14 days of the individual's application for admission to  comprehensive maintenance treatment. An initial and at least two other  urine screens shall be taken from interim patients during the maximum of  120 days permitted for such treatment. A program shall establish and  follow reasonable criteria for establishing priorities for transferring  patients from interim maintenance to comprehensive maintenance  treatment. These transfer criteria shall be in writing and shall  include, at a minimum, a preference for pregnant women in admitting  patients to interim maintenance and in transferring patients from  interim maintenance to   comprehensive maintenance treatment. Interim maintenance shall be  provided in a manner consistent with all applicable Federal and State  laws, including sections 1923, 1927(a), and 1976 of the Public Health  Service Act (21 U.S.C. 300x-23, 300x-27(a), and 300y-11).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The program shall notify the State health officer when a patient  begins interim maintenance treatment, when a patient leaves interim  maintenance treatment, and before the date of mandatory transfer to a  comprehensive program, and shall document such notifications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> SAMHSA may revoke the interim maintenance authorization for  programs that fail to comply with the provisions of this paragraph (j).  Likewise, SAMHSA will consider revoking the interim maintenance  authorization of a program if the State in which the program operates is  not in compliance with the provisions of Sec.  8.11(g).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All requirements for comprehensive maintenance treatment apply  to interim maintenance treatment with the following exceptions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The opioid agonist treatment medication is required to be  administered daily under observation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unsupervised or ``take-home'' use is not allowed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An initial treatment plan and periodic treatment plan  evaluations are not required;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A primary counselor is not required to be assigned to the  patient;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Interim maintenance cannot be provided for longer than 120 days  in any 12-month period; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Rehabilitative, education, and other counseling services  described in paragraphs (f)(4), (f)(5)(i), and (f)(5)(iii) of this  section are not required to be provided to the patient.
