                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duties of recipient. A member of the Commission or decisional employee who receives, or who make or knowingly causes to be made, a communication prohibited by this section, or who receives or makes a communication which he or she concludes should, in fairness, be brought to the attention of all participants to the proceeding, shall transmit to the Commission's Secretary, who shall place on the public record of the proceeding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All such written communications; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Memoranda stating the substance of all such oral communications; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All written responses, and memoranda stating the substance of all oral responses, to the materials described in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to participants. The Secretary shall send copies of the communication to all participants to the proceeding with respect to which it was made, and shall notify the communicator of the provisions of this code prohibiting ex parte communications. If the communications are from persons other than participants to the proceedings or their agents, and the Secretary determines that it would be too burdensome to send copies of the communications to all participants because: (1) The communications are so voluminous, or (2) the communications are of such borderline relevance to the issues of the proceedings, or (3) the participants to the proceeding are so numerous, the Secretary may, instead, notify the participants that the communications have been received, placed in the file, and are available for examination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Post decisional communications. Any Commission member or decisional employee who receives a communication which would be prohibited by this Code, but for the fact that it was received subsequent to the date when the prohibitions imposed hereby have ceased to apply, shall comply with the provisions of Sec. 200.112(a) with respect to such communication in the event that he or she is to act in a decisional capacity in the same proceeding pursuant to remand where he or she concludes, in fairness, that such communication should be brought to the attention of all participants to the proceeding.
