Any  person who did not file comments, or did not participate in any public  hearing(s) on the draft RAP, may petition for administrative review only  to the extent of the changes from the draft to the final RAP decision.  Appeals of RAPs may be made to the same extent as for final permit  decisions under Sec.  124.15 of this chapter (or a decision under Sec.   270.29 to deny a permit for the active life of a RCRA hazardous waste  management facility or unit).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This appeal is a prerequisite to seeking judicial review of  these EPA actions.
