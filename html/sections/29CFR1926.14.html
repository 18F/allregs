                                Sec. 1926.14  Federal contract for ``mixed'' types of performance.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is the intent of the Congress to provide safety and health  protection of Federal, federally financed, or federally assisted  construction. See, for example, H. Report No. 91-241, 91st Cong., first  session, p. 1 (1969). Thus, it is clear that when a Federal contract  calls for mixed types of performance, such as both manufacturing and  construction, section 107 would apply to the construction. By its  express terms, section 107 applies to a contract which is ``for  construction, alteration, and/or repair.'' Such a contract is not  required to be exclusively for such services. The application of the  section is not limited to contracts which permit an overall  characterization as ``construction contracts.'' The text of section 107  is not so limited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> concerning the relationship  between the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and section 107.</p>
