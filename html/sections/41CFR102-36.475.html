                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Stevenson-Wydler Technology Innovation Act of 1980, as  amended (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), authorizes federal agencies to transfer  excess education-related federal equipment to educational institutions  or nonprofit organizations for educational and research activities.  Executive Order 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180) requires, to the  extent permitted by law and where appropriate, the transfer of computer  equipment for use by schools or nonprofit organizations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each federal agency is required to identify a point of contact  within the agency to assist eligible recipients, and to publicize the  availability of such property to eligible communities. Excess education- related equipment may be transferred directly under established agency  procedures, or reported to GSA as excess for subsequent transfer to  potential eligible recipients as appropriate. You must include transfers  under this authority in the annual Non-federal Recipients Report (See  Sec. 102-36.295) to GSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The ``Computers for Learning'' website has been developed to  streamline the transfer of excess and surplus Federal computer equipment  to schools and nonprofit educational organizations. For additional  information about this program access the ``Computers for Learning''  website, http://www.computers.fed.gov.</p>
