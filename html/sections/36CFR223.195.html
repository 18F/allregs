                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Highway yellow paint. The use of highway yellow paint on  unprocessed logs west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States  shall be reserved for identifying logs requiring domestic manufacturing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preserving identification. All identifying marks placed on an  unprocessed log to identify the National Forest System origin of that  log and/or to identify the log as requiring domestic processing shall be  retained on the log until the log is domestically processed. If the  identifying marks are lost, removed, or become unreadable, they shall be  replaced. If the log is cut into two or more segments, each segment   shall be identified in the same manner as the original log.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A generic log hammer brand, known as a ``catch brand'', used to  identify ownership, may be used to replace lost, removed, unreadable or  otherwise missing brands where such use is authorized by the Regional  Forester and approved by the Contracting Officer. Use of such a catch  brand on a log or log segment will signify Federal origin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The requirement to preserve identification of log pieces shall  not apply to logs cut into two or more segments as a part of the mill  in-feed process immediately before processing. Log segments that are  returned to or placed in storage must be marked on both ends with yellow  paint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National Forest System logs. Except as otherwise provided in  this subsection, all unprocessed logs originating from National Forest  System timber sales west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48  States shall, before being removed from the timber sale area, be marked  on each end as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow paint not less  than three square inches in size; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Branded on each end with a hammer brand approved for use by the  Forest Supervisor of the National Forest from which the logs originate.  The brand pattern may not be used to mark logs from any other source for  a period of 24 months after all logs have been removed from the sale  area and until such brand pattern is released in writing by the Forest  Supervisor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Private logs. All unprocessed logs originating from private  lands west of the 100th meridian in the contiguous 48 States that  require domestic manufacturing pursuant to Sec. 223.194 of this  subpart, shall be painted on each end with a spot of highway yellow  paint not less than three (3) square inches in size before removal from  the harvest area. If private logs are acquired by a person who may not  export such logs, the logs must be marked by the person acquiring the  logs at the time of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Waiver of painting requirements. The log painting requirements  pursuant to paragraphs (c)(1) and (d) of this section may be waived if  the Chief of the Forest Service determines that alternate methods for  identifying logs required to be domestically processed are equal to or  better than the procedures required herein.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Waiver of branding requirements. Regional Foresters may waive  the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Regions 1, 2, 3, and 4. On an individual timber sale basis, all  or a portion of the branding requirements pursuant to paragraph (c)(2)  of this section may be waived, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unprocessed logs from any origin are not known to have been  exported by any person from the person's area of operations within the  previous 5; years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The person certifies as follows:</p><p class="depth4">``I hereby request waiver of the requirements to brand each end of  individual logs originating from the ____ timber sale, Forest Service  contract number ____ pursuant to 36 CFR 223.195.
