For the purpose of this paragraph (q)(6), a previous cancellation of enrollment because of insufficient annuity to cover the full amount of the withholdings is deemed to be a termination of enrollment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Sole survivor. When an employee or annuitant enrolled for self and family dies, leaving a survivor annuitant who is entitled to continue the enrollment, and it is apparent from available records that the survivor annuitant is the sole survivor entitled to continue the enrollment, the office of the retirement system which is acting as employing office must change the enrollment from self and family to self only, effective on the commencing date of the survivor annuity. On request of the survivor annuitant made within 31 days after the first installment of annuity is paid, the office of the retirement system which is acting as employing office must rescind the action retroactive to the effective date of the change to self only, with corresponding adjustment in withholdings and contributions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Election between survivor annuities.

within 60 days after the termination of the remarriage and entitlement to a survivor annuity.
