                            <p class="depth0">This part 794 constitutes the official interpretation of the Department of Labor with respect to the meaning and application of section 7(b)(3) of the Act. This section provides a limited partial exemption from the overtime provisions of section 7 of the Act (but not from the minimum wage, child labor, equal pay, or recordkeeping provisions) with respect to employees of an independently owned and controlled local enterprise engaged in the wholesale or bulk distribution of petroleum products, if the enterprise meets certain specified conditions. This exemption was added to the Act by the 1966 Amendments, which repealed a complete overtime exemption previously available for employees of such enterprises (section 13(b)(10) of the Act as amended in 1961). It is the purpose of this part to make available in one place the interpretations of the law governing this exemption which will guide the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator in the performance of their duties under the Act.</p>
