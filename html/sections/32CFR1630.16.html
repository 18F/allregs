If the local  board determines that the registrant would qualify for Class 1-O if he  were acceptable for military service, it will delay such classification  until he is found acceptable for military service. Upon the written  request of such registrant, he will be deemed acceptable for military  service without examination only for the purpose of paragraph (a) of  this section.
