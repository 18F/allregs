                                Sec. 1.169-1  Amortization of pollution control facilities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> may, at any time after making such election and prior to  the expiration of the 60-month amortization period, elect to discontinue  the amortization deduction for the remainder of the 60-month period in  the manner prescribed in paragraph (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 1.169-4. In addition,  if on or before May 18, 1971, an election under section 169(a) has been  made, consent is hereby given to revoke such election without the  consent of the Commissioner in the manner prescribed in (b)(2) of Sec.  1.169-4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amount of deduction. With respect to each month of such 60-month  period which falls within the taxable year, the amortization deduction  shall be an amount equal to the amortizable basis of the certified  pollution control facility at the end of such month divided by the  number of months (including the month for which the deduction is  computed) remaining in such 60-month period. The amortizable basis at  the end   of any month shall be computed without regard to the amortization  deduction for such month. The total amortization deduction with respect  to a certified pollution control facility for a taxable year is the sum  of the amortization deductions allowable for each month of the 60-month  period which falls within such taxable year. If a certified pollution  control facility is sold or exchanged or otherwise disposed of during 1  month, the amortization deduction (if any) allowable to the original  holder in respect of such month shall be that portion of the amount to  which such person would be entitled for a full month which the number of  days in such month during which the facility was held by such person  bears to the total number of days in such month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Effect on other deductions. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amortization deduction  provided by section 169 with respect to any month shall be in lieu of  the depreciation deduction which would otherwise be allowable under  section 167 or a deduction in lieu of depreciation which would otherwise  be allowable under paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.162-11 for such month.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the adjusted basis of such facility as computed under  section 1011 for purposes other than the amortization deduction provided  by section 169 is in excess of the amortizable basis, as computed under  Sec. 1.169-3, such excess shall be recovered through depreciation  deductions under the rules of section 167. See section 169(g).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> See section 179 and paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of Sec. 1.179-1 and  paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.169-3 for additional first-year depreciation  in respect of a certified pollution control facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rules. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a certified pollution control  facility held by one person for life with the remainder to another  person, the amortization deduction under section 169(a) shall be  computed as if the life tenant were the absolute owner of the property  and shall be allowable to the life tenant during his life.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the assets of a corporation which has elected to take the  amortization deduction under section 169(a) are acquired by another  corporation in a transaction to which section 381 (relating to  carryovers in certain corporate acquisitions) applies, the acquiring  corporation is to be treated as if it were the distributor or transferor  corporation for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the right of estates and trusts to amortize pollution  control facilities see section 642(f) and Sec. 1.642 (f)-1. For the  allowance of the amortization deduction in the case of pollution control  facilities of partnerships, see section 703 and Sec. 1.703-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Depreciation subsequent to discontinuance or in the case of  revocation of amortization. A taxpayer which elects in the manner  prescribed under paragraph (b) (1) of Sec. 1.169-4 to discontinue  amortization deductions or under paragraph (b) (2) of Sec. 1.169-4 to  revoke an election under section 169(a) with respect to a certified  pollution control facility is entitled, if such facility is of a  character subject to the allowance for depreciation provided in section  167, to a deduction for depreciation (to the extent allowable) with  respect to such facility. In the case of an election to discontinue an  amortization deduction, the deduction for depreciation shall begin with  the first month as to which such amortization deduction is not  applicable and shall be computed on the adjusted basis of the property  as of the beginning of such month (see section 1011 and the regulations  thereunder). Such depreciation deduction shall be based upon the  remaining portion of the period authorized under section 167 for the  facility as determined, as of the first day of the first month as of  which the amortization deduction is not applicable. If the taxpayer so  elects to discontinue the amortization deduction under section 169(a),  such taxpayer shall not be entitled to any further amortization  deduction under this section and section 169(a) with respect to such  pollution control facility. In the case of a revocation of an election  under section 169(a), the deduction for depreciation shall begin as of  the time such depreciation deduction would have been taken but for the  election under section 169(a). See paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.169-4 for  rules as to filing amended returns for years for which amortization  deductions have been taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Definitions. Except as otherwise provided in Sec. 1.169-2, all  terms used in section 169 and the regulations thereunder shall have the  meaning provided by this section and Sec. Sec. 1.169-2 through 1.169-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Examples. This section may be illustrated by the following  examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. On September 30, 1970, the X Corporation, which uses the  calendar year as its taxable year, completes the installation of a  facility all of which qualifies as a certified pollution control  facility within the meaning of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.169-2. The cost  of the facility is $120,000 and the period referred to in paragraph  (a)(6) of Sec. 1.169-2 is 10 years in accordance with the rules set  forth in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.169-4, on its income tax return filed  for 1970, X elects to take amortization deductions under section 169(a)  with respect to the facility and to begin the 60-month amortization  period with October 1970, the month following the month in which it was  completed. The amortizable basis at the end of October 1970 (determined  without regard to the amortization deduction under section 169(a) for  that month) is $120,000. The allowable amortization deduction with  respect to such facility for the taxable year 1970 is $6,000, computed  as follows:  Monthly amortization deductions:</p><p class="depth2">October: $120,000 divided by 60.............................    $2,000</p><p class="depth2">November: $118,000 (that is, $120,000 minus $2,000) divided      2,000</p><p class="depth2">by 59......................................................</p><p class="depth2">December: $116,000 (that is, $118,000 minus $2,000) divided      2,000</p><p class="depth2">by 58......................................................</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Total amortization deduction for 1970...................     6,000</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in example (1). Assume further  that on May 20, 1972, X properly files notice of its election to  discontinue the amortization deductions with the month of June 1972. The  adjusted basis of the facility as of June 1, 1972, is $80,000, computed  as follows:  Yearly amortization deductions:</p><p class="depth2">1970 (as computed in example (1))...........................    $6,000</p><p class="depth2">1971 (computed in accordance with example (1))..............    24,000</p><p class="depth2">1972 (for the first 5 months of 1972 computed in accordance     10,000</p><p class="depth2">with example (1))..........................................</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Total amortization deductions for 20 months...............    40,000</p><p class="depth2">--------- Adjusted basis as beginning of amortization period............   120,000 Less: Amortization deductions.................................    40,000</p><p class="depth2">--------- Adjusted basis as of June 1, 1972.............................    80,000</p><p class="depth2">---------</p><p class="depth2">Beginning as of June 1, 1972, the deduction for depreciation under  section 167 is allowable with respect to the property on its adjusted  basis of $80,000.  [T.D. 7116, 36 FR 9012, May 18, 1971; 36 FR 9770, May 28, 1971, as  amended by T.D. 7203, 37 FR 17133, Aug. 25, 1972]</p>
