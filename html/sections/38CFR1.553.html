Information routinely provided to the public (press releases, for  example) may be provided without following these sections. In addition,  as a matter of policy, VA may make discretionary releases of records or  information exempt from disclosure under the FOIA when permitted to do  so in accordance with current law and governmental policy. Each VA  component is responsible for determining which of its records are  required to be made available and for making its records available  electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> VA may process, in accordance with the FOIA, records that it  makes publicly available. Information in a public reading room record  will be redacted, for example, if its release would be a clearly  unwarranted invasion of an individual's personal privacy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Some VA components may also maintain physical public reading  rooms. Information regarding these components and their contact  information is available on VA's FOIA home page on the Internet. See  Sec.  1.552(a) for the pertinent Internet address.
