                                Sec. 53.4965-5  Entity managers and related definitions.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Entity manager of a non-plan entity--(1) In general. Under  section 4965(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, an entity manager of a non-plan entity is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A person with the authority or responsibility similar to that  exercised by an officer, director, or trustee of an organization (that  is, the non-plan entity); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> With respect to any act, the person who has final authority or  responsibility (either individually or as a member of a collective body)  with respect to such act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definition of officer. For purposes of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of  this section, a person is considered to be an officer of the non-plan  entity (or to have similar authority or responsibility) if the person--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is specifically designated as such under the certificate of  incorporation, by-laws, or other constitutive documents of the non-plan  entity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Regularly exercises general authority to make administrative or  policy decisions on behalf of the non-plan entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception for acts requiring approval by a superior. With  respect to any act, any person is not described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii)  of this section if the person has authority merely to recommend  particular administrative or policy decisions, but not to implement them  without approval of a superior.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Delegation of authority. A person is an entity manager of a non- plan entity within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section  if, with respect to any prohibited tax shelter transaction, such person  has been delegated final authority or responsibility with respect to  such transaction (including by transaction type or dollar amount) by a  person described in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section or the governing  board of the entity. For example, an investment manager is an entity  manager with respect to a prohibited tax shelter transaction if the non- plan entity's governing body delegated to the investment manager the  final authority to make certain investment decisions and, in the  exercise of that authority, the manager committed the entity to the  transaction. To be considered an entity manager of a non-plan entity  within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a person  need not be an employee of the entity. A person is not described in  paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section if the person is merely  implementing a decision made by a superior.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Entity manager of a plan entity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under section  4965(d)(2), an entity manager of a plan entity is the person who  approves or otherwise causes the entity to be a party to the prohibited  tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for plan participants and beneficiaries who have  investment elections--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fully self-directed plans or arrangements. In  the case of a fully self-directed qualified plan, IRA, or other savings  arrangement (including a case where a plan participant or beneficiary is  given a list of prohibited investments, such as collectibles), if the  plan participant or beneficiary selected a certain investment and,  therefore, approved the plan entity to become a party to a prohibited  tax shelter transaction, the plan participant or the beneficiary is an  entity manager.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Plans or arrangements with limited investment options. In the  case of a qualified plan, IRA, or other savings arrangement where a plan  participant or beneficiary is offered a limited number of investment  options from which to choose, the person responsible for determining the  pre-selected investment options is an entity manager and the plan  participant or the beneficiary generally is not an entity manager.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Meaning of ``approves or otherwise causes''--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A  person is treated as approving or otherwise causing a tax-exempt entity  to become a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction if the person  has the authority to commit the entity to the transaction, either  individually or as a member of a collective body, and the person  exercises that authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Collective bodies. If a person shares the authority described in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section as a member of a collective body (for  example, board of trustees or committee), the person will be considered  to have exercised such authority if the person voted in favor of the  entity becoming a party to the transaction. However, a member of the  collective body will not be treated as having exercised the authority  described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section if he or she voted against  a resolution that constituted approval or an act that caused the tax- exempt entity to be a party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction,  abstained from voting for such approval, or otherwise failed to vote in  favor of such approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, a material   change includes an extension or renewal of the agreement (other than an  extension or renewal that results from another party to the transaction  unilaterally exercising an option granted by the agreement) or a more  than incidental change to any payment under the agreement. A change for  the sole purpose of substituting the successor entity for the original  tax-exempt party is not a material change.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Exercise or nonexercise of options. Nonexercise of an option  pursuant to a transaction involving the tax-exempt entity generally will  not constitute an act of approving or causing the entity to be a party  to the transaction. If, pursuant to a transaction involving the tax- exempt entity, the entity manager exercises an option (such as a  repurchase option), the entity manager will not be subject to the entity  manager-level tax if the exercise of the option does not result in the  tax-exempt entity becoming a party to a second transaction that is a  prohibited tax shelter transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the principles of  paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3">Example. In a sale-in, lease-out (SILO) transaction described in  Notice 2005-13 (2005-1 CB 630), X, which is a non-plan entity, has  purported to sell property to Y, a taxable entity and lease it back for  a term of years. At the end of the basic lease term, X has the option of  ``repurchasing'' the property from Y for a predetermined purchase price,  with funds that have been set aside at the inception of the transaction  for that purpose. The entity manager, by deciding to exercise or not  exercise the ``repurchase'' option is not approving or otherwise causing  the non-plan entity to become a party to a second prohibited tax shelter  transaction. See Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Coordination with the reason-to-know standard. The determination  that an entity manager approved or caused a tax-exempt entity to be a  party to a prohibited tax shelter transaction, by itself, does not  establish liability for the section 4965(a)(2) tax. For rules on  determining whether an entity manager knew or had reason to know that  the transaction was a prohibited tax shelter transaction, see Sec.  53.4965-6(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability dates. See Sec. 53.4965-9 for the  discussion of the relevant effective and applicability dates.  [T.D. 9492, 75 FR 38702, July 6, 2010; 75 FR 46844, Aug. 4, 2010]</p>
