                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Unless the Commission orders otherwise, the jurisdiction of the  presiding officer designated to conduct a hearing over the proceeding,  including motions and procedural matters, commences when the proceeding  commences. If a presiding officer has not been designated, the Chief  Administrative Judge has jurisdiction or, if he or she is unavailable,  another administrative judge or administrative law judge has  jurisdiction. A proceeding commences when a notice of hearing or a  notice of proposed action under Sec. 2.105 is issued. When a notice of  hearing provides that the presiding officer is to be an administrative  judge or an administrative law judge, the Chief Administrative Judge  will designate by order the administrative judge or administrative law  judge, as appropriate, who is to preside. The presiding officer's  jurisdiction in each proceeding terminates when the period within which  the Commission may direct that the record be certified to it for final  decision expires, when the Commission renders a final decision, or when  the presiding officer withdraws from the case upon considering himself  or herself disqualified, whichever is earliest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation, Director,  Office of New Reactors, or the Director, Office of Nuclear Material  Safety and Safeguards, as appropriate, may issue an order and take any  otherwise proper administrative action with respect to a licensee who is  a party to a pending proceeding. Any order related to the subject matter  of the pending proceeding may be modified by the presiding officer as  appropriate for the purpose of the proceeding.
