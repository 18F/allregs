                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. (1) Subject to the prior approval of the Board, a Board-regulated institution may use the method in this section to measure comprehensive risk, that is, all price risk, for one or more portfolios of correlation trading positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A Board-regulated institution that measures the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions using internal models must calculate at least weekly a comprehensive risk measure that captures all price risk according to the requirements of this section. The comprehensive risk measure is either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Board-regulated institution's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A surcharge for the Board-regulated institution's modeled correlation trading positions equal to the total specific risk add-on for such positions as calculated under section 210 of this subpart multiplied by 8.0 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> With approval of the Board and provided the Board-regulated institution has met the requirements of this section for a period of at least one year and can demonstrate the effectiveness of the model through the results of ongoing model validation efforts including robust benchmarking, the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The Board-regulated institution's modeled measure of all price risk determined according to the requirements in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The total specific risk add-on that would apply to the bank's modeled correlation trading positions as calculated under section 210 of this subpart multiplied by 8.0 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for modeling all price risk. If a Board-regulated institution uses an internal model to measure the price risk of a portfolio of correlation trading positions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The internal model must measure comprehensive risk over a one-year time horizon at a one-tail, 99.9 percent confidence level, either under the assumption of a constant level of risk, or under the assumption of constant positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The model must capture all material price risk, including but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The risks associated with the contractual structure of cash flows of the position, its issuer, and its underlying exposures;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Credit spread risk, including nonlinear price risks;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The volatility of implied correlations, including nonlinear price risks such as the cross-effect between spreads and correlations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Basis risk;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Recovery rate volatility as it relates to the propensity for recovery rates to affect tranche prices; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> To the extent the comprehensive risk measure incorporates the benefits of dynamic hedging, the static nature of the hedge over the liquidity horizon must be recognized. In such cases, a Board-regulated institution must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Choose to model the rebalancing of the hedge consistently over the relevant set of trading positions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Demonstrate that the inclusion of rebalancing results in a more appropriate risk measurement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Demonstrate that the market for the hedge is sufficiently liquid to permit rebalancing during periods of stress; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Capture in the comprehensive risk model any residual risks arising from such hedging strategies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The Board-regulated institution must use market data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the Board-regulated institution's correlation trading positions in order to ensure that the Board-regulated institution fully captures the material risks of the correlation trading positions in its comprehensive risk measure in accordance with this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The Board-regulated institution must be able to demonstrate that its model is an appropriate representation of comprehensive risk in light of the historical price variation of its correlation trading positions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Requirements for stress testing. (1) A Board-regulated institution must at least weekly apply specific, supervisory stress scenarios to its portfolio of correlation trading positions that capture changes in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Default rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recovery rates;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Credit spreads;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Correlations of underlying exposures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Correlations of a correlation trading position and its hedge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Other requirements. (i) A Board-regulated institution must retain and make available to the Board the results of the supervisory stress testing, including comparisons with the capital requirements generated by the Board-regulated institution's comprehensive risk model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A Board-regulated institution must report to the Board promptly any instances where the stress tests indicate any material deficiencies in the comprehensive risk model.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Calculation of comprehensive risk capital requirement. The comprehensive risk capital requirement is the greater of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The average of the comprehensive risk measures over the previous 12 weeks; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The most recent comprehensive risk measure.</p>
