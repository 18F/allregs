                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an individual submitting a request for access under Sec.  1.112 has asked that an agency authorize a personal inspection of  records pertaining to him or her, and the agency has granted that  request, the requester shall present himself or herself at the time and  place specified in the agency's response or arrange another, mutually  convenient, time with the appropriate agency official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prior to inspection of the records, the requester shall present  sufficient identification (e.g., driver's license, employee  identification card, social security card, credit cards) to establish  that the requester is the individual to whom the records pertain. If the  requester is unable to provide such identification, the requester shall  complete and sign in the presence of an agency official a signed  statement asserting the requester's identity and stipulating that the  requester understands that knowingly or willfully seeking or obtaining  access to records about another individual under false pretenses is a  misdemeanor punishable by fine up to $5,000. No identification shall be  required, however, if the records are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be  released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any individual who has requested access to records about himself  or herself by personal inspection, and who wishes to have another person  or persons accompany the requester during this inspection, shall submit  a written statement authorizing disclosure of the record in the presence  of such other person or persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any individual having made a personal inspection of records  pertaining to the requester may request the agency to provide the  requester copies of those records or any portion of those records. Each  agency shall grant such requests but may charge fees in accordance with  Sec. 1.120.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an individual submitting a request for access under Sec.  1.112 wishes to be supplied with copies of the records by mail, the  requester shall include with his or her request sufficient data for the  agency to verify the requester's identity. If the sensitivity of the   records warrant it, however, the agency to which the request is directed  may require the requester to submit a signed, notarized statement  indicating that the requester is the individual to whom the records  pertain and stipulating the requester understands that knowingly or  willfully seeking or obtaining access to records about another  individual under false pretenses is a misdemeanor punishable by fine up  to $5,000. No identification shall be required, however, if the records  are required by 5 U.S.C. 552 to be released. If the agency to which this  request is directed determines to grant the requested access, it may  charge fees in accordance with Sec. 1.120 before making the necessary  copies.
