                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Late charges. If the borrower fails to pay all of a required  installment payment or fails to provide written evidence that verifies  eligibility for the deferment of the payment within 30 days after the  payment's due date, the lender or holder will require that the borrower  pay a late charge. A late charge must be equal to 5 percent of the  unpaid portion of the payment due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Collection charges. The lender or holder may also require that  the borrower pay the holder of the note for reasonable costs incurred by  the holder or its agent in collecting any installment not paid when due.  These costs may include attorney's fees, court costs, telegrams, and  long-distance phone calls. The holder may not charge the borrower for  the normal costs associated with preparing letters and making personal  and local telephone contacts with the borrower. A service agency's fee  for normal servicing of a loan may not be passed on to the borrower,  either directly or indirectly. No charges, other than those authorized  by this section, may be passed on to the borrower, either directly or  indirectly, without prior approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other loan making costs. A lender may not pass on to the  borrower any cost of making a HEAL loan other than the costs of the  insurance premium.
