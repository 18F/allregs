                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each pressure vessel containing refrigerants, which may be isolated, shall be protected by a relief valve set to relieve at a pressure not exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the vessel. When a pressure vessel forms an integral part of a system having a relief valve, such vessel need not have an individual relief valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Relief valves fitted on the high pressure side may discharge to the low pressure side before relieving to atmosphere. When relieving to atmosphere, a relief valve shall be fitted in the atmospheric discharge connection from the receivers and condensers. The relief valve from the receivers may relieve to the condenser which in turn may relieve either to the low side or to atmosphere. It shall be set to relieve at a pressure not greater than the maximum allowable working pressure. A rupture disk may be fitted in series with the relief valve, provided the bursting pressure of the rupture disk is not in excess of the relief valve set pressure. Where a rupture disk is fitted on the downstream side of the relief valve, the relief valve shall be of the type not affected by back pressure.</p>
