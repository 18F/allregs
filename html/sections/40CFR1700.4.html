                            <p class="depth0">For the following discharges incidental to the normal operation of Armed Forces vessels, the Administrator and the Secretary have determined that it is reasonable and practicable to require use of a Marine Pollution Control Device for at least one class of vessel to mitigate adverse impacts on the marine environment:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Aqueous Film-Forming Foam: the firefighting foam and seawater mixture discharged during training, testing, or maintenance operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Catapult Water Brake Tank & Post-Launch Retraction Exhaust: the oily water skimmed from the water tank used to stop the forward motion of an aircraft carrier catapult, and the condensed steam discharged when the catapult is retracted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Chain Locker Effluent: the accumulated precipitation and seawater that is emptied from the compartment used to store the vessel's anchor chain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Clean Ballast: the seawater taken into, and discharged from, dedicated ballast tanks to maintain the stability of the vessel and to adjust the buoyancy of submarines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Compensated Fuel Ballast: the seawater taken into, and discharged from, ballast tanks designed to hold both ballast water and fuel to maintain the stability of the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Controllable Pitch Propeller Hydraulic Fluid: the hydraulic fluid that discharges into the surrounding seawater from propeller seals as part of normal operation, and the hydraulic fluid released during routine maintenance of the propellers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Deck Runoff: the precipitation, washdowns, and seawater falling on the weather deck of a vessel and discharged overboard through deck openings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dirty Ballast: the seawater taken into, and discharged from, empty fuel tanks to maintain the stability of the vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Distillation and Reverse Osmosis Brine: the concentrated seawater (brine) produced as a byproduct of the processes used to generate freshwater from seawater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Elevator Pit Effluent: the liquid that accumulates in, and is discharged from, the sumps of elevator wells on vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Firemain Systems: the seawater pumped through the firemain system for firemain testing, maintenance, and training, and to supply water for the operation of certain vessel systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Gas Turbine Water Wash: the water released from washing gas turbine components.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Graywater: galley, bath, and shower water, as well as wastewater from lavatory sinks, laundry, interior deck drains, water fountains, and shop sinks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Hull Coating Leachate: the constituents that leach, dissolve, ablate, or erode from the paint on the hull into the surrounding seawater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Motor Gasoline and Compensating Discharge: the seawater taken into, and discharged from, motor gasoline tanks to eliminate free space where vapors could accumulate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Non-Oily machinery wastewater: the combined wastewater from the operation of distilling plants, water chillers, valve packings, water piping, low- and high-pressure air compressors, and propulsion engine jacket coolers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Photographic Laboratory Drains: the laboratory wastewater resulting from processing of photographic film.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Seawater Cooling Overboard Discharge: the discharge of seawater from a dedicated system that provides noncontact cooling water for other vessel systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Seawater Piping Biofouling Prevention: the discharge of seawater containing additives used to prevent the growth and attachment of biofouling organisms in dedicated seawater cooling systems on selected vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Small Boat Engine Wet Exhaust: the seawater that is mixed and discharged with small boat propulsion engine exhaust to cool the exhaust and quiet the engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Sonar Dome Discharge: the leaching of antifoulant materials into the surrounding seawater and the release of seawater or freshwater retained within the sonar dome.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Submarine Bilgewater: the wastewater from a variety of sources that accumulates in the lowest part of the submarine (i.e., bilge).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Surface Vessel Bilgewater/Oil-Water Separator Effluent: the wastewater from a variety of sources that accumulates in the lowest part of the vessel (the bilge), and the effluent produced when the wastewater is processed by an oil water separator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Underwater Ship Husbandry: the materials discharged during the inspection, maintenance, cleaning, and repair of hulls performed while the vessel is waterborne.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(y)</em> Welldeck Discharges: the water that accumulates from seawater flooding of the docking well (welldeck) of a vessel used to transport, load, and unload amphibious vessels, and from maintenance and freshwater washings of the welldeck and equipment and vessels stored in the welldeck.</p>
