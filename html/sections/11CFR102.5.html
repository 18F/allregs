Such account shall be treated as a  separate Federal political committee that must comply with the  requirements of the Act including the registration and reporting  requirements of 11 CFR parts 102 and 104. Only funds subject to the  prohibitions and limitations of the Act shall be deposited in such  separate Federal account. See 11 CFR 103.3. All disbursements,  contributions, expenditures, and transfers by the committee in  connection with any Federal election shall be made from its Federal  account, except as otherwise permitted for State, district and local  party committees by 11 CFR part 300 and paragraph (a)(5) of this  section.

Such organization shall register as a  political committee and comply with the requirements of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) of this section may be deposited in  a Federal account established under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section,  see 11 CFR 103.3, or may be received by a political committee  established under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contributions designated for the Federal account;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contributions that result from a solicitation which expressly  states that the contribution will be used in connection with a Federal  election; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Contributions from contributors who are informed that all  contributions are subject to the prohibitions and limitations of the  Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State, district, and local party committees that intend to  expend Levin funds raised pursuant to 11 CFR 300.31 for activities  identified in 11 CFR 300.32(b)(1) must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish one or more separate Levin accounts pursuant to 11 CFR  300.30(c)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrate through a reasonable accounting method approved by  the Commission (including any method embedded in software provided or  approved by the Commission) that whenever such organization makes a  payment that organization has received sufficient funds subject to the  limitations and prohibitions of the Act or the requirements of 11 CFR  300.30(c)(1) or (3) to make such payment. Such organization shall keep  records of amounts received or expended under this paragraph and, upon  request, shall make such records available for examination by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Solicitations by Federal candidates and Federal officeholders  for State, district, and local party committees are subject to the  restrictions   in 11 CFR 300.31(e) and 11 CFR part 300, subpart D.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State, district, and local party committees and organizations  may establish one or more separate allocation accounts to be used for  activities allocable pursuant to 11 CFR 106.7 and 11 CFR 300.33.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organizations that are not political committees under the Act.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any organization that makes contributions, expenditures, and  exempted payments under 11 CFR 100.80, 100.87 and 100.89 and 11 CFR  100.140, 100.147 and 100.149, but that does not qualify as a political  committee under 11 CFR 100.5, must keep records of receipts and  disbursements and, upon request, must make such records available for  examination by the Commission. The organization must demonstrate through  a reasonable accounting method that, whenever such an organization makes  a contribution or expenditure, or payment, the organization has received  sufficient funds subject to the limitations and prohibitions of the Act  to make such contribution, expenditure, or payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any State, district, or local party organization that makes  payments for certain Federal election activities under 11 CFR 300.32(b)  must either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All such party organizations shall keep records of deposits to  and disbursements from such Federal and Levin accounts, and upon  request, shall make such records available for examination by the  Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National party committees.
