                            <p class="depth0">This section describes how we apply the special provisions in this  part for small-volume engine manufacturers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Special provisions apply for certain small-volume engine  manufacturers, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Additional lead time and other provisions related to the  transition to new emission standards. See Sec.  1045.145.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> More flexible arrangements for creating engine families for  high-performance engines. See Sec.  1045.230.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assigned deterioration factors. See Sec.  1045.240.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Waived requirements for production-line testing. See Sec.   1045.301.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Additional special provisions apply for small-volume engine and  vessel manufacturers. For example, see Sec.  1045.625 and 40 CFR  1068.250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you use any of the provisions of this part that apply  specifically to small-volume engine manufacturers and we find that you  do not qualify to use these provisions, we may consider you to be in  violation of the requirements that apply for companies that are not  small-volume engine manufacturers. If your number of employees   grows to the point that you no longer qualify as a small-volume engine  manufacturer, we will work with you to determine a reasonable schedule  for complying with additional requirements that apply. For example, if  you no longer qualify as a small-volume engine manufacturer shortly  before you certify your engines for the next model year, we might allow  you to use assigned deterioration factors for one more model year.</p>
