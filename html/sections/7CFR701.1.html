                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subject to the availability of funds, this part provides the  terms, conditions and requirements of the Emergency Conservation Program  (ECP) and the Emergency Forest Restoration Program (EFRP) administered  by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Neither program is an entitlement  program and payments will only be made   to the extent that the Deputy Administrator announces the eligibility of  benefits for certain natural disasters, the areas in which such benefits  will be available, the time period in which the disaster and the  rehabilitation must occur, and only so long as all the conditions for  eligibility specified in this part and elsewhere in law are met.  However, the Deputy Administrator will not apply any non-statutory  limitation on payments provided for in this part in such a way that it  would necessarily result in the non-expenditure of program funds  required to otherwise be made by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> ECP and EFRP are administered by the Administrator, FSA through  the Deputy Administrator, FSA, and shall be carried out in the field by  State and county FSA committees (State and county committees), subject  to the availability of funds. Except as otherwise provided in this rule,  discretionary determinations to be made under this rule will be made by  the Deputy Administrator. Matters committed to the discretion of the  Deputy Administrator shall be considered in all cases to be permissive  powers and no person or legal entity shall, under any circumstances, be  considered to be entitled to an exercise of such power in their favor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> State and county committees, and representatives and employees,  do not have authority to modify or waive any regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State committee may take any action authorized or required  of the county committee by this part, but which the county committee has  not taken, such as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Correct or require a county committee to correct any action  taken by such county committee that is not in accordance with this part;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require a county committee to withhold taking any action that is  not in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No provision or delegation herein to a State or county committee  shall preclude the Administrator, FSA, or a designee, from determining  any question arising under the program or from reversing or modifying  any determination made by a State or county committee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Deputy Administrator may authorize State and county  committees to waive or modify deadlines and other requirements in cases  where lateness or failure to meet such other requirements does not  adversely affect the operation of the program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Deputy Administrator may limit the authority of state and  county committees to approve cost share in excess of specified amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Data furnished by the applicants will be used to determine  eligibility for program benefits. Furnishing the data is voluntary;  however, the failure to provide data could result in program benefits  being withheld or denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> FSA may consult with any other Federal agency, State agency, or  other provider of technical assistance for such assistance as is  determined by FSA to be necessary to implement ECP or EFRP. FSA is  responsible for the technical aspects of ECP and EFRP but may enter into  a Memorandum of Agreement with another party to provide technical  assistance. If the requirement for technical assistance results in undue  delay or significant hardship to producers in a county, the State  committee may request in writing that FSA waive this requirement for  that county. However, nothing in this paragraph or in this part creates  a right of appeal or action for an applicant with respect to provisions  relating to internal procedures of FSA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The provisions in this part shall not create an entitlement in  any person or legal entity to any ECP or EFRP cost share or claim or any  particular notice or form or procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Additional terms and conditions may be set forth in the  application or the forms participants will be required to sign for  participation in the ECP or EFRP.
