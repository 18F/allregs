                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> UST Form 101-7-TFR, Chapter 7 Trustee's Final Report. A chapter 7 trustee must complete UST Form 101-7-TFR final report (TFR) in preparation for closing an asset case. This report must be submitted to the United States Trustee after liquidating the estate's assets, but before making distribution to creditors, and before filing it with the United States Bankruptcy Court. The TFR must contain the trustee's certification, under penalty of perjury, that all assets have been liquidated or properly accounted for and that funds of the estate are available for distribution. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 589b(d), the TFR must also contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Summary of the trustee's case administration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Copies of the estate's financial records;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> List of allowed claims;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Fees and administrative expenses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proposed dividend distribution to creditors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> UST Form 101-7-NFR Chapter 7 Trustee's Notice of Trustee's Final Report. After the TFR has been reviewed by the United States Trustee and filed with the United States Bankruptcy Court, if the net proceeds realized in an estate exceed the amounts specified in Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002(f)(8), UST Form 101-7-NFR (NFR) must be sent to all creditors as the notice required under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 2002(f). The NFR must show the receipts, approved disbursements, and any balance identified on the TFR, as well as the information required in the TFR's Exhibit D. In addition, the NFR must identify the procedures for objecting to any fee application or to the TFR.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> UST Form 101-7-TDR Chapter 7 Trustee's Final Account, Certification The Estate Has Been Fully Administered and Application of Trustee To Be Discharged. After distributing all estate funds, a trustee must submit to the United States Trustee and file with the United States Bankruptcy Court the trustee's final account, UST Form 101-7-TDR (TDR). The TDR must contain the trustee's certification, under penalty of perjury, that the estate has been fully administered and the trustee's request to be discharged as trustee. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 589b(d), the TDR must also include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of time the case was pending;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets abandoned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets exempted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Receipts and disbursements of the estate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claims asserted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Claims allowed; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Distributions to claimants and claims discharged without payment, in each case by appropriate category.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> UST Form 101-7-NDR Chapter 7 Trustee's Report of No Distribution. In cases where there is no distribution of funds the case trustee must submit to the United States Trustee and file with the United States Bankruptcy Court UST Form 101-7-NDR (NDR). The NDR must contain the trustee's certification that the estate has been fully administered, that the trustee has neither received nor disbursed any property or money on account of the estate, and that there is no property available for distribution over and above that exempted by law. In addition, the NDR must set forth the trustee's request to be discharged as trustee. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 589b(d), the NDR must also include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of time the case was pending;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets abandoned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets exempted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Claims asserted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claims scheduled; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> claims scheduled to be discharged without payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> UST Form 101-12-FR-S, Chapter 12 Standing Trustee's Final Report and Account and UST Form 101-13-FR-S, Chapter 13 Standing Trustee's Final Report and Account. After the final distribution to creditors in a chapter 12 or 13 case in which a standing trustee has been appointed, a trustee must submit to the United States Trustee and file with the United States Bankruptcy Court either UST Form 101-12-FR-S for chapter 12 cases or UST Form 101-13-FR-S for chapter 13 cases, which are the trustee's final report and account. In these forms, a trustee must include a certification that the estate has been fully administered if not converted to another chapter and a request to be discharged as trustee. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 589b(d), these forms must also include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of time the case was pending;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets abandoned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets exempted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Receipts and disbursements of the estate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses of administration, including for use under section 707(b), actual costs of administering cases under chapter 12 or 13 (as applicable) of title 11;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Claims asserted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Claims allowed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Distributions to claimants and claims discharged without payment, in each case by appropriate category;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Date of confirmation of the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Date of each modification thereto; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Defaults by the debtor in performance under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> UST Form 101-12-FR-C, Chapter 12 Case Trustee's Final Report and Account, and UST Form 101-13-FR-C, Chapter 13 Case Trustee's Final Report and Account.

In these forms, a trustee must include a certification, submitted under penalty of perjury, that the estate has been fully administered if not converted to another chapter and the trustee's request to be discharged from further duties as trustee. Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 589b(d), these forms must also include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The length of time the case was pending;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assets abandoned;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Assets exempted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Receipts and disbursements of the estate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Expenses of administration, including for use under section 707(b), actual costs of administering cases under chapter 12 or 13 (as applicable) of title 11;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Claims asserted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Claims allowed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Distributions to claimants and claims discharged without payment, in each case by appropriate category;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Date of confirmation of the plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Date of each modification thereto; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> defaults by the debtor in performance under the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Mandatory Usage of Uniform Forms. The Uniform Forms associated with this rule must be utilized by trustees when completing their final reports and final accounts. All trustees serving in districts where a United States Trustee is serving must use the Uniform Forms in the administration of their cases, in the same manner, and with the same content, as set forth in this rule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All Uniform Forms may be electronically or mechanically reproduced so long as all the content and the form remain consistent with the Uniform Forms as they are posted on EOUST's Web site;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Uniform Forms shall be filed via the United States Bankruptcy Courts Case Management/Electronic Case Filing System (CM/ECF) as a ``smart form'' meaning the forms are data enabled, unless the court offers an automated process that has been approved by EOUST, such as the virtual NDR event through CM/ECF.
