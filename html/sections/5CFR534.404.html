                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Setting pay upon initial appointment to the SES. An authorized agency official may set the rate of basic pay of an individual at any rate within the SES rate range upon initial appointment to the SES, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in Sec. 534.403(a). Rates of basic pay above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule but less than or equal to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule generally are reserved for those newly appointed senior executives who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan. In setting a new senior executive's rate of basic pay, an agency must consider the nature and quality of the individual's experience, qualifications, and accomplishments as they relate to the requirements of the SES position, as well as the individual's current responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adjusting the pay of SES members. (1) An authorized agency official may adjust (increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive consistent with the agency's plan for setting and adjusting SES rates of basic pay under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An authorized agency official may adjust (increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive consistent with the agency's plan for setting and adjusting SES rates of basic pay under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A senior executive who receives an annual summary rating of outstanding performance must be considered for an annual pay increase, subject to the limitation on the maximum rate of basic pay in Sec. 534.403(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agency may provide a pay increase to allow a senior executive to advance his or her relative position within the SES rate range only upon a determination by the authorized agency official that the senior executive's individual performance and/or contributions to agency performance so warrant. In assessing a senior executive's performance and/or contribution

to the agency's performance, the authorized agency official may consider such things as unique skills, qualifications, or competencies that the individual possesses, and their significance to the agency's performance, as well as the senior executive's current responsibilities. Senior executives who demonstrate the highest levels of individual performance and/or make the greatest contributions to the agency's performance, as determined by the agency through the administration of its performance appraisal system, or, in the case of newly-appointed senior executives, those who possess superior leadership or other competencies, as determined by the agency as part of its strategic human capital plan, must receive the highest rates of basic pay or pay adjustments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> On the effective date of an increase in the minimum or maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range under Sec. 534.403(a)(1) or (2), an authorized agency official may increase the rate of basic pay of a senior executive who meets or exceeds his or her performance expectations by an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the senior executive's relative position in the SES rate range, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A pay increase made under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying Sec. 534.404(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On the effective date of an increase in the minimum or maximum rate of basic pay of the SES rate range under Sec. 534.403(a)(1) or (2), an authorized agency official may increase the rate of basic pay of a senior executive who meets or exceeds his or her performance expectations by an amount that does not exceed the amount necessary to maintain the senior executive's relative position in the SES rate range, except as provided in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) and (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A pay increase made under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying Sec. 534.404(c).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is at or below the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule if such an increase would cause the senior executive's rate of basic pay to exceed the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A pay increase under paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may not be provided to a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule unless the senior executive has received an annual summary rating of outstanding for the most recently completed appraisal period and the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) has approved the increase in pay. However, in the case of a senior executive whose rate of basic pay is above the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule and who has been rated below outstanding, but above fully successful, for the most recently completed appraisal period, the agency head or designee who performs the functions described in 5 CFR 430.404(a)(5) or (6) (including the Inspector General, where applicable) may approve such a pay increase in limited circumstances, such as for an exceptionally meritorious accomplishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A senior executive who receives a summary rating of less than fully successful may not receive an increase in pay for the current appraisal period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> An authorized agency official may reduce the rate of basic pay of a senior executive for performance and/or disciplinary reasons, consistent with the restrictions on reducing the rate of basic pay of a career senior executive in paragraph (j) of this section and in Sec. 534.406(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> 12-month rule. (1) An authorized agency official may adjust (i.e., increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive not more than once during any 12-month period. However, an agency may make a determination to provide an additional pay increase under certain conditions as prescribed in paragraph (c)(3) and (4) of this section without regard to whether the senior executive has received a pay adjustment during the previous 12-month period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An authorized agency official may adjust (i.e., increase or reduce) the rate of basic pay of a senior executive not more than once during any 12-month period.

Any pay adjustment made as a result of a determination under paragraph (c)(4) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying Sec. 534.404(c) and begins a new 12-month period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Adjustments in pay prior to certification of applicable performance appraisal system. An authorized agency official may adjust a senior executive's rate of basic pay converted under Sec. 534.406 on the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1, 2004, or on any date thereafter prior to obtaining certification under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D, but only up to the rate for level III of the Executive Schedule. The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (i.e., he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under Sec. 534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period).

subpart D, an authorized agency official may increase a covered senior executive's rate of basic pay up to the rate for level II of the Executive Schedule, consistent with the limitations in Sec. 534.403(a)(3). The authorized agency official may provide an increase in pay if warranted under the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section and if the senior executive is otherwise eligible for such an increase (i.e., he or she did not receive a pay adjustment under Sec. 534.404(c) during the previous 12-month period).

The determination to provide an additional pay increase must be approved and made effective as of the effective date of increases in the Executive Schedule under 5 U.S.C. 5318 (i.e., the first day of the first pay period beginning on or after January 1). An additional pay increase under this paragraph is not considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying Sec. 534.404(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Agency plan for setting and adjusting SES rate of basic pay. Each agency must establish a plan for setting and adjusting the rates of basic pay for SES members.

The senior executive will continue to receive his or her current SES rate and is not eligible for a pay adjustment until the senior executive is assigned to a position that would allow the employee to receive a pay adjustment or the employing agency's applicable performance appraisal system is certified under 5 CFR part 430, subpart D. The SES rate of pay is not considered a retained rate of pay for the purpose of applying 5 U.S.C. 3594 and 5 CFR part 359, subpart G, or 5 U.S.C. 5363 and 5 CFR part 536, subpart C.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Setting pay following a break in SES service--(1) General.

If fewer than 12 months have elapsed since the employee's last SES pay adjustment, an authorized agency official may approve an additional pay increase under Sec. 534.404(c)(4) if the additional pay increase is warranted. Any pay adjustment must be made in accordance with paragraphs (b), (d), and (e) of this section and the agency's plan for adjusting SES rates of pay in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the individual did not elect to remain subject to the SES pay provisions while serving under a Presidential appointment, his or her SES rate may be set upon reinstatement to the SES at any rate within the SES rate range, subject to the limitations in Sec. 534.403(a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Setting a rate of basic pay upon reinstatement to the SES under paragraphs (i)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section is considered a pay adjustment for the purpose of applying Sec. 534.404(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Restrictions on reducing the pay of career senior executives.
