                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Chief Executive Officer of the research facility shall appoint an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), qualified through the experience and expertise of its members to assess the research facility's animal program, facilities, and procedures. Except as specifically authorized by law or these regulations, nothing in this part shall be deemed to permit the Committee or IACUC to prescribe methods or set standards for the design, performance, or conduct of actual research or experimentation by a research facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> IACUC membership. (1) The members of each Committee shall be appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the research facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The members of each Committee shall be appointed by the Chief Executive Officer of the research facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Committee shall be composed of a Chairman and at least two additional members;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Of the members of the Committee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least one shall be a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, with training or experience in laboratory animal science and medicine, who has direct or delegated program responsibility for activities involving animals at the research facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least one shall not be affiliated in any way with the facility other than as a member of the Committee, and shall not be a member of the immediate family of a person who is affiliated with the facility. The Secretary intends that such person will provide representation for general community interests in the proper care and treatment of animals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Committee consists of more than three members, not more than three members shall be from the same administrative unit of the facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> IACUC functions. With respect to activities involving animals, the IACUC, as an agent of the research facility, shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review, at least once every six months, the research facility's program for humane care and use of animals, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspect, at least once every six months, all of the research facility's animal facilities, including animal study areas, using title 9, chapter I, subchapter A-Animal Welfare, as a basis for evaluation; Provided, however, That animal areas containing free-living wild animals in their natural habitat need not be included in such inspection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Prepare reports of its evaluations conducted as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of this section, and submit the reports to the Institutional Official of the research facility; Provided, however, That the IACUC may determine the best means of conducting evaluations of the research facility's programs and facilities; and Provided, further, That no Committee member wishing to participate in any evaluation conducted under this subpart may be excluded. The IACUC may use subcommittees composed of at least two Committee members and may invite ad hoc consultants to assist in conducting the evaluations, however, the IACUC remains responsible for the evaluations and reports as required by the Act and regulations. The reports shall be reviewed and signed by a majority of the IACUC members and must include any minority views.

The reports must contain a description of the nature and extent of the research facility's adherence to this subchapter, must identify specifically any departures from the provisions of title 9, chapter I, subchapter A--Animal Welfare, and must state the reasons for each departure. The reports must distinguish significant deficiencies from minor deficiencies. A significant deficiency is one which, with reference to Subchapter A, and, in the judgment of the IACUC and the Institutional Official, is or may be a threat to the health or safety of the animals.
