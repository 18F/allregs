                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Criteria warranting an inquiry. An inquiry is warranted if the  allegation--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Falls within the definition of research misconduct under this  part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is within Sec.  93.102; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is sufficiently credible and specific so that potential evidence  of research misconduct may be identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice to respondent and custody of research records. At the  time of or before beginning an inquiry, an institution must make a good  faith effort to notify in writing the presumed respondent, if any. If  the inquiry subsequently identifies additional respondents, the  institution must notify them. To the extent it has not already done so  at the allegation stage, the institution must, on or before the date on  which the respondent is notified or the inquiry begins, whichever is  earlier, promptly take all reasonable and practical steps to obtain  custody of all the research records and evidence needed to conduct the  research misconduct proceeding, inventory the records and evidence, and  sequester them in a secure manner, except that where the research  records or evidence encompass scientific instruments shared by a number  of users, custody may be limited to copies of the data or evidence on  such instruments, so long as those copies are substantially equivalent  to the evidentiary value of the instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of evidence. The purpose of an inquiry is to conduct an  initial review of the evidence to determine whether to conduct an  investigation. Therefore, an inquiry does not require a full review of  all the evidence related to the allegation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Criteria warranting an investigation. An inquiry's purpose is to  decide if an allegation warrants an investigation. An investigation is  warranted if there is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reasonable basis for concluding that the allegation falls  within the definition of research misconduct under this part and  involves PHS supported biomedical or behavioral research, research  training or activities related to that research or research training, as  provided in Sec.  93.102; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preliminary information-gathering and preliminary fact-finding  from the inquiry indicates that the allegation may have substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inquiry report. The institution must prepare a written report  that meets the requirements of this section and Sec.  93.309.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Opportunity to comment. The institution must provide the  respondent an opportunity to review and comment on the inquiry report  and attach any comments received to the report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Time for completion. The institution must complete the inquiry  within 60 calendar days of its initiation unless circumstances clearly  warrant a longer period. If the inquiry takes longer than 60 days to  complete, the inquiry record must include documentation of the reasons  for exceeding the 60-day period.</p>
