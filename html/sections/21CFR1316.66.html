The party shall include a statement of  supporting reasons for such exceptions, together with evidence of record  (including specific and complete citations of the pages of the  transcript and exhibits) and citations of the authorities relied upon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Hearing Clerk shall cause such filings to become part of the  record of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrative Law Judge may, upon the request of any party  to a proceeding, grant time beyond the twenty days provided in paragraph  (a) of this section for the filing of a response to the exceptions filed  by another party if he determines that no party in the hearing will be  unduly prejudiced and that the ends of justice will be served thereby.  Provided however, that each party shall be entitled to only one filing  under this section; that is, either a set of exceptions or a response  thereto.  [44 FR 55332, Sept. 26, 1979]</p>
