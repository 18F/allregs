                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Prepayment privilege. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or otherwise established by HUD, the mortgage shall contain a provision permitting the mortgagor to prepay the mortgage in whole or in part upon any interest payment date, after giving the mortgagee a 30-day notice in writing in advance of its intention to so prepay. The 30-day notice may be extended with the prior written approval of HUD.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prepayment charge. The mortgage may contain a provision for such charge, in the event of prepayment of principal, as may be agreed upon between the mortgagor and the mortgagee, subject to the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The mortgagor shall be permitted to prepay up to 15 percent of the original principal amount of the mortgage in any one calendar year without any such charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any reduction in the original principal amount of the mortgage resulting from the certification of cost, which HUD may require, shall not be construed as a prepayment of the mortgage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Prepayment of bond-financed or GNMA-securitized mortgages. Where the mortgage is given to secure GNMA mortgage-backed securities or a loan made by a lender that has obtained the funds for the loan by the issuance and sale of bonds or bond anticipation notes, or both, the mortgage may contain a prepayment restriction and prepayment penalty charge acceptable to HUD as to term, amount, and conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> HUD override of prepayment restrictions. In the event of a default, HUD may override any lockout, prepayment penalty, or combination of penalties in order to facilitate a partial or full refinancing of the mortgaged property and avoid a claim.</p>
