                            <p class="depth0">The Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions for the 2006 and succeeding  crop years are as follows:  FCIC Policies</p><p class="depth0">United States Department of Agriculture</p><p class="depth0">Federal Crop Insurance Corporation</p><p class="depth0">Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">(Appropriate title for insurance provider)  Both FCIC and Reinsured Policies</p><p class="depth0">Nursery Crop Insurance Provisions</p><p class="depth0">If a conflict exists among the policy provisions, the order of  priority is as follows: (1) The Catastrophic Risk Protection  Endorsement, if applicable; (2) the Special Provisions; (3) these Crop  Provisions; and (4) the Basic Provisions with (1) controlling (2), etc.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Act. The Federal Crop Insurance Act, 7 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.</p><p class="depth0">American Standard for Nursery Stock. A publication of the American  Nursery and Landscape Association, or a subsequent successor  organization, issued in accordance with the rules of the American  National Standards Institute, Inc. that provides common terminology and  standards for nurseries.</p><p class="depth0">Amount of insurance. For each basic unit, your basic unit value  multiplied by the coverage level percentage you elect and multiplied by  your share.</p><p class="depth0">Basic unit value. The full value of all insurable plants in each  basic unit as shown on your PIVR, including any revision that increases  the value of your insurable plant inventory.</p><p class="depth0">Container grown. Nursery plants planted and grown in standard  nursery containers either above ground or that are placed in the ground,  either directly or when placed in another pot in the ground (i.e., pot- in-pot).</p><p class="depth0">Crop year. The period beginning the day insurance attaches and  extending until the following May 31. Crop year is designated by the  year in which the insurance period ends.</p><p class="depth0">Crop year deductible. The deductible percentage multiplied by the  sum of all plant inventory values for each basic unit. The crop year  deductible will be increased for any increases in the inventory value on  the PIVR or through the purchase of a Peak Inventory Endorsement, if in  effect at the time of loss. The crop year deductible will be reduced by  any previously incurred deductible, except any incurred under the  Rehabilitation Endorsement, if you timely report each loss to us.</p><p class="depth0">Deductible percentage. An amount equal to 100 percent minus the  percent of coverage you select.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible Plant List. A list that includes the botanical and common  names of insurable plants, the winter protection requirements for  container grown material and the areas in which they apply, the  hardiness zone to which field grown material is insurable, the  designated hardiness zone for each county, and the unit classification  for each plant on the list, published by FCIC on RMA's Web site at  http://www.rma.usda.gov. It is also available on compact disk from your  crop insurance agent.</p><p class="depth0">Fabric grow bag. A fabric bag (including a woven or matted bag with  a plastic or fabric bottom) used for growing woody plants in-ground or  as an above-ground nursery plant container that provides adequate  drainage and is appropriate in size for the plant.</p><p class="depth0">FCIC. The Federal Crop Insurance Corporation, a wholly owned  corporation within the USDA, or a successor agency.</p><p class="depth0">Field grown. Nursery plants planted and grown in the ground without  the use of an artificial root containment device. Plants grown in in- ground fabric grow bags, plants that are balled and burlapped or plants  grown in containers that allow the plants to root (excluding fibrous  roots) into the ground (for example, a container without a bottom) are  also considered field grown.</p><p class="depth0">Field market value A. The value of undamaged insurable plants, based  on the lesser of: (1) The prices contained in the Plant Price Schedule;  or (2) the prices contained in your catalog or price list in the basic  unit immediately prior to the occurrence of any loss, as determined by  our appraisal. This allows the amount of insurance under the policy to  be divided among the individual units in accordance with the actual  value of the plants in the unit at the time of loss to determine whether  you are entitled to an indemnity for insured losses in the basic unit.  This value is also used to calculate the actual value of the plants in  the basic unit at the time of loss to ensure that you have not under- reported your plant values. For liners, the total value of undamaged  liners is multiplied by the survival factor to determine the value of  undamaged insurable plants.</p><p class="depth0">Field market value B. The value of insurable plants, based on the  lesser of: (1) The prices contained in the Plant Price Schedule; or (2)  the prices contained in your catalog or price list in the basic unit  following the occurrence of a loss, as determined by our appraisal, plus  any reduction in value due to uninsured causes. This is used to  determine   the loss of value for each individual unit so that losses can be paid on  an individual unit basis.</p><p class="depth0">Good nursery practices. In lieu of the definition of ``good farming  practices'' contained in section 1 of the Basic Provisions, the  horticultural practices generally in use in the area for nursery plants  to make normal progress toward the stage of growth at which marketing  can occur and: (1) For conventional practices, generally recognized by  agricultural experts for the area as compatible with the nursery plant  production practices and weather conditions in the county; or (2) for  organic practices, generally recognized by the organic agricultural  industry for the area as compatible with the nursery plant production  practices and weather conditions in the county or contained in the  organic plan. We may, or you may request us to, contact FCIC to  determine whether or not production methods will be considered to be  ``good nursery practices.''</p><p class="depth0">Irrigated practice. In lieu of the definition in the Basic  Provisions, the application of water, using appropriate systems and at  the proper times, to provide the quantity of water needed to sustain  normal growth of your insured plant inventory and provide cold  protection for applicable plants as specified in the Eligible Plant  List.</p><p class="depth0">Liners. Plants produced in standard nursery containers that are  equal to or greater than 1 inch in diameter (including trays containing  200 or fewer individual cells, unless specifically provided by the  Special Provisions) but less than 3 inches in diameter at the widest  point of the container or cell interior, have an established root  system, and meet all other conditions specified in the Special  Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">Loss. Field market value A minus field market value B.</p><p class="depth0">Marketable. Of a condition that it may be offered for sale in the  market.</p><p class="depth0">Monthly proration factors. Factors contained in the actuarial  documents that are used to calculate premium when you do not insure the  nursery plants for an entire crop year.</p><p class="depth0">Nursery. A business enterprise that grows the nursery plants and  derives at least 50 percent of its gross income from the wholesale  marketing of such plants.</p><p class="depth0">Occurrence deductible. This deductible allows a smaller deductible  than the crop year deductible to be used when the inventory value is  less than the reported basic unit value. The occurrence deductible is  the lesser of: (1) The deductible percentage multiplied by field market  value A multiplied by the under-report factor; or (2) the crop year  deductible.</p><p class="depth0">PIVR. The plant inventory value report, your report that declares  the value of insurable plants in accordance with section 6.</p><p class="depth0">Plant Price Schedule. A schedule of insurable plant prices that  establishes the maximum insurable value of undamaged insurable plants,  published by FCIC as an actuarial document available on RMA's Web site  at http://www.rma.usda.gov. It is also available on compact disk from  your crop insurance agent.</p><p class="depth0">Practice. A cultural method of producing plants. Container grown and  field grown are considered separate insurable practices.</p><p class="depth0">Sales closing date. In lieu of the definition in section 1 of the  Basic Provisions, the date shown in the Special Provisions. New-policy  applications may be filed at any time. However, all applications,  including those for new or amended coverage, are subject to a 30-day  waiting period before commencement of coverage as specified in sections  3(d) and 9(a).</p><p class="depth0">Standard nursery containers. Rigid containers not less than 1 inch  in diameter at the widest point of the container interior (including  trays that contain 200 or fewer individual cells, unless specifically  provided by the Special Provisions), above-ground fabric grow bags, and  other types of containers specified in the Special Provisions that are  appropriate in size and provide adequate drainage for the plant. In- ground fabric grow bags, balled and burlapped, and trays (flats) without  individual cells are not considered standard nursery containers.</p><p class="depth0">Stock plants. Plants used solely for propagation during the  insurance period.</p><p class="depth0">Survival factor. A factor shown on the Special Provisions that  specifies the expected percentage of liners that normally survive the  period from insurance attachment to market.</p><p class="depth0">Under-report factor. The factor that adjusts your indemnity for  under-reporting of inventory values. The factor is always used in  determining indemnities. For each basic unit, the under-report factor is  the lesser of: (1) 1.000; or (2) the basic unit value, including a Peak  Inventory Value Report during the coverage term of a Peak Inventory  Endorsement, minus the total of all previous losses, as adjusted by any  previous under-report factor, divided by field market value A. Payments  made under the Rehabilitation Endorsement will not be considered a  previous loss when calculating the under-report factor.</p><p class="depth0">Wholesale. To sell nursery plants in large quantities at a price  below that offered on low-quantity sales to retailers, commercial users,  governmental end-users, or other end-users for business purposes (e.g.  sales to landscape contractors and commercial fruit producers). This  determination will be based on a county-by-county basis.</p><p class="depth0">2. Unit Division</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> If you elect additional coverage for a practice, a basic unit,  as defined in section 1   of the Basic Provisions, may be divided into additional basic units by  each insurable plant type designated in section 2(b) for which a premium  rate is provided by the actuarial documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Only the following plant types contained on the Eligible Plant  List are insurable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Deciduous Trees (Shade and Flower);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Broad-leaf Evergreen Trees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Coniferous Evergreen Trees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Fruit and Nut Trees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Deciduous Shrubs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Broad-leaf Evergreen Shrubs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Coniferous Evergreen Shrubs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Small Fruits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Herbaceous Perennials;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Roses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Ground Cover and Vines;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Annuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Foliage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Palms and Cycads;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Liners (container grown only and inclusive of all insurable  plant types); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Other plant types listed in the Special Provisions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining</p><p class="depth0">Indemnities</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The production reporting requirements, including the  misreporting provisions, contained in section 3 of the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the requirements of section 3 of the Basic  Provisions, you may select either catastrophic risk protection or  additional coverage for each insured practice. An administrative fee  established in accordance with section 7(e) of the Basic Provisions will  be owed for each practice insured.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of section 3(b) of the Basic Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you select additional coverage for a practice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You may select one coverage level for each plant type insured in  that practice if you elect basic units by plant type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> You will receive 100 percent of the price election for all  plant types in that practice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> You must provide on the application a coverage level  percentage for each plant type that will be insured; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> You must select a coverage level if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A new plant is added under a revised PIVR or Peak Inventory  Endorsement; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The plant is not categorized under a plant type reported on the  initial PIVR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you select catastrophic risk protection for a practice, all  plant types under the practice must be insured at the catastrophic risk  protection level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> of the Basic Provisions, you may request  changes to the coverage level for a plant type by submitting them in  writing to us as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For new policies, changes cannot be made for the crop year after  the date of the application; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For carryover policies:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For the 2006 crop year only, changes must be requested on or  before September 30th prior to the start of the crop year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For all subsequent crop years, changes must be requested on or  before the sales closing date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unless we reject the proposed increase because a loss occurs  within 30 days of the date the request is made (Rejection can occur at  any time we discover such loss has occurred), requested changes will  take effect:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For the 2006 crop year, 30 days after the date you submitted  your request; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For all subsequent crop years, on the date of the start of the  crop year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Your amount of insurance will be reduced by the amount of any  indemnity paid under this policy. For losses occurring when a Peak  Inventory Endorsement is in effect, to determine the amount of insurance  remaining after the loss you must subtract the amount of the indemnity  from the peak amount of insurance, then subtract any remaining amount of  indemnity from the amount of insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If you restock your nursery plant inventory, you may increase  your amount of insurance in accordance with section 6(g).</p><p class="depth0">4. Contract Changes</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 4 of the Basic Provisions, the contract  change date is January 31 of each crop year.</p><p class="depth0">5. Cancellation and Termination Dates</p><p class="depth0">In accordance with section 2 of the Basic Provisions, the  cancellation and termination dates are May 31 preceding the crop year.</p><p class="depth0">6. PIVR</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 6 of the Basic Provisions is not applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You must submit a PIVR for each insured practice, as applicable,  and two copies of your most recent wholesale catalogs or price lists in  accordance with subsection (k) to us with your application on or before  the sales closing date for each crop year following the year of  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You will be notified in writing if an application for insurance  is refused because the inventory or wholesale catalog or price list is  not acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you fail to provide a PIVR or applicable catalog or price  list on or before the sales closing date for any crop year, insurance  will not attach until 30 days after all such documents have been  received by your crop insurance agent and we will not be liable for any  losses that occur before insurance has attached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The PIVR must include, by basic unit, all growing locations,  basic unit value, coverage level selected, as applicable, and your  share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you do not elect additional basic units by plant type or you  elect CAT coverage, the plant inventory values for each plant type in  the basic unit must be separately reported on the PIVR and totaled to  determine the basic unit value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At our option, you will be required to provide documentation in  support of your PIVR, including, but not limited to, a detailed plant  inventory listing that includes the name, the number, and the size of  each plant; acceptable records of sales and purchases of plants for the  three previous crop years in the amount of detail we require; and your  ability to properly obtain and maintain nursery stock. Acceptable  records must contain the name and telephone number of the purchaser or  seller, as applicable, names of the plants, the number of each plant  sold or purchased, and the sales price for each plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to provide documentation when requested or providing  inadequate documentation will result in denial of insurance for the crop  year for any basic units for which such documentation was not provided.  This provision does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plant varieties you have not previously grown; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New nurseries where an inspection has determined you have the  ability to properly obtain and maintain the nursery stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Your PIVR, including any revised report, and your Peak Inventory  Value Report will be used to determine your premium and amount of  insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Your PIVR must reflect your insurable nursery plant inventory  value by basic unit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The price for each plant and size listed on your PIVR will be  the lower of the Plant Price Schedule price or the lowest wholesale  price in your nursery catalog or price list submitted in accordance with  section 6(k).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In no instance will we be liable for plant values greater than  those contained in the Plant Price Schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you have previously made a claim and the loss adjuster is  unable to determine whether a plant was damaged prior to submission of  your PIVR for the current crop year, the plant will be insurable at full  value based on the lesser of the Eligible Plant List price or the  catalog or price list price. The value of the plant may be reduced at  any time during the crop year if the extent of damage is discovered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For catastrophic level policies only, you must report, on the  PIVR for each practice insured, your greatest plant sales in any of the  previous 3 years and the actual inventory value on the date insurance  attaches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You may be required to provide documentation to support the  above reporting requirements. To be considered adequate, sales documents  must contain the name and telephone number of the purchaser, names of  the plants, the number of each plant sold, and the sales price for each  plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each applicable practice, the total of your basic unit  values cannot exceed 110 percent of the higher of your:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Greatest amount of plant sales in any of the previous 3 years;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Actual inventory value on the date insurance attaches.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Failure to provide documentation when requested or providing  inadequate documentation will result in denial of insurance for the crop  year for any basic unit for which such documentation was not provided.  This provision does not apply to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Plant varieties you have not previously grown; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> New nurseries where an inspection has determined you have the  ability to properly obtain and maintain the nursery stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> You may increase your reported inventory value for each basic  unit no more than twice during the crop year by submitting a revised  PIVR prior to 30 days before the end of such crop year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any requested increase must be made in writing and contain the  same information as required in section 6(c). The limitations in section  3(d) regarding making changes to the coverage level after a specified  date are not applicable to a revised PIVR that adds new plant types. The  limitations continue to apply if plants are added for a specific plant  type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An inspection will be performed when the total of all the basic  unit values contained on the revised PIVRs is increased 50 percent or  more from the previous total of all the basic unit values on the PIVR,  and the increase is not due to restocking subsequent to an insured loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> At our discretion, we may inspect the inventory if an increase  of less than 50 percent is reported on the revised PIVR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Your revised PIVR will be considered accepted by us and  insurance will attach on any proposed increase in inventory value 30  days after your written request is received unless we reject the  proposed increase in your plant inventory value in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> We will reject any requested increase if a loss occurs within 30  days of the date the request is made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> You cannot revise your PIVR to decrease the plant inventory  value after the start of the insurance period specified in section 9.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For insurable plants that were damaged prior to the attachment  of insurance coverage:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The applicable price, as determined in accordance with section  6(e), will be reduced for inventory reporting purposes if we accept such  plants for insurance coverage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The plants will be removed from the PIVR if they are not  accepted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The procedure for calculating the insurable value of damaged  plants that are accepted for coverage is contained in the Special  Provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> You must report the full value of each basic unit value in  accordance with section 6(e). Failure to report the full value of each  basic unit value will result in the reduction of any claim in accordance  with section 12(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Insurable plants in over-sized containers will be valued for  purposes of reporting inventory and loss adjustment as if the plants  were in appropriate-sized containers in accordance with the standards  contained in the current American Standard for Nursery Stock. Each cell  in a multiple-cell container is considered a separate container. (See  the Eligible Plant List at http://www.rma.usda.gov/ for additional  information and requirements on container specifications and volume  calculation.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> At a minimum, your wholesale catalog or price list must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Be type-written and legible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Show an issue date on the cover page (may be handwritten);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Contain the name, address, and phone number of your nursery;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Be provided to customers and used in the sale of your plants;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> List each plant's name (scientific or common), plant or  container size, and wholesale price.</p><p class="depth0">7. Premium</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In lieu of section 7(c) of the Basic Provisions, we will  determine your premium by multiplying the amount of insurance by the  appropriate premium rate, any premium adjustment factor, and the monthly  proration factor contained in the actuarial documents, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the provisions in section 7 of the Basic  Provisions, we will prorate your premium based on:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The time remaining in the crop year after insurance attaches:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If you have made application after the start of the insurance  period specified in section 9; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If you submit a PIVR or wholesale catalog or price list after  the sales closing date;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The time remaining in the crop year after insurance attaches and  the additional amount of inventory reported, if you submit a revised  PIVR to report an increase in inventory value for a basic unit; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The time period for which insurance is provided under the Peak  Inventory Endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If your premium is prorated, premium will be charged for the  entire month for any calendar month during which any amount of coverage  is provided under these provisions or the Peak Inventory Endorsement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In lieu of section 7(a) of the Basic Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you apply for insurance before April 1st, the annual premium  is earned and payable at the time coverage begins.

Settlement of Claim</p><p class="depth0">We will determine indemnities for any unit as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Determine the under-report factor for the basic unit;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determine the occurrence deductible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subtract field market value B from field market value A;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Multiply the result of 12(c) by the under-report factor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Subtract the occurrence deductible from the result in section  12(d); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> If the result of section 12(e) is greater than zero, and subject  to the limit of section 12(g);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For other than catastrophic risk protection coverage, your  indemnity equals the result of section 12(e), multiplied by your share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For catastrophic risk protection coverage, your indemnity equals  the result of section 12(e) multiplied by fifty-five percent, multiplied  by your share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The total of all indemnities for the crop year will not exceed  the amount of insurance, including any peak amount of insurance during  the coverage term of the Peak Inventory Endorsement, if this endorsement  is elected.</p><p class="depth0">13. Late and Prevented Planting</p><p class="depth0">The late and prevented planting provisions in the Basic Provisions  are not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">14. Written Agreements</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of the Basic Provisions, you must  request in writing a written agreement with the application for the  initial crop year, and not later than the cancellation date for each  subsequent crop year, except as provided in section 14(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In lieu of the requirements of section 18(d) of the Basic  Provisions, any written agreement is valid only until the end of the  insurance period for the crop year such written agreement applies; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In lieu of section 18(e) of the Basic Provisions, an application  for a written agreement submitted after the date of application for the  initial crop year and the cancellation date for all subsequent crop  years may be approved if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You demonstrate your physical inability to have applied timely;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> After physical examination of the nursery plant inventory, we  determine the inventory will be marketable at the value shown on the  PIVR.</p><p class="depth0">15. Examples</p><p class="depth0">Single Unit Example</p><p class="depth0">Assume you have a 100 percent share and the plant inventory value  reported by you is $100,000, and your coverage level is 75 percent. Your  amount of insurance is $75,000 ($100,000 x .75). At the time of loss,  field market value A is $125,000, and field market value B is $80,000.  The under-report factor is .80 ($100,000 divided by $125,000). The  deductible percentage is 25 percent (100 - 75), the crop year deductible  is $25,000 (.25 x $100,000) and the occurrence deductible is $25,000  (.25 x $125,000 x .80). Your indemnity would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step (1) Determine the under-report factor $100,000 / $125,000 =  .80;</p><p class="depth0">Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B $125,000 -  $80,000 = $45,000;</p><p class="depth0">Step (3) The result of step (2) multiplied by the result of step (1)  $45,000 x .80 = $36,000;</p><p class="depth0">Step (4) The result of step (3) minus the occurrence deductible  $36,000 - $25,000 = $11,000; and</p><p class="depth0">Step (5) Result of step (4) multiplied by your share $11,000 x 1.000  = $11,000 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth0">Peak Inventory Value Report Example</p><p class="depth0">Assume you have a second loss on the same basic unit. Your amount of  insurance has been reduced by subtracting your previous indemnity  payment of $11,000 from your amount of insurance ($75,000 - $11,000 =  $64,000). Your crop year deductible has been reduced to zero by the  previous loss ($25,000 - $36,000, but not less than zero). You purchase  a Peak Inventory Endorsement and report $60,000 in inventory. Your peak  amount of insurance is your reported inventory   times your coverage level ($60,000 x .75 = $45,000). The combined amount  of insurance for the coverage term of the peak endorsement is $64,000 +  $45,000 = $109,000. Your crop year deductible is increased by $15,000  ($60,000 x .25). At the time of loss, field market value A is $124,000,  and field market value B is $58,000. The under-report factor is 1.00  [($160,000 - $36,000)/$124,000]. The crop year deductible is $15,000  (.25 x $60,000) and the occurrence deductible is $15,000 (the lesser of  field market value A x .25 or the crop year deductible). Your indemnity  would be calculated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Step (1) Determine the under-report factor $160,000 - $36,000) /  $124,000 = 1.00;</p><p class="depth0">Step (2) Field market value A minus field market value B $124,000 -  $58,000 = $66,000;</p><p class="depth0">Step (3) The result of step (2) multiplied by the result of step (1)  $66,000 x 1.0 = $66,000;</p><p class="depth0">Step (4) The result of step (3) minus the occurrence deductible  $66,000 - $15,000 = $51,000; and</p><p class="depth0">Step (5) Result of step (4) multiplied by your share $51,000 x 1.000  = $51,000 indemnity payment.</p><p class="depth0">Your peak amount of insurance is reduced to zero. Your amount of  insurance is reduced by the amount the indemnity exceeds the peak amount  of insurance. $64,000 - ($51,000 - 45,000) = $64,000 - $6,000 = $58,000.
