(1) A manufacturer who operates under an approved National Organic Program (7 CFR part 205) (NOP) organic handling system plan may be exempt from the payment of assessments under this part, provided that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Only agricultural products certified as ``organic'' or ``100 percent organic'' (as defined in the NOP) are eligible for exemption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The exemption shall apply to all certified ``organic'' or ``100 percent organic'' (as defined in the NOP) products of a manufacturer regardless of whether the agricultural

commodity subject to the exemption is manufactured by a person that also manufactures conventional or nonorganic agricultural products of the same agricultural commodity as that for which the exemption is claimed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The manufacturer maintains a valid certificate of organic operation as issued under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990 (7 U.S.C. 6501-6522) (OFPA) and the NOP regulations issued under OFPA (7 CFR part 205); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any manufacturer so exempted shall continue to be obligated to pay assessments under this part that are associated with any agricultural products that do not qualify for an exemption under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> To apply for exemption under this section, an eligible manufacturer shall submit a request to the Board on an Organic Exemption Request Form (Form AMS-15) at any time during the year initially, and annually thereafter on or before the start of the fiscal year, as long as the manufacturer continues to be eligible for the exemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A manufacturer request for exemption shall include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The applicant's full name, company name, address, telephone and fax numbers, and email address;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certification that the applicant maintains a valid certificate of organic operation issued under the OFPA and the NOP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Certification that the applicant manufactures organic products eligible to be labeled ``organic'' or ``100 percent organic'' under the NOP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A requirement that the applicant attach a copy of their certificate of organic operation issued by a USDA-accredited certifying agent under the OFPA and the NOP;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certification, as evidenced by signature and date, that all information provided by the applicant is true; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Such other information as may be required by the Board, with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If a manufacturer complies with the requirements of this section, the Board will grant an assessment exemption and issue a Certificate of Exemption to the manufacturer within 30 calendar days.

Such importer may submit documentation to the Board and request an exemption from assessment on certified ``organic'' or ``100 percent organic'' paper and paper-based packaging on an Organic Exemption Request Form (Form AMS-15) at any time initially, and annually thereafter on or before the beginning of the fiscal year, as long as the importer continues to be eligible for the exemption. This documentation shall include the same information required of a manufacturer in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

For all other exempt organic product for which Customs collects the assessment, the importer may apply to the Board for a reimbursement of assessments paid, and the importer must submit satisfactory proof to the Board that the importer paid the assessment on exempt organic product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The exemption will apply immediately following the issuance of a Certificate of Exemption.</p><p class="depth0">Promotion, Research and Information</p>
