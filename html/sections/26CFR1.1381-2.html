farmers', fruit growers', or like associations, organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and Sec. 1.521-1, shall be subject to the taxes imposed by section 11 or section 1201. Although such associations are subject to both normal tax and surtax, as in the case of corporations generally, certain special deductions are provided for them in section 1382(c) and Sec. 1.1382-3. For the purpose of any law which refers to organizations exempt from income taxes such an association shall, however, be considered as an organization exempt under section 501. Thus, the provisions of section 243, providing a credit for dividends received from a domestic corporation subject to taxation, are not applicable to dividends received from a cooperative association organized and operated in compliance with the requirements of section 521 and Sec. 1.521-1. The provisions of section 1501, relating to consolidated returns, are likewise not applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962,
