                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FCIC will deny reinsurance to any insurer or will terminate any existing reinsurance agreement if any false or misleading statement is made in the financial statements or any other document submitted by the insurer in connection with its qualification for FCIC reinsurance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No policy issued by an insurer subsequent to revocation of a reinsurance agreement will be reinsured by FCIC. Policies in effect at the time of revocation will continue to be reinsured by FCIC for the balance of the crop year then in effect for the applicable crop. However, if materially false information is made to the Corporation and that information directly affects the ability of the Company to perform under the Agreement, or if the Company commits any fraudulent or criminal act in relation to the Standard Reinsurance Agreement or any policy reinsured under the Agreement, FCIC may require that the Company transfer the servicing and contractual right to all business in effect and reinsured by the Corporation to the Corporation.
