                            <p class="depth0">Since transportation and preparation for transportation are both  exempt activities, an employee who engages in both is performing exempt  work. In referring to ``the transportation and preparation for  transportation'' of the fruits or vegetables, the statute recognizes the  two activities as interrelated parts of the single task of moving the  commodities from the farm to the designated points. Accordingly, the  word ``and'' between the words ``transportation'' and ``preparation'' is  not considered to require that any employee be employed in both parts of  the task in order to be exempt. The exemption may apply to an employee  engaged either in transporting or preparing the commodities for  transportation if he otherwise qualifies under section 13(b)(16).</p>
