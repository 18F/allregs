                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The extent and sophistication of a covered  credit union's governance over its capital planning and analysis process  must align with the extent and sophistication of that process. The  process must be consistent with the financial condition, size,  complexity, risk profile, scope of operations, and level of capital of  the covered credit union. The ultimate responsibility for governance  over a covered credit union's capital planning and analysis process  rests with the credit union's board of directors. Senior management must  establish a comprehensive, integrated, and effective process that fits  into the broader risk management of the credit union. Senior management  responsible for capital planning and analysis must provide regular  reports on capital planning and analysis to the credit union's board of  directors (or a designated committee of the board).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mandatory elements. A covered credit union's board of directors  (or a designated committee of the board) must review and approve a  capital policy, along with procedures to implement it. The capital  policy must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State goals and limits for capital levels and risk exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish requirements for reviewing and reporting capital  levels and breaches of capital limits, with contingency plans for  remedying any breaches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> State the governance over the capital analysis process,  including all the activities that contribute to the analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Specify capital analysis roles and responsibilities, including  controls over external resources used for any part of capital analysis  (such as vendors and data providers);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Specify the internal controls that govern capital planning,  including review by internal audit, control of changes in capital  planning procedures, and required documentation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Describe the frequency with which capital analyses will be  conducted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> State how capital analysis results are used and by whom; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Be reviewed at least annually and updated as necessary to ensure  that it remains current with changes in market conditions, credit union  products and strategies, credit union risk exposures and activities, the  credit union's established risk appetite, and industry practices.</p>
