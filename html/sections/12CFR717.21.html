                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initial notice and opt-out requirement. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. You may  not use eligibility information about a consumer that you receive from  an affiliate to make a solicitation for marketing purposes to the  consumer, unless--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is clearly and conspicuously disclosed to the consumer in  writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically, in a concise notice  that you may use eligibility information about that consumer received  from an affiliate to make solicitations for marketing purposes to the  consumer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The consumer is provided a reasonable opportunity and a  reasonable and simple method to ``opt out,'' or prohibit you from using  eligibility information to make solicitations for marketing purposes to  the consumer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The consumer has not opted out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. A consumer has a homeowner's insurance policy obtained  through an insurance brokerage. The insurance brokerage furnishes  eligibility information about the consumer to its affiliated federal  credit union. Based on that eligibility information, the federal credit  union wants to make a solicitation to the consumer about its home equity  loan products. The federal credit union does not have a pre-existing  business relationship with the consumer and none of the other exceptions  apply. The federal credit union is prohibited from using eligibility  information received from its insurance brokerage affiliate to make  solicitations to the consumer about its home equity loan products unless  the consumer is given a notice and opportunity to opt out and the  consumer does not opt out.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Affiliates who may provide the notice. The notice required by  this paragraph must be provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By an affiliate that has or has previously had a pre-existing  business relationship with the consumer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> As part of a joint notice from two or more members of an  affiliated group of companies, provided that at least one of the  affiliates on the joint notice has or has previously had a pre-existing  business relationship with the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Making solicitations--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of this  subpart, you make a solicitation for marketing purposes if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You receive eligibility information from an affiliate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You use that eligibility information to do one or more of the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identify the consumer or type of consumer to receive a  solicitation;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Establish criteria used to select the consumer to receive a  solicitation; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Decide which of your products or services to market to the  consumer or tailor your solicitation to that consumer; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As a result of your use of the eligibility information, the  consumer is provided a solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Receiving eligibility information from an affiliate, including  through a   common database. You may receive eligibility information from an  affiliate in various ways, including when the affiliate places that  information into a common database that you may access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Receipt or use of eligibility information by your service  provider. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of this section, you  receive or use an affiliate's eligibility information if a service  provider acting on your behalf (whether an affiliate or a nonaffiliated  third party) receives or uses that information in the manner described  in paragraphs (b)(1)(i) or (b)(1)(ii) of this section. All relevant  facts and circumstances will determine whether a person is acting as  your service provider when it receives or uses an affiliate's  eligibility information in connection with marketing your products and  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use by an affiliate of its own eligibility information. Unless  you have used eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate  in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, you do  not make a solicitation subject to this subpart if your affiliate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Uses its own eligibility information that it obtained in  connection with a pre-existing business relationship it has or had with  the consumer to market your products or services to the consumer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Directs its service provider to use the affiliate's own  eligibility information that it obtained in connection with a pre- existing business relationship it has or had with the consumer to market  your products or services to the consumer, and you do not communicate  directly with the service provider regarding that use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Use of eligibility information by a service provider--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In  general. You do not make a solicitation subject to Subpart C of this  part if a service provider (including an affiliated or third-party  service provider that maintains or accesses a common database that you  may access) receives eligibility information from your affiliate that  your affiliate obtained in connection with a pre-existing business  relationship it has or had with the consumer and uses that eligibility  information to market your products or services to the consumer, so long  as--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Your affiliate controls access to and use of its eligibility  information by the service provider (including the right to establish  the specific terms and conditions under which the service provider may  use such information to market your products or services);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Your affiliate establishes specific terms and conditions under  which the service provider may access and use the affiliate's  eligibility information to market your products and services (or those  of affiliates generally) to the consumer, such as the identity of the  affiliated companies whose products or services may be marketed to the  consumer by the service provider, the types of products or services of  affiliated companies that may be marketed, and the number of times the  consumer may receive marketing materials, and periodically evaluates the  service provider's compliance with those terms and conditions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Your affiliate requires the service provider to implement  reasonable policies and procedures designed to ensure that the service  provider uses the affiliate's eligibility information in accordance with  the terms and conditions established by the affiliate relating to the  marketing of your products or services;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Your affiliate is identified on or with the marketing materials  provided to the consumer; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> You do not directly use your affiliate's eligibility information  in the manner described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Writing requirements. (A) The requirements of paragraphs  (b)(5)(i)</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> and (C) of this section must be set forth in a written  agreement between your affiliate and the service provider; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> of this section must be set forth  in writing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Examples of making solicitations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consumer has a deposit  account with a federal credit union, which is affiliated with an  insurance brokerage. The insurance brokerage receives eligibility  information about the consumer from the federal credit union. The  insurance brokerage uses that eligibility information to identify the  consumer   to receive a solicitation about insurance brokerage services, and, as a  result, the insurance brokerage provides a solicitation to the consumer  about its services. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the  insurance brokerage has made a solicitation to the consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this  section, except that after using the eligibility information to identify  the consumer to receive a solicitation about insurance brokerage  services, the insurance brokerage asks the federal credit union to send  the solicitation to the consumer and the federal credit union does so.  Pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the insurance brokerage  has made a solicitation to the consumer because it used eligibility  information about the consumer that it received from an affiliate to  identify the consumer to receive a solicitation about its products or  services, and, as a result, a solicitation was provided to the consumer  about the insurance brokerage's services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(i) of  this section, except that eligibility information about consumers that  have deposit accounts with the federal credit union is placed into a  common database that all members of the affiliated group of companies  may independently access and use. Without using the federal credit  union's eligibility information, the insurance brokerage develops  selection criteria and provides those criteria, marketing materials, and  related instructions to the federal credit union. The federal credit  union reviews eligibility information about its own consumers using the  selection criteria provided by the insurance brokerage to determine  which consumers should receive the insurance brokerage's marketing  materials and sends marketing materials about the insurance brokerage's  services to those consumers. Even though the insurance brokerage has  received eligibility information through the common database as provided  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it did not use that information to  identify consumers or establish selection criteria; instead, the federal  credit union used its own eligibility information. Therefore, pursuant  to paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section, the insurance brokerage has not  made a solicitation to the consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(iii) of  this section, except that the federal credit union provides the  insurance brokerage's criteria to the federal credit union's service  provider and directs the service provider to use the federal credit  union's eligibility information to identify federal credit union  consumers who meet the criteria and to send the insurance brokerage's  marketing materials to those consumers. The insurance brokerage does not  communicate directly with the service provider regarding the use of the  federal credit union's information to market its services to the federal  credit union's consumers. Pursuant to paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this  section, the insurance brokerage has not made a solicitation to the  consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An affiliated group of companies includes a federal credit  union, an insurance brokerage, and a service provider. Each affiliate in  the group places information about its consumers into a common database.  The service provider has access to all information in the common  database. The federal credit union controls access to and use of its  eligibility information by the service provider. This control is set  forth in a written agreement between the federal credit union and the  service provider. The written agreement also requires the service  provider to establish reasonable policies and procedures designed to  ensure that the service provider uses the federal credit union's  eligibility information in accordance with specific terms and conditions  established by the federal credit union relating to the marketing of the  products and services of all affiliates, including the insurance  brokerage. In a separate written communication, the federal credit union  specifies the terms and conditions under which the service provider may  use the federal credit union's eligibility information to market the  insurance brokerage's products and services to the federal credit  union's consumers. The specific terms and conditions are: a list of  affiliated companies (including the insurance   brokerage) whose products or services may be marketed to the federal  credit union's consumers by the service provider; the specific products  or types of products that may be marketed to the federal credit union's  consumers by the service provider; the categories of eligibility  information that may be used by the service provider in marketing  products or services to the federal credit union's consumers; the types  or categories of the federal credit union's consumers to whom the  service provider may market products or services of federal credit union  affiliates; the number and/or types of marketing communications that the  service provider may send to the federal credit union's consumers; and  the length of time during which the service provider may market the  products or services of the federal credit union's affiliates to its  consumers. The federal credit union periodically evaluates the service  provider's compliance with these terms and conditions. The insurance  brokerage asks the service provider to market insurance products to  certain consumers who have deposit accounts with the federal credit  union. Without using the federal credit union's eligibility information,  the insurance brokerage develops selection criteria and provides those  criteria, marketing materials, and related instructions to the service  provider. The service provider uses the federal credit union's  eligibility information from the common database to identify the federal  credit union's consumers to whom insurance brokerage services will be  marketed. When the insurance brokerage's marketing materials are  provided to the identified consumers, the name of the federal credit  union is displayed on the brokerage marketing materials, an introductory  letter that accompanies the marketing materials, an account statement  that accompanies the marketing materials, or the envelope containing the  marketing materials. The requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of this  section have been satisfied, and the insurance brokerage has not made a  solicitation to the consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The same facts as in the example in paragraph (b)(6)(v) of this  section, except that the terms and conditions permit the service  provider to use the federal credit union's eligibility information to  market the products and services of other affiliates to the federal  credit union's consumers whenever the service provider deems it  appropriate to do so. The service provider uses the federal credit  union's eligibility information in accordance with the discretion  afforded to it by the terms and conditions. Because the terms and  conditions are not specific, the requirements of paragraph (b)(5) of  this section have not been satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions. The provisions of this subpart do not apply to you  if you use eligibility information that you receive from an affiliate:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To make a solicitation for marketing purposes to a consumer with  whom you have a pre-existing business relationship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To facilitate communications to an individual for whose benefit  you provide employee benefit or other services pursuant to a contract  with an employer related to and arising out of the current employment  relationship or status of the individual as a participant or beneficiary  of an employee benefit plan;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To perform services on behalf of an affiliate, except that this  subparagraph shall not be construed as permitting you to send  solicitations on behalf of an affiliate if the affiliate would not be  permitted to send the solicitation as a result of the election of the  consumer to opt out under this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In response to a communication about your products or services  initiated by the consumer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In response to an authorization or request by the consumer to  receive solicitations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If your compliance with this subpart would prevent you from  complying with any provision of State insurance laws pertaining to  unfair discrimination in any State in which you are lawfully doing  business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples of exceptions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Example of the pre-existing business  relationship exception. A consumer has a deposit account with a federal  credit union. The consumer also has a relationship with the federal  credit union's securities brokerage affiliate. The federal credit union  receives eligibility information about the consumer from its securities   brokerage affiliate and uses that information to make a solicitation to  the consumer about the federal credit union's wealth management  services. The federal credit union may make this solicitation even if  the consumer has not been given a notice and opportunity to opt out  because the federal credit union has a pre-existing business  relationship with the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples of service provider exception. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consumer has an  insurance policy obtained through an insurance brokerage. The insurance  brokerage furnishes eligibility information about the consumer to its  affiliated federal credit union. Based on that eligibility information,  the federal credit union wants to make a solicitation to the consumer  about membership and its deposit products. The federal credit union does  not have a pre-existing business relationship with the consumer and none  of the other exceptions in paragraph (c) of this section apply. The  consumer has been given an opt-out notice and has elected to opt out of  receiving such solicitations. The federal credit union asks a service  provider to send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The  service provider may not send the solicitation on behalf of the federal  credit union because, as a result of the consumer's opt-out election,  the federal credit union is not permitted to make the solicitation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The same facts as in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section,  except the consumer has been given an opt-out notice, but has not  elected to opt out. The federal credit union asks a service provider to  send the solicitation to the consumer on its behalf. The service  provider may send the solicitation on behalf of the federal credit union  because, as a result of the consumer's not opting out, the federal  credit union is permitted to make the solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples of consumer-initiated communications. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consumer  who has a deposit account with a federal credit union initiates a  communication with the federal credit union's credit card affiliate to  request information about a credit card. The credit card affiliate may  use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains from the  federal credit union or any other affiliate to make solicitations  regarding credit card products in response to the consumer-initiated  communication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A consumer who has a deposit account with a federal credit  union contacts the institution to request information about how to save  and invest for a child's college education without specifying the type  of product in which the consumer may be interested. Information about a  range of different products or services offered by the federal credit  union and one or more affiliates of the institution may be responsive to  that communication. Such products or services may include the following:  Mutual funds offered by the institution; section 529 plans offered by  the institution or its securities brokerage affiliate; or trust services  offered by the institution or its trust services affiliate. Any  affiliate offering investment counseling services that would be  responsive to the consumer's request for information about saving and  investing for a child's college education may use eligibility  information to make solicitations to the consumer in response to this  communication.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A credit card issuer makes a marketing call to the consumer  without using eligibility information received from an affiliate. The  issuer leaves a voice-mail message that invites the consumer to call a  toll-free number to apply for the issuer's credit card. If the consumer  calls the toll-free number to inquire about the credit card, the call is  a consumer-initiated communication about a product or service and the  credit card issuer may now use eligibility information it receives from  its affiliates to make solicitations to the consumer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A consumer calls a federal credit union to ask about retail  locations and hours, but does not request information about products or  services. The institution may not use eligibility information it  receives from an affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about  its products or services because the consumer-initiated communication  does not relate to the federal credit union's products or services.  Thus, the use of eligibility information received from an affiliate  would not be responsive to the communication and the exception does not  apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A consumer calls a federal credit union to ask about retail  locations and hours. The customer service representative asks the  consumer if there is a particular product or service about which the  consumer is seeking information. The consumer responds that the consumer  wants to stop in and find out about share certificates. The customer  service representative offers to provide that information by telephone  and mail additional information and application materials to the  consumer. The consumer agrees and provides or confirms contact  information for receipt of the materials to be mailed. The federal  credit union may use eligibility information it receives from an  affiliate to make solicitations to the consumer about share certificates  because such solicitations would respond to the consumer-initiated  communication about products or services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Examples of consumer authorization or request for solicitations.  </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A consumer who obtains a mortgage from a federal credit union  authorizes or requests information about obtaining homeowner's insurance  through the federal credit union's insurance brokerage affiliate. Such  authorization or request, whether given to the federal credit union or  to the insurance brokerage affiliate, would permit the insurance  brokerage to use eligibility information about the consumer it obtains  from the federal credit union or any other affiliate to make  solicitations to the consumer about its homeowner's insurance services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A consumer completes an online application to apply for a  credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application  contains a blank check box that the consumer may check to authorize or  request information from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The  consumer checks the box. The consumer has authorized or requested  solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A consumer completes an online application to apply for a  credit card from a credit card issuer. The issuer's online application  contains a pre-selected check box indicating that the consumer  authorizes or requests information from the issuer's affiliates. The  consumer does not deselect the check box. The consumer has not  authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The terms and conditions of a credit card account agreement  contain preprinted boilerplate language stating that by applying to open  an account the consumer authorizes or requests to receive solicitations  from the credit card issuer's affiliates. The consumer has not  authorized or requested solicitations from the card issuer's affiliates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Relation to affiliate-sharing notice and opt-out. Nothing in  this subpart limits the responsibility of a person to comply with the  notice and opt-out provisions of section 603(d)(2)(A)(iii) of the Act  where applicable.</p>
