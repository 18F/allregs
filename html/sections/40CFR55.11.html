                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)</em> of the Act, to the Administrator  for the authority to implement and enforce the requirements of this OCS  program: Within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary; and/or Beyond  25 miles of the State's seaward boundary. Authority to implement and  enforce Secs. 55.5, 55.11, and 55.12 of this part will not be delegated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator will delegate implementation and enforcement  authority to a State if the State has an adjacent OCS source and the  Administrator determines that the State's regulations are adequate,  including a demonstration by the State that the State has:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adopted the appropriate portions of this part into State law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adequate authority under State law to implement and enforce the  requirements of this part. A letter from the State Attorney General  shall be required stating that the requesting agency has such authority;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Adequate resources to implement and enforce the requirements of  this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adequate administrative procedures to implement and enforce the  requirements of this part, including public notice and comment  procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will notify in writing the Governor or the  Governor's designee of the Administrator's final   action on a request for delegation within 6 months of the receipt of the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Administrator finds that the State regulations are  adequate, the Administrator will authorize the State to implement and  enforce the OCS requirements under State law. If the Administrator finds  that only part of the State regulations are adequate, he will authorize  the State to implement and enforce only that portion of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Upon delegation, a State may use any authority it possesses  under State law to enforce any permit condition or any other requirement  of this part for which the agency has delegated authority under this  part. A State may use any authority it possesses under State law to  require monitoring and reporting and to conduct inspections.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Nothing in this part shall prohibit the Administrator from  enforcing any requirement of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Administrator will withdraw a delegation of any authority to  implement and enforce any or all of this part if the Administrator  determines that: (1) The requirements of this part are not being  adequately implemented or enforced by the delegated agency, or (2) The  delegated agency no longer has adequate regulations as required by  Sec. 55.11(b) of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Sharing of information. Any information obtained or used in the  administration of a delegated program shall be made available to EPA  upon request without restriction. If the information has been submitted  to the delegated agency under a claim of confidentiality, the delegated  agency must notify the source of this obligation and submit that claim  to EPA. Any information obtained from a delegated agency accompanied by  a claim of confidentiality will be treated in accordance with the  requirements of 40 CFR part 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Grant of exemptions. A decision by a delegated agency to grant  or deny an exemption request may be appealed to the Administrator in  accordance with Sec. 55.7 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Delegated authority. The delegated agency in the COA for sources  located within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary or the delegated  agency in the NOA for sources located beyond 25 miles of the State's  seaward boundary will exercise all delegated authority. If there is no  delegated agency in the COA for sources located within 25 miles of the  State's seaward boundary, or in the NOA for sources located beyond 25  miles of the State's seaward boundary, the EPA will issue the permit and  implement and enforce the requirements of this part. For sources located  within 25 miles of the State's seaward boundary, the Administrator may  retain the authority for implementing and enforcing the requirements of  this part if the NOA and COA are in different States.
