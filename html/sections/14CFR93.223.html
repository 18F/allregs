                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Slots do not represent a property right but represent an  operating privilege subject to absolute FAA control. Slots may be  withdrawn at any time to fulfill the Department's operational   needs, such as providing slots for international or essential air  service operations or eliminating slots. Before withdrawing any slots  under this section to provide them for international operations,  essential air services or other operational needs, those slots returned  under Sec. 93.224 of this part and those recalled by the agency under  Sec. 93.227 will be allocated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Separate slot pools shall be established for air carriers and  commuter operators at each airport. The FAA shall assign, by random  lottery, withdrawal priority numbers for the recall priority of slots at  each airport. Each additional permanent slot, if any, will be assigned  the next higher number for air carrier or commuter slots, as  appropriate, at each airport. Each slot shall be assigned a designation  consisting of the applicable withdrawal priority number; the airport  code; a code indicating whether the slot is an air carrier or commuter  operator slot; and the time period of the slot. The designation shall  also indicate, as appropriate, if the slot is daily or for certain days  of the week only; is limited to arrivals or departures; is allocated for  international operations or for EAS purposes; and, at Kennedy  International Airport, is a summer or winter slot.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever slots must be withdrawn, they will be withdrawn in  accordance with the priority list established under paragraph (b) of  this section, except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Slots obtained in a lottery held pursuant to Sec. 93.225 of this  part shall be subject to withdrawal pursuant to paragraph (i) of that  section, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Slots necessary for international and essential air service  operations shall be exempt from withdrawal for use for other  international or essential air service operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 93.227(a), the FAA shall not withdraw  slots held at an airport by an air carrier or commuter operator holding  and operating 12 or fewer slots at that airport (excluding slots used  for operations described in Sec. 93.212(a)(1)), if withdrawal would  reduce the number of slots held below the number of slots operated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No slot comprising the guaranteed base of slots, as defined in  section 93.318(b), shall be withdrawn for use for international  operations or for new entrants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following withdrawal priority rule shall be used to permit  application of the one-for-one trade provisions for international and  essential air service slots and the slot withdrawal provisions where the  slots are needed for other than international or essential air service  operations. If an operator has more than one slot in a specific time  period in which it also has a slot being used for international or  essential air service operations, the international and essential air  service slots will be considered to be those with the lowest withdrawal  priority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The operator(s) using each slot to be withdrawn shall be  notified by the FAA of the withdrawal and shall cease operations using  that slot on the date indicated in the notice. Generally, the FAA will  provide at least 30 days after notification for the operator to cease  operations unless exigencies require a shorter time period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For 24 months following a lottery held after June 1, 1991, a  slot acquired in that lottery shall be withdrawn by the FAA upon the  sale, merger, or acquisition of more than 50 percent ownership or  control of the carrier using that slot or one acquired by trade of that  slot, if the resulting total of slots held or operated at the airport by  the surviving entity would exceed 12 slots.
