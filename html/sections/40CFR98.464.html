                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For calendar year 2011 monitoring, the facility may submit a request to the Administrator to use one or more best available monitoring methods as listed in Sec. 98.3(d)(1)(i) through (iv). The request must be submitted no later than October 12, 2010 and must contain the information in Sec. 98.3(d)(2)(ii). To obtain approval, the request must demonstrate to the Administrator's satisfaction that it is not reasonably feasible to acquire, install, and operate a required piece of monitoring equipment by January 1, 2011. The use of best available monitoring methods will not be approved beyond December 31, 2011.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For each waste stream placed in the landfill during the reporting year for which you choose to determine volatile solids concentration and/or a waste stream-specific DOCX, you must collect and test a representative sample of that waste stream using the methods specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(4) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Develop and follow a sampling plan to collect a representative sample (in terms of composition and moisture content) of each waste stream placed in the landfill for which testing is elected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the percent total solids and the percent volatile solids of each sample following Standard Method 2540G ``Total, Fixed, and Volatile Solids in Solid and Semisolid Samples'' (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 98.7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For the purposes of Sec. 98.460(c)(2)(xii), the volatile solids concentration (weight percent on a dry basis) is the percent volatile solids determined using Standard Method 2540G ``Total, Fixed, and Volatile Solids in Solid and Semisolid Samples'' (incorporated by reference; see Sec. 98.7).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine DOC value of a waste stream by either using at least a 60-day anaerobic biodegradation test as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section or by estimating the DOC value based on the total and volatile solids measurements as specified in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Perform an anaerobic biodegradation test and determine the DOC value of a waste stream following the procedures and requirements in paragraphs (b)(4)(i)(A) through (E) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> You may use the procedures published by a consensus-based standards organization to conduct a minimum of a 60-day anaerobic biodegradation test. Consensus-based standards organizations include, but are not limited to, the following: ASTM International (100 Barr Harbor Drive, P.O. Box CB700, West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania 19428-B2959, (800) 262-1373, http://www.astm.org), the American National Standards Institute (ANSI, 1819 L Street, NW., 6th floor, Washington, DC 20036, (202) 293-8020, http://www.ansi.org), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME, Three Park Avenue, New York, NY 10016-5990, (800) 843-2763,

Each waste stream sample must be appropriately ground to ensure the waste material is fully exposed to the anaerobic digester sludge.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Determine the net mass of carbon degraded in the control sample as the difference in the results of the control sample and the digester sludge blank sample. Determine the net mass of carbon degraded in each waste stream sample as the difference in the results of each waste stream sample and the digester sludge blank sample.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Determine the fraction of carbon degraded in the control sample as the net mass of carbon degraded in the control sample divided by the mass of carbon added via the substrate material in the control sample. If less than 50 percent of the theoretical mass of carbon in the control sample is degraded, the test run is invalid.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Determine the DOC of each waste sample using Equation TT-7 of this section. If the DOC values for the two waste stream samples differ by more than 20 percent, the test run is invalid. The DOC of the waste stream is determined as the average DOC value of the two waste stream samples determined during a valid test.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR29NO13.026
