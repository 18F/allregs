                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The Deputy Administrator has determined, as provided in  (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(3)(ii) that use of this Title XII source  selection procedure is necessary so as not to impair or affect USAID's  ability to administer Title XII of the Foreign Assistance Act. This  determination is reflected in (48 CFR) AIDAR 706.302-70(b)(4). This  constitutes authority for other than full and open competition when  selecting Title XII institutions to perform Title XII projects.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope of subsection. This subsection prescribes policies and  procedures for the selection of institutions eligible under Title XII of  the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended, to perform activities  authorized under Title XII.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Applicability. The provisions of this subsection are applicable  when the project office certifies that the activity is authorized under  Title XII, and determines that use of the Title XII selection procedure  is appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Solicitation, evaluation, and selection procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Competition shall be sought among eligible Title XII institutions to the  maximum practicable extent; this requirement shall be deemed satisfied  when a contractor is selected under the procedures of this subsection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The project office shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prepare selection criteria for evaluation of eligible  institutions for use in preparing the source list, determining  predominantly qualified sources, and selecting the contractor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prepare an initial list of eligible institutions considered  qualified to perform the proposed activity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a statement describing qualifications and areas of  expertise considered essential, a statement of work, estimate of  personnel requirements, special requirements (logistic support,  Government furnished property, and so forth) for the contracting  officer's use in preparing the request for technical proposal (RFTP).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Send a memorandum incorporating the certification and  determination required by paragraph (c) of this section, together with  the information required by paragraphs (d)(2)(i) through (iii) of this  section, with the ``Action'' copy of the requisition to the contracting  officer, requesting him/her to prepare and distribute the RFTP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon receipt and acceptance of the project officer's request,  the contracting officer shall prepare the RFTP. The RFTP shall contain  sufficient information to enable an offeror to submit a responsive and  complete technical proposal. This includes a definitive statement of  work, an estimate of the personnel required, and special provisions  (such as logistic support, Government furnished equipment, and so  forth), a proposed contract format, and evaluation criteria. No cost or  pricing data will be requested or required by the RFTP. The RFTP will be  distributed to the eligible institutions recommended by the project  office. The RFTP will be synopsized, as required by (48 CFR) FAR 5.201,  and will normally allow a minimum of 60 days for preparation and  submission of a proposal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Upon receipt of responses to the RFTP by the contracting  officer, an evaluation committee will be established as provided for in  715.303-70.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The evaluation committee will evaluate all proposals in  accordance with the criteria set forth in the RFTP, and will prepare a  selection memorandum which shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the evaluation criteria;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> List all of the eligible institutions whose proposals were  reviewed;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Report on the ranking and rationale therefor for all  proposals;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Indicate the eligible institution or institutions considered  best qualified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The evaluation committee will submit the selection memorandum to  the contracting officer for review and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The contracting officer will either approve the selection  memorandum, or   return it to the evaluation committee for reconsideration for specified  reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the selection memorandum is approved, the contracting officer  shall obtain cost, pricing, and other necessary data from the  recommended institution or institutions and shall conduct negotiations.  If a satisfactory contract cannot be obtained, the contracting officer  will so advise the evaluation committee. The evaluation committee may  then recommend an alternate institution or institutions.  [52 FR 6158, Mar. 2, 1987, as amended at 54 FR 28069, July 5, 1989; 55  FR 6802, Feb. 27, 1990.
