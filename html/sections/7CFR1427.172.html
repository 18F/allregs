                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A producer may, at any time before maturity of the loan, obtain  release of all or any part of the loan seed cotton by paying to CCC the  amount of the loan, plus interest and charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A producer or the producer's agent shall not remove from  storage any cotton which is pledged as collateral for a loan until prior  written approval has been received from CCC for removal of such cotton.  If a producer or the producer's agent obtains such approval, they may  remove such cotton from storage, sell the seed cotton, have it ginned,  and sell the lint cotton and cottonseed obtained therefrom. The ginner  shall inform the county office in writing immediately after the seed  cotton removed from storage has been ginned and furnish the county  office the loan number, producer's name, and applicable gin bale  numbers. If the seed cotton is removed from storage, the loan principal  plus interest and charges thereon must be satisfied not later than the  earlier of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The date established by the county committee;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 5 days after the date of the producer received the AMS  classification under Sec. 1427.9 (and the warehouse receipt, if the  cotton is delivered to a warehouse), representing such cotton; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The loan maturity date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the seed cotton or lint cotton is sold, the loan principal,  interest, and charges must be satisfied immediately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A producer, except a CMA, may obtain a nonrecourse loan or loan  deficiency payment under subpart A of this part, on the lint cotton,  but:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The loan principal, interest, and charges on the seed cotton  must be satisfied from the proceeds of the nonrecourse loan under  subpart A of this part; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The loan deficiency payment must be applied to the loan  principal, interest, and charges on the outstanding seed cotton loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A CMA must repay the seed cotton loan principal, interest, and  charges before pledging the cotton for a nonrecourse loan or before a  loan deficiency payment can be approved under subpart A of this part, on  the lint cotton. If CMA's authorized by producers to obtain loans in  their behalf remove seed cotton from storage before obtaining approval  to move such cotton, such removal shall constitute conversion of such  cotton unless the CMA:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Notifies the county office in writing the following morning by  mail or otherwise that such cotton has been moved and is on the gin  yard;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Furnishes CCC an irrevocable letter of credit if requested; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Repays the loan principal, plus interest and charges, within  the time specified by the county committee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any removal from storage shall not be deemed to constitute a  release of CCC's security interest in the seed cotton or to release the  producer or CMA from liability for the loan principal, interest, and  charges if full payment of such amount is not received by the county  office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, either before or after maturity, the producer discovers that  the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of  condition, the producer shall immediately notify the county office and  confirm such notice in writing. If the county committee determines that  the cotton is going out of condition or is in danger of going out of  condition, the county committee will call for repayment of the loan  principal, plus interest and charges on or before a specified date. If  the producer does not repay the loan or have the cotton ginned and  obtain a nonrecourse loan under subpart A of this part on the lint  cotton produced therefrom within the period as specified by the county  committee, the cotton shall be considered abandoned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the producer has control of the storage site and if the  producer subsequently loses control of the storage site or there is  danger of flood or damage to the seed cotton or storage structure making  continued storage of the cotton unsafe, the producer shall immediately  either repay the loan or move the seed cotton to the nearest approved  gin for ginning and shall, at the same time, inform the county office.  If the producer does not do so, the seed cotton shall be considered  abandoned.</p>
