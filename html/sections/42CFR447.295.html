                                Sec.  447.295  Hospital-specific disproportionate share hospital  insurance or other third party coverage.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Basis and purpose. This section sets forth the methodology for  determining the costs for individuals who have no health insurance or  other source of third party coverage for services furnished during the  year for purposes of calculating the hospital-specific disproportionate  share hospital payment limit under section 1923(g) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions.</p><p class="depth2">Health insurance coverage limit means a limit imposed by a third  party payer that establishes a maximum dollar value or maximum number of  specific services, for benefits received by an individual.</p><p class="depth2">Individuals who have no health insurance (or other source of third  party coverage) for the services furnished during the year means  individuals who have no source of third party coverage for the specific  inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service furnished by the  hospital.</p><p class="depth2">No source of third party coverage for a specific inpatient hospital  or outpatient hospital service means that the service is not included in  an individual's health benefits coverage through a group health plan or  health insurer, and for which there is no other legally liable third  party. When a health insurance coverage limit is imposed by a third  party payer, specific services beyond the limit would not be within the  individual's health benefit package from that third party payer. For  American Indians/Alaska Natives, IHS and tribal coverage is only  considered third party coverage when services are received directly from  IHS or tribal health programs (direct health care services) or when IHS  or a tribal health program has authorized coverage through the contract  health service program (through a purchase order or equivalent  document). Administrative denials of payment, or requirements for  satisfaction of deductible, copayment or coinsurance liability, do not  affect the determination that a specific service is included in the  health benefits coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of an individual's third party coverage status.  Individuals who have no source of third party coverage for a specific  inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service must be considered,  for purposes of that service, to be uninsured. This determination is   not dependent on the receipt of payment by the hospital from the third  party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The determination of an individual's status as having a source  of third party coverage must be a service-specific coverage  determination. The service-specific coverage determination can occur  only once per individual per service provided and applies to the entire  service, including all elements as that service, or similar services,  would be defined in Medicaid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Individuals who are inmates in a public institution or are  otherwise involuntarily in secure custody as a result of criminal  charges are considered to have a source of third party coverage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hospital-specific DSH limit calculation. Only costs incurred in  providing inpatient hospital and outpatient hospital services to  Medicaid individuals, and revenues received with respect to those  services, and costs incurred in providing inpatient hospital and  outpatient hospital services, and revenues received with respect to  those services, for which a determination has been made in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section that the services were furnished to  individuals who have no source of third party coverage for the specific  inpatient hospital or outpatient hospital service are included when  calculating the costs and revenues for Medicaid individuals and  individuals who have no health insurance or other source of third party  coverage for purposes of section 1923(g)(1) of the Act.
