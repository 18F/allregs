                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Organizations that are religious or faith-based are eligible, on the same basis as any other organization, to receive ESG funds. Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under ESG shall discriminate against an organization on the basis of the organization's religious character or affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organizations that are directly funded under the ESG program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization as part of the programs or services funded under ESG. If an organization conducts these activities, the activities must be offered separately, in time or location, from the programs or services funded under ESG, and participation must be voluntary for program participants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any religious organization that receives ESG funds retains its independence from Federal, State, and local governments, and may continue to carry out its mission, including the definition, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs, provided that the religious organization does not use direct ESG funds to support any inherently religious activities, such as worship, religious instruction, or proselytization. Among other things, faith-based organizations may use space in

their facilities to provide ESG-funded services, without removing religious art, icons, scriptures, or other religious symbols. In addition, an ESG-funded religious organization retains its authority over its internal governance, and the organization may retain religious terms in its organization's name, select its board members on a religious basis, and include religious references in its organization's mission statements and other governing documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An organization that receives ESG funds shall not, in providing ESG assistance, discriminate against a program participant or prospective program participant on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ESG funds may not be used for the rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those structures are used for inherently religious activities. Solutions ESG funds may be used for the rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that those structures are used for conducting eligible activities under the ESG program. Where a structure is used for both eligible and inherently religious activities, ESG funds may not exceed the cost of those portions of the rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to ESG funds. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that an ESG-funded religious congregation uses as its principal place of worship, however, are ineligible for funded improvements under the program. Disposition of real property after the term of the grant, or any change in use of the property during the term of the grant, is subject to government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (see 24 CFR parts 84 and 85).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the recipient or a subrecipient that is a local government voluntarily contributes its own funds to supplement federally funded activities, the recipient or subrecipient has the option to segregate the Federal funds or commingle them. However, if the funds are commingled, this section applies to all of the commingled funds.</p>
