Except as otherwise provided in this  section, fixed tube devices are not acceptable as the primary gaging  device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All gaging devices shall be arranged so that the maximum liquid  level for product being carried, to which the tank may be filled is  readily determinable. The maximum gallonage capacity as required by  Sec. 38.15-1 shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Marked on the tank system nameplate or gaging device; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Shown in the ullage tables.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gaging devices that require bleeding of the product to the  atmosphere, such as the rotary tube, fixed tube, and slip tube, shall be  so designed that the bleed valve maximum opening is not larger than a  No. 54 drill size (0.055-inch diameter), unless provided with an excess  flow valve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For pressure vessel type tanks each automatic float, continuous  reading tape or similar type gage not mounted directly on the tank or  dome shall be fitted with a shutoff device located as close to the tank  as practicable. When an automatic float gaging device, which gages the  entire height of the tank is used, a fixed tube gage set in the range of  85 percent to 90 percent of the water capacity of the tank shall be  provided in addition as a means of checking the accuracy of the  automatic float, gage, or other alternate means acceptable to the  Commandant may be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A gaging device shall be designed for a pressure at least equal  to the maximum allowable pressure of the tank on which it is installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Gage glasses of the columnar type are prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Flat sight glasses may be used in the design of automatic float  continuous reading tape gages: Provided, That such glasses shall be made  of high strength material suitable for the operating temperatures of not  less than one-half inch in thickness and adequately protected by a metal  cover.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 38.15_Special Requirements</p>
