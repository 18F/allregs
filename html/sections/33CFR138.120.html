The request must be received by the Director, NPFC, within 10 days after the date of the notification of intention to deny or revoke. A Certificate subject to revocation under this paragraph remains valid until the Director, NPFC, issues a written decision revoking the Certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An applicant or certificant whose Certificate has been denied under paragraph (a) of this section or revoked under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section may request the Director, NPFC, to reconsider the denial or revocation. The certificant must submit a request for reconsideration, in writing, to the Director, NPFC, within 20 days of the date of the denial or revocation. The certificant must state the reasons for requesting reconsideration. The Director, NPFC, will generally issue a written decision on the request within 30 days of receipt, provided that, if the Director, NPFC, does not issue a decision within 30 days, the request for reconsideration will be deemed to have been denied, and the denial or revocation will be deemed to have been affirmed. Unless the Director, NPFC, issues a decision reversing the revocation, a revoked Certificate remains invalid. A decision by the Director, NPFC, affirming a denial or revocation, is final agency action.</p>
