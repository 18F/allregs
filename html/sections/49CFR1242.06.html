                                Sec.  1242.06  Instructions for separation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certain instructions for separating common expense accounts  (dependent accounts) between freight and passenger services base the  allocation on the proportional freight/passenger separation of other  common expense accounts (independent accounts). The dependent account is  frequently identified by an ``XX'' symbol in the natural expense  position (first two digits) with corresponding independent accounts also  identified by the ``XX'' natural expense symbol. Unless otherwise  stated, the applicable natural expense associated with ``XX'' symbol  shall be the same for both the dependent and independent accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To illustrate, Sec.  1242.10 provides instructions for  separating common Way and Structures, Administration--Track accounts  (dependent accounts) designated by XX-19-02. The separation is   based on certain other common Way and Structures accounts including  Roadway--Running, XX-17-10, and Roadway--Switching, XX-18-10.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As Sec.  1242.05 states, the ``XX'' symbol denotes the following  natural expenses for Way and Structures administration functions:  11--Salaries and wages, 21--Materials, tools, supplies, fuels, and lubricants, 41--Other purchased services, and 61--General.   These natural expenses shall be individually applied to the separation  rules in Sec.  1242.10. In each case, the independent accounts providing  the basis for freight/passenger separation of the dependent account  shall have the same natural expense designation. For example, the basis  of separating account 11-19-02, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures,  Administration--Track, would be based on certain independent accounts  including 11-17/18-10, Salaries and Wages, Way and Structures, Running/ Switching, Repair and Maintenance, Roadway.</p><p class="depth2">Operating Expenses--Way and Structures</p>
