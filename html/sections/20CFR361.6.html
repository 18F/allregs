                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A request for waiver or for a hearing must be made in writing  and received by the Chief Financial Officer no later than thirty  calendar days after the notice is sent to the employee. This time limit  may, at the discretion of the Chief Financial Officer, be extended if  the employee can show that the delay was caused by circumstances which  were beyond the employee's control or because of the employee's failure  to receive notice of the time limit. Any right to waiver or to a hearing  is forfeited unless the time limits set forth in this paragraph are  complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The employee's request for a hearing must be signed by the  employee and fully identify and explain with reasonable specificity all  the facts, evidence and witnesses, if any, which the employee believes  support his or her position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A request for a hearing under this paragraph is not a request  for waiver. A request for waiver must state the basis for the request  for waiver and whether a hearing is requested. If no request for a  hearing is contained in the waiver request, no hearing will be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A hearing, if requested, will be an informal proceeding  conducted by an administrative law judge or hearing official not under  the control of the Board. The employee, or his/her representative, and  the Board will be   given full opportunity to present evidence, witnesses and argument.</p>
