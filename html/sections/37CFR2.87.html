                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application may be divided. An application may be divided into  two or more separate applications upon the payment of a fee for each new  application created and submission by the applicant of a request in  accordance with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fee. In the case of a request to divide out one or more entire  classes from an application, only the fee for dividing an application as  set forth in Sec.  2.6(a)(19) will be required. However, in the case of  a request to divide out some, but not all, of the goods or services in a  class, the applicant must submit the application filing fee as set forth  in Sec.  2.6(a)(1) for each new separate application to be created by  the division, in addition to the fee for dividing an application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time for filing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A request to divide an application may be  filed at any time between the application filing date and the date on  which the trademark examining attorney approves the mark for  publication; or during an opposition, concurrent use, or interference  proceeding, upon motion granted by the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In an application under section 1(b) of the Act, a request to  divide may also be filed with a statement of use under Sec.  2.88 or at  any time between the filing of a statement of use and the date on which  the trademark examining attorney approves the mark for registration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a multiple-basis application, a request to divide out goods  or services having a particular basis may also be filed during the  period between the issuance of the notice of allowance under section  13(b)(2) of the Act and   the filing of a statement of use under Sec.  2.88.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Form. A request to divide an application should be made in a  separate document from any other amendment or response in the  application. The title ``Request to Divide Application'' should appear  at the top of the first page of the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Outstanding time periods apply to newly created applications.  Any time period for action by the applicant which is outstanding in the  original application at the time of the division will apply to each  separate new application created by the division, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an Office action pertaining to less than all the classes in a  multiple-class application is outstanding, and the applicant files a  request to divide out the goods, services, and/or class(es) to which the  Office action does not pertain before the response deadline, a response  to the Office action is not due in the new (child) application(s)  created by the division of the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If an Office action pertaining to less than all the bases in a  multiple-basis application is outstanding, and the applicant files a  request to divide out the goods/services having the basis or bases to  which the Office action does not pertain before the response deadline, a  response to the Office action is not due in the new (child)  application(s) created by the division of the application; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In a multiple-basis application in which a notice of allowance  has issued, if the applicant files a request to divide out the goods/ services having the basis or bases to which the notice of allowance does  not pertain before the deadline for filing the statement of use, the new  (child) applications created by the division are not affected by the  notice of allowance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Signature. The request to divide must be signed by the  applicant, someone with legal authority to bind the applicant (e.g., a  corporate officer or general partner of a partnership), or a  practitioner who meets the requirements of Sec.  11.14, in accordance  with the requirements of Sec.  2.193(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Section 66(a) applications--change of ownership with respect to  some but not all of the goods or services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the International  Bureau of the World Intellectual Property Organization notifies the  Office that an international registration has been divided as the result  of a change of ownership with respect to some but not all of the goods  or services, the Office will construe the International Bureau's notice  as a request to divide. The Office will record the partial change of  ownership in the Assignment Services Branch, and divide out the assigned  goods/services from the original (parent) application. The Office will  create a new (child) application serial number, and enter the  information about the new application in its automated records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To obtain a certificate of registration in the name of the new  owner for the goods/services that have been divided out, the new owner  must pay the fee(s) for the request to divide, as required by Sec.  2.6  and paragraph (b) of this section. The examining attorney will issue an  Office action in the child application requiring the new owner to pay  the required fee(s). If the owner of the child application fails to  respond, the child application will be abandoned. It is not necessary  for the new owner to file a separate request to divide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Office will not divide a section 66(a) application based  upon a change of ownership unless the International Bureau notifies the  Office that the international registration has been divided.
