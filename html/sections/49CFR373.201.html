                            <p class="depth0">Each freight forwarder must issue the shipper a receipt or through bill of lading, covering transportation from origin to ultimate destination, on each shipment for which it arranges transportation in interstate commerce. Where a motor carrier receives freight at the origin and issues a receipt therefor on its form with a notation showing the freight forwarder's name, then the freight forwarder, upon receiving the shipment at the ``on line'' or consolidating station, must issue a receipt or through bill of lading on its form as of the date the carrier receives the shipment.
