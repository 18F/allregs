                            <p class="depth0">For a NOVA, NOPS or NIDP, the 30 day response period begins to run  on the date the notice is received. All other time periods begin to run  on the day following the service date of the document, paper, or event  that begins the time period. Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays  will be included in computing such time, except that when such time  expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, in which event such  period will be extended to include the next business day. This method of  computing time periods also applies to any act, such as paying a   civil penalty, required by this part to take place within a specified  period of time. When the period of time prescribed or allowed is less  than 11 days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays will  be excluded in the computation.</p>
