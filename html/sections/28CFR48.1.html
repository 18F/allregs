                            <p class="depth0">These regulations set forth the procedure by which application may be made to the Attorney General for his approval of joint newspaper operating arrangements entered into after July 24, 1970, and for the filing with the Department of Justice of the terms of a renewal or amendment of existing joint newspaper operating arrangements, as required by the Newspaper Preservation Act, Pub. L. 91-353, 84 Stat. 466, 15 U.S.C. 1801 et seq. The Newspaper Preservation Act does not require that all joint newspaper operating arrangements obtain the prior written consent of the Attorney General. The Act and these regulations provide a method for newspapers to obtain the benefit of a limited exemption from the antitrust laws if they desire to do so. Joint newspaper operating arrangements that are put into effect without the prior written consent of the Attorney General remain fully subject to the antitrust laws.</p>
