                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to section 1116 of the Act, any State dissatisfied with a  determination of the Administrator pursuant to Sec. 201.3 (e) or (f)  with respect to any plan or amendment may, within 60 days after the date  of receipt of notification of such determination, file a petition with  the Regional Administrator, asking the Administrator for reconsideration  of the issue of whether such plan or amendment conforms to the  requirements for approval under the Act and pertinent Federal  requirements. Within 30 days after receipt of such a petition, the  Administrator shall notify the State of the time and place at which the  hearing for the purpose of reconsidering such issue will be held. Such  hearing shall be held not less than 30 days nor more than 60 days after  the date notice of such hearing is furnished to the State, unless the  Administrator and the State agree in writing on another time. For  hearing procedures, see part 213 of this chapter. A determination  affirming, modifying, or reversing the Administrator's original decision  will be made within 60 days of the conclusion of the hearing. Action  pursuant to an initial determination by the Administrator described in  such Sec. 201.3 (e) or (f) that a plan or amendment is not approvable  shall not be stayed pending the reconsideration, but in the event that  the Administrator subsequently determines that his original decision was  incorrect he shall certify restitution forthwith in a lump sum of any  funds incorrectly withheld or otherwise denied.
