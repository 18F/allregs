The Secretary may order an immediate temporary suspension of activities authorized under a permit or other use authorization prior to a hearing or final administrative finding if he/she determines that such a suspension is necessary to protect health or safety or the environment. Further, where other applicable law contains specific provisions for suspension, revocation, or cancellation of a permit or other authorization to use, occupy, or develop the public lands, the specific provisions of such law shall prevail.</p>
