                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Obtaining the services of a hearing official. When the debtor is  not an NCUA employee and NCUA cannot provide a prompt and appropriate  hearing before a hearing official, NCUA may request a hearing official  from an agent of the paying agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581,  appendix A, or as otherwise designated by the paying agency. When the  debtor is an NCUA employee, NCUA may contact any agent of another  agency, as designated in 5 CFR part 581, appendix A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of hearing. After the employee requests a hearing, the  hearing official shall notify the employee of the form of the hearing to  be provided. If the hearing will be oral, the notice shall set forth the  date, time, and location of the hearing, which must occur no more than  30 calendar days after the request is received, unless the employee  requests that the hearing be delayed. If the hearing will be conducted  by an examination of documents, the employee, within 30 calendar days,  shall submit any evidence or written arguments that should be considered  by the hearing official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Oral hearing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An employee who requests an oral hearing shall  be provided an oral hearing if the hearing official determines that the  matter cannot be resolved by an examination of the documents alone, as  for example, when an issue of credibility or veracity is involved. The  oral hearing need not be an adversarial adjudication and rules of  evidence need not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Oral hearings may take the form of, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Informal conferences with the hearing official in which the  employee and agency representative are given full opportunity to present  evidence, witnesses, and argument;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Informal meetings in which the hearing examiner interviews the  employee; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Formal written submissions followed by an opportunity for oral  presentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hearing by examination of documents. If the hearing official  determines that an oral hearing is not necessary, the hearing official  shall make the determination based upon an examination of the documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record. The hearing official shall maintain a summary record of  any hearing conducted under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Decision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing official shall issue a written  decision based upon evidence and information developed at the hearing or  in the case of a documentary hearing the decision shall be based on the  documents and written submissions. The decision shall be issued, as soon  as practicable after the hearing, but not later than 60 calendar days  after the hearing request was received by NCUA. If the hearing was  delayed at the request of the employee,   the 60-day decision period shall be extended by the number of days by  which the hearing was postponed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The decision of the hearing official shall be final and is  considered to be an official certification regarding the existence and  the amount of the debt for purposes of executing salary offset under 5  U.S.C. 5514. If the hearing official determines that a debt may not be  collected by salary offset, but NCUA finds that the debt is still valid,  NCUA may seek collection of the debt through other means in accordance  with applicable law and regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Content of decision. The written decision shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A summary of the facts concerning the origin, nature, and amount  of the debt;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The hearing official's findings, analysis, and conclusions; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The terms of any repayment schedules, if applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Failure to appear. If the employee or the NCUA representative  fails to appear, the hearing official shall proceed with the hearing as  scheduled, and issue the decision based upon the oral testimony  presented and the documentation submitted by both parties. At the  request of both parties, the hearing official may re-schedule the  hearing date.</p>
