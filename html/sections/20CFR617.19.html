Paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not applicable in regard to additional TRA, and the participation in training requirement of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section may not be waived under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Waiver of participation requirement. When it is determined, in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this section, that it is not feasible or is not appropriate (as such terms are defined in paragraph (b) of this section) to approve a training program for an individual otherwise entitled to basic TRA, the individual shall be furnished a formal written notice of waiver, with an explanation of the reason(s) for the waiver and a statement of why training is not feasible or is not appropriate in the case of such individual. At a minimum, the written statement furnished to the individual shall contain information required by Sec. 617.50(e) as well as the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Name and social security number of the individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Petition number under which the worker was certified;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A statement why the agency has determined that it is not feasible or is not appropriate to approve training for the individual at that time, and the reason(s) for the finding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the waiver will be revoked at any time that feasible and appropriate training becomes available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any other advice or information the State agency deems appropriate in informing the individual;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Signature block (with signature) for the appropriate State official; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Signature block (with signature) for the worker's acknowledgement of receipt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial of a waiver. In any case in which a determination is made to deny to any individual a waiver of the participation requirement, the individual shall be furnished a formal written notice of denial of waiver, which shall contain all of the information required of formal written notices under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Procedure. Any determination under paragraph (a)(2) or paragraph (a)(3) of this section shall be a determination to which Sec. Sec. 617.50 and 617.51 apply, including the requirement that any written notice furnished to an individual shall include notice of the individual's appeal rights as is provided in Sec. 617.50(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasons for issuing a waiver. (1) For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, a waiver of the participation in training requirement shall be issued to an individual only upon a supported finding that approval of a Sec. 617.22(a) training program for that individual is not feasible or is not appropriate at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of paragraphs (a)(2) and (a)(3) of this section, a waiver of the participation in training requirement shall be issued to an individual only upon a supported finding that approval of a Sec. 617.22(a) training program for that individual is not feasible or is not appropriate at that time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Feasible and appropriate. For the purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Feasible. The term feasible means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Training is available at that time which meets all the criteria of Sec. 617.22(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The individual is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training opportunity and complete the training; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Funding is available to pay the full costs of the training and any transportation and subsistence expenses which are compensable. The funding referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(3) of this section includes not only TAA program funds but also all other funds available under any of the provisions of

the Title I, Subchapter B of the Workforce Investment Act or any other Federal, State or private source that may be utilized for training approvable under Sec. 617.22(a). Further, the individual's situation in respect to undertaking training (as referred to in paragraph (b)(1)(i)(A)(2) of this section) shall include taking into account personal circumstances that preclude the individual from being able to participate in and complete the training program, such as the availability of transportation, the ability to make arrangements for necessary child care, and adequate financial resources if the weeks of training exceeds the duration of UI and TRA payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Appropriate. The term appropriate means being suitable or compatible, fitting, or proper. Appropriate, therefore, refers to suitability of the training for the worker (including whether there is a reasonable prospect which is reasonably foreseeable that the individual will be reemployed by the firm from which separated), and compatibility of the training for the purposes of the TAA Program. In these respects, suitability of training for the individual is encompassed within the several criteria in Sec. 617.22 (a), and compatibility with the program is covered by the various provisions of subpart C of this part which describe the types of training approvable under Sec. 617.22(a) and the limitations thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis for application. Whether training is feasible or appropriate at any given time is determined by finding whether, at that time, training suitable for the worker is available, the training is approvable under subpart C of this part including the criteria in Sec. 617.22(a), the worker is so situated as to be able to take full advantage of the training and satisfactorily complete the training, full funding for the training is available from one or more sources in accordance with Sec. Sec. 617.24 and 617.25, the worker has the financial resources to complete the training when the duration of the training program exceeds the worker's eligibility for TRA, and the training will commence within 30 days of approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Particular applications. The reasons for any determination that training is not feasible or is not appropriate shall be in accord with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Not feasible because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The beginning date of approved training is beyond 30 days, as required by the definition for ``Enrolled in training'' in Sec. 617.11(a)(2)(vii)(D),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Training is not reasonably available to the individual,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Training is not available at a reasonable cost,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Funds are not available to pay the total costs of training, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Personal circumstances such as health or financial resources, preclude participation in training or satisfactory completion of training,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Other (explain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not appropriate because--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(1)</em> The firm from which the individual was separated plans to recall the individual within the reasonably foreseeable future (State agencies must verify planned recalls with the employer),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Planned recall. For the purpose of determining whether the recall or reemployment of an individual is reasonably foreseeable (for the purposes of this section and Sec. 617.22), either a specific or general type of recall (as set out) shall be deemed to be sufficient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Specific recall. A specific recall is where an individual or group of individuals who was separated from employment is identified and notified by the employer to return to work within a specified time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> General recall. A general recall is where the employer announces an intention to recall an individual or group of individuals, or by other action reasonably signals an intent to recall, without specifying any certain date or specific time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonably foreseeable. For purposes of determining whether training should be denied and a training waiver granted, because of a planned recall that is reasonably foreseeable, such a planned recall includes a specific recall and also includes a general recall (as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section) if the general recall in each individual's case is reasonably expected to occur before the individual exhausts eligibility for any regular UI payments for which the individual is or may become entitled. A general recall,

in which the timing of the recall is reasonably expected to occur after the individual's exhaustion of any regular UI to which the individual is or may become entitled, shall not be treated as precluding approval of training, but shall be treated as any other worker separation for these purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The duration of training suitable for the individual exceeds the individual's maximum entitlement to basic and additional TRA payments and the individual cannot assure financial responsibility for completing the training program,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The individual possesses skills for ``suitable employment'' and there is a reasonable expectation of employment in the foreseeable future, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other (explain).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Waivers and able and available. An individual who has been furnished a written notice of waiver under paragraph (a)(2) of this section (or denial of waiver under paragraph (a)(3) of this section) shall be subject to all of the requirements of Sec. 617.17(a), which shall continue until the individual is enrolled in a training program as required by paragraph (a)(2)(vii) of Sec. 617.11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Waiver review and revocations. (1) State agencies must have a procedure for reviewing regularly (i.e., every 30 days or less) all waivers issued under this section to individuals, to ascertain that the conditions upon which the waivers were granted continue to exist. In any case in which the conditions have changed--i.e., training has become feasible and appropriate--then the waiver must be revoked, and a written notice of revocation shall be furnished to the individual involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State agencies must have a procedure for reviewing regularly (i.e., every 30 days or less) all waivers issued under this section to individuals, to ascertain that the conditions upon which the waivers were granted continue to exist. In any case in which the conditions have changed--i.e., training has become feasible and appropriate--then the waiver must be revoked, and a written notice of revocation shall be furnished to the individual involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In addition to the periodic reviews required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, State agencies must have a procedure for revoking waivers in individual cases promptly whenever a change in circumstances occurs. For example, a written notice of revocation shall be issued to the individual concurrent with the approval of the training in which the individual has enrolled (if such training is scheduled to commence within 30 days), and shall not be issued prior to such approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> State agencies may incorporate a revocation section in the waiver form or on a separate revocation form. Any determination under paragraph (c) of this section shall be a determination to which Sec. Sec. 617.50 and 617.51 apply. The information included in a written notice of revocation issued under this paragraph (c) shall include all of the information required for written notices issued under paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Recordkeeping and reporting. (1) State agencies must develop procedures for compiling and reporting on the number of waivers issued and revoked, by reason, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and report such data to the Department of Labor as requested by the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State agencies must develop procedures for compiling and reporting on the number of waivers issued and revoked, by reason, as specified in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, and report such data to the Department of Labor as requested by the Department.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State agencies are not required to forward copies of individual waiver and revocation notices to the Department of Labor, unless specifically requested by the Department. However, each State agency shall retain a copy of every individual waiver and revocation notice issued by the State, for such period of time as the Department requires.
