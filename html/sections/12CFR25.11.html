The authority  for subparts A, B, C, D, and E is 12 U.S.C. 21, 22, 26, 27, 30, 36, 93a,  161, 215, 215a, 481, 1814, 1816, 1828(c), 1835a, 2901 through 2907, and  3101 through 3111.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OMB control number.

In enacting the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA), the  Congress required each appropriate Federal financial supervisory agency  to assess an institution's record of helping to meet the credit needs of  the local communities in which the institution is chartered, consistent  with the safe and sound operation of the institution, and to take this  record into account in the agency's evaluation of an application for a  deposit facility by the institution. This part is intended to carry out  the purposes of the CRA by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establishing the framework and criteria by which the Office of  the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) assesses a bank's record of  helping to meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low-  and moderate-income neighborhoods, consistent with the safe and sound  operation of the bank; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Providing that the OCC takes that record into account in  considering certain applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scope--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. This part applies to all banks except as  provided in paragraphs (c)(2) and (c)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Federal branches and agencies. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This part applies to all  insured Federal branches and to any Federal branch that is uninsured  that results from an acquisition described in section 5(a)(8) of the  International Banking Act of 1978 (12 U.S.C. 3103(a)(8)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section, this  part does not apply to Federal branches that are uninsured, limited  Federal branches, or   Federal agencies, as those terms are defined in part 28 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain special purpose banks. This part does not apply to  special purpose banks that do not perform commercial or retail banking  services by granting credit to the public in the ordinary course of  business, other than as incident to their specialized operations. These  banks include banker's banks, as defined in 12 U.S.C. 24 (Seventh), and  banks that engage only in one or more of the following activities:  providing cash management controlled disbursement services or serving as  correspondent banks, trust companies, or clearing agents.
