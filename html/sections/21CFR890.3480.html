                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A powered exoskeleton is a prescription device  that is composed of an external, powered, motorized orthosis used for  medical purposes that is placed over a person's paralyzed or weakened  limbs for the purpose of providing ambulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special  controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Elements of the device materials that may contact the patient  must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Appropriate analysis/testing must validate electromagnetic  compatibility/interference (EMC/EMI), electrical safety, thermal safety,  mechanical safety, battery performance and safety, and wireless  performance, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Appropriate software verification, validation, and hazard  analysis must be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Design characteristics must ensure geometry and materials  composition are consistent with intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Non-clinical performance testing must demonstrate that the  device performs as intended under anticipated conditions of use.  Performance testing must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Mechanical bench testing (including durability testing) to  demonstrate that the device will withstand forces, conditions, and  environments encountered during use;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Simulated use testing (i.e., cyclic loading testing) to  demonstrate performance of device commands and safeguard under worst  case conditions and after durability testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Verification and validation of manual override controls are  necessary, if present;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The accuracy of device features and safeguards; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Device functionality in terms of flame retardant materials,  liquid/particle ingress prevention, sensor and actuator performance, and  motor performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Clinical testing must demonstrate safe and effective use and  capture any adverse events observed during clinical use when used under  the proposed conditions of use, which must include considerations for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Level of supervision necessary, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Environment of use (e.g., indoors and/or outdoors) including  obstacles and terrain representative of the intended use environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A training program must be included with sufficient educational  elements so that upon completion of training program, the clinician,  user, and companion can:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the safe environments for device use,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Use all safety features of device, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Operate the device in simulated or actual use environments  representative of indicated environments and use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Labeling for the Physician and User must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Appropriate instructions, warning, cautions, limitations, and  information related to the necessary safeguards of the device, including  warning against activities and environments that may put the user at  greater risk.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Specific instructions and the clinical training needed for the  safe use of the device, which includes:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Instructions on assembling the device in all available  configurations;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Instructions on fitting the patient;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Instructions and explanations of all available programs and how  to program the device;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Instructions and explanation of all controls, input, and  outputs;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Instructions on all available modes or states of the device;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Instructions on all safety features of the device; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Instructions for properly maintaining the device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Information on the patient population for which the device has  been demonstrated to have a reasonable assurance of safety and  effectiveness.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Pertinent non-clinical testing information (e.g., EMC, battery  longevity).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A detailed summary of the clinical testing including:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Adverse events encountered under use conditions,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Summary of study outcomes and endpoints, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Information pertinent to use of the device including the  conditions under which the device was studied (e.g., level of  supervision or assistance, and environment of use (e.g., indoors and/or  outdoors) including obstacles and terrain).
