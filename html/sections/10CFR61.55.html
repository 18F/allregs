                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Classification of waste for near surface disposal--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Considerations. Determination of the classification of radioactive waste  involves two considerations. First, consideration must be given to the  concentration of long-lived radionuclides (and their shorter-lived  precursors) whose potential hazard will persist long after such  precautions as institutional controls, improved waste form, and deeper  disposal have ceased to be effective. These precautions delay the time  when long-lived radionuclides could cause exposures. In addition, the  magnitude of the potential dose is limited by the concentration and  availability of the radionuclide at the time of exposure. Second,  consideration must be given to the concentration of shorter-lived  radionuclides for which requirements on institutional controls, waste  form, and disposal methods are effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Classes of waste. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Class A waste is waste that is usually  segregated from other waste classes at the disposal site. The physical  form and characteristics of Class A waste must meet the minimum  requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56(a). If Class A waste also meets  the stability requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56(b), it is not  necessary to segregate the waste for disposal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Class B waste is waste that must meet more rigorous  requirements on waste form to ensure stability after disposal. The  physical form and characteristics of Class B waste must meet both the  minimum and stability requirements set forth in Sec. 61.56.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Class C waste is waste that not only must meet more rigorous  requirements on waste form to ensure stability but also requires  additional measures at the disposal facility to protect against  inadvertent intrusion. The physical form and characteristics of Class C  waste must meet both the minimum and stability requirements set forth in  Sec. 61.56.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Waste that is not generally acceptable for near-surface  disposal is waste for which form and disposal methods must be different,  and in general more stringent, than those specified for Class C waste.  In the absence of specific requirements in this part, such waste must be  disposed of in a geologic repository as defined in part 60 or 63 of this  chapter unless proposals for disposal of such waste in a disposal site  licensed pursuant to this part are approved by the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Classification determined by long-lived radionuclides. If  radioactive waste contains only radionuclides listed in Table 1,  classification shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the concentration does not exceed 0.1 times the value in  Table 1, the waste is Class A.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the concentration exceeds 0.1 times the value in Table 1 but  does not exceed the value in Table 1, the waste is Class C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the concentration exceeds the value in Table 1, the waste  is not generally acceptable for near-surface disposal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For wastes containing mixtures of radionuclides listed in Table  1, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions  rule described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Table 1 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Concentration</p><p class="depth4">Radionuclide                          curies per</p><p class="depth4">cubic meter ------------------------------------------------------------------------ C-14.....................................................           8 C-14 in activated metal..................................          80 Ni-59 in activated metal.................................         220 Nb-94 in activated metal.................................           0.2 Tc-99....................................................           3 I-129....................................................           0.08 Alpha emitting transuranic nuclides with half-life            \1\ 100</p><p class="depth4">greater than 5 years....................................

If  radioactive waste does not contain any of the radionuclides listed in  Table 1, classification shall be determined based on the concentrations  shown in Table 2. However, as specified in paragraph (a)(6) of this  section, if radioactive waste does not   contain any nuclides listed in either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the concentration does not exceed the value in Column 1, the  waste is Class A.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 1, but does  not exceed the value in Column 2, the waste is Class B.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 2, but does  not exceed the value in Column 3, the waste is Class C.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the concentration exceeds the value in Column 3, the waste  is not generally acceptable for near-surface disposal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> For wastes containing mixtures of the nuclides listed in Table  2, the total concentration shall be determined by the sum of fractions  rule described in paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth4">Table 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Concentration, curies</p><p class="depth4">per cubic meter</p><p class="depth4">Radionuclide                   ----------------------</p><p class="depth4">Col.

Practical considerations such as the effects of external</p><p class="depth4">radiation and internal heat generation on transportation, handling,</p><p class="depth4">and disposal will limit the concentrations for these wastes. These</p><p class="depth4">wastes shall be Class B unless the concentrations of other nuclides in</p><p class="depth4">Table 2 determine the waste to be Class C independent of these</p><p class="depth4">nuclides.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Classification determined by both long- and short-lived  radionuclides. If radioactive waste contains a mixture of radionuclides,  some of which are listed in Table 1, and some of which are listed in  Table 2, classification shall be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the concentration of a nuclide listed in Table 1 does not  exceed 0.1 times the value listed in Table 1, the class shall be that  determined by the concentration of nuclides listed in Table 2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the concentration of a nuclide listed in Table 1 exceeds 0.1  times the value listed in Table 1 but does not exceed the value in Table  1, the waste shall be Class C, provided the concentration of nuclides  listed in Table 2 does not exceed the value shown in Column 3 of Table  2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Classification of wastes with radionuclides other than those  listed in Tables 1 and 2. If radioactive waste does not contain any  nuclides listed in either Table 1 or 2, it is Class A.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The sum of the fractions rule for mixtures of radionuclides. For  determining classification for waste that contains a mixture of  radionuclides, it is necessary to determine the sum of fractions by  dividing each nuclide's concentration by the appropriate limit and  adding the resulting values. The appropriate limits must all be taken  from the same column of the same table. The sum of the fractions for the  column must be less than 1.0 if the waste class is to be determined by  that column. Example: A waste contains Sr-90 in a concentration of 50  Ci/m\3\ and Cs-137 in a concentration of 22 Ci/m\3\. Since the  concentrations both exceed the values in Column 1, Table 2, they must be  compared to Column 2 values. For Sr-90 fraction 50/150=0.33; for Cs-137  fraction, 22/44=0.5; the sum of the fractions=0.83. Since the sum is  less than 1.0, the waste is Class B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Determination of concentrations in wastes. The concentration of  a radionuclide may be determined by indirect methods such as use of  scaling factors which relate the inferred concentration of one  radionuclide to another that is measured, or radionuclide material  accountability, if there is reasonable assurance that the indirect  methods can be correlated with actual measurements. The concentration of  a radionuclide may be averaged over the volume of the waste, or weight  of the waste if the units are expressed as nanocuries per gram.
