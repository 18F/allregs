If such statement has been used as the basis for obtaining vessel clearance, the duplicate of the certificate must be filed with Customs within the time period prescribed by Sec. 4.75.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No clearance shall be granted to any vessel carrying tallow, stearin, oleo oil, or other rendered fat derived from cattle, sheep, swine, or goats for export from the United States, which has not been inspected, passed, and marked by the United States Department of Agriculture, unless the port director is furnished with a certificate by the exporter that the article is inedible.
