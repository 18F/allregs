If the grower has acreage with 5 years of sales history and such acreage was planted more than 6 years ago, a new sales history shall be computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For growers whose acreage has 5 years of sales history and was planted 6 years ago or later, the sales history shall be computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d). For growers whose acreage has 4 years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by averaging all 4 years and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d). For growers whose acreage has 1 to 3 years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by dividing the total years sales by 4 and shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For growers with acreage with no sales history or for the first harvest of re-planted acres, the sales history will be 75 barrels per acre for acres planted or re-planted 1 year ago and first harvested in the current crop year and 156 barrels per acre for acres planted or re-planted 2 years ago and first harvested in the current crop year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In addition to the sales history computed in accordance with paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, additional sales history shall be assigned to growers with acreage planted in the last 6 years. The additional sales histories depending on the date the acreage is planted are shown in Table 1.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1--Additional Sales History Assigned to Acreage------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Additional</p><p class="depth2">current crop</p><p class="depth2">Date planted                          year sales</p><p class="depth2">history per</p><p class="depth2">acre------------------------------------------------------------------------6 years ago.............................................              495 years ago.............................................             1174 years ago.............................................             1573 years ago.............................................             1832 years ago.............................................             1561 year ago..............................................              75------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Fresh fruit sales shall be deducted from the sales histories.
