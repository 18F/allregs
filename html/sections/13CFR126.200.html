Thus, 9 employees must reside in a HUBZone.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2: A concern has 95 employees, 35% or 33.25 employees must reside in a HUBZone. Thus, 34 employees must reside in a HUBZone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Contract Performance.

The small agricultural cooperative must meet the size standard corresponding to its primary industry classification as defined in part 121 of this chapter. However, in determining such size, an agricultural cooperative is treated as a ``business concern'' and its member shareholders are not considered affiliated with the cooperative by virtue of their membership in the cooperative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Principal office. The cooperative's principal office must be located in a HUBZone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employees. At least 35% of the cooperative's employees must reside in a HUBZone.
