                                Sec.  1.58-9  Application of the tax benefit rule to the minimum tax for taxable years beginning prior to 1987.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. For purposes of computing the minimum tax liability  imposed under section 56 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (Code),  taxpayers are not liable for minimum tax on tax preference items that do  not reduce the taxpayer's tax liability under subtitle A of the Code for  the taxable year. In general, tax preference items that do not reduce  tax liability under subtitle A for the taxable year are those from which  no current tax benefit is derived because available credits would have  reduced or eliminated the taxpayer's regular tax liability if the  preference items had not been allowed in computing taxable income.  However, any credits that, because of such preference items, are not  needed for use against regular tax (``freed-up credits''), are required  to be reduced under the rules of paragraph (c) of this section. For  purposes of this section, a taxpayer's regular tax is the Federal income  tax liability under subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code, not including  the minimum tax imposed by section 56. Unless otherwise noted, all  references to Internal Revenue Code sections refer to the Internal  Revenue Code of 1954.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effective date. The rules of this section are effective May 5,  1992, but only as they affect tax preference items that arise in taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1976, and before January 1, 1987.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment of carryover credits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A taxpayer's  freed-up credits must be reduced by the additional minimum tax that  would have been imposed if a current tax benefit had been derived from  preference items that did not actually produce a current tax benefit.  The amount of this reduction shall be calculated in the following  manner--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the amount of freed-up credits;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the amount of tax preference items (if any) from  which a current tax benefit was derived for the taxable year  (``beneficial preferences''), and the amount of preferences from which  no current tax benefit was derived for the taxable year (``non- beneficial preferences''); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the portion of the total minimum tax on all tax  preference items for the taxable year that is attributable to the non- beneficial preferences.</p><p class="depth0">The freed-up credits are then reduced by an amount equal to such  portion of the minimum tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determine freed-up credits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To determine the freed-up  credits for the taxable year, first determine the regular tax that would  have been imposed for the taxable year if preference items had not been  allowed in computing taxable income (``non-preference regular tax''). In  the case of a taxpayer with the capital gain preference described in  section 57(a)(9)(B), non-preference regular tax is computed without  regard to section 1201 and without adding the section 57(a)(9)(B)  preference amount to taxable income. Second, compute the amount of  credits that would have been allowed to reduce the non-preference  regular tax. The credits available to reduce non-preference regular tax  shall include any freed-up credits from other taxable years, as reduced  under paragraph (c)(5) of this section, that are carried to the current  taxable year. Third, subtract the amount of credits that were actually  allowed to reduce the regular tax for such taxable year from the amount  of credits that would have been allowed to reduce non-preference regular  tax. The result is the amount of the freed-up credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The following examples illustrate the determination of freed-up  credits. The first two examples assume that the foreign tax credits  being used do not exceed the limitation under section 904.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 1982 Corporation B has $17.6 million dollars in  foreign tax credits available for the taxable year. If preference items  were not allowed in determining regular tax, the regular tax would have  been $10.2 million and foreign tax credits used to reduce regular tax  would have been $10.2 million. Because of tax preference items, however,  B's regular tax is $6.3 million and the amount of foreign tax credits  actually used to reduce the regular tax is $6.3 million. The amount of  freed-up foreign tax credits is $3.9 million ($10.2 million minus $6.3  million).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 of paragraph  (c)(2)(ii) of this section except that Corporation B has $7.2 million  dollars in foreign tax credits. If preference items were not allowed,  the non-preference regular tax would have been $10.2 million and the  foreign tax credits used to reduce the regular tax would have been $7.2  million. Because of tax preference items, however, B's regular tax is  $6.3 million, and the amount of foreign tax credits actually used to  reduce the regular tax is $6.3 million. The amount of freed-up foreign  tax credits is $.9 million ($7.2 million minus $6.3 million).</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 1983 Corporation C has $500,000 of investment tax  credits available. If preference items were not allowed, non-preference  regular tax would have been $690,000 and all $500,000 of investment tax  credits would have been allowed to reduce non-preference regular tax  liability. Because of tax preferences, however, C's actual regular tax  is $439,750. As a result of the limitation under section 38(c), only  $377,537 of the investment tax credits are allowed to reduce the actual  regular tax. Freed-up credits are $122,463 ($500,000 minus $377,537).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 1984 Corporation B has ordinary income of $20,000 and  net section 1201 gain of $300,000, none of which is attributable to  foreign sources. B has no other items of tax preference in 1984. B's  non-preference regular tax for 1984 is $126,950, the amount of tax that  would be imposed without regard to section 1201.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of beneficial and non-beneficial preferences--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  In general. The amount of tax preferences from which a current tax  benefit is derived (``beneficial preferences'') and the amount from  which no current tax benefit is derived (``non-beneficial preferences'')  for the taxable year are determined as set forth below.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Regular tax liability is the same regardless of preference  items. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the taxpayer's tax liability (after credits) would be the  same regardless of whether preference items were allowed to reduce  taxable income, then all of the taxpayer's preference items are non- beneficial preference items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The following example illustrates the rule set forth in  paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. This example assumes that  foreign tax credits being used do not exceed the limitation under  section 904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1982 Corporation B has $17.6 million dollars in  foreign tax credits available for the taxable year. If preference items  were not allowed in determining regular tax, the regular tax would have  been $10.2 million and foreign tax credits used to reduce regular tax  would have been $10.2 million. Because of tax preference items, however,  B's regular tax is $6.3 million and the amount of foreign tax credits  actually used to reduce the regular tax is $6.3 million. The amount of  freed-up foreign tax credits is $3.9 million ($10.2 million minus $6.3  million).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total amount of B's tax preference items is $8.4 million.  B's non-preference regular tax is $10.2 million and, reduced by foreign  tax credits, is zero. B's actual regular tax is $6.3 million and,  reduced by foreign tax credits, is zero. Since the amount of credits  that would have been allowed to offset the non-preference regular tax  would have reduced such tax to an amount ($0) equal to the actual  regular tax liability ($0), B received a tax benefit from none of the  $8.4 million of tax preferences and therefore all of these preferences  are non-beneficial preferences.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Regular tax liability differs because of preference items. If  tax liability (after credits) is less because preference items are  allowed to reduce taxable income, then some of these preference items  have provided a current tax benefit. In such cases, the amount of  beneficial and non-beneficial preferences are determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Non-beneficial preferences. (1) The non-beneficial preferences  are determined by converting the freed-up credits for such taxable year  into an amount of taxable income. To make this conversion, freed-up  credits are ``grossed up'' (i.e., divided by the regular tax marginal  rate at which such credits would have offset non-preference regular tax)  to determine the amount of tax preferences that freed up such credits.  For purposes of this calculation, the 5-percent addition to tax provided  by section 11(b) shall be included in determining the marginal rate. The  aggregate of these grossed-up amounts is the total amount of non-   beneficial preferences for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The freed-up credits shall be grossed up beginning at the lowest  marginal tax rate that would have applied to the additional taxable  income arising if tax preferences were not allowed. Thus, the marginal  tax rates at which the actual regular tax was imposed shall not be taken  into account in grossing up freed-up credits, even if all or a portion  of such tax is not offset by credits because of limitations on the  allowance of such credits (such as the section 904 limit on foreign tax  credits or the section 38(c) limit on investment tax credits). For  example, if the first dollar of additional non-preference taxable income  would have been taxed at a rate of 46 percent, then freed-up credits  shall be grossed up at 46 percent, even if regular tax imposed on  taxable income at a 40-percent rate was not offset by credits because of  the limitations on investment tax credits under section 38(c). See  Examples 1 and 2 in paragraph (d) of this section for illustrations of  the gross up of freed-up credits in cases where limitations apply to the  amount of credit allowed to offset actual regular tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The following example illustrates the gross up of freed-up  credits to determine non-beneficial preferences. This example assumes  that foreign tax credits being used do not exceed the limitation under  section 904.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation L has the following items for the 1985  taxable year:  Actual taxable income...............................  ........   $90,000 Regular tax.........................................  ........    21,750 Available credits:</p><p class="depth0">Foreign tax credits for 1985......................   $15,000</p><p class="depth0">Foreign tax credits carried forward from 1984.....    25,000</p><p class="depth0">Investment tax credits carried forward from 1984..    20,000</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">........    60,000 Credit allowed to offset actual regular tax:</p><p class="depth0">Foreign tax credits for 1985......................    15,000</p><p class="depth0">Foreign tax credits carried forward from 1984.....     6,750</p><p class="depth0">----------</p><p class="depth0">........    21,750 Actual regular tax liability........................  ........         0 Preferences.........................................  ........   110,000 Taxable income for 1985 determined as though          ........   200,000</p><p class="depth0">preferences were not allowed.......................

Since the entire amount of B's tax preferences are non- beneficial preferences, the minimum tax of $1,258,500 that would be  imposed on the total tax preferences is the credit reduction amount.  Thus, B's $3.9 million of freed-up foreign tax credits is reduced by  $1,258,500. The foreign tax credit carryforward from 1982 is  $10,041,500. This amount is the sum of $2,641,500 (the freed-up foreign  tax credit of $3,900,000, reduced by the credit reduction amount of  $1,258,500), plus $7.4 million (the foreign tax credit that would have  been carried over even if tax preference items had not been allowed).   However, if the taxpayer has more than one type of freed-up credit, or  the taxpayer's freed-up credits are from more than one taxable year,  then the credit reduction amount must be allocated under the exact  method described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, unless an  election is made under paragraph (c)(5)(iii) of this section to use the  simplified method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exact method. For each type of freed-up credits and for each  taxable year within such type from which any such credits are earned,  the amount of credit reduction shall be equal to the amount of minimum  tax attributable to the non-beneficial preferences that freed up the  credits for that type and taxable year. The amount of the credit  reduction is computed by multiplying the amount of non-beneficial  preferences which freed up credits for each type and taxable year by the  minimum tax rate. For purposes of this computation, if the amount of the  taxpayer's minimum tax exemption for the taxable year (as determined  under section 56(a)) exceeds the amount of the taxpayer's beneficial  preferences, such excess exemption shall reduce the amount of non- beneficial preferences to be multiplied by the minimum tax rate. The  non-beneficial preferences shall be reduced by any such excess exemption  in the same order in which the credits that were freed up by such  preferences would have been allowed to offset tax. Thus, for example,  any excess exemption shall first reduce non-beneficial preferences that  freed up foreign tax credits. Any such excess exemption remaining after  reducing non-beneficial preferences that freed up foreign tax credits to  zero would then be used to reduce the non-beneficial preferences that  freed up investment tax credits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Simplified method--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Description of method. In lieu of the  exact credit reduction method described in paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this  section, taxpayers may elect to use the simplified credit reduction  method. Under the simplified credit reduction method, the amount of  freed-up credits for each type of credit and for each taxable year in  which such credit is earned is multiplied by a fraction. The numerator  of the fraction is the total credit reduction amount as determined in  paragraph (c)(4)(i)(C) of this section. The denominator is the total  amount of freed-up credits as determined in paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this  section. The product of this multiplication is the amount of credit  reduction for each type and taxable year of freed-up credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Election to use simplified method. A taxpayer may elect to use  the simplified credit reduction method for all taxable years to which  this section applies by attaching a statement indicating such an  election on the amended Federal income tax return or returns applying  the adjustments of this section. If an election is made for any taxable  year, it must be made for all taxable years. Once an election has been  made, it can be revoked only with the permission of the Commissioner.  Similarly, once returns have been filed applying the exact credit  reduction method, an election to apply the simplified method can be made  only with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Effect of credit reduction on credit carryovers. Under both the  exact method and the simplified method, the determination of credit  carryovers to other taxable years is made on the basis of freed-up  credits remaining after such reduction, plus any other unused credits.  Thus, an amount of freed-up credits that is equal to the credit  reduction amount shall not be allowed to reduce tax liability in any  taxable year. Such disallowance is without regard to whether such  credits would otherwise be allowed as a carryover. The freed-up credits,  as reduced under this paragraph (c)(5), shall be carried over or carried  back in applying this section in a carryover or carryback year. No  minimum tax liability shall be due with respect to the non-beneficial  preferences for any taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples.

Corporation D places property in service in 1983 that  generates investment tax credits of $10,000. D earns no other investment  tax credits in 1983. None of the investment tax credits are used to  reduce tax liability in 1983 or any prior years. In 1984, D uses $1,000  of this credit to reduce regular tax liability. In addition, D has items  of tax preferences in 1984. However, under section 58(h), D is not  liable for minimum tax on any of these preference items because none of  these preference items produces a tax benefit in 1984. As a result, an  adjustment is made under the provisions of Sec.  1.58-9 and the  investment tax credit carryforward from 1983 is reduced by $4,000. Thus,  D has an investment tax credit carryforward of $5,000 that is  attributable to the property placed in service in 1983. In 1986, the  property is disposed of and the investment tax credits earned in 1983  are recomputed as required under section 47. This recomputation results  in a reduction of $6,000 of the investment tax credits earned in 1983. D  must now adjust its 1983 investment tax credit carryforward under  section 47(a)(6) by reducing this carryforward to zero. In addition, D  has an additional tax liability of $1,000 for 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Period of limitations; adjustments to tax liability.

Therefore, these adjustments  generally apply for purposes of assessing deficiencies and refunding any  overpayment of tax for all years for which the period of limitations has  not expired regardless of whether the period of limitations has expired  for the taxable year in which the non-beneficial preferences arose.  However, the adjustments of this section do not apply to reduce  otherwise allowable credits that were freed up by such non-beneficial  preferences where:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer paid minimum tax on all tax preference items  arising in the taxable year in which the non-beneficial preferences  arose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer has not made a claim for a credit or refund for  such minimum tax; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The period of limitations for claiming a credit or refund  under section 6511 has expired for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Further, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> the taxpayer never paid minimum tax attributable to non- beneficial preferences;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> credits that were freed up by such preferences were used to  reduce tax liability for a taxable year for which the period of  limitations has expired; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> credits so used exceed the amount of credits that would have  been available if the credit reduction required under this section with  respect to such preferences had been made,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Then, the taxpayer shall be liable for the minimum tax equal to  the amount of credits so used, provided the period of limitations has  not expired for the taxable year in which preferences arose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Claims for credit or refund. A taxpayer may claim a credit or  refund of minimum tax that was made on non-beneficial preferences.  However, such a claim for a credit or refund shall be disallowed to the  extent that the taxpayer has reduced tax liability in a taxable year for  which the period of limitations has expired by using freed-up credits in  excess of the amount that would have been available if the credit  reduction required under this section had been made. Such claim must be  made by filing an amended return for the taxable year for which such  minimum tax was paid. Further, if a claim for credit or refund is filed,  amended returns must also be filed for any taxable year for which tax  liability would be affected as a result of the reduction, under this  section, of credits freed up by such non-beneficial preferences. See  section 6511 and the regulations thereunder regarding the period of  limitations for claiming a credit or refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Carryovers of foreign tax credit to taxable years after 1986. In  the case of foreign tax credit carryforwards to taxable years beginning  after December 31, 1986, reductions in such credits required under this  section shall apply for purposes of computing the alternative minimum  tax foreign tax credit under section 59(a) of the Internal Revenue Code  of 1986 as well as for purposes of computing the foreign tax credit for  regular tax purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Credit Carrybacks. If credit carrybacks increase the amount of  credits for a taxable year, the adjustments described in this section  shall be recomputed taking into account the additional credits. This  rule may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1981 corporation D has actual taxable income of  $72,500 and regular tax before credits of $15,000. In computing actual  regular taxable income, D made use of $36,739 of tax preference items,  so that D's taxable income determined as though preference were not  allowed would be $109,239. D's non-preference regular tax before credits  is $30,000. D earns $25,000 of foreign tax credits in 1981, none of  which exceed the limitation under section 904 determined using either  actual regular taxable income or the non-preference taxable income.  These credits reduce actual regular tax to zero ($0) and would have  reduced non-preference regular tax to $5,000 ($30,000 minus $25,000).  Thus, D has freed-up foreign tax credits from 1981 of $10,000 ($25,000  minus $15,000). Pursuant to the adjustments required under this section,  D determines that its credit reduction amount is $3,843 and reduces its  freed-up credit (and its credit carryover) from 1981 to $6,157 ($10,000  minus $3,843). D also pays minimum tax of $167 on $11,114 of beneficial  preferences (($11,114 minus $10,000) multiplied by .15).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In 1982 D earns additional foreign tax credits. After  application of the foreign tax credit carryback rules, D would have  $5,000 of 1982 foreign tax credits available for use in   1981. D must recalculate the adjustments required under this section by  treating $5,000 of foreign tax credit from 1982 as carried back and  (assuming that these credits do not exceed the limitation under section  904) used to reduce non-preference regular tax liability in 1981 to zero  ($0). That is, $5,000 of the foreign tax credits earned in 1982 are  treated as credits freed up because of D's tax preference items in 1981.  Pursuant to the rules set forth herein, D must take into account the  foreign tax credits from both 1981 and 1982 in determining to what  extent a tax benefit was derived from the preference items used to  determine actual regular tax liability in 1981 and in computing the  credit reduction amount. When the $5,000 of foreign tax credits from  1982 are considered, all preferences become non-beneficial preferences,  and the credit reduction amount is $4,010. Assuming that D elects the  simplified method, the 1981 freed-up credits and the 1982 freed-up  credits will each be reduced by the following percentage: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.155   The 1981 freed-up foreign tax credits of $10,000 are thus reduced by  $2,673 ($10,000 multiplied by .2673), to $7,327 and the 1982 freed-up  foreign tax credits of $5,000 are reduced by $1,334 ($5,000 multiplied  by .2673) to $3,666. D also files a claim for credit or refund of the  $167 of minimum tax paid in 1981.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 1985 corporation E's non-preference regular taxable  income was $25,000. E had no available credits. It paid zero in regular  tax, however, because of $25,000 in preference items. E paid $2,250 of  minimum tax on these preferences (($25,000 minus $10,000) multiplied by  .15). In 1986, E has additional investment tax credits. After  application of the investment tax credit carryback rules, E would have  $1,000 investment tax credit from 1986 available for use in 1985. E must  recompute the adjustments required under this section by treating $1,000  of these 1986 investment tax credits as carried back and used to reduce  non-preference regular tax liability for 1985. Pursuant to the rules of  this section, all of these $1,000 of credits are freed-up credits. Non- beneficial preferences are $6,667 ($1,000 grossed up at a 15 percent  regular tax rate). Beneficial preferences are $18,333 ($25,000 minus  $6,667). Minimum tax on all preferences would be $2,250 (($25,000 minus  $10,000) multiplied by .15); minimum tax on beneficial preferences would  be $1,250 (($18,333 minus $10,000) multiplied by .15). Minimum tax  attributable to the non-beneficial preferences is thus $1,000 ($2,250  minus $1,250), which is the credit reduction amount. E thus reduces the  $1,000 of credits carried back to 1985 to zero. Under the rules of this  section, the amount of minimum tax due for 1985 is redetermined. It is  equal to the minimum tax on beneficial preferences, which, as described  above, is $1,250. Because E paid minimum tax of $2,250 in 1985, E files  a claim for credit or refund for $1,000 of the minimum tax paid in 1985.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of net operating losses.
