An applicant for Federal financial assistance to  which this part applies shall submit an assurance on a form specified by  the Secretary, that the program or activity will be operated in  compliance with this part. An applicant may incorporate these assurances  by reference in subsequent applications to the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of obligations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of Federal financial  assistance extended in the form of real property or to provide real  property or structures on the property, the assurance will obligate the  recipient or, in the case of a subsequent transfer, the transferee, for  the period during which the real property or structures are used for the  purposes for which Federal financial assistance is extended or for  another purpose involving the provision of similar services or benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where no transfer of property is involved but property is  purchased or improved with Federal financial assistance, the recipient  shall agree to include the covenant described in paragraph (c)(1) of  this section in the instrument effecting or recording any subsequent  transfer of the property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where Federal financial assistance is provided by the Department  in the form of real property or interest in real property, the covenant  shall also include a condition coupled with a right to be reserved by  the Department to revert title to the property in the event of a breach  of the covenant. If a transferee of real property proposes to mortgage  or otherwise encumber the real property as security for financing  construction of new, or improvement of existing facilities on the  property for the purposes for which the property was transferred, the  Secretary may, upon request of the transferee and if necessary to  accomplish such financing and upon such conditions as the Secretary  deems appropriate, agree to forbear the exercise of such right to revert  title for so long as the lien of such mortgage or other encumbrance  remains effective.</p>
