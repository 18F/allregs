This section also applies to all complaints  alleging a violation of the agency's responsibility to procure  electronic and information technology under section 508 whether filed by  members of the public or EEOC employees or applicants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Commission shall process complaints alleging violations of  section 504 with respect to employment according to the procedures  established by EEOC in 29 CFR part 1614 pursuant to section 501 of the  Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791). With regard to employee  claims concerning agency procurements made in violation of section 508,  the procedures set out in paragraphs (d) through (m) of this section  shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsibility for implementation and operation of this section  shall be vested in the Director, Office of Equal Opportunity (Director  of OEO).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing a complaint. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person who believes that he or she  has been subjected to discrimination prohibited by this part or that the  agency's procurement of electronic and information technology has  violated section 508, or authorized representative of such person, may  file a complaint with the Director of OEO. Any person who believes that  any specific class of persons has been subjected to discrimination  prohibited by this part and who is a member of that class or the  authorized representative of a member of that class may file a complaint  with the Director. A charge on behalf of a person or member of a class  of persons claiming to be aggrieved may be made by any person, agency or  organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where and when to file. Complaints shall be filed with the  Director of OEO within one hundred and eighty calendar days of the  alleged acts of discrimination. A complaint shall be deemed filed on the  date it is postmarked, or, in the absence of a postmark, on the date it  is received in the Office of the Director. The Commission shall extend  the time period for filing a complaint upon a showing of good cause. For  example, the Commission shall extend this time limit if a complainant  shows that he or she was not notified of the time limits and was not  otherwise aware of them, or that he or she was prevented by  circumstances beyond his or her control from submitting the matter  within the time limits. A technically incomplete complaint shall be  deemed timely if the complainant cures any defect upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acceptance of complaint. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission shall accept a  complete complaint that is filed in accordance with paragraph (d) of  this section and over which it has jurisdiction.

The Commission shall extend  this time for good cause when a complainant shows that he or she was not  notified of the prescribed time limit and was not otherwise aware of it  or that circumstances beyond his or her control prevented the filing of  an appeal within the prescribed time limit. An appeal shall be deemed  filed on the date it is postmarked, or, in the absence of a postmark, on  the date it is received by the Chair at EEOC headquarters. It should be  clearly marked ``Appeal of section 504 decision'' or ``Appeal of section  508 decision'' and should contain specific objections explaining why the  person believes the initial decision was factually or legally wrong.  Attached to the appeal letter should be a copy of the initial decision  being appealed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Timely appeals shall be decided by the Chair of the Commission  unless the Commission determines that an appeal raises a policy issue  which should be addressed by the full Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Chair will draft a decision within 30 days of receipt of an  appeal and circulate it to the Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Commissioner believes an appeal raises a policy issue that  should be addressed by the full Commission, he or she shall so inform  the Chair by notice in writing within ten calendar days of the  circulation of the draft decision on appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Chair does not receive such written notice, the decision  on appeal shall be issued.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Chair receives written notice as described in  subparagraph (2), the Commission shall resolve the appeal through a  vote.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The Commission shall notify the complainant of the results of  the appeal within ninety calendar days of the receipt of the appeal from  the complainant.
