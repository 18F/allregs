                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An organization that participates in programs and activities  supported by direct USDA assistance programs shall not discriminate  against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the  basis of religion or religious belief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Organizations that receive direct USDA assistance under any USDA  program may not engage in inherently religious activities, such as  worship, religious instruction, or proselytization, as part of the  programs or services supported with direct USDA assistance. If an  organization conducts such activities, the activities must be offered  separately, in time or location, from the programs or services supported  with direct assistance from USDA, and participation must be voluntary  for beneficiaries of the programs or services supported with such direct  assistance. These restrictions on inherently religious activities do not  apply where USDA funds or benefits are provided to religious  organizations as a result of a genuine and independent private choice   of a beneficiary or through other indirect funding mechanisms, provided  the religious organizations otherwise satisfy the requirements of the  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nothing in paragraphs (a) or (b) shall be construed to prevent  religious organizations that receive USDA assistance under the Richard  B. Russell National School Lunch Act, 42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq., the Child  Nutrition Act of 1966, 42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq., or USDA international  school feeding programs from considering religion in their admissions  practices or from imposing religious attendance or curricular  requirements at their schools.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct USDA assistance may be used for the acquisition,  construction, or rehabilitation of structures only to the extent that  those structures are used for conducting USDA programs and activities  and only to the extent authorized by the applicable program statutes and  regulations. Direct USDA assistance may not be used for the acquisition,  construction, or rehabilitation of structures to the extent that those  structures are used by the USDA funding recipients for inherently  religious activities. Where a structure is used for both eligible and  inherently religious activities, direct USDA assistance may not exceed  the cost of those portions of the acquisition, construction, or  rehabilitation that are attributable to eligible activities in  accordance with the cost accounting requirements applicable to USDA  funds. Sanctuaries, chapels, or other rooms that an organization  receiving direct assistance from USDA uses as its principal place of  worship, however, are ineligible for USDA-funded improvements.  Disposition of real property after the term of the grant or any change  in use of the property during the term of the grant is subject to  government-wide regulations governing real property disposition (see 7  CFR parts 3015, 3016 and 3019).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any use of direct USDA assistance funds for equipment, supplies,  labor, indirect costs and the like shall be prorated between the USDA  program or activity and any use for other purposes by the religious  organization in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and  guidance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the  residents of housing receiving direct USDA assistance funds from  engaging in religious exercise within such housing.</p>
