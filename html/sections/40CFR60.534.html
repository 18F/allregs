                            <p class="depth0">Test methods and procedures specified in this section or in appendices of this part, except as provided under Sec. 60.8(b), must be used to determine compliance with the standards and requirements for certification under Sec. Sec. 60.532 and 60.533 and for reporting carbon monoxide emissions and efficiency as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards of Sec. Sec. 60.532(a) and (b), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing according to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section. The manufacturer or manufacturer's authorized representative must submit a summary and the full test reports with all supporting information, including detailed discussion of all anomalies, whether all burn rate categories were properly achieved, any data not used in the calculations and, for any test runs not completed, the data that were collected and the reason that the test run was not completed. The burn rate for the low burn rate category must be no greater than the rate that an operator can achieve in home use and no greater than is advertised by the manufacturer or retailer. The manufacturer has the option of submitting test results obtained pursuant to either paragraph (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section to the Administrator as

specified under Sec. 60.537 as part of a request for a certification of compliance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For affected wood heaters subject to the 2015 and 2020 particulate matter emission standards of Sec. Sec. 60.532(a) and (b), the manufacturer must have an EPA-approved test laboratory conduct testing according to paragraphs (a)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section.

Four-inch filters and Teflon membrane filters or Teflon-coated glass fiber filters may be used in ASTM E2515-11.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For all tests conducted using ASTM E2515-11 (IBR, see Sec. 60.17) pursuant to this section, the manufacturer and approved test laboratory must also measure the first hour of particulate matter emissions for each test run using a separate filter in one of the two parallel trains. The manufacturer and approved test laboratory must report the test results for the first hour separately and also include them in the total particulate matter emissions per run.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The manufacturer must have the approved test laboratory measure the efficiency, heat output and carbon monoxide emissions of the tested wood heater using Canadian Standards Administration (CSA) Method B415.1-10 (IBR, see Sec. 60.17), section 13.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Douglas fir may be used in ASTM E2779-10, ASTM E2780-10 and CSA B415.1-10 (IBR, see Sec. 60.17).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The manufacturer of an affected wood heater model line must notify the Administrator of the date that certification testing is scheduled to begin by email to WoodHeaterReports@epa.gov. This notice must be received by the EPA at least 30 days before the start of testing. The notification of testing must include the manufacturer's name and physical and email addresses, the approved test laboratory's name and physical and email addresses, the third-party certifier name, the model name and number (or, if unavailable, some other way to distinguish between models), and the dates of testing. The laboratory may substitute certification testing of another affected wood heater on the original date in order to ensure regular laboratory testing operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The approved test laboratory must allow the manufacturer, the manufacturer's approved third-party certifier, the EPA and delegated state regulatory agencies to observe certification testing. However, manufacturers must not involve themselves in the conduct of the test after the pretest burn has begun. Communications between the manufacturer and laboratory or third-party certifier personnel regarding operation of the wood heater must be limited to written communications transmitted prior to the first pretest burn of the certification test series. During certification tests, the manufacturer may communicate with laboratory personnel only in writing and only to notify them that the manufacturer has observed a deviation from proper test procedures. All communications must be included in the test documentation required to be submitted pursuant to Sec. 60.533(b)(5) and must be consistent with instructions provided in the owner's manual required under Sec. 60.536(g), except to the extent that they address details of the certification tests that would not be relevant to owners or regulators.</p>
