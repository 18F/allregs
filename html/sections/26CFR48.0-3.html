                            <p class="depth0">Several sections of the regulations in this part, relating to sales  exempt from retailers or manufacturers excise tax, require the retailer  or manufacturer (as the case may be) to obtain an exemption certificate  from the purchaser to substantiate the exempt character of the sale.  Many of these sections also contain specimen forms of acceptable  exemption certificates. However, any form of exemption certificate will  be acceptable if it includes all the information required to be  contained in such a certificate by the pertinent sections of the  regulations in this part. If it contains all the required information, a  form of exemption certificate that is processed by data processing  equipment is acceptable.  [T.D. 7536, 43 FR 13516, Mar. 31, 1978.
