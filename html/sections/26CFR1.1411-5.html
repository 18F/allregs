                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A trade or business is described in this section if  such trade or business involves the conduct of a trade or business, and  such trade or business is either--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A passive activity (within the meaning of paragraph (b) of this  section) with respect to the taxpayer; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Passive activity--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A passive activity is  described in this section if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such activity is a trade or business; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such trade or business is a passive activity with respect to  the taxpayer within the meaning of section 469 and the regulations  thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of income recharacterization rules--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Income and  gain recharacterization. To the extent that any income or gain from a  trade or business is recharaterized as ``not from a passive activity''  by reason of Sec. 1.469-2T(f)(2), Sec. 1.469-2(f)(5), or Sec. 1.469- 2(f)(6), such trade or business does not constitute a passive activity  within the   meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section solely with respect to  such recharaterized income or gain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>  of this section solely with respect to such recharacterized gain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(F)</em>, then such trade or business constitutes a  passive activity within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this  section solely with respect to such recharacterized income or gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the principles of  paragraph (b)(1) of this section and the ordinary course of a trade or  business exception in Sec. 1.1411-4(b). In each example, unless  otherwise indicated, the taxpayer uses a calendar taxable year, the  taxpayer is a United States citizen, and Year 1 and all subsequent years  are taxable years in which section 1411 is in effect:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Rental activity. A, an unmarried individual, rents a  commercial building to B for $50,000 in Year 1. A is not involved in the  activity of the commercial building on a regular and continuous basis,  therefore, A's rental activity does not involve the conduct of a trade  or business, and under section 469(c)(2), A's rental activity is a  passive activity. Because paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section is not  satisfied, A's rental income of $50,000 is not derived from a trade or  business described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. However, A's  rental income of $50,000 still constitutes gross income from rents  within the meaning of Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i) because rents are included  in the determination of net investment income under Sec. 1.1411- 4(a)(1)(i) whether or not derived from a trade or business described in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Application of grouping rules under section 469. In Year  1, A, an unmarried individual, owns an interest in PRS, a partnership  for Federal income tax purposes. PRS is engaged in two activities, X and  Y, which constitute trades or businesses, and neither of which  constitute trading in financial instruments or commodities (within the  meaning of paragraph (a)(2) of this section). Pursuant to Sec. 1.469-4,  A has properly grouped X and Y together as one activity (the grouped  activity). A participates in X for more than 500 hours during Year 1 and  would be treated as materially participating in activity X within the  meaning of Sec. 1.469-5T(a)(1) if A's material participation were  determined only with respect to activity X. A only participates in Y for  50 hours during Year 1. If not for the grouping of the X and Y  activities together, A would not be treated as materially participating  in Y within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-5T(a). However, pursuant to  Secs. 1.469-4 and 1.469-5T(a)(1), A materially participates in the  grouped activity. Therefore, for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of  this section, neither X nor Y is a passive activity with respect to A.  Accordingly, with respect to A, neither X nor Y is a trade or business  described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Application of the rental activity exceptions. B, an  unmarried individual, is a partner in PRS, which is engaged in an  equipment leasing activity. The average period of customer use of the  equipment is seven days or less (and therefore meets the exception in  Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)). B materially participates in the equipment  leasing activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-5T(a)). The equipment  leasing activity constitutes a trade or business. In Year 1, B has  modified adjusted gross income (as defined in Sec. 1.1411-2(c)) of  $300,000, all of which is derived from PRS. All of the income from PRS  is derived in the ordinary course of the equipment leasing activity, and  all of PRS's property is held in the equipment leasing activity. Of B's  allocable share of income from PRS, $275,000 constitutes gross income  from rents (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i)). While  $275,000 of the gross income from the equipment leasing activity meets  the definition of rents in Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i), the activity meets  one of the exceptions to rental activity in Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii) and  B materially participates in the activity. Therefore, the trade or  business is not a passive activity with respect to B for purposes of  paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Because the rents are derived in  the ordinary course of a trade or business not described in paragraph  (a) of this section, the ordinary course of a trade or business  exception in Sec. 1.1411-4(b) applies, and the rents are not described  in Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i). Furthermore, because the equipment leasing  trade or business is not a trade or business described in paragraph  (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section, the $25,000 of other gross income is  not net investment income under Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(ii). However, the  $25,000 of other gross income may be net investment   income by reason of section 1411(c)(3) and Sec. 1.1411-6 if it is  attributable to PRS's working capital. Finally, gain or loss from the  sale of the property held in the equipment leasing activity will not be  subject to Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(iii) because, although it is attributable  to a trade or business, it is not a trade or business to which the  section 1411 tax applies.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Application of section 469 and other gross income under  Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(ii). Same facts as Example 3, except B does not  materially participate in the equipment leasing trade or business and  therefore the trade or business is a passive activity with respect to B  for purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. Accordingly, the  $275,000 of gross income from rents is described in Sec. 1.1411- 4(a)(1)(i) because the rents are derived from a trade or business that  is a passive activity with respect to B. Furthermore, the $25,000 of  other gross income from the equipment leasing trade or business is  described in Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(ii) because the gross income is derived  from a trade or business described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.  Finally, gain or loss from the sale of the property used in the  equipment leasing trade or business is subject to Sec. 1.1411- 4(a)(1)(iii) because the trade or business is a passive activity with  respect to B, as described in paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. Application of the portfolio income rule and section 469.  C, an unmarried individual, is a partner in PRS, a partnership engaged  in a trade or business that does not involve a rental activity. C does  not materially participate in PRS within the meaning of Sec. 1.469- 5T(a). Therefore, the trade or business of PRS is a passive activity  with respect to C for purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section. C's  $500,000 allocable share of PRS's income consists of $450,000 of gross  income from a trade or business and $50,000 of gross income from  dividends and interest (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i))  that is not derived in the ordinary course of the trade or business of  PRS. Therefore, C's $500,000 allocable share of PRS's income is subject  to section 1411. C's $50,000 allocable share of PRS's income from  dividends and interest is subject to Sec. 1.1411-4(a)(1)(i) because the  share is gross income from dividends and interest that is not derived in  the ordinary course of a trade or business (that is, the ordinary course  of a trade or business exception in Sec. 1.1411-4(b) is inapplicable).  C's $450,000 allocable share of PRS's income is subject to Sec. 1.1411- 4(a)(1)(ii) because it is gross income from a trade or business that is  a passive activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective/applicability date. This section applies to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2013. However, taxpayers may apply  this section to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2012, in  accordance with Sec. 1.1411-1(f).
