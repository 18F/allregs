If the  election is to subscribe to the uniform plan, and the annuity or  compensation is suspended, or the annuity is waived to the extent that  the retired employee's share of the cost cannot be withheld,  withholdings and Government contributions are suspended, but the  subscription continues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the waiver or suspension covers 3 months or less, Government  contributions and withholdings for the period of waiver or suspension  shall be made when annuity payment is resumed. If the waiver or  suspension covers more than 3 months, the retired employee's election is  terminated effective at the end of the third month of waiver or  suspension. A terminated election is renewed when annuity or  compensation payment is resumed. When a terminated election is renewed  pursuant to this paragraph, withholdings and Government contributions  shall be made for the first 3 months of the waiver or suspension.  Withholdings and Government contributions shall be made for annuity or  compensation accruing after the election is renewed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If title of a retired employee to annuity or compensation is  terminated, his eligibility under this part is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the eligibility of a retired employee is terminated and other  members of the same family continue to be eligible under this part, the  election of the former retired employee continues for the remainder of  the family unless and until changed in accordance with Sec. 891.202.</p>
