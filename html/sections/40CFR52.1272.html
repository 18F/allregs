                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With the exceptions set forth in this subpart, the Administrator approves Mississippi's plan for the attainment and maintenance of the national standards under section 110 of the Clean Air Act. Furthermore, the Administrator finds that the plan satisfies all requirements of part D, title 1, of the Clean Air Act as amended in 1977.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disapproval. Submittal from the State of Mississippi, through the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) on May 29, 2012, and July 26, 2012, to address the Clean Air Act (CAA) section 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) for the 2008 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards concerning state board majority requirements respecting significant portion of income. EPA is disapproving MDEQ's submittal with respect to section 128(a)(1) because a majority of board members may still derive a significant portion of income from persons subject to permits or enforcement orders issued by the Mississippi Boards, therefore, its current SIP does not meet the section 128(a)(1) majority requirements respecting significant portion of income for the 2008 8-hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disapproval. With respect to the significant portion of income requirement of section 128(a)(1), the provisions included in the October 11, 2012, infrastructure SIP submission did not preclude at least a majority of the members of the Mississippi Board from receiving a significant portion of their income from persons subject to permits

or enforcement orders issued by the Mississippi Boards. Because a majority of board members may still derive a significant portion of income from persons subject to permits or enforcement orders issued by the Mississippi Boards, the Mississippi SIP does not meet the section 128(a)(1) majority requirements respecting significant portion of income, and as such, EPA is today proposing to disapprove the State's 110(a)(2)(E)(ii) submission as it relates only to this portion of section 128(a)(1).
