                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 1249 provides that if gain is recognized from the sale or exchange after December 31, 1962, of a patent, an invention, model, or design (whether or not patented), a copyright, a secret formula or process, or any other similar property right (not including property such as goodwill, a trademark, or a trade brand) to any foreign corporation by any United States person (as defined in section 7701(a)(30)) which controls such foreign corporation, and if such gain would (but for the provisions of section 1249) be gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset or of property described in section 1231, then such gain shall be considered as gain from the sale or exchange of property which is neither a capital asset nor property described in section 1231. Section 1249 applies only to gain recognized in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Control. For purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, the term control means, with respect to any foreign corporation, the ownership, directly or indirectly, of stock possessing more than 50 percent of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rules for determining ownership of stock provided by section 958 (a) and (b), and the principles for determining percentage of total combined voting power owned by United States shareholders provided by paragraphs (b) and (c) of Sec. 1.957-1, shall apply.
