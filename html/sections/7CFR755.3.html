                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To be eligible for payment, producers must obtain and submit a  completed application for payment and meet other eligibility  requirements specified in this part. Producers may obtain an application  in person, by mail, or by facsimile from any county FSA office. In  addition, producers may download a copy of the application at http:// www.sc.egov.usda.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An application for payment must be submitted on a completed  application form. Applications and any other supporting documentation  must be submitted to the FSA county office serving the county where the  agricultural operation is located, but, in any case, must be received by  the FSA county office by the close of business on the last day of the  application period established by the Deputy Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> All producers who incurred transportation costs for eligible  reimbursements and who share in the risk of an agricultural operation  must certify to the information on the application before the  application will be considered complete. FSA may require the producer to  provide documentation to support all verifiable records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each producer requesting payment under this part must certify to  the accuracy and truthfulness of the information provided in their  application and any supporting documentation. All information provided  is subject to verification by FSA. Refusal to allow FSA or any other  agency of the Department of Agriculture to verify any information  provided will result in a denial of eligibility. Furnishing the  information is voluntary; however, without it program benefits will not  be approved. Providing a false certification to the Federal Government  may be punishable by imprisonment, fines and other penalties or  sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To ensure all producers are provided an opportunity to submit  actual costs for reimbursement at the actual cost rate, applicants will  have 30 days after the end of the FY to provide supporting documentation  of actual transportation costs to the FSA County Office. The actual  costs documented in supporting documentation will override previously  reported costs of eligible reimbursable costs at the fixed or set rate  made during the application period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If verifiable records are not provided to FSA, the producer will  be ineligible for payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If supporting documentation is provided within 30 days after the  end of the FY, but an application was not submitted to the applicable  FSA County Office before the end of the application period, the producer  is not eligible for payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Producers who submit applications after the application period  are not entitled to any payment consideration or determination of  eligibility. Regardless of the reason why an application is not  submitted to or received by FSA, any application received after the  close of business on such date will not be eligible for benefits under  this program.</p>
