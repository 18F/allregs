Provided other requirements of this part are met, the determination of  the acceptability of the product and the condition of the containers  shall be based on the results of an examination of a statistical sample  drawn from the consignment as provided in paragraph (a) of this section.  If the inspector determines, on the basis of the sample examination,  that the product does not meet the requirements of the Act and  regulations thereunder, the consignment shall be refused entry.
