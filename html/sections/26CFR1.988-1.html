                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 988 transaction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term ``section 988  transaction'' means any of the following transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A disposition of nonfunctional currency as defined in paragraph  (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any transaction described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  if any amount which the taxpayer is entitled to receive or is required  to pay by reason of such transaction is denominated in terms of a  nonfunctional currency or is determined by reference to the value of one  or more nonfunctional currencies.  A transaction described in this paragraph (a) need not require or permit  payment with a nonfunctional currency as long as any amount paid or  received is determined by reference to the value of one or more  nonfunctional currencies. The acquisition of nonfunctional currency is  treated as a section 988 transaction for purposes of establishing the  taxpayer's basis in such currency and determining exchange gain or loss  thereon.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Debt instruments. Acquiring a debt instrument or becoming an  obligor under a debt instrument. The term ``debt instrument'' means a  bond, debenture, note, certificate or other evidence of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> if the QBU branch's functional currency is the U.S. dollar  and the foreign taxes are claimed as a credit under section 901.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> and paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, entering  into or acquiring any forward contract, futures contract, option,  warrant, or similar financial instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Limitation for certain derivative instruments. A forward  contract, futures contract, option, warrant, or similar financial  instrument is within this paragraph (a)(2)(iii) only if the underlying  property to which the instrument ultimately relates is a nonfunctional  currency or is otherwise described in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this  section. Thus, if the underlying property of an instrument is another  financial instrument (e.g., an option on a futures contract), then the  underlying property to which such other instrument (e.g., the futures  contract) ultimately relates must be a nonfunctional currency. For  example, a forward contract to purchase wheat denominated in a  nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward contract to  purchase wheat denominated in a nonfunctional currency, or a warrant to  purchase stock denominated in a nonfunctional currency is not described  in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii). On the other hand, a forward contract to  purchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to enter into a forward  contract to purchase a nonfunctional currency, an option to purchase a  bond denominated in or the payments of which are determined by reference  to the value of a nonfunctional currency, or a warrant to purchase  nonfunctional currency is described in this paragraph (a)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Nonfunctional currency notional principal contracts--(1) In  general. The term ``similar financial instrument'' includes a notional  principal contract only if the payments required to be made or received  under the contract are determined with reference to a nonfunctional  currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)</em>, but does not include a swap referenced to a commodity or  equity index.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Effective date with respect to certain contracts. This paragraph  (a)(2)(iii) does not apply to any forward contract, futures contract,  option, warrant, or similar financial instrument entered into or  acquired on or before October 21, 1988, if such instrument would have  been marked to market under section 1256 if held on the last day of the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)-(5)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (a) of this section. The examples assume that X is a U.S.  corporation on an accrual method with the calendar year as its taxable  year. Because X is a U.S. corporation the U.S. dollar is its functional  currency under section 985. The examples also assume that section 988(d)  does not apply.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars.  On January 15, 1989, X uses the 10,000 Canadian dollars to purchase  inventory. The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section  988 transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian  dollars. The disposition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988  transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On January 1, 1989, X acquires 10,000 Canadian dollars.  On January 15, 1989, X converts the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S.  dollars. The acquisition of the 10,000 Canadian dollars is a section 988  transaction for purposes of establishing X's basis in such Canadian  dollars. The conversion of the 10,000 Canadian dollars to U.S. dollars  is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. On January 1, 1989, X borrows 100,000 British pounds  () for a period of 10 years and issues a note to the lender  with a face amount of 100,000. The note provides for  payments of interest at an annual rate of 10% paid quarterly in pounds  and has a stated redemption price at maturity of 100,000.  X's becoming the obligor under the note is a section 988 transaction  pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this section. Because X  is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of interest expense under X's  note is a section 988 transaction pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and  (2)(ii) of this section. In addition, the acquisition of the British  pounds to make payments under the note is a section 988 transaction for  purposes of establishing X's basis in such pounds, and the disposition  of such pounds is a section 988 transaction under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of  this section. See Sec. 1.988-2(b) with respect to the translation of  accrued interest expense and the determination of exchange gain or loss  upon payment of accrued interest expense.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. On January 1, 1989, X purchases an original issue for  74,621.54 British pounds () a 3-year bond maturing on  December 31, 1991, at a stated redemption price of 100,000.  The bond provides for no stated interest. The bond has a yield to  maturity of 10% compounded semiannually and has 25,378.46 of  original issue discount. The acquisition of the bond is a section 988  transaction as provided in paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(i) of this  section. The accrual of original issue discount with respect to the bond  is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of  this section. See Sec. 1.988-2(b) with respect to the translation of  original issue discount and the determination of exchange gain or loss  upon receipt of such amounts.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. On January 1, 1989, X sells and delivers inventory to Y  for 10,000,000 Italian lira for payment on April 1, 1989. Under X's  method of accounting, January 1, 1989 is the accrual date. Because X is  an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional currency  denominated item of gross receipts on January 1, 1989, for payment after  the date of accrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs  (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. On January 1, 1989, X agrees to purchase a machine from Y  for delivery on March 1, 1990 for 1,000,000 yen. The agreement calls for  X to pay Y for the machine on June 1, 1990. Under X's method of  accounting, the expenditure for the machine does not accrue until  delivery on March 1, 1990. The agreement to purchase the machine is not  a section 988 transaction. In particular, the agreement to purchase the  machine is not described in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section because  the agreement is not an item of expense taken into account under  subtitle A (but rather is an agreement to purchase a capital asset in  the future). However, the   payable that will arise on the delivery date is a section 988  transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section even  though the payable relates to a capital expenditure. In addition, the  disposition of yen to satisfy the payable on June 1, 1990, is a section  988 transaction under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. On January 1, 1989, X purchases and takes delivery of  inventory for 10,000 French francs with payment to be made on April 1,  1989. Under X's method of accounting, the expense accrues on January 1,  1989. On January 1, 1989, X also enters into a forward contract with a  bank to purchase 10,000 French francs for $2,000 on April 1, 1989.  Because X is an accrual basis taxpayer, the accrual of a nonfunctional  currency denominated item of expense on January 1, 1989, for payment  after the date of accrual is a section 988 transaction under paragraphs  (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(ii) of this section. Entering into the forward  contract to purchase the 10,000 French francs is a section 988  transaction under paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. On January 1, 1989, X acquires 100,000 Norwegian krone.  On January 15, 1989, X purchases and takes delivery of 1,000 shares of  common stock with the 100,000 krone acquired on January 1, 1989. On  August 1, 1989, X sells the 1,000 shares of common stock and receives  120,000 krone in payment. On August 30, 1989, X converts the 120,000  krone to U.S. dollars. The acquisition of the 100,000 krone on January  1, 1989, and the acquisition of the 120,000 krone on August 1, 1989, are  section 988 transactions for purposes of establishing the basis of such  krone. The disposition of the 100,000 krone on January 15, 1989, and the  120,000 krone on August 30, 1989, are section 988 transactions as  provided in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. Neither the acquisition  on January 15, 1989, nor the disposition on August 1, 1989, of the stock  is a section 988 transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. On May 11, 1989, X purchases a one year note at original  issue for its issue price of $1,000. The note pays interest in dollars  at the rate of 4 percent compounded semiannually. The amount of  principal received by X upon maturity is equal to $1,000 plus the  equivalent of the excess, if any, of (a) the Financial Times One Hundred  Stock Index (an index of stocks traded on the London Stock Exchange  hereafter referred to as the FT100) determined and translated into  dollars on the last business day prior to the maturity date, over (b)  2,150, the ``stated value'' of the FT100, which is equal to  110% of the average value of the index for the six months prior to the  issue date, translated at the exchange rate of 1=$1.50. The  purchase by X of the instrument described above is not a section 988  transaction because the index used to compute the principal amount  received upon maturity is determined with reference to the value of  stock and not nonfunctional currency.</p><p class="depth0">Example 10. On April 9, 1989, X enters into an interest rate swap  that provides for the payment of amounts by X to its counterparty based  on 4% of a 10,000 yen principal amount in exchange for amounts based on  yen LIBOR rates. Pursuant to paragraphs (a)(1)(ii) and (2)(iii) of this  section, this yen for yen interest rate swap is a section 988  transaction.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. On August 11, 1989, X enters into an option contract for  sale of a group of stocks traded on the Japanese Nikkei exchange. The  contract is not a section 988 transaction within the meaning of  Sec. 1.988-1(a)(2)(iii) because the underlying property to which the  option relates is a group of stocks and not nonfunctional currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special rules for regulated futures contracts and non-equity  options--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of  this section, paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section shall not apply to  any regulated futures contract or non-equity option which would be  marked to market under section 1256 if held on the last day of the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election to have paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section apply.  Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this section, a taxpayer may  elect to have paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section apply to regulated  futures contracts and non-equity options as provided in paragraphs  (a)(7)(iii) and (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Procedure for making the election. A taxpayer shall make the  election provided in paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section by sending to  the Internal Revenue Service Center, Examination Branch, Stop Number 92,  Kansas City, MO 64999 a statement titled ``Election to Treat Regulated  Futures Contracts and Non-Equity Options as Section 988 Transactions  Under Section 988 (c)(1)(D)(ii)'' that contains the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The taxpayer's name, address, and taxpayer identification  number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The date the notice is mailed or otherwise delivered to the  Internal Revenue Service Center;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A statement that the taxpayer (including all members of such  person's affiliated group as defined in section 1504 or in the case of  an individual all persons filing a joint return with such individual)  elects to have section   988(c)(1)(D)(i) and Sec. 1.988-1(a)(7)(i) not apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date of the beginning of the taxable year for which the  election is being made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the election is filed after the first day of the taxable  year, a statement regarding whether the taxpayer has previously held a  contract described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(i) or Sec. 1.988-1(a)(7)(i)  during such taxable year, and if so, the first date during the taxable  year on which such contract was held; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The signature of the person making the election (in the case of  individuals filing a joint return, the signature of all persons filing  such return).  The election shall be made by the following persons: in the case of an  individual, by such individual; in the case of a partnership, by each  partner separately; effective for taxable years beginning after March  17, 1992, in the case of tiered partnerships, each ultimate partner; in  the case of an S corporation, by each shareholder separately; in the  case of a trust (other than a grantor trust) or estate, by the fiduciary  of such trust or estate; in the case of any corporation other than an S  corporation, by such corporation (in the case of a corporation that is a  member of an affiliated group that files a consolidated return, such  election shall be valid and binding only if made by the common parent,  as that term is used in Sec. 1.1502-77(a)); in the case of a controlled  foreign corporation, by its controlling United States shareholders under  Sec. 1.964-1(c)(3). With respect to a corporation (other than an S  corporation), the election, when made by the common parent, shall be  binding on all members of such corporation's affiliated group as defined  in section 1504 that file a consolidated return. The election shall be  binding on any income or loss derived from the partner's share  (determined under the principles of section 702(a)) of all contracts  described in section 988(c)(1)(D)(i) or paragraph (a)(7)(i) of this  section in which the taxpayer holds a direct interest or indirect  interest through a partnership or S corporation; however, the election  shall not apply to any income or loss of a partnership for any taxable  year if such partnership made an election under section  988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) for such year or any preceding year. Generally, a  copy of the election must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax  return for the first year it is effective. It is not required to be  attached to subsequent returns. However, in the case of a partner, a  copy of the election must be attached to the taxpayer's income tax  return for every year during which the taxpayer is a partner in a  partnership that engages in a transaction that is subject to the  election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Time for making the election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Unless the  requirements for making a late election described in paragraph  (a)(7)(iv)(B) of this section are satisfied, an election under section  988 (c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section for any  taxable year shall be made on or before the first day of the taxable  year or, if later, on or before the first day during such taxable year  on which the taxpayer holds a contract described in section  988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section. The election  under section 988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section  shall apply to contracts entered into or acquired after October 21,  1988, and held on or after the effective date of the election. The  election shall be effective as of the beginning of the taxable year and  shall be binding with respect to all succeeding taxable years unless  revoked with the prior consent of the Commissioner. In determining  whether to grant revocation of the election, recapture of the tax  benefit derived from the election in previous taxable years will be  considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Late elections. A taxpayer may make an election under section  988(c)(1)(D)(ii) and paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section within 30 days  after the time prescribed in the first sentence of paragraph  (a)(7)(iv)(A) of this section. Such a late election shall be effective  as of the beginning of the taxable year; however, any losses recognized  during the taxable year with respect to contracts described in section  988(c)(1)(D)(ii) or paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section which were  entered into or acquired after October 21, 1988, and held on or before  the date on which the   late election is mailed or otherwise delivered to the Internal Revenue  Service Center shall not be treated as derived from a section 988  transaction. A late election must comply with the procedures set forth  in paragraph (a)(7)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Transition rule. An election made prior to September 21, 1989  which satisfied the requirements of Notice 88-124, 1988-51 I.R.B. 6,  shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of paragraphs (a)(7)(iii)  and (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> General effective date provision. This paragraph (a)(7) shall  apply with respect to futures contracts and options entered into or  acquired after October 21, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Special rules for qualified funds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Definition of qualified  fund. The term ``qualified fund'' means any partnership if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At all times during the taxable year (and during each preceding  taxable year to which an election under section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V)  applied) such partnership has at least 20 partners and no single partner  owns more than 20 percent of the interests in the capital or profits of  the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The principa1 activity of such partnership for such taxable year  (and each such preceding taxable year) consists of buying and selling  options, futures, or forwards with respect to commodities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> At least 90 percent of the gross income of the partnership for  the taxable year (and each such preceding year) consists of income or  gains described in subparagraph (A), (B), or (G) of section 7704(d)(1)  or gain from the sale or disposition of capital assets held for the  production of interest or dividends;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> No more than a de minimis amount of the gross income of the  partnership for the taxable year (and each such preceding taxable year)  was derived from buying and selling commodities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)(iii)(V)</em> as provided in  paragraph (a)(8)(iv) of this section applies to the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rules relating to paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this  section--(A) Certain general partners. The interest of a general partner  in the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20  percent ownership requirement of paragraph (a)(8)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section  for any taxable year of the partnership if, for the taxable year of the  partner in which such partnership's taxable year ends, such partner (and  each corporation filing a consolidated return with such partner) had no  ordinary income or loss from a section 988 transaction (other than  income from the partnership) which is exchange gain or loss (as the case  may be).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Treatment of incentive compensation. For purposes of paragraph  (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section, any income allocable to a general partner  as incentive compensation based on profits rather than capital shall not  be taken into account in determining such partner's interest in the  profits of the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Treatment of tax exempt partners. The interest of a partner in  the partnership shall not be treated as failing to meet the 20 percent  ownership requirements of paragraph (a)(5)(8)(A) of this section if none  of the income of such partner from such partnership is subject to tax  under chapter 1 of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (whether  directly or through one or more pass-through entities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Look-through rule. In determining whether the 20 percent  ownership requirement of paragraph (a)(8)(i)(A) of this section is met  with respect to any partnership, any interest in such partnership held  by another partnership shall be treated as held proportionately by the  partners in such other partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Related persons. Interests in the  partnership held by persons related to each other (within the meaning of  section 267(b) or 707(b)) shall be treated as held by one person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Predecessors.

A   partnership shall make the election provided in section  988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) by sending to the Internal Revenue Service Center,  Examination Branch, Stop Number 92, Kansas City, MO 64999 a statement  titled ``QUALIFIED FUND ELECTION UNDER SECTION 988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V)''  that contains the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The partnership's name, address, and taxpayer identification  number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The name, address and taxpayer identification number of the  general partner making the election on behalf of the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date the notice is mailed or otherwise delivered to the  Internal Revenue Service Center;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A brief description of the activity of the partnership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)(iii)(V)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The date of the beginning of the taxable year for which the  election is being made;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If the election is filed after the first day of the taxable  year, then a statement regarding whether the partnership previously held  an instrument referred to in section 988(c)(1)(E)(i) during such taxable  year and, if so, the first date during the taxable year on which such  contract was held; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The signature of the general partner making the election.

The election under section  988(c)(1)(E)(iii)(V) shall apply to the taxable year for which made and  all succeeding taxable years. Such election may only be revoked with the  consent of the Commissioner. In determining whether to grant revocation  of the election, recapture by the partners of the tax benefit derived  from the election in previous taxable years will be considered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Operative rules applicable to qualified funds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  In the case of a qualified fund, any bank forward contract or any  foreign currency futures contract traded on a foreign exchange which is  not otherwise a section 1256 contract shall be treated as a section 1256  contract for purposes of section 1256.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> of such section shall not apply).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Transition rule. An election made prior to September 21, 1989,  which satisfied the requirements of Notice 88-124, 1988-51 I.R.B. 6,  shall be deemed to satisfy the requirements of Sec. 1.988-1(a)(8)(iv)  and (v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> General effective date rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The requirements of  subclause (IV) of section 988(c)(1)(E)(iii) shall not apply to contracts  entered into or acquired on or before October 21, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In the case of any partner in an existing partnership, the 20  percent ownership requirements of subclause (I) of section  988(c)(1)(E)(iii) shall be treated as met during any period during which  such partner does not own a percentage interest in the capital or  profits of such partnership greater than 33\1/3\ percent (or, if lower,  the lowest such percentage interest of such partner during any period  after October 21, 1988, during which such partnership is in existence).  For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term ``existing  partnership'' means any partnership if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such partnership was in existence on October 21, 1988, and  principally engaged on such date in buying and selling options, futures,  or forwards with respect to commodities; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A registration statement was filed with respect to such  partnership with the Securities and Exchange Commission on or before  such date and such registration statement indicated that   the principal activity of such partnership will consist of buying and  selling instruments referred to in paragraph (a)(8)(viii)(B)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Exception for certain transactions entered into by an  individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A transaction entered into by an individual  which otherwise qualifies as a section 988 transaction shall be  considered a section 988 transaction only to the extent expenses  properly allocable to such transaction meet the requirements of section  162 or 212 (other than the part of section 212 dealing with expenses  incurred in connection with taxes).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  paragraph (a)(9) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is a U.S. citizen who therefore has the U.S. dollar as  his functional currency. On January 1, 1990, X enters into a spot  contract to purchase 10,000 British pounds () for $15,000  for delivery on January 3, 1990. Immediately upon delivery, X acquires  at original issue a pound denominated bond with an issue price of  10,000. The bond matures on January 3, 1993, pays interest  in pounds at a rate of 10% compounded semiannually, and has no original  issue discount. Assume that all expenses properly allocable to these  transactions would meet the requirements of section 212. Under  Sec. 1.988-2(d)(1)(ii), entering into the spot contract on January 1,  1990, is not a section 988 transaction. The acquisition of the pounds on  January 3, 1990, under the spot contract is a section 988 transaction  for purposes of establishing X's basis in the pounds. The disposition of  the pounds and the acquisition of the bond by X are section 988  transactions. These transactions are not excluded from the definition of  a section 988 transaction under paragraph (a)(9) of this section because  expenses properly allocable to such transactions meet the requirements  of section 212.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X is a U.S. citizen who therefore has the dollar as his  functional currency. In preparation for X's vacation, X purchases 1,000  British pounds () from a bank on June 1, 1989. During the  period of X's vacation in the United Kingdom beginning June 10, 1989,  and ending June 20, 1989, X spends 500 for hotel rooms,  300 for food and 200 for miscellaneous vacation  expenses. The expenses properly allocable to such dispositions do not  meet the requirements of section 162 or 212. Thus, the disposition of  the pounds by X on his vacation are not section 988 transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Intra-taxpayer transactions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided  in paragraph (a)(10)(ii) of this section, transactions between or among  the taxpayer and/or qualified business units of that taxpayer (``intra- taxpayer transactions'') are not section 988 transactions. See section  987 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain transfers. Exchange gain or loss with respect to  nonfunctional currency or any item described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section entered into with another taxpayer shall be realized upon an  intra-taxpayer transfer of such currency or item where as the result of  the transfer the currency or other such item--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Loses its character as nonfunctional currency or an item  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Where the source of the exchange gain or loss could be altered  absent the application of this paragraph (a)(10)(ii).  Such exchange gain or loss shall be computed in accordance with  Sec. 1.988-2 (without regard to Sec. 1.988-2(b)(8)) as if the  nonfunctional currency or item described in paragraph (a)(2) of this  section had been sold or otherwise transferred at fair market value  between unrelated taxpayers. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a  taxpayer must use the translation rate that it uses for purposes of  computing section 987 gain or loss with respect to the QBU branch that  makes the transfer. In the case of a gain or loss incurred in a  transaction described in this paragraph (a)(10)(ii) that does not have a  significant business purpose, the Commissioner, may defer such gain or  loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (a)(10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional  currency, operates through foreign branches Y and Z. Y and Z are  qualified business units as defined in section 989(a) with the LC as  their functional currency. X computes Y's and Z's income under section  987 (relating to branch transactions). On November 12, 1988, Y transfers  $25 to the home office of X when the fair market value of such amount  equals LC120. Y has a basis of LC100 in the $25. Under paragraph  (a)(10)(ii) of this section, Y realizes foreign source exchange gain of  LC20 (LC120--LC100) as the result of the $25 transfer. For purposes of  determining whether the transfer is a remittance resulting in additional  gain or loss, see section 987 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If instead Y transfers the $25 to Z, exchange gain is not  realized because the $25 is nonfunctional currency with respect to Z and  if Z were to immediately convert the $25 into LCs, the gain would be  foreign source. For purposes of determining whether the transfer is a  remittance resulting in additional gain or loss, see section 987 and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Authority to include or exclude transactions from section 988-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The Commissioner may recharacterize a transaction (or  series of transactions) in whole or in part as a section 988 transaction  if the effect of such transaction (or series of transactions) is to  avoid section 988. In addition, the Commissioner may exclude a  transaction (or series of transactions) which in form is a section 988  transaction from the provisions of section 988 if the substance of the  transaction (or series of transactions) indicates that it is not  properly considered a section 988 transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  this paragraph (a)(11).</p><p class="depth0">Example. B is an individual with the U.S. dollar as its functional  currency. B holds 500,000 Swiss francs which have a basis of $100,000  and a fair market value of $400,000 as of October 15, 1989. On October  16, 1989, B transfers the 500,000 Swiss francs to a newly formed U.S.  corporation, X, with the dollar as its functional currency. On October  16, 1989, B sells the stock of X for $400,000. Assume the transfer to X  qualified for nonrecognition under section 351. Because the sale of the  stock of X is a substitute for the disposition of an asset subject to  section 988, the Commissioner may recharacterize the sale of the stock  as a section 988 transaction. The same result would obtain if B  transferred the Swiss francs to a partnership and then sold the  partnership interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Spot contract. A spot contract is a contract to buy or sell  nonfunctional currency on or before two business days following the date  of the execution of the contract. See Sec. 1.988-2 (d)(1)(ii) for  operative rules regarding spot contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonfunctional currency. The term ``nonfunctional currency''  means with respect to a taxpayer or a qualified business unit (as  defined in section 989 (a)) a currency (including the European Currency  Unit) other than the taxpayer's or the qualified business unit's  functional currency as defined in section 985 and the regulations  thereunder. For rules relating to nonrecognition of exchange gain or  loss with respect to certain dispositions of nonfunctional currency, see  Sec. 1.988-2 (a)(1)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Spot rate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in this  paragraph, the term ``spot rate'' means a rate demonstrated to the  satisfaction of the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner  (International) to reflect a fair market rate of exchange available to  the public for currency under a spot contract in a free market and  involving representative amounts. In the absence of such a  demonstration, the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner  (International), in his or her sole discretion, shall determine the spot  rate from a source of exchange rate information reflecting actual  transactions conducted in a free market. For example, the taxpayer or  the District Director or the Assistant Commissioner (International) may  determine the spot rate by reference to exchange rates published in the  pertinent monthly issue of ``International Financial Statistics'' or a  successor publication of the International Monetary Fund; exchange rates  published by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System  pursuant to 31 U.S.C. section 5151; exchange rates published in  newspapers, financial journals or other daily financial news sources; or  exchange rates quoted by electronic financial news services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Consistency required in valuing transactions subject to section  988. If the use of inconsistent sources of spot rate quotations results  in the distortion of income, the District Director or the Assistant  Commissioner (International) may determine the appropriate spot rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of certain spot rate conventions for payables and  receivables denominated in nonfunctional currency. If consistent with  the taxpayer's financial accounting, a taxpayer may utilize a spot rate  convention determined at intervals of one quarter year or less for  purposes of computing exchange gain or loss with respect to payables and  receivables denominated in a nonfunctional currency that are incurred in  the ordinary course of business with respect to the   acquisition or sale of goods or the obtaining or performance of  services. For example, if consistent with the taxpayer's financial  accounting, a taxpayer may accrue all payables and receivables incurred  during the month of January at the spot rate on December 31 or January  31 (or at an average of any spot rates occurring between these two  dates) and record the payment or receipt of amounts in satisfaction of  such payables and receivables consistent with such convention. The use  of a spot rate convention cannot be changed without the consent of the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Currency where an official government established rate differs  from a free market rate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a currency has an official  government established rate that differs from a free market rate, the  spot rate shall be the rate which most clearly reflects the taxpayer's  income. Generally, this shall be the free market rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (d)(4).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. X is an accrual method U.S. corporation with the dollar  as its functional currency. X owns all the stock of a Country L  subsidiary, CFC. CFC has the currency of Country L, the LC, as its  functional currency. Country L imposes restrictions on the remittance of  dividends. On April 1, 1990, CFC pays a dividend to X in the amount of  LC100. Assume that the official governnent established rate is $1=LC1  and the free market rate, which takes into account the remittance  restrictions and which is the rate that most clearly reflects income, is  $1=LC4. On April 1, 1990, X donates the LC100 in a transaction that  otherwise qualifies as a charitable contribution under section 170 (c).  Both the amount of the dividend income and the deduction under section  170 is $25 (LC100 x the free market rate, $.25).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. X, a corporation with the U.S. dollar as its functional  currency, operates in foreign country L through branch Y. Y is a  qualified business unit as defined in section 989 (a). X computes Y's  income under the dollar approximate separate transactions method as  described in Sec. 1.985-3. The currency of L is the LC. X can purchase  legally United States dollars ($) in L only from the L government. In  order to take advantage of an arbitrage between the official and  secondary dollar to LC exchange rates in L:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X purchases LC100 for $60 in L on the secondary market when the  official exchange rate is S1=LC1;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X transfers the LC100 to Y;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Y purchases $100 for LC100; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Y transfers $65 ($100 less an L tax withheld of $35 on the  transfer) to the home office of X.  Under paragraph (a)(7) of this section, the transfer of the LC100 by X  to Y is a realization event. X has a basis of $60 in the LC100. Under  these facts, the appropriate dollar to LC exchange rate for computing  the amount realized by X is the official exchange rate. Therefore, X  realizes $40 ($100-$60) of U.S. source gain from the transfer to Y. The  same result would obtain if Y rather than X purchased the LC100 on the  secondary market in L with $60 supplied by X, because the substance of  this transaction is that X is performing the arbitrage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exchange gain or loss. The term ``exchange gain or loss'' means  the amount of gain or loss realized as determined in Sec. 1.988-2 with  respect to a section 988 transaction. Except as otherwise provided in  these regulations (e.g., Sec. 1.98B-5), the amount of exchange gain or  loss from a section 988 transaction shall be separately computed for  each section 988 transaction, and such amount shall not be integrated  with gain or loss recognized on another transaction (whether or not such  transaction is economically related to the section 988 transaction). See  Sec. 1.988-2 (b)(8) for a special rule with respect to debt instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Hyperinflationary currency--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule.  For purposes of section 988, a hyperinflationary currency means a  currency described in Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D). Unless otherwise  provided, the currency in any example used in Secs. 1.988-1 through  1.988-5 is not a hyperinflationary currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(D)</em>  for purposes of this paragraph (f), the following rules will apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The base period means the thirty-six calendar month period  ending on the last day of the taxpayer's (or qualified business unit's)  current taxable year. Thus, for example, if for 1996, 1997, and 1998, a  country's annual inflation rates are 6 percent, 11 percent, and 90  percent, respectively, the cumulative inflation rate for the three-year  base period is 124% [((1.06 x 1.11 x 1.90) - 1.0 = 1.24) x 100 = 124%].  Accordingly, assuming the QBU has a calendar year   as its taxable year, the currency of the country is hyperinflationary  for the 1998 taxable year. This change in the Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D)  base period shall not apply to any section 988 transaction of an entity  described in section 851 (regulated investment company (RIC)) or section  856 (real estate investment trust (REIT)). The Service may, by notice,  provide that the foregoing change in the Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) base  period does not apply to any section 988 transaction of an entity with  distribution requirements similar to a RIC or REIT.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The last sentence of Sec. 1.985-1(b)(2)(ii)(D) shall not apply  to alter the base period for purposes of this paragraph (f) in  determining whether a currency is hyperinflationary for purposes of  section 988. Accordingly, generally accepted accounting principles may  not apply to alter the base period for purposes of this paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective date. Paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall apply to  transactions entered into after February 14, 2000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Fair market value. The fair market value of an item shall, where  relevant, reflect an appropriate premium or discount for the time value  of money (e.g., the fair market value of a forward contract to buy or  sell nonfunctional currency shall reflect the present value of the  difference between the units of nonfunctional currency times the market  forward rate at the time of valuation and the units of nonfunctional  currency times the forward rate set forth in the contract). However, if  consistent with the taxpayer's method of financial accounting (and  consistently applied from year to year), the preceding sentence shall  not apply to a financial instrument that matures within one year from  the date of issuance or acquisition. Unless otherwise provided, the fair  market value given in any example used in Secs. 1.988-1 through 1.988-5  is deemed to reflect appropriately the time value of money. If the use  of inconsistent sources of forward or other market rate quotations  results in the distortion of income, the District Director or the  Assistant Commissioner (International) may determine the appropriate  rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Interaction with sections 1092 and 1256. Unless otherwise  provided, it is assumed for purposes of Secs. 1.988-1 through 1.988-5  that any contract used in any example is not a section 1256 contract and  is not part of a straddle as defined in section 1092. No inference is  intended regarding the application of section 1092 or 1256 unless  expressly stated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effective date. Except as otherwise provided in this section,  this section shall be effective for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1986. Thus, except as otherwise provided in this section,  any payments made or received with respect to a section 988 transaction  in taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986, are subject to this  section.  [T.D. 8400, 57 FR 9178, Mar. 17, 1992, as amended by T.D. 8914, 66 FR  280, Jan. 3, 2001]</p>
