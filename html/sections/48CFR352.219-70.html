The amount of credit provided by the Contracting Officer to a mentor firm for Protege firm developmental assistance costs shall be calculated on a dollar for dollar basis and reported by the mentor firm in the Summary Subcontract Report via the Electronic Subcontracting Reporting System (eSRS) at http://www.esrs.gov. The mentor firm and Protege firm shall submit to the Contracting Officer a signed joint statement agreeing on the dollar value of the developmental assistance the mentor firm provided. (For example, a mentor firm would report a $10,000 subcontract awarded to a Protege firm and provision of $5,000 of developmental assistance as $15,000 of developmental assistance.) The mentor firm may use this additional credit towards attaining its subcontracting plan participation goal under this contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The program consists of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mentor firms--large businesses that: (i) demonstrate the interest, commitment, and capability to provide developmental assistance to small business Protege firms; and (ii) have a Mentor-Protege agreement approved by HHS' OSDBU;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Protege firms--firms that: (i) seek developmental assistance; (ii) qualify as small businesses, veteran-owned small businesses, service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, or woman-owned businesses; and (iii) have a Mentor-Protege agreement approved by HHS' OSDBU; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mentor-Protege agreements--joint agreements, approved by HHS' OSDBU, which detail the specific terms, conditions, and responsibilities of the mentor-Protege relationship.</p><p class="depth3">(End of provision)
