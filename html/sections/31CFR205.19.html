                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A State must calculate Federal interest liabilities and State  interest liabilities for each Federal assistance program subject to this  subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The interest rate for all interest liabilities for each Federal  assistance program subject to this subpart A is the annualized rate  equal to the average equivalent yields of 13-week Treasury Bills  auctioned during a State's fiscal year. We provide this rate to each  State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A State must calculate and report interest liabilities on the  basis of its fiscal year. A State must ensure that its interest  calculations are auditable and retain a record of the calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> As set forth in Sec. 205.9, a Treasury-State agreement must  include the method a State uses to calculate and document interest  liabilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A State may use actual data, a clearance pattern, or statistical  sampling to calculate interest. A clearance pattern used to calculate  interest must meet the standards of Sec. 205.20. If a State uses  statistical sampling to calculate interest, the State must sample  transactions separately for each Federal assistance program subject to  this subpart A. Each sample must be representative of the pool of  transactions and be of sufficient size to accurately represent the flow  of Federal funds under the Federal assistance program, including  seasonal or other periodic variations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For the first year in which a Federal assistance program is  covered in a Treasury-State agreement, funds transfers that occur prior  to the first day of the State's fiscal year must not be included in  interest calculations and are not subject to the interest liability  provisions of this part.</p>
