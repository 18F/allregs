                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Housing of the donor dam. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Beginning at least 24 hours before  a donor dam is bred to produce embryos for importation to the United  States, the donor dam must be housed at an embryo collection unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The donor dam must remain at the embryo collection unit until  the embryos for importation into the United States have been collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After collection of embryos, the donor dam must either remain at  the embryo collection unit or be returned to the herd of origin and  remain there until all examinations and tests required by this subpart  have been completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> During the time the donor dam is in the embryo collection unit,  in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section, no  animals may be in the embryo collection unit with the donor dam unless:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> They meet the requirements of Sec. 98.15 of this subpart that  are applicable to the donor dam at that time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> They are part of the donor dam's herd of origin; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> They are serving as donor sires for the production of embryos  to be imported into the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oversight and supervision. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All procedures associated with  the production of embryos for importation into the United States,  including artificial insemination, natural breeding, and cleaning and  disinfection, must be performed under the oversight of an APHIS  veterinarian. Collecting test samples, and collecting, processing,   and storing embryos, must be supervised in person by an APHIS  veterinarian.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Officials from the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  must be given access to all areas of the embryo collection unit and the  donor dam's herd of origin during the time the donor dam is housed  there, in accordance with paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Personnel. All personnel must put on clean outer garments,  including disinfected boots, and must scrub their hands with soap and  water each time they enter the embryo collection unit and before  entering any room or area listed in Sec. 98.16 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cleaning, disinfection, and sterilization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All equipment  that comes in contact with embryos or with media used for their  collection or processing must be sterile. Equipment used for embryos  from one donor dam, or with associated media, may not be used for  embryos or associated media from any other donor dam until it has been  resterilized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All equipment that comes in contact with a donor dam's  secretions or excretions must be sterile and may not be used with any  other donor dam until it has been resterilized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Containers used for storing embryos or for shipping embryos to  the United States must be examined and found free of any organic matter  and then disinfected before the ampules or straws are placed inside.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The floor, ceiling, and walls of any room or outdoor area used  for embryo collection, and the restraining device(s) used for this  procedure, must be cleaned with soap and water and disinfected before  the room or area is used to collect embryos intended for importation to  the United States, and at least daily while in use for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The room and work surface used for processing embryos must be  kept free of insects, rodents, trash, manure, and other animal matter  and must be cleaned with soap and water and disinfected before the room  is used for embryos intended for importation to the United States, and  the work surface must be cleaned and disinfected at least daily while in  use for this purpose.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The area of the embryo collection unit used to store embryos  intended for importation to the United States must be kept free of  insects, rodents, trash, manure, and other animal matter and must be  cleaned with soap and water and disinfected before being used to store  the embryos.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The room used for cleaning and disinfecting or sterilizing  equipment used for artificial insemination or for collection,  processing, or storage of embryos must be kept free of insects, rodents,  trash, manure, and other animal matter and must be cleaned with soap and  water and disinfected before being used to prepare equipment for donors  of embryos intended for importation into the United States, and at least  daily while in use for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Media; cryogenic agent. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All media containing products of  animal origin and used for embryo collection and processing must be from  sources in the United States or Canada.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The liquid nitrogen used to freeze embryos may not have been  used previously for any other products of animal origin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Collection and processing of embryos. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If embryos are  collected in an outdoor area, they must be collected by using a closed  collection system so that the embryos are not exposed to open air until  they are inside the embryo processing room.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Embryos from donors that do not meet the requirements of Sec.  98.15 of this subpart that are applicable at the time of embryo  collection may not be in the processing room at the same time as embryos  intended for importation into the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each embryo must be washed at least 10 times. Each wash must be  accomplished by transferring the embryo into an aliquot of fresh medium  that is 100 times the volume of the embryo plus any fluid transferred  from the previous wash. No more than 10 embryos from the same flush may  be washed together. A sterile micropipette must be used for each  transfer, and the embryos must be well agitated throughout the entire  volume of the wash before the   next transfer. Embryos from different donors may not be washed together.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the last wash, each embryo must be microscopically  examined over its entire surface at not less than 50x magnification. An  embryo may not be imported into the United States unless its zona  pellucida is found to be intact and free from any adherent material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After washing and examination of the zona pellucida, embryos  must be individually packaged in sterile ampules or straws and frozen in  liquid nitrogen. The donor dam's and sire's identifications and breed,  the date of embryo collection, the name and address of the place where  the embryos were collected, and an identification number for the straw  or ampule must be recorded with indelible markings on each ampule or  straw. If any of this information is provided in code, deciphering  information must be attached to the health certificate for the embryos.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The Administrator may require additional measures to be taken in  processing embryos after collection (for example, adding trypsin to the  washes) if he or she determines that such measures are necessary to  ensure the embryos freedom from infectious agents that may cause  communicable diseases. Circumstances that may result in such additional  measures being required include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existence of communicable diseases of livestock, other than  those diseases specifically listed, in the region of origin; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A high prevalence or an increase in the incidence of a  communicable disease in the region of origin.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Preparation of test samples; tests. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All nontransferrable  embryos and unfertilized eggs from each collection of embryos intended  for importation into the United States must be pooled, frozen in liquid  nitrogen, and sent to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory  for testing under the personal supervision of an APHIS veterinarian. The  collection and last two wash fluids from the collection of embryos must  be frozen and sent to the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory  for testing under the personal supervision of an APHIS veterinarian.  Samples from different collections may not be mixed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All samples collected in accordance with paragraph (g)(1) of  this section must be tested and found negative for viral contamination.  The wash fluids also must be found negative for bacterial contamination.  The only official results for these tests will be those provided by the  Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Storage of embryos. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Frozen embryos to be imported into the  United States must be stored in a locked area or must remain in the  custody of an official veterinarian until they are sealed in accordance  with paragraph (h)(2) of this section and released for shipment to the  United States in accordance with Sec. 98.18(a) of this subpart; except  that, the embryos may be moved to a U.S. Department of Agriculture- operated animal import center in either New York, Hawaii, or Florida,  under seal and in the custody of that individual, and remain in  quarantine there until all tests and examinations required by this  subpart have been completed and all test results have been provided by  the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Containers in which embryos will be imported into the United  States must be sealed by an official veterinarian with the official seal  of the region of origin or, if the official veterinarian is an employee  of the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, with an official seal  of the United States Department of Agriculture. The seal number must be  recorded on the health certificate that accompanies the embryos to the  United States.
