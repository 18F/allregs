                            <p class="depth0">Upon petition of any researcher who claims in writing to the  Archivist that the restriction of specified materials is inappropriate  and should be removed, the archivists shall submit the pertinent  materials, or representative examples of them, to the Presidential  Materials Review Board described in Sec. 1275.46(f). The Board shall  review the restricted materials, and consult with interested Federal  agencies as necessary. To the extent these consultations require the  transfer of copies of materials to Federal officials outside the  National Archives and Records Administration, the Board shall comply  with the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1275.26 and 1275.32. As necessary  and practicable, the Board shall also seek the views of any person,  including former President Nixon, whose rights or privileges might be  adversely affected by a decision to open the materials. The Board shall  prepare a final written decision, including dissenting and concurring  opinions, as to the continued restriction of all or part of the  pertinent materials. The Board's decision shall be the final  administrative determination. The Archivist will notify the petitioner  and other interested persons of the final administrative determination  within 60 calendar days following receipt of such petition. If the  Board's decision is to open previously restricted materials, the  Archivist will comply with the notice requirements of Sec. 1275.42(b).
