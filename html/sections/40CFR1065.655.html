                                Sec.  1065.655  Chemical balances of fuel, intake air, and exhaust.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Chemical balances of fuel, intake air, and exhaust may  be used to calculate flows, the amount of water in their flows, and the  wet concentration of constituents in their flows. With one flow rate of  either fuel, intake air, or exhaust, you may use chemical balances to  determine the flows of the other two. For example, you may use chemical  balances along with either intake air or fuel flow to determine raw  exhaust flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures that require chemical balances. We require chemical  balances when you determine the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A value proportional to total work, W when you choose to  determine brake-specific emissions as described in Sec.  1065.650(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of water in a raw or diluted exhaust flow,  xH2Oexh, when you do not measure the amount of water to  correct for the amount of water removed by a sampling system. Correct  for removed water according to Sec.  1065.659.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The calculated dilution air flow when you do not measure  dilution air flow to correct for background emissions as described in  Sec.  1065.667(c) and (d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Chemical balance procedure. The calculations for a chemical  balance involve a system of equations that require iteration. We  recommend using a computer to solve this system of equations. You must  guess the initial values of up to three quantities: The amount of water  in the measured flow, xH2Oexh, fraction of dilution air in  diluted exhaust, xdil/exh, and the amount of products on a  C1 basis per dry mole of dry measured flow,  xCcombdry. You may use time-weighted mean values of  combustion air humidity and dilution air humidity in the chemical  balance; as long as your combustion air and dilution air humidities  remain within tolerances of 0.0025 mol/mol of  their respective mean values over the test interval. For each emission  concentration, x, and amount of water, xH2Oexh, you must  determine their completely dry concentrations, xdry and  xH2Oexhdry. You must also use your fuel's atomic hydrogen-to- carbon ratio, a, oxygen-to-carbon ratio, b, sulfur-to-carbon ratio, g,  and nitrogen-to-carbon ratio, d. You may calculate a, b, g, and d based  on measured fuel composition as described in paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2)  of this section, or you may use default values for a given fuel as  described in paragraph   (d)(3) of this section. Use the following steps to complete a chemical  balance:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Convert your measured concentrations such as,  xCO2meas, xNOmeas, and xH2Oint, to dry  concentrations by dividing them by one minus the amount of water present  during their respective measurements; for example:  xH2OxCO2meas, xH2OxNOmeas, and xH2Oint.  If the amount of water present during a ``wet'' measurement is the same  as the unknown amount of water in the exhaust flow, xH2Oexh,  iteratively solve for that value in the system of equations. If you  measure only total NOX and not NO and NO2  separately, use good engineering judgment to estimate a split in your  total NOX concentration between NO and NO2 for the  chemical balances. For example, if you measure emissions from a  stoichiometric spark-ignition engine, you may assume all NOX  is NO. For a compression-ignition engine, you may assume that your molar  concentration of NOX, xNOx, is 75% NO and 25%  NO2. For NO2 storage aftertreatment systems, you  may assume xNOx is 25% NO and 75% NO2. Note that  for calculating the mass of NOX emissions, you must use the  molar mass of NO2 for the effective molar mass of all  NOX species, regardless of the actual NO2 fraction  of NOX.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enter the equations in paragraph (c)(4) of this section into a  computer program to iteratively solve for xH2Oexh,  xCcombdry, and xdil/exh. Use good engineering  judgment to guess initial values for xH2Oexh,  xCcombdry, and xdil/exh. We recommend guessing an  initial amount of water that is about twice the amount of water in your  intake or dilution air. We recommend guessing an initial value of  xCcombdry as the sum of your measured CO2, CO, and  THC values. We also recommend guessing an initial xdil/exh  between 0.75 and 0.95, such as 0.8. Iterate values in the system of  equations until the most recently updated guesses are all within 1% of their respective most recently calculated values.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Use the following symbols and subscripts in the equations for  this paragraph (c):  xdil/exh = amount of dilution gas or excess air per mole of</p><p class="depth3">exhaust. xH2Oexh = amount of H2O in exhaust per mole of</p><p class="depth3">exhaust. xCcombdry = amount of carbon from fuel in the exhaust per</p><p class="depth3">mole of dry exhaust. xH2dry = amount of H2 in exhaust per amount of dry</p><p class="depth3">exhaust. xH2Ogas = water-gas reaction equilibrium coefficient.
