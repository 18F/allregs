For determining initial compliance, the organic HAP limit is based on the amount of material used during the performance test, in megagrams, rather than during the past 12 months. Calculate the limit using the megagrams of resin and gel coat applied inside the enclosure during the

three runs of the performance test and equation 1 of Sec. 63.5698.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Add the total measured emissions, in kilograms, from all three of the 1-hour runs of the performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the total emissions from the three 1-hour runs of the performance test are less than the organic HAP limit calculated in paragraph (a) of this section, then you have demonstrated initial compliance with the emission limit in Sec. 63.5698 for those operations performed in the enclosure and controlled by the add-on control device.</p>
