                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The United States Munitions List is located in 22 CFR part 121. A system of demilitarization codes has been developed and an appropriate code assigned to each Munitions List Item (MLI) to describe what, if any, restrictions or actual demilitarization requirements apply to each item. These codes, in addition to demilitarization policy and procedures for all surplus military items which are owned, procured by, or under the control of the

Department of Defense, are contained in the Defense Demilitarization Manual (DoD 4160.21-M-1). This Sec. 101-42.1102-8 applies only to MLIs and is to be used in conjunction with guidance in parts 101-42, 101-44, and 101-45.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Utilization requirements. (1) Federal agencies acquiring MLIs which require demilitarization shall perpetuate the demilitarization codes in their property records and on subsequent reports of excess personal property submitted to GSA. Demilitarization shall be a condition of transfer of excess MLIs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal agencies acquiring MLIs which require demilitarization shall perpetuate the demilitarization codes in their property records and on subsequent reports of excess personal property submitted to GSA. Demilitarization shall be a condition of transfer of excess MLIs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Utilization without demilitarization of other than classified material is authorized only under the conditions cited in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Donation requirements. (1) Donation without demilitarization of other than classified material is authorized only under the conditions cited in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Donation without demilitarization of other than classified material is authorized only under the conditions cited in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State agency requesting the transfer of donation of MLIs identified as requiring demilitarization shall include the appropriate demilitarization code on the SF 123, and a statement that the State agency will obtain from the donee a certification that prior to further disposition, demilitarization of the property shall be performed by the donee under the demilitarization instructions for the code as set forth in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1. In the case of MLIs requested for donation by service educational activities or public airports pursuant to the provisions of subparts 101-44.4 and 101-44.5 respectively, the donee shall include a statement on the SF 123 certifying that appropriate demilitarization of the property will be accomplished under the requirements of the codes before further disposition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before disposing of MLIs identified as requiring demilitarization, donees may request demilitarization instructions from GSA through the State agency if the donation was made pursuant to subpart 101-44.2. Demilitarization instructions for such items donated to public airports, under subpart 101-44.5, may be requested through the Federal Aviation Administration. Demilitarization instructions for such items donated to service educational activities under subpart 101-44.4 may be obtained directly from the Item Technical Manager within DOD for the item involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Demilitarization of property to be donated to public bodies under subpart 101-44.7 shall be accomplished in a manner to preserve so far as possible any civilian use or commercial value of the property, as prescribed in the minimum demilitarization requirements of the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sales requirements. (1) Except for sales authorized by statute, sales of ``explosives'' and ``ammunition components'' authorized by paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, or specialized sales authorized by the Secretary of Defense, MLIs identified as requiring demilitarization shall not be reported for public sale without first being demilitarized under the requirements of the assigned code in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1 or requiring demilitarization under the terms and conditions of sale. GSA will, as necessary, refer technical questions on demilitarization to the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for sales authorized by statute, sales of ``explosives'' and ``ammunition components'' authorized by paragraphs (d) (2) and (3) of this section, or specialized sales authorized by the Secretary of Defense, MLIs identified as requiring demilitarization shall not be reported for public sale without first being demilitarized under the requirements of the assigned code in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1 or requiring demilitarization under the terms and conditions of sale.

For the purpose of this section, the term explosive means any chemical compound, mixture, or device, the primary or common purpose of which is to function by explosion. The term includes, but is not limited to, dynamite and other high explosives, black powder, pellet powder, initiating explosives, detonators, safety fuses, squibs, detonating cord, igniter cord, igniters, and any other items appearing in the explosives list issued by the Secretary of the Treasury (18 U.S.C. 841(d)). The explosives list is published and revised at least annually in the Federal Register by the Director, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Department of the Treasury, as required by 27 CFR 55.23. The following procedures shall apply in any disposal of explosives:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All explosives offered for sale shall be properly identified in the offering with respect to their hazardous characteristics.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All explosives shall be labeled by the holding agency before shipment so that their hazardous or dangerous

character will be immediately evident upon inspection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Purchasers of explosives shall be required, as a condition of sale, to execute the following certification:</p><p class="depth4">It is hereby certified that the purchaser will comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws, ordinances, and regulations with respect to the care, handling, storage, shipment, resale, export, and other use of the materials, hereby purchased, and that he/she is a user of, or dealer in, said materials and will comply with all applicable Federal, State, and local laws. This certification is made in accordance with and subject to the penalties of Title 18, Section 1001, the United States Code, Crime and Criminal Procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ammunition components. The term ``ammunition components'' means ammunition or cartridge cases, primers, bullets, or propellant powder designed for use in any firearm. The transportation of primers or propellent powder is governed by the Hazardous Materials Regulations (49 CFR parts 170-189) promulgated by the Department of Transportation. Purchasers of such materials are responsible to certify, based on their own examination, that the materials are properly classified, described, packaged, marked, and labeled and are in proper condition for transportation in accordance with the Hazardous Materials Regulations. So that bidders will be notified of the special requirements concerning the purchase and transportation of usable ammunition components, the following statement shall be included in the IFBs and shall be made a part of the contract by including in it the bid form to be submitted by the bidders:</p><p class="depth3">Item No. ____ contains ammunition components offered for sale in this invitation.

Besides the requirement of subpart 101-45.9, surplus munitions list items which require demilitarization shall be abandoned or disposed of under the requirements of Sec. 101-42.406, but only after performance of demilitarization under the requirements of the assigned code in the Defense Demilitarization Manual, DoD 4160.21-M-1.</p>
