If the amount to be borrowed is $500,000 or less, the Administrator may arrange to pledge the credit of the Fund pursuant to a resolution of the Board of Trustees. If the proposed borrowing exceeds $500,000, the Administrator shall, prior to issuance of a note or other security pledging the credit of the Fund, secure the approval of the Secretary. No money may be borrowed from any of the Permittees or their affiliates.</p>
