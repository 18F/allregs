                            <p class="depth0">The application should also contain a description of the terms of  employment relating to overtime so that the Administrator can determine  how the established basic rate will be used if it is approved. For  instance, if the employees are to be paid time and one-half the basic  rate for all hours worked in excess of 35 each workweek, this should be  stated in the application. If the employees are to be paid double time  for work on Sundays the application should so state.  [20 FR 5683, Aug. 6, 1955]</p>
