Any respondent must, within 20 days of  the date of the filing of a complaint, answer the complaint. The answer  must state whether the respondent is a participant in the Board's  arbitration program, or whether the respondent is willing to arbitrate  the particular dispute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the complaint requests arbitration by a single-neutral  arbitrator instead of by an arbitration panel, the answer must contain a  statement consenting to arbitration by a single-neutral arbitrator or an  express rejection of the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The respondent may also initiate a request to use a single- neutral arbitrator instead of an arbitration panel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Absent the parties agreeing to arbitration through a single- neutral arbitrator, the Board will assign the case to arbitration by a  panel of three arbitrators as provided by Sec.  1108.6(a)-(c). The party  requesting the single-neutral arbitrator shall at that time provide  written notice to the Board and the other parties if it continues to  object to a three-member arbitration panel.

The Board will then set the  matter for arbitration, and provide a list of arbitrators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the complaint proposes a different amount of potential  liability, the answer must state whether the respondent agrees to that  amount in lieu of the $200,000 monetary award cap.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)-(e)</em>. Counterclaims are subject to the monetary award cap  provisions contained in Sec.  1108.4(b)(2)-(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Affirmative defenses. An answer to an arbitration complaint  shall contain specific admissions or denials of each factual allegation  contained in the complaint, and any affirmative defenses that the  respondent wishes to assert against the complainant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Arbitration agreement. Prior to the commencement of an  arbitration proceeding, the parties to arbitration together with the  neutral arbitrator shall create a written arbitration agreement, which  at a minimum will state with specificity the issues to be arbitrated and  the corresponding monetary award cap to which the parties have agreed.  The agreement may contain other mutually agreed upon provisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any additional issues selected for arbitration by the parties,  that are not outside the scope of these arbitration rules as explained  in Sec.  1108.2(b), must be subject to the Board's statutory authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> These rules shall be incorporated by reference into any  arbitration agreement conducted pursuant to an arbitration complaint  filed with the Board.</p>
