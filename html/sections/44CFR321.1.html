Therefore, the  facilities, machine tools, production equipment, and skilled workers  necessary to produce the wartime requirements of the Department of  Defense, Department of Energy, and the Maritime Administration shall be  maintained in a state of readiness which will facilitate their immediate  use or conversion in time of emergency, with especial emphasis on  measures to maximize the probability of continued post-attack production  of those items judged to be vital to survival and victory.</p>
