For purposes of this report, and for purposes of computing  support under this subpart, lines served using resale of the rate-of- return local exchange carrier's service pursuant to section 251(c)(4) of  the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, shall be considered lines  served by the rate-of-return carrier only and must be reported  accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A rate-of-return carrier may submit the information in paragraph  (a) of this section in accordance with the schedule in Sec. 54.1306,  even if it is not required to do so.
