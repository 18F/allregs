                            <p class="depth0">A protesting party may seek further review of a protest in lieu of review by the port director by filing, on the form prescribed in Sec. 174.25, an application for such review within the time allowed and in the manner prescribed by Sec. 174.12 for the filing of a protest. The filing of an application for further review shall not preclude a preliminary examination by the port director whose decision is the subject of the protest for the purpose of determining whether the protest may be allowed in full. If such preliminary examination indicates that the protest would be denied in whole or in part by the port director in the absence of an application for further review, however, he shall forward the protest and application for consideration in accordance with Sec. 174.26.</p>
