                            <p class="depth0">Subsection (b) of section 321, Part II, Title III, of the  Transportation Act of 1940 provides that in the case of a railroad  carrier, or a predecessor, which received a land grant to aid in the  construction of any part of its railroad, the laws relating to  compensation for certain Government transportation services shall  continue to apply as though subsection (a) of section 321 had not been  enacted unless the carrier shall file on or before September 18, 1941,  with the Secretary of the Interior, in the form and manner prescribed by  him, a release of any claim it may have to lands, interests in lands,  compensation, or reimbursement on account of lands or interests in lands  so granted, claimed to have been granted or claimed should have been  granted. Section 321 provides further that nothing therein shall be  construed as preventing the issuance of patents confirming the title to  such uncertified or unpatented lands as the Secretary of the Interior  shall find have been sold prior to September 18, 1940, to innocent  purchasers for value. Subsection (b) of section 321 authorizing the  issuance of such patents is not an enlargement of the grants, and does  not extend them to lands not already covered thereby and, therefore, has  no application to lands which for various reasons, such as mineral  character, prior grants, withdrawals, reservations, or appropriation,  were not subject to the grants. It does apply, however, to lands  selected under remedial or lieu acts supplemental to the original grants  as well as to primary and indemnity lands. Classification under section  7 of the Taylor Grazing Act of June 28, 1934 (48 Stat. 1269), as amended  by the Act of June 26, 1936 (49 Stat. 1976; 43 U.S.C. 315f), will not be  required where the sold land is such as the company was authorized by  law to select.</p>
