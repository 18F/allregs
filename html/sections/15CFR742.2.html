(1) License applications for the items described in paragraph (a) of this section will be considered on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the export or reexport would make a material contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling or use of chemical or biological weapons. When an export or reexport is deemed to make such a material contribution, the license will be denied. When an export or reexport is intended to be used in a chemical weapons or biological weapons program, or for chemical or biological weapons terrorism purposes, it is deemed to make a material contribution. The factors listed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section are among those that will be considered to determine what action should be taken on license applications for these items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following factors are among those that will be considered to determine what action should be taken on license applications for the items described in paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The specific nature of the end-use, including the appropriateness of the stated end-use;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The significance of the export and reexport in terms of its potential contribution to the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The nonproliferation credentials of the importing country, including the importing country's chemical and biological capabilities and objectives;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The extent and effectiveness of the export control system in the importing country and in any intermediary country through which the items being exported or reexported will transit or be transshipped en route to the importing country;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The risk that the items will be diverted for use in a chemical weapons or biological weapons program, or for chemical weapons or biological weapons terrorism purposes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The reliability of the parties to the transaction, including whether:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An export or reexport license application involving any such parties has previously been denied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any such parties have been engaged in clandestine or illegal procurement activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The end-user is capable of securely handling and storing the items to be exported or reexported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Relevant information about proliferation and terrorism activities, including activities involving the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons by any parties to the transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The types of assurances or guarantees against the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons that are given in a particular case, including any relevant assurances provided by the importing country or the end-user;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The applicability of other multilateral export control or nonproliferation agreements (e.g., the Chemical Weapons Convention and the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention) to the transaction; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The existence of a pre-existing contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> BIS will review license applications in accordance with the licensing policy described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section for items not described in paragraph (a) of this section that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Require a license for reasons other than short supply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Could be destined for the design, development, production, stockpiling, or use of chemical or biological weapons, or for a facility engaged in such activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> License applications for items described in paragraph (a) of this section, when destined for the People's Republic of China, will be reviewed in accordance with the licensing policies in both paragraph (b) of this section and Sec. 742.4(b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Contract sanctity. Contract sanctity dates are set forth in Supplement No. 1 to part 742. Applicants who wish that a preexisting contract be considered in reviewing their license applications must submit documentation sufficient to establish the existence of such a contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Australia Group. The Australia Group, a multilateral body that works to halt the spread of chemical and biological weapons, has developed common control lists of items specifically related to chemical and biological weapons. Australia Group members are listed in Country Group A:3 (see Supplement No. 1 to part 740 of the EAR). Controls on items listed in paragraph (a) of this section are consistent with lists agreed to in the Australia Group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> License application requirements and instructions.
