These sections were amended by the Fair Labor Standards Amendments of 1949 \2\ to provide, among other things, protection against these ``hot goods'' prohibitions

with respect to purchasers ``who acquired such goods for value without notice of such violation'' if they did so ``in good faith in reliance on'' a specified ``written assurance.''---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ Pub.

The Act does not provide that a purchaser must secure such an assurance or that a supplier must give it. The amendments confer no express authority for the Department of Labor to require the use of these assurances or to prescribe their form or content. Whether any particular written assurance affords the statutory protection to a purchaser who acquires his goods in good faith and for value without notice of an applicable violation, is left for determination by the courts. Opinions issued by the Department of Labor on this question are advisory only and represent simply the Department's best judgment as to what the courts may hold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The interpretations contained in this general statement are confined to the statutory protection accorded these purchasers in section 12(a) and section 15(a)(1) of the Act. These interpretations, with respect to this protection of purchasers, indicate the construction of the law which the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division \3\ believe to be correct and which will guide them in the performance of their administrative duties under the Act unless and until they are otherwise directed by authoritative decisions of the courts or conclude, upon re-examination of an interpretation, that it is incorrect.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ The functions of the Secretary and the Administrator under the Act are delineated in 13 FR 2195, 12 FR 6971, and 15 FR 3290.
