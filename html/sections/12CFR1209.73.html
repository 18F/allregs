                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conflict of interest in representation. No representative shall represent another person in an adjudicatory proceeding if it reasonably appears that such representation may be limited materially by that representative's responsibilities to a third person or by that representative's own interests. The presiding officer may take corrective measures at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification and waiver. If any person appearing as counsel or other representative represents two or more parties to an adjudicatory proceeding, or also represents a non-party on a matter relevant to an issue in the proceeding, that representative must certify in writing at the time of filing the notice of appearance required by Sec.  1209.72 of this part as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the representative has personally and fully discussed the possibility of conflicts of interest with each affected party and non-party; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That each affected party and non-party waives any right it might otherwise have had to assert any known conflicts of interest or to assert any non-material conflicts of interest during the course of the proceeding.</p>
