                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Fees based on reciprocity. The fees for the issuance of visas,  including official visas, to nonimmigrant nationals or stateless  residents of each foreign country shall be collected in the amounts  prescribed by the Secretary of State unless, on the basis of  reciprocity, no fee is chargeable. If practicable, fees will correspond  to the total amount of all visa, entry, residence, or other similar  fees, taxes or charges assessed or levied against nationals of the  United States by the foreign countries of which such nonimmigrants are  nationals or stateless residents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fees when more than one alien included in visa. A single  nonimmigrant visa may be issued to include all eligible family members  if the spouse and unmarried minor children of a principal alien are  included in one passport. Each alien must execute a separate  application. The name of each family member shall be inserted in the  space provided in the visa stamp. The visa fee to be collected shall  equal the total of the fees prescribed by the Secretary of State for  each alien included in the visa, unless upon a basis of reciprocity a  lesser fee is chargeable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certain aliens exempted from fees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon a basis of  reciprocity, or as provided in section 13(a) of the Headquarters  Agreement with the United Nations (61 Stat. 716; 22 U.S.C. 287, Note),  no fee shall be collected for the application for or issuance of a  nonimmigrant visa to an alien who is within a class of nonimmigrants  classifiable under the visa symbols A, G, C-2, C-3, or NATO, or B-1  issued for participation in an official observer mission to the United  Nations, or who is issued a diplomatic visa as defined in Sec. 41.26.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The consular officer shall waive the nonimmigrant visa  application and issuance fees for an alien who will be engaging in  charitable activities for a charitable organization upon the written  request of the charitable organization claiming that it will find the  fees a financial burden, if the consular officer is satisfied that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The organization seeking relief from the fees is, if based in  the United States, tax-exempt as a charitable organization under the  provisions of section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.  501(c)(3)); if a foreign organization based outside the United States in  a country having laws according recognition to charitable institutions,  that it establishes that it is recognized as a charitable institution by  that government; and if a foreign organization based in a country  without such laws, that it is engaged in activities substantially  similar to those underlying section 501(c)(3), and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The charitable activities in which the alien will engage are  specified and will be a part of, or will be related to and in support  of, the organization's provision of services, including but not limited  to health care, food and housing, job training, and similar direct  services and assistance to the poor and needy, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The request includes the location of the proposed activities,  the number and identifying data of each of the alien(s) who will be  applying for visas, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The proposed duration of the alien(s)'s temporary stay in the  United States is reasonably consistent with the charitable purpose for  which the alien(s) seek to enter the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Foreign national employees of the U. S. Government who are  travelling to the United States on official business in connection with  that employment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refund of fees. A fee collected for the issuance of a  nonimmigrant visa is refundable only if the principal officer at a post  or the officer in charge of a consular section determines that the visa  was issued in error or could not be used as a result of action taken by  the U.S. Government for which the alien was not responsible and over  which the alien had no control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Visa processing surcharge. In addition to the collection of  the fee prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, a consular officer  shall collect or ensure the collection of a surcharge for the processing  of applications for machine readable nonimmigrant visas and for machine  readable combined border crossing cards in the amount specified by the  Secretary of State from such applicants as the Secretary of State shall  designate. Such surcharge is refundable only if, as a result of action  taken by the U.S. Government for which the alien was not responsible and  over which the alien had no control, the alien's application is not  processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a consular  officer shall collect or insure the collection of a processing fee for a  machine-readable combined border crossing card and nonimmigrant visa in  an amount determined by the Secretary and set forth in 22 CFR 22.1 to be  sufficient only to cover the cost for manufacturing the combined card  and visa if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The alien is a Mexican citizen under the age of 15;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The alien is applying in Mexico; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The alien has at least one parent or guardian who has a visa  or is applying for a machine-readable combined border crossing card and  visa.
