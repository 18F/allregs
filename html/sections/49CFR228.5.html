The plant or installation could include track immediately adjacent to the plant or installation if the plant railroad leases the track from the general system railroad and the lease provides for (and actual practice entails) the exclusive use of that trackage by the plant railroad and the general system railroad for purposes of moving only cars shipped to or from the plant. A plant or installation that operates a locomotive to switch or move cars for other entities, even if solely within the confines of the plant or installation, rather than for its own purposes or industrial processes, will not be considered a plant railroad because the performance of such activity makes the operation part of the general railroad system of transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Prior time off means the amount of time that an employee has been off duty between identifiable periods of service at the behest of the railroad.</p><p class="depth0">Program edits are filters contained in the logic of an hours of service recordkeeping program that detect identifiable reporting errors made by a reporting employee at the time of data entry, and prevent the employee from submitting a record without first correcting or explaining any identified errors or anomalies.</p><p class="depth0">Quick tie-up is a data entry process used only when an employee is within 3 minutes of, or is beyond, his or her statutory maximum on-duty period, which process allows an employee to enter only the basic information necessary for the railroad to identify the beginning of an employee's statutory off-duty period, to avoid the excess service that would otherwise be incurred in completing the full record for the duty tour. The information permitted in a quick tie-up process is limited to, at a maximum:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Board placement time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relieved location, date, and time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Final release location, date, and time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Contact information for the employee during the statutory off-duty period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Request for rest in addition to the statutory minimum, if provided by collective bargaining agreement or local practice;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The employee may be provided an option to enter basic payroll information, related only to the duty tour being tied up; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Employee certification of the tie-up information provided.</p><p class="depth0">Railroad means a person providing railroad transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Railroad transportation means any form of non-highway ground transportation that runs on rails or electromagnetic guideways, including commuter or other short-haul rail passenger service in a metropolitan or suburban area, and high speed ground transportation systems that connect metropolitan areas, without regard to whether they use new technologies not associated with traditional railroads. Such term does not include rapid transit operations within an urban area that are not connected to the general railroad system of transportation.</p><p class="depth0">Regular reporting point means the permanent on-duty location of a train employee's regular assignment that is established through a job bulletin assignment (either a job award or a forced assignment) or through an employee's exercise of seniority to be placed in an assignment. The assigned regular reporting point is a single fixed location identified by the railroad, even for extra board and pool crew employees.</p><p class="depth0">Release means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a train employee,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The time within the duty tour that the employee begins an interim release;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The time that an employee completes a covered service assignment and begins another covered service assignment on a different train or job, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The time that an employee completes a covered service assignment to begin another activity that counts as time on duty (including waiting for deadhead transportation to another duty location at which the employee will perform covered service, deadheading to duty, or any other commingled service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a signal employee, the time within a duty tour that the employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completes his or her regular assigned hours and begins an off-duty period of at least one hour but less than a statutory off-duty period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Completes his or her return travel from a trouble call or other unscheduled duty and begins an off-duty period of at least one hour, but less than a statutory off-duty period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a dispatching service employee, when he or she stops performing covered service and commingled service within any 24-hour period and begins an off-duty period of at least one hour.</p><p class="depth0">Relieved time means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The actual time that a train employee stops performing a covered service assignment or commingled service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The actual time that a signal employee:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Completes his or her assigned duty hours, or stops performing covered service or commingled service, whichever is later; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stops performing covered service associated with a trouble call or other unscheduled duty outside of normally assigned duty hours.</p><p class="depth0">Reports for duty means that an employee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Presents himself or herself at the location established by the railroad at the time the railroad established for the employee to be present; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is ready to perform covered service.</p><p class="depth0">Report-for-duty time means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a train employee, the actual time that the employee is required to be present at a reporting point and prepared to start a covered service assignment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a signal employee, the assigned starting time of an employee's scheduled shift, or the time that he or she receives a trouble call or a call for any other unscheduled duty during an off-duty period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For a dispatching service employee, when the employee begins the turn-over process at or before the beginning of his or her assigned shift, or begins any other activity at the behest of the railroad during any 24-hour period in which covered service is performed.</p><p class="depth0">Reporting point means any location where an employee is required to begin or restart a duty tour.</p><p class="depth0">Seniority move means a repositioning at the behest of the employee, usually a repositioning from a regular assignment or extra board to a different regularly assigned position or extra board, as the result of the employee's selection of a bulletin assignment or the employee's exercise of seniority over a junior employee.</p><p class="depth0">Signal employee means an individual who is engaged in installing, repairing, or maintaining signal systems.</p><p class="depth0">Station, office or tower means the precise location where a dispatching service employee is expected to perform service for the railroad as defined in 49 U.S.C. 21105(b) and (c).</p><p class="depth0">Statutory off-duty period means the period of 8 or 10 consecutive hours or more time, that is the minimum off-duty period required under the hours of service laws for a train employee or a signal employee to begin a new 24-hour period for the purposes of calculating his or her total time on duty.</p><p class="depth0">Total off-duty period means the actual amount of time that a train employee or a signal employee is off duty between duty tours after the previous final release and before the beginning of the next duty tour. This time may differ from the expected prior time off that will be generated by the recordkeeping system, if the employee performed service at the behest of the railroad between the duty tours.</p><p class="depth0">Total time on duty (TTOD) means the total accumulation of time spent in periods of covered service and commingled service between qualifying statutory off-duty periods of 8 or 10 hours or more. Mandatory activities that do not constitute covered service, such as rules classes, when they may not attach to covered service, are counted as limbo time, rather than commingled service, which limbo time is not counted toward the calculation of total time on duty.</p><p class="depth0">Tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operations that are not part of the general railroad system of transportation means a tourist, scenic, historic, or excursion operation conducted only on track used exclusively for that purpose (i.e., there is no freight, intercity passenger, or

commuter passenger railroad operation on the track).</p><p class="depth0">Train employee means an individual engaged in or connected with the movement of a train, including a hostler.</p><p class="depth0">Travel time means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For a signal employee, the time spent in transportation between the employee's headquarters and an outlying duty point or between the employee's residence and an outlying duty point, or, between duty locations, including both on-track and on-highway vehicular travel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a dispatching service employee, the time spent in travel between stations, offices, or towers during the employee's time on duty.</p><p class="depth0">Type 1 assignment means an assignment to be worked by a train employee who is engaged in commuter or intercity rail passenger transportation that requires the employee to report for duty no earlier than 4 a.m. on a calendar day and be released from duty no later than 8 p.m. on the same calendar day, and that complies with the provisions of Sec. 228.405. For the purposes of this part, FRA considers a Type 1 assignment to present an acceptable level of risk for fatigue that does not violate the defined fatigue threshold under a scientifically valid, biomathematical model of human performance and fatigue specified by FRA at Sec. 228.407(c)(1) or approved by FRA under the procedures at Sec. 228.407(c)(2). However, a Type 1 assignment that is delayed such that the schedule actually worked includes any period of time between midnight and 4 a.m. is considered a Type 2 assignment for the purposes of compliance with Sec. 228.405.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Type 2 assignment means an assignment to be worked by a train employee who is engaged in commuter or intercity rail passenger transportation that requires the employee to be on duty for any period of time between 8:01 p.m. on a calendar day and 3:59 a.m. on the next calendar day, or that otherwise fails to qualify as a Type 1 assignment. A Type 2 assignment is considered a Type 1 assignment if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It does not violate the defined fatigue threshold under a scientifically valid biomathematical model of human performance and fatigue specified by FRA at 228.407(c)(2) or approved by FRA under the procedures at Sec. 228.407(c)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It complies with the provisions of Sec. 228.405; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> It does not require the employee to be on duty for any period of time between midnight and 4 a.m.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a Type 2 assignment that would normally qualify to be treated as a Type 1 assignment is delayed so that the schedule actually worked includes any period of time between midnight and 4 a.m., the assignment is considered a Type 2 assignment for the purposes of compliance with Sec. 228.405.
