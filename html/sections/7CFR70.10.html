Grading service with respect to determination of quality of products shall be on the basis of United States Classes, Standards, and Grades for Poultry and Rabbits. However, grading service may be rendered with respect to products which are bought and sold on the basis of institutional contract specifications or specifications of the applicant, and such service, when approved by the Administrator, shall be rendered on the basis of such specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever grading service is provided for examination of quality, condition, or for test weighing on a representative sample basis, such sample shall be drawn and consist of not less than the minimum number of containers indicated in the following table. The number of representative samples for large bulk containers (combo bins, tanks, etc.) may be reduced by one-half. For quality or condition, all of the poultry and rabbits in each representative sample shall be examined except for individual ready-to-cook carcasses weighing under 6 pounds in large bulk containers. For individual carcasses weighing under 6 pounds in large bulk containers, 100 carcasses shall be examined for quality or condition. Procedures for test weighing shall be in accordance with those prescribed by the Administrator.
