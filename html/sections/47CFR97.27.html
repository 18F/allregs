                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The FCC may modify a station license grant, either for a limited time or for the duration of the term thereof, if it determines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That such action will promote the public interest, convenience, and necessity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That such action will promote fuller compliance with the provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, or of any treaty ratified by the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the FCC makes such a determination, it will issue an order of modification. The order will not become final until the licensee is notified in writing of the proposed action and the grounds and reasons therefor. The licensee will be given reasonable opportunity of no less than 30 days to protest the modification; except that, where safety of life or property is involved, a shorter period of notice may be provided. Any protest by a licensee of an FCC order of modification will be handled in accordance with the provisions of 47 U.S.C. 316.
