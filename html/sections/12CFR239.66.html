The Board will generally approve the application to engage in a voluntary supervisory conversion unless it determines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The mutual holding company does not meet the eligibility requirements for a voluntary supervisory conversion under Sec. Sec. 239.65(d) or because the proceeds from the sale of the conversion stock, less the expenses of the conversion, would be insufficient to satisfy any applicable viability requirement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The transaction is detrimental to or would cause potential injury to the mutual holding company, its subsidiary savings association, or the Deposit Insurance Fund or is contrary to the public interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The mutual holding company or the acquiror, or the controlling parties or directors and officers of the mutual holding company or the acquiror, have engaged in unsafe or unsound practices in connection with the voluntary supervisory conversion; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The mutual holding company fails to justify an employment contract incidental to the conversion, or the employment contract will be an unsafe or unsound practice or represent a sale of control. In a voluntary supervisory conversion, the Board generally will not approve employment contracts of more than one year for the existing management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions the Board may impose on an approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Board will condition approval of a voluntary supervisory conversion application on all of the following.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The conversion stock sale must be complete within three months after the Board approves the application.

The Board may impose these conditions and restrictions on the mutual holding company and the resulting stock holding company (before and after the conversion), the acquiror, controlling parties, or directors and officers of the mutual holding company or the acquiror; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mutual holding company or the resulting stock holding company must infuse a larger amount of capital, if necessary, for safety and soundness reasons.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 239--Mutual Holding Company Model Charter</p><p class="depth0">FEDERAL MUTUAL HOLDING COMPANY CHARTER</p><p class="depth0">Section 1: Corporate title. The name of the mutual holding company is ----(the ``Mutual Holding Company'').</p><p class="depth0">Section 2: Duration. The duration of the Mutual Holding Company is perpetual.</p><p class="depth0">Section 3: Purpose and powers. The purpose of the Mutual Holding Company is to pursue any or all of the lawful objectives of a federal mutual savings and loan holding company chartered under section 10(o) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C. 1467a(o), and to exercise all of the express, implied, and incidental powers conferred thereby and all acts amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto, subject to the Constitution and the laws of the United States as they are now in effect, or as they may hereafter be amended, and subject to all lawful and applicable rules, regulations, and orders of the Federal Reserve Board (``Board'').</p><p class="depth0">Section 4: Capital. The Mutual Holding Company shall have no capital stock.</p><p class="depth0">Section 5: Members. [The content of this section 5 shall be identical to the content of the parallel section in the charter of the reorganizing association, with the following exceptions: (A) Any provisions conferring membership rights upon borrowers of the reorganizing association shall be eliminated and replaced with provisions grandfathering those rights in accordance with 12 CFR 239.5; and (B) appropriate changes shall be made to indicate that membership rights in the mutual holding company derive from deposit accounts in and, to the extent of any grandfather provisions, borrowings from the resulting association. Set forth below is an example of how section 5 should appear in the charter of a mutual holding company formed by a reorganizing association whose charter conforms to the model charter prescribed for federal mutual savings associations for calendar year 1989. Additional changes to this section 5 may be required whenever a mutual holding company reorganization involves an acquiree association, or a mutual holding company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a mutual savings association, so as to preserve the membership rights of the members of the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 239.5.]</p><p class="depth0">All holders of the savings, demand, or other authorized accounts of ----[insert the name of the resulting association] (the ``Association'') are members of the Mutual Holding Company. With respect to all questions requiring action by the members of the Mutual Holding Company, each holder of an account in the Association shall be permitted to cast one vote for each $100, or fraction thereof, of the withdrawal value of the member's account. In addition, borrowers from the Association as of ----[insert the date of the reorganization or any earlier date as of which new borrowings ceased to result in membership rights] shall be entitled to one vote for the period of time during which such borrowings are in existence. [The foregoing sentence should be included only if the charter of the reorganizing association confers voting rights on any borrowers.] No member, however, shall cast more than one thousand votes. All accounts shall be nonassessable.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Directors. The Mutual Holding Company shall be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen, as fixed in the Mutual Holding Company's bylaws, except that the number of directors may be decreased to a number less than five or increased to a number greater than fifteen with the prior approval of the Board.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7: Capital, surplus, and distribution of earnings. [The content of this section 7 shall be identical to the content of the parallel section in the charter of the reorganizing association, except for changes made to indicate that distribution rights in the mutual holding company derive from deposit accounts in the resulting association, any changes required to provide that the Board shall be the approving authority in instances where the charter requires regulatory approval of distributions, and any other changes necessary to accommodate the mutual holding company format. Set forth below is an example of how section 7 should appear in the charter of a mutual holding company formed by a reorganizing association whose charter conforms to the model charter prescribed for federal mutual savings associations for calendar year 1989. Additional changes to this section 7 may be required whenever a mutual holding company reorganization involves an acquiree association, or a mutual holding company makes a post-reorganization acquisition of a mutual savings association, so as to preserve the membership rights of the members of the acquired association consistent with 12 CFR 239.5].</p><p class="depth0">The Mutual Holding Company shall distribute net earnings to account holders of the Association on such basis and in accordance with such terms and conditions as may from time to time be authorized by the Board, provided that the Mutual Holding Company may establish minimum account balance requirements for account holders to be eligible for distributions of earnings.</p><p class="depth0">All holders of accounts of the Association shall be entitled to equal distribution of the assets of the Mutual Holding Company, pro rata to the value of their accounts in the Association, in the event of voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution, or winding up of the Mutual Holding Company.</p><p class="depth0">Section 8. Amendment. Adoption of any preapproved charter amendment shall be effective after such preapproved amendment has been approved by the members at a legal meeting. Any other amendment, addition, change, or repeal of this charter must be approved by the Board prior to approval by the members at a legal meeting and shall be effective upon filing with the Board in accordance with regulatory procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Attest:________________________________________________________________Secretary of the Association</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________President or Chief Executive Officer of the Association</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date:________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The shares may be issued from time to time as authorized by the board of directors without the approval of its shareholders, except as otherwise provided in this section 5 or to the extent that such approval is required by governing law, rule, or regulation. The consideration for the issuance of the shares shall be paid in full before their issuance and shall not be less than the par [or stated] value. Neither promissory notes nor future services shall constitute payment or part payment for the issuance of shares of the MHC subsidiary holding company. The consideration for the shares shall be cash, tangible or intangible property (to the extent direct investment in such property would be permitted to the MHC subsidiary holding company), labor, or services actually performed for the MHC subsidiary holding company, or any combination of the foregoing. In the absence of actual fraud in the transaction, the value of such property, labor, or services, as determined by the board of directors of the MHC subsidiary holding company, shall be conclusive. Upon payment of such consideration, such shares shall be deemed to be fully paid and nonassessable. In the case of a stock dividend, that part of the retained earnings of the MHC subsidiary holding company that is transferred to common stock or paid-in capital accounts upon the issuance of shares as a stock dividend shall be deemed to be the consideration for their issuance.</p><p class="depth0">Except for shares issued in the initial organization of the MHC subsidiary holding company, no shares of capital stock (including shares issuable upon conversion, exchange, or exercise of other securities) shall be issued, directly or indirectly, to officers, directors, or controlling persons (except for shares issued to the parent mutual holding company) of the MHC subsidiary holding company other than as part of a general public offering or as qualifying shares to a director, unless the issuance or the plan under which they would be issued has been approved by a majority of the total votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting.</p><p class="depth0">The holders of the common stock shall exclusively possess all voting power. Each holder of shares of common stock shall be entitled to one vote for each share held by such holder, except as to the cumulation of votes for the election of directors, unless the charter provides that there shall be no such cumulative voting.

Each share of common stock shall have the same relative rights as and be identical in all respects with all the other shares of common stock.</p><p class="depth0">Section 6. Preemptive rights. Holders of the capital stock of the MHC subsidiary holding company shall not be entitled to preemptive rights with respect to any shares of

the MHC subsidiary holding company which may be issued.</p><p class="depth0">Section 7. Directors. The MHC subsidiary holding company shall be under the direction of a board of directors. The authorized number of directors, as stated in the MHC subsidiary holding company's bylaws, shall not be fewer than five nor more than fifteen except when a greater or lesser number is approved by the Board, or his or her delegate.</p><p class="depth0">Section 8. Amendment of charter. Except as provided in Section 5, no amendment, addition, alteration, change or repeal of this charter shall be made, unless such is proposed by the board of directors of the MHC subsidiary holding company, approved by the shareholders by a majority of the votes eligible to be cast at a legal meeting, unless a higher vote is otherwise required, and approved or preapproved by the Board.</p><p class="depth0">Attest:________________________________________________________________Secretary of the Subsidiary Holding Company</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________President or Chief Executive Officer of the Subsidiary Holding Company</p><p class="depth0">By:____________________________________________________________________Secretary of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date:________________________________________________________</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

The annual meeting of the members of the mutual holding company for the election of directors and for the transaction of any other business of the mutual holding company shall be held, as designated by the board of directors, at a location within the state that constitutes the principal place of business of the mutual holding company, or at any other convenient place the board of directors may designate, at (insert date and time within 150 days after the end of the mutual holding company's fiscal year, if not a legal holiday, or if a legal holiday then on the next succeeding day not a legal holiday). At each annual meeting, the officers shall make a full report of the financial condition of the mutual holding company and of its progress for the preceding year and shall outline a program for the succeeding year.</p><p class="depth0">2. Special meetings of members. Special meetings of the members of the mutual holding company may be called at any time by the president or the board of directors and shall be called by the president, a vice president, or the secretary upon the written request of members of record, holding in the aggregate at least one-tenth of the voting capital of the mutual holding company. Such written request shall state the purpose of the meeting and shall be delivered at the principal place of business of the mutual holding company addressed to the president. For purposes of this section, ``voting capital'' means FDIC-insured deposits as of the voting record date. Annual and special meetings shall be conducted in accordance with the most current edition of Robert's Rules of Order or any other set of written procedures agreed to by the board of directors.</p><p class="depth0">3. Notice of meeting of members.

When any meeting is adjourned for 30 days or more, notice of the adjournment and reconvening of the meeting shall be given as in the case of the original meeting.</p><p class="depth0">4. Fixing of record date. For the purpose of determining members entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of members or any adjournment thereof, or in order to make a determination of members for any other proper purpose, the board of directors shall fix in advance a record date for any such determination of members. Such date shall be not more than 60 days nor fewer than 10 days prior to the date on which the action, requiring such determination of members, is to be taken. The member entitled to participate in any such action shall be the member of record on the books of the mutual holding company on such record date. The number of votes which each member shall be entitled to cast at any meeting of the members shall be determined from the books of the mutual holding company as of such record date.

determination shall apply to any adjourned meeting.</p><p class="depth0">5. Member quorum. Any number of members present and voting, represented in person or by proxy, at a regular or special meeting of the members shall constitute a quorum.

At any adjourned meeting any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the meeting as originally called. Members present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to transact business until adjournment.</p><p class="depth0">6. Voting by proxy. Voting at any annual or special meeting of the members may be by proxy pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (Board), provided, that no proxies shall be voted at any meeting unless such proxies shall have been placed on file with the secretary of the mutual holding company, for verification, prior to the convening of such meeting. Proxies may be given telephonically or electronically as long as the holder uses a procedure for verifying the identity of the member. All proxies with a term greater than eleven months or solicited at the expense of the mutual holding company must run to the board of directors as a whole, or to a committee appointed by a majority of such board. Accounts held by an administrator, executor, guardian, conservator or receiver may be voted in person or by proxy by such person. Accounts held by a trustee may be voted by such trustee either in person or by proxy, in accordance with the terms of the trust agreement, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote accounts without a transfer of such accounts into the trustee name. Accounts held in trust in an IRA or Keogh Account, however, may be voted by the mutual holding company if no other instructions are received. Joint accounts shall be entitled to no more than 1000 votes, and any owner may cast all the votes unless the mutual holding company has otherwise been notified in writing.</p><p class="depth0">7. Communication between members. Communication between members shall be subject to any applicable rules or regulations of the Board. No member, however, shall have the right to inspect or copy any portion of any books or records of a mutual holding company containing: (i) a list of depositors in or borrowers from such mutual holding company; (ii) their addresses; (iii) individual deposit or loan balances or records; or (iv) any data from which such information could reasonably be constructed.</p><p class="depth0">8.

Meetings of the board. The board of directors shall meet regularly without notice at the principal place of business of the mutual holding company at least once each month at an hour and date fixed by resolution of the board, provided that the place of meeting may be changed by the directors. Special meetings of the board may be held at any place specified in a notice of such meeting and shall be called by the secretary upon the written request of the chairman or of three directors. All special meetings shall be held upon at least 24 hours written notice to each director unless notice is waived in writing before or after such meeting. Such notice shall state the place, date, time, and purposes of such meeting. A majority of the authorized directors shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business. The act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the board. Action may be taken without a meeting if unanimous written consent is obtained for such action. The board may also permit telephonic participation at meetings. The meetings shall be under the direction of a chairman, appointed annually by the board, or in the absence of the chairman, the meetings shall be under the direction of the president.</p><p class="depth0">10. Officers, employees, and agents. Annually at the meeting of the board of directors of the mutual holding company following the annual meeting of the members of the mutual holding company, the board shall elect a president, one or more vice presidents, a secretary, and a treasurer or comptroller: Provided, that the offices of president and secretary may not be held by the same person and a vice president may also be the treasurer or comptroller. The board may appoint such additional officers, employees, and agents as it may from time to time determine. The term of office of all officers shall be one year or until their respective successors are elected and qualified. Any officer may be removed at any time by the board with or without cause, but such removal, other than for cause, shall be without prejudice to the contractual rights, if any, of the person so removed. In the absence of designation from time to time of powers and duties by the board, the officers shall have such powers and duties as generally pertain to their respective offices. Any indemnification by the mutual holding company of the mutual holding company's personnel is subject

to any applicable rules or regulations of the Board.</p><p class="depth0">11. Vacancies, resignation or removal of directors. Members of the mutual holding company shall elect directors by ballot: Provided, that in the event of a vacancy on the board between meetings of members, the board of directors may, by their affirmative vote, fill such vacancy, even if the remaining directors constitute less than a quorum. A director elected to fill a vacancy shall be elected to serve only until the next election of directors by the members. Any director may resign at any time by sending a written notice of such resignation to the mutual holding company delivered to the secretary. Unless otherwise specified therein such resignation shall take effect upon receipt by the secretary. More than three consecutive absences from regular meetings of the board, unless excused by resolution of the board, shall automatically constitute a resignation, effective when such resignation is accepted by the board. At a meeting of members called expressly for that purpose, directors or the entire board may be removed, only with cause, by a vote of the holders of a majority of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of directors.</p><p class="depth0">12. Powers of the board. The board of directors shall have the power: (a) By resolution, to appoint from among its members and remove an executive committee, which committee shall have and may exercise the powers of the board between the meetings of the board, but no such committee shall have the authority of the board to amend the charter or bylaws, adopt a plan of merger, consolidation, dissolution, or provide for the disposition of all or substantially all the property and assets of the mutual holding company. Such committee shall not operate to relieve the board, or any member thereof, of any responsibility imposed by law; (b) To appoint and remove by resolution the members of such other committees as may be deemed necessary and prescribe the duties thereof; (c) To fix the compensation of directors, officers, and employees; and to remove any officer or employee at any time with or without cause; (d) To limit payments on capital which may be accepted; and (e) To exercise any and all of the powers of the mutual holding company not expressly reserved by the charter to the members.</p><p class="depth0">13. Execution of instruments, generally. All documents and instruments or writings of any nature shall be signed, executed, verified, acknowledged, and delivered by such officers, agents, or employees of the mutual holding company or any one of them and in such manner as from time to time may be determined by resolution of the board. All notes, drafts, acceptances, checks, endorsements, and all evidences of indebtedness of the mutual holding company whatsoever shall be signed by such officer or officers or such agent or agents of the mutual holding company and in such manner as the board may from time to time determine. Endorsements for deposit to the credit of the mutual holding company in any of its duly authorized depositories shall be made in such manner as the board may from time to time determine. Proxies to vote with respect to shares or accounts of other mutual holding companies or stock of other corporations owned by, or standing in the name of, the mutual holding company may be executed and delivered from time to time on behalf of the mutual holding company by the president or a vice president and the secretary or an assistant secretary of the mutual holding company or by any other persons so authorized by the board.</p><p class="depth0">14. Nominating committee. The chairman, at least 30 days prior to the date of each annual meeting, shall appoint a nominating committee of three individuals who are members of the mutual holding company. Such committee shall make nominations for directors in writing and deliver to the secretary such written nominations at least 15 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, which nominations shall then be posted in a prominent place in the principal place of business for the 15-day period prior to the date of the annual meeting, except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity. Provided such committee is appointed and makes such nominations, no nominations for directors except those made by the nominating committee shall be voted upon at the annual meeting unless other nominations by members are made in writing and delivered to the secretary of the mutual holding company at least 10 days prior to the date of the annual meeting, which nominations shall then be posted in a prominent place in the principal place of business for the 10-day period prior to the date of the annual meeting, except in the case of a nominee substituted as a result of death or other incapacity. Ballots bearing the names of all individuals nominated by the nominating committee and by other members prior to the annual meeting shall be provided for use by the members at the annual meeting. If at any time the chairman shall fail to appoint such nominating committee, or the nominating committee shall fail or refuse to act at least 15 days prior to the annual meeting, nominations for directors may be made at the annual meeting by any member and shall be voted upon.</p><p class="depth0">15. New business. Any new business to be taken up at the annual meeting, including any proposal to increase or decrease the number of directors of the mutual holding company, shall be stated in writing and filed with the secretary of the mutual holding company at least 30 days before the date of the annual meeting, and all business so stated, proposed, and filed shall be considered at

the annual meeting; but no other proposal shall be acted upon at the annual meeting. Any member may make any other proposal at the annual meeting and the same may be discussed and considered; but unless stated in writing and filed with the secretary 30 days before the meeting, such proposal shall be laid over for action at an adjourned, special, or regular meeting of the members taking place at least 30 days thereafter. This provision shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at the annual meeting of the reports of officers and committees, but in connection with such reports no new business shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated and filed as herein provided.</p><p class="depth0">16. Seal. The seal shall be two concentric circles between which shall be the name of the mutual holding company. The year of incorporation, the word ``Incorporated'' or an emblem may appear in the center.</p><p class="depth0">17. Amendment. Adoption of any bylaw amendment pursuant to Sec. 239.15 of the Board's regulations, as long as consistent with applicable law, rules and regulations, and which adequately addresses the subject and purpose of the stated by law section, shall be effective after (i) approval of the amendment by a majority vote of the authorized board, or by a vote of the members of the mutual holding company at a legal meeting; and (ii) receipt of any applicable regulatory approval. When a mutual holding company fails to meet its quorum requirement solely due to vacancies on the board, the bylaws may be amended by an affirmative vote of a majority of the sitting board.</p><p class="depth0">18. Age limitations. [Bylaws on age limitations must comply with all Federal laws, such as the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Directors. No individual ---- years of age shall be eligible for election, reelection, appointment, or reappointment to the board of the mutual holding company.

No proxy shall be valid more than eleven months from the date of its execution except for a proxy coupled with an interest.</p><p class="depth2">Section 10. Voting of Shares in the Name of Two or More Persons. When ownership stands in the name of two or more persons, in the absence of written directions to the Subsidiary Holding Company to the contrary, at any meeting of the shareholders of the Subsidiary Holding Company any one or more of such shareholders may cast, in person or by proxy, all votes to which such ownership is entitled. In the event an attempt is made to cast conflicting votes, in person or

by proxy, by the several persons in whose names shares of stock stand, the vote or votes to which those persons are entitled shall be cast as directed by a majority of those holding such and present in person or by proxy at such meeting, but no votes shall be cast for such stock if a majority cannot agree.</p><p class="depth2">Section 11. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing in the name of another corporation may be voted by any officer, agent, or proxy as the bylaws of such corporation may prescribe, or, in the absence of such provision, as the board of directors of such corporation may determine.

Shares standing in the name of a trustee may be voted by him or her, either in person or by proxy, but no trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by him or her without a transfer of such shares into his or her name. Shares held in trust in an IRA or Keogh Account, however, may by voted by the Subsidiary Holding Company if no other instructions are received. Shares standing in the name of a receiver may be voted by such receiver, and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by such receiver without the transfer into his or her name if authority to do so is contained in an appropriate order of the court or other public authority by which such receiver was appointed. A shareholder whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee, and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred. Neither treasury shares of its own stock held by the Subsidiary Holding Company nor shares held by another corporation, if a majority of the shares entitled to vote for the election of directors of such other corporation are held by the Subsidiary Holding Company, shall be voted at any meeting or counted in determining the total number of outstanding shares at any given time for purposes of any meeting. [If charter authorizes cumulative voting, the following Section 12 shall apply, otherwise renumber Sections 13-16 as Sections 12-15.]</p><p class="depth2">Section 12. Cumulative Voting. Every shareholder entitled to vote at an election for directors shall have the right to vote, in person or by proxy, the number of shares owned by the shareholder for as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose election the shareholder has a right to vote, or to cumulate the votes by giving one candidate as many votes as the number of such directors to be elected multiplied by the number of shares shall equal or by distributing such votes on the same principle among any number of candidates.</p><p class="depth2">Section 13. Inspectors of Election. In advance of any meeting of shareholders, the board of directors may appoint any individual other than nominees for office as inspectors of election to act at such meeting or any adjournment.

If inspectors of election are not so appointed, the chairman of the board or the president may, or on the request of not fewer than 10 percent of the votes represented at the meeting shall, make such appointment at the meeting. If appointed at the meeting, the majority of the votes present shall determine whether one or three inspectors are to be appointed. In case any individual appointed as inspector fails to appear or fails or refuses to act, the vacancy may be filled by appointment by the board of directors in advance of the meeting or at the meeting by the chairman of the board or the president. Unless otherwise prescribed by regulations of the Board, the duties of such inspectors shall include: determining the number of shares and the voting power of each share, the shares represented at the meeting, the existence of a quorum, and the authenticity, validity and effect of proxies; receiving votes, ballots, or consents; hearing and determining all challenges and questions in any way arising in connection with the rights to vote; counting and tabulating all votes or consents; determining the result; and such acts as may be proper to conduct the election or vote with fairness to all shareholders.</p><p class="depth2">Section 14.

Upon delivery, such nominations shall be posted in a conspicuous place in each office of the Subsidiary Holding Company.

shareholder entitled to vote and shall be voted upon.</p><p class="depth2">Section 15. New Business.

Any shareholder may make any other proposal at the annual meeting and the same may be discussed and considered, but unless stated in writing and filed with the secretary at least five days before the meeting, such proposal shall be laid over for action at an adjourned, special, or annual meeting of the shareholders taking place 30 days or more thereafter. This provision shall not prevent the consideration and approval or disapproval at the annual meeting of reports of officers, directors, and committees; but in connection with such reports, no new business shall be acted upon at such annual meeting unless stated and filed as herein provided.</p><p class="depth2">Section 16. Informal Action by Shareholders. Any action required to be taken at a meeting of the shareholders, or any other action which may be taken at a meeting of shareholders, may be taken without a meeting if consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be given by all of the shareholders entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter.</p><p class="depth2">Article III--Board of Directors</p><p class="depth2">Section 1.

Any director may waive notice of any meeting by a writing filed with the secretary. The attendance of a director at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except where a director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the board of directors need be specified in the notice of waiver of notice of such meeting.</p><p class="depth2">Section 7. Quorum. A majority of the number of directors fixed by section 2 of this article III shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any meeting of the board of directors; but if less than such majority is present at a meeting, a majority of the directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time.
