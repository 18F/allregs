This revision requested an extension of the final compliance  dates to implement reasonably available control technology (RACT) on  topcoat and final repair applications. As a result of EPA's disapproval  of this revision, the existing compliance date of December   31, 1985 specified in the automobile surface coating regulation  contained in the Massachusetts SIP will remain in effect (Massachusetts  Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(7) as approved by EPA and codified at 40 CFR  52.1120(c)(30) and (53)).
