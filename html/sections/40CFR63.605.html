                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing wet-process  phosphoric acid process line or superphosphoric acid process line  subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate,  maintain, and operate a monitoring system which can be used to determine  and permanently record the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material  to the process. The monitoring system shall have an accuracy of  q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing phosphate rock dryer  or phosphate rock calciner subject to the provisions of this subpart  shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring system  which can be used to determine and permanently record either the mass  flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the dryer or calciner, or  the mass flow of product from the dryer or calciner. The monitoring  system shall have an accuracy of q5 percent over  its operating range. Since the emissions limits under Sec. Sec.   63.602(c) and 63.603(c) for the phosphate rock dryer are in the format  of kilogram/megagram (lb/ton) of phosphate rock feed, during performance  testing required in Sec.  63.606, the owner or operator that chooses to  operate a monitoring system to determine and permanently record the mass  flow of product from the dryer must either simultaneously monitor the  dryer feed rate and dryer output rate, or monitor the dryer output rate  and the dryer input and output moisture contents and calculate the  corresponding dryer input rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing wet-process  phosphoric acid process line or superphosphoric acid process line  subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain a daily record  of equivalent P2O5 feed by first determining the  total mass rate in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed using a  monitoring system for measuring mass flowrate which meets the  requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and then by proceeding  according to Sec.  63.606(c)(3).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing phosphate rock  calciner or phosphate rock dryer subject to the provisions of this  subpart shall maintain a daily record of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For owners and operators that monitor the mass flow of  phosphorus-bearing feed material to the dryer or calciner, a daily  record of phosphate rock feed by determining the total mass rate in  metric ton/hour of phosphorus-bearing feed using a monitoring system for  measuring mass flowrate which meets the requirements of paragraph (a)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For owners and operators that monitor the mass flow of product  from the dryer or calciner, a daily record of product by determining the  total mass rate in metric ton/hour of product using a monitoring system  for measuring mass flowrate which meets the requirements of paragraph  (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing wet-process  phosphoric acid process line, superphosphoric acid process line,  phosphate rock dryer or phosphate rock calciner using a wet scrubbing  emission control system shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate  the following monitoring systems:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A monitoring system which continuously measures and permanently  records the pressure drop across each scrubber in the process scrubbing  system in 15-minute block averages. The monitoring system shall be  certified by the manufacturer to have an accuracy of  q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A monitoring system which continuously measures and permanently  records the flow rate of the scrubbing liquid to each scrubber in the  process scrubbing system in 15-minute block averages. The monitoring  system shall be certified by the manufacturer to have an accuracy of  q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(1)</em> or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, and/ or 63.10(d)(2), the owner or operator will indicate whether the  operating range will be based on the new performance test or the  previously established range. If the Administrator has not denied  approval of the new operating ranges within 30 days of submission of the  performance test results, the new ranges shall be deemed approved and  the new baseline value shall then be effective on the 31st day following  submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>. The source shall certify that the control devices and processes  have not been modified subsequent to the testing upon which the data  used to establish the allowable ranges were obtained. The allowable  ranges developed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph must be  submitted to the Administrator for approval. The owner or operator must  request and obtain approval of the Administrator for changes to the  allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph  is retested, the owner or operator shall determine new allowable ranges  of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the  operating parameters outside the previously established ranges. If the  Administrator has not denied approval of the new operating ranges within  30 days of submission of the performance test results, the new ranges  shall be deemed approved and the new baseline value shall then be  effective on the 31st day following submission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing purified phosphoric  acid process line shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring system  which continuously measures and permanently records the stack gas exit  temperature for each chiller stack.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure and record the concentration of methyl isobutyl ketone  in each   product acid stream and each raffinate stream once daily.
