                                Sec. 102-81.20  Are the security standards for new Federally owned owned and leased  facilities?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">No, the minimum standards specified in the Department of Justice's  June 28,   1995, study entitled ``Vulnerability Assessment of Federal Facilities''  identifies the minimum-security standards that agencies must adhere to  for all existing owned and leased Federal facilities. As specified in  Sec. 102-81.25, new Federally owned and leased facilities must be  designed to meet the standards identified in the document entitled  ``Interagency Security Committee Security Design Criteria for New  Federal Office Buildings and Major Modernization Projects,'' dated May  28, 2001. The security design criteria for new facilities takes into  consideration technology developments, new cost consideration, the  experience of practitioners applying the criteria, and the need to  balance security requirements with public building environments that  remain lively, open, and accessible.</p>
