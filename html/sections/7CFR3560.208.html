If a borrower can document that a tenant received a notice specifying a tenant recertification date and the tenant fails to comply by the specified date or fails to cooperate with verification or other procedures related to the tenant's recertification so that the tenant recertification cannot be completed by the recertification date, the borrower, within 10 days of the recertification date, shall give the tenant and the Agency written notification that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination proceedings are being initiated, in accordance with Sec. 3560.159; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tenant will be charged note rent until the tenant's lease is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unauthorized assistance due to tenant recertification failure. Any unauthorized assistance received because of the tenant's failure to be recertified will be collected in accordance with the provisions of subpart O of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rents when borrowers fail to recertify tenants. If a borrower cannot document that a tenant received a recertification notice, and a tenant is not recertified within 12 months of the most recently executed tenant certification, tenants shall continue to make net tenant contributions to rent based on their most recent tenant certification and the borrower must remit to the Agency full overage as if the tenant was paying the note rent until the tenant is recertified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unauthorized assistance due to borrower recertification failure. Any unauthorized assistance received as a result of the borrower's failure to recertify a tenant will be collected from the borrower in accordance with the provisions of subpart O of this part and may
