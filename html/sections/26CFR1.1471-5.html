                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> U.S. accounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (a) defines the  term U.S. account and describes when a person is treated as the holder  of a financial account (account holder). This paragraph also provides  rules for determining when an exception to U.S. account status applies  for certain depository accounts, including account aggregation  requirements relevant to applying the exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of U.S. account. Subject to the exception described  in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, a U.S. account is any financial  account maintained by an FFI that is held by one or more specified U.S.  persons or U.S. owned foreign entities. For the definition of the term  financial account, see paragraph (b) of this section. For the definition  of the term specified U.S. person, see Sec. 1.1473-1(c). For the  definition of the term U.S. owned foreign entity, see paragraph (c) of  this section. For reporting requirements of participating FFIs with  respect to U.S. accounts, see Sec. 1.1471-4(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Financial accounts held by agents that are not financial  institutions. A person, other than a financial institution, that holds a  financial account for the benefit or account of another person as an  agent, custodian, nominee, signatory, investment advisor, or  intermediary, is not treated as an account holder with respect to such  account for purposes of this section. Instead, such other person is  treated as the account holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Account holder for insurance and annuity contracts. An  insurance or annuity contract is held by each person that is entitled to  access the contract's value (for example, through a loan, withdrawal,  surrender, or otherwise) or change a beneficiary under the contract. If  no person can access the contract's value or change a beneficiary, the  account holders are any person named in the contract as an owner and any  person who is entitled to receive a future payment under the terms of  the contract. When an obligation to pay an   amount under the contract becomes fixed, each person entitled to receive  a payment is an account holder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (a)(3) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Account held by agent. F, a nonresident alien, holds a  power of attorney from U, a specified U.S. person, that authorizes F to  open, hold, and make deposits and withdrawals with respect to a  depository account on behalf of U. The balance of the account for the  calendar year is $100,000. F is listed as the holder of the depository  account at a participating FFI, but because F holds the account as an  agent for the benefit of U, F is not ultimately entitled to the funds in  the account. Because the depository account is treated as held by U, a  specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Jointly held accounts. U, a specified U.S. person, holds  a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance of the account  for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is jointly held with A,  an individual who is a nonresident alien. Because one of the joint  holders is a specified U.S. person, the account is a U.S. account.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Jointly held accounts. U and Q, both specified U.S.  persons, hold a depository account in a participating FFI. The balance  of the account for the calendar year is $100,000. The account is a U.S.  account and both U and Q are treated as holders of the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Election to forgo exception. A participating FFI may elect to  disregard the exception described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section  by reporting all U.S. accounts, including those accounts that would  otherwise meet the conditions of the exception.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> of this section. For  purposes of applying the $50,000 threshold described in paragraph  (a)(4)(i) of this section, however, a depository account is aggregated  only with other depository accounts. Therefore, U's depository account  is eligible for the paragraph (a)(4)(i) exception to U.S. account status  because the balance of the depository account does not exceed $50,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Financial accounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided  in this paragraph (b), the term financial account means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section) maintained by a financial  institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section) maintained by a financial  institution;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Equity or debt interest--(A) Equity or debt interests in an  investment entity. Any equity or debt interest (other than interests  regularly traded on an established securities market under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in an investment entity described in  paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) or (C) of this section (including an entity that  is also a depository institution, custodial institution, insurance  company, or investment entity described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of  this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain equity or debt interests in a holding company or  treasury center. Any equity or debt interest (other than interests  regularly traded on an established securities market under paragraph  (b)(3)(iv) of this section) in a holding company or treasury center  described in paragraph (e)(1)(v) of this section if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The expanded affiliated group of which the entity is a member  includes one or more investment entities described in paragraph  (e)(4)(i)(B) or (C) of this section or passive NFFEs and the income  derived by such investment entities or passive NFFEs is 50 percent or  more of the aggregate income earned by the expanded affiliated group;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)(v))</em> of this  section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The interest is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the  reporting or withholding requirements of chapter 4;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Equity or debt interests in other financial institutions. Any  equity or debt interest (other than interests regularly traded on an  established securities market under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this  section) in an entity that is a depository institution, custodial  institution, investment entity described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of  this section, or insurance company if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The value of the interest is determined, directly or indirectly,  primarily by reference to assets that give rise (or could give rise) to  withholdable payments (as determined under paragraph (b)(3)(v) of this  section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The interest is issued with a principal purpose of avoiding the  reporting or withholding requirements of chapter 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Insurance and annuity contracts. A contract issued or  maintained by an insurance company, a holding company (as described in  paragraph (e)(5)(i)(C) of this section) of an insurance company, or a  financial institution described in paragraphs (e)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), or  (v) of this section, if the contract is a cash value insurance contract  (as defined in paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section) or an annuity  contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Certain savings accounts--(A) Retirement and pension accounts. A  retirement or pension account that satisfies the following conditions  under the laws of the jurisdiction where the account is maintained:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The account is subject to regulation as a personal retirement  account or is part of a registered or regulated retirement or pension  plan for the provision of retirement or pension benefits (including  disability or death benefits);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(E)</em> of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annual information reporting is required to the relevant tax  authorities with respect to the account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Withdrawals are conditioned on reaching a specified retirement  age, disability, or death, or penalties apply to withdrawals made before  such specified events; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annual contributions are limited to $50,000 or less, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a maximum lifetime contribution limit to the account  of $1,000,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Non-retirement savings accounts. An account (other than an  insurance or annuity contract) that satisfies the following conditions  under the laws of the jurisdiction where the account is maintained:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The account is subject to regulation as a savings vehicle for  purposes other than for retirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)(E)</em> of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Withdrawals are conditioned on meeting specific criteria related  to the purpose of the savings account (for example, the provision of  educational or medical benefits), or penalties apply to withdrawals made  before such criteria are met; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Annual contributions are limited to $50,000 or less;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Rollovers. An account that otherwise satisfies the requirements  of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section will not fail to  satisfy such requirements solely because such account may receive assets  or funds transferred from one or more accounts that meet the  requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) or (B) of this section, one or  more retirement or pension funds that meet the requirements of  Sec. 1.1471-6(f), one or more accounts described in paragraph (b)(2)(vi)  of this section, or one or more entities identified as nonreporting  financial institutions under the terms of an applicable Model 1 or Model  2 IGA because they are retirement or pension funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Coordination with section 6038D. The exclusions provided under  paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this section shall not apply for purposes of  determining   whether an account or other arrangement is a financial account for  purposes of section 6038D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Account that is tax-favored. For purposes of this paragraph  (b)(2)(i), an account is tax-favored under the laws of a jurisdiction  where the account is maintained if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Contributions to the account that would otherwise be subject to  tax under such laws are deductible or excluded from the gross income of  the account holder or taxed at a reduced rate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Taxation of investment income from the account is deferred or  taxed at a reduced rate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain term life insurance contracts. A life insurance  contract with a coverage period that will end before the insured  individual attains age 90, provided that the contract satisfies the  following conditions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Periodic premiums, which do not decrease over time, are payable  at least annually during the period the contract is in existence or  until the insured attains age 90, whichever is shorter;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The contract has no contract value that any person can access  (by withdrawal, loan, or otherwise) without terminating the contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount (other than a death benefit) payable upon  cancellation or termination of the contract cannot exceed the aggregate  premiums paid for the contract, less the sum of mortality, morbidity,  and expense charges (whether or not actually imposed) for the period or  periods of the contract's existence and any amounts paid prior to the  cancellation or termination of the contract; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The contract is not held by a transferee for value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Account held by an estate.

An account or product that is excluded from the definition of  financial account under the terms of an applicable Model 1 IGA or Model  2 IGA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of  chapter 4--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>, the term depository account means any  account that is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A commercial, checking, savings, time, or thrift account, or an  account that is evidenced by a certificate of deposit, thrift  certificate, investment certificate, passbook, certificate of  indebtedness, or any other instrument for placing money in the custody  of an entity engaged in a banking or similar business for which such  institution is   obligated to give credit (regardless of whether such instrument is  interest bearing or non-interest bearing), including, for example, a  credit balance with respect to a credit card account issued by a credit  card company that is engaged in a banking or similar business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any amount held by an insurance company under a guaranteed  investment contract or under a similar agreement to pay or credit  interest thereon or to return the amount held.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exceptions.

In the  case of a partnership that is a financial institution, the term equity  interest means either a capital or profits interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trust. In the case of a trust that is a financial institution,  an equity interest means an interest held by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person who is an owner of all or a portion of the trust under  sections 671 through 679;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A beneficiary who is entitled to a mandatory distribution from  the trust as defined in Sec. 1.1473-1(b)(3); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> from the trust but only if such person  receives a distribution in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Debt interest. The value of a debt interest is determined,  directly or indirectly, primarily by reference to assets that give rise  (or could give rise) to withholdable payments if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)(B)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Cash value insurance contract--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The term cash  value insurance contract means an insurance contract (other than an  indemnity reinsurance contract between two insurance companies and a  term life insurance contract described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this  section) that has an aggregate cash value greater than $50,000 at any  time during the calendar year, applying the rules set forth in paragraph  (b)(4)(iii) of this section. A participating FFI may elect to disregard  the $50,000 threshold in the preceding sentence by reporting all  contracts with a cash value greater than zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cash value. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph  (b)(3)(vii)(C) of this section, the term cash value means any amount  (determined without reduction for any charge or policy loan) that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is payable under the contract to any person upon surrender,  termination, cancellation, or withdrawal; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any person can borrow under or with regard to (for example, by  pledging as collateral) the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Amounts excluded from cash value. Cash value does not include an  amount payable--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Solely by reason of the death of an individual insured under a  life insurance contract;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a personal injury or sickness benefit or a benefit providing  indemnification of an economic loss incurred upon the occurrence of the  event insured against;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> As a refund of a previously paid premium (less cost of insurance   charges whether or not actually imposed) under an insurance contract  (other than a life insurance or annuity contract) due to cancellation or  termination of the contract, decrease in risk exposure during the  effective period of the contract, or arising from the correction of a  posting or similar error with regard to the premium for the contract; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> As a policyholder dividend (other than a termination dividend)  provided that the dividend relates to an insurance contract under which  the only benefits payable are described in paragraph (b)(3)(vii)(C)(2)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> As a return of an advance premium or premium deposit for an  insurance contract for which the premium is payable at least annually if  the amount of the advance premium or premium deposit does not exceed the  next annual premium that will be payable under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Policyholder dividend--(1) For purposes of paragraph  (b)(3)(vii)(C)(4) of this section and except as otherwise provided in  this paragraph, a policyholder dividend means any dividend or similar  distribution to policyholders in their capacity as such, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An amount paid or credited (including as an increase in  benefits) if the amount is not fixed in the contract but rather depends  on the experience of the insurance company or the discretion of  management;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A reduction in the premium that, but for the reduction, would  have been required to be paid; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An experience rated refund or credit based solely upon the  claims experience of the contract or group involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A policyholder dividend cannot exceed the premiums previously  paid for the contract, less the sum of the cost of insurance and expense  charges (whether or not actually imposed) during the contract's  existence and the aggregate amount of any prior dividends paid or  credited with regard to the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A policyholder dividend does not include any amount that is in  the nature of interest that is paid or credited to a contract holder to  the extent that such amount exceeds the minimum rate of interest  required to be credited with respect to contract values under local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> provides rules  for determining the balance or value of a financial account for purposes  of chapter 4. For example, the rules of this paragraph apply for  purposes of determining whether an FFI meets the requirements of  paragraph (f)(2)(i), (f)(2)(ii) or (f)(3) of this section to certify to  a deemed-compliant FFI status. The rules of this paragraph also apply to  a participating FFI's due diligence and reporting obligations to the  extent required under Sec. 1.1471-4(c) or (d) and to a U.S. withholding  agent's due diligence obligations to the extent required under  Sec. 1.1471-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> to determine the value of  trust interests that are financial accounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule for immediate annuity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Immediate annuities  without minimum benefit guarantees. If the value of an immediate annuity  contract with no minimum benefit guarantee is not reported to the  account holder, the account balance or value of the contract is the sum  of the net present values on the valuation date of the amounts  reasonably expected to be payable in future periods under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Immediate annuities with a minimum benefit guarantee. The  account balance or value of an annuity contract with a minimum guarantee  is the sum of the net present values on the valuation date of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The non-guaranteed amounts reasonably expected to be payable in  future periods; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The guaranteed amounts payable in future periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Net present value of amounts payable in future periods. The net  present value of an amount payable in a future period shall be  determined using--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A reasonable actuarial valuation method, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The mortality tables and interest rate(s)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prescribed pursuant to section 7520 and the regulations  thereunder; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Used by the issuer of the contract to determine the amounts  payable under the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Account aggregation requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. To the  extent a financial institution is required under chapter 4 to determine  the aggregate balance or value of an account, the financial institution  is required to aggregate the account balance or value of all accounts  that are held (in whole or in part) by the same person and that are  maintained by the financial institution or members of its expanded  affiliated group, but only to the extent that the financial  institution's computerized systems link the accounts by reference to a  data element, such as client number, EIN, or foreign tax identifying  number, and allow the account balances of such accounts to be  aggregated. Notwithstanding the rules set forth in this paragraph  (b)(4)(iii), a financial institution is required to aggregate the  balance or value of accounts that it treats as consolidated obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Aggregation rule for relationship managers. To the extent a  financial institution is required under chapter 4 to apply the  aggregation rules of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii), the financial  institution also is required to aggregate all accounts that a  relationship manager knows are directly or indirectly owned, controlled,  or established (other than in a fiduciary capacity) by the same person,  as well as all accounts that the relationship manager has associated  with one another through a relationship code, customer identification  number, TIN, or similar indicator, or that the relationship manager  would typically associate with each other under the procedures of the  financial institution (or the department, division, or unit with which  the relationship manager is associated).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the account  aggregation requirements of this paragraph (b)(4)(iii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. FFI not required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account  exception. A U.S. resident individual, U, holds a depository account  with Branch 1 of CB, a commercial bank that is a participating FFI. The  balance in U's Branch 1 account at the end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also  holds a depository account with Branch 2 of CB, with a $45,000 balance  at the end of Year 1. CB's retail banking businesses share computerized  information management systems across its branches, but U's accounts are  not associated with one another in the shared computerized information  system. In addition, CB has not assigned a relationship manager to U or  U's accounts. Because the accounts are not associated in CB's system or  by a relationship manager, CB is not required to aggregate the accounts  under paragraph (b)(4)(iii) and both accounts are eligible for the  exception to U.S. account status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of  this section as neither account exceeds the $50,000 threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. FFI required to aggregate accounts for U.S. account  exception. Same facts as Example 1, except that both of U's depository  accounts are associated with U and with one another by reference to CB's  internal identification number. The system shows the account balances  for both accounts, and such balances may be electronically aggregated,  though the system does not show a combined balance for the accounts. In  determining whether such accounts meet the exception to U.S. account  status described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section for certain  depository accounts with an aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or  less, CB is required to aggregate   the account balances of all depository accounts under the rules of  paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this section. Under those rules, U is treated  as holding depository accounts with CB with an aggregate balance of  $80,000. Accordingly, neither account is eligible for the exception to  U.S. account status, because the accounts, when aggregated, exceed the  $50,000 threshold.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Aggregation rules for joint accounts maintained by a  participating FFI. In Year 1, a U.S. resident individual, U, holds a  custodial account that is a preexisting account at custodial institution  CI, a participating FFI. The balance in U's CI custodial account at the  end of Year 1 is $35,000. U also holds a joint custodial account that is  a preexisting account with her sister, A, a nonresident alien for U.S.  federal income tax purposes, with another custodial institution, CI2.  The balance in the joint account at the end of Year 1 is also $35,000.  CI and CI2 are part of the same expanded affiliated group and share  computerized information management systems. Both U's custodial account  at CI and U and A's custodial account at CI2 are associated with U and  with one another by reference to CI's internal identification number and  the system allows the balances to be aggregated. In determining whether  such accounts meet the documentation exception described in Sec. 1.1471- 4(c)(4)(iv) for certain preexisting individual accounts with an  aggregate balance or value of $50,000 or less, CI is required to  aggregate the account balances of accounts held in whole or in part by  the same account holder under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this  section. Under those rules, U is treated as having financial accounts  with C1 and CI2, each with an aggregate balance of $70,000. Accordingly,  neither account is eligible for the documentation exception.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Aggregation for applying indefinite validity periods. In  Year 1, an owner-documented FFI, O, holds an offshore account with  Branch 1 of CB, a commercial bank that is a U.S. withholding agent. The  balance in O's CB account at the end of Year 1 is $600,000. In Year 1, O  also holds an account in the United States with Branch 2 of CB. The  Branch 2 account has a $450,000 balance at the end of Year 1. CB's  banking businesses share computerized information management systems  across its branches. O's accounts are associated with one another in the  shared computerized information system and the system allows the  balances to be aggregated. In determining whether CB is permitted to  apply an indefinite validity period for the documentation submitted for  O's account at Branch 1 pursuant to Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(4)  (permitting indefinite validity for a withholding statement of an owner- documented FFI if the balance or value of all accounts held by the  owner-documented FFI does not exceed $1,000,000), CB is required to  aggregate the account balance of O's accounts at Branch 1 and Branch 2  to the extent required under the rules of paragraph (b)(4)(iii) of this  section. Accordingly, O is treated as holding financial accounts with CB  with an aggregate balance of $1,050,000 and the documentation submitted  for O's account at Branch 1 is not eligible for the indefinite validity  period described under Sec. 1.1471-3(c)(6)(ii)(C)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Currency translation of balance or value. If the balance or  value of a financial account, other obligation, or the aggregate amount  payable under a group life or group annuity contract described in  Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(4) is denominated in a currency other than U.S.  dollars, a withholding agent must calculate the balance or value by  applying a spot rate determined under Sec. 1.988-1(d) to translate such  balance or value into the U.S. dollar equivalent. For the purpose of a  participating or registered deemed-compliant FFI reporting an account  under Sec. 1.1471-4(d), the spot rate must be determined as of the last  day of the calendar year (or, in the case of an insurance contract or  annuity contract, the most recent contract anniversary date, when  applicable) for which the account is being reported or, if the account  was closed during such calendar year, the date the account was closed.  In the case of an FFI determining whether an account meets (or continues  to meet) a preexisting account documentation exception described in  Sec. 1.1471-4(c)(3)(iii) or (c)(5)(iii), or whether the account is an  account described in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section, the spot rate  must be determined on the date for which the FFI is determining the  threshold amount as prescribed in those provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Account maintained by financial institution. A custodial account  is maintained by the financial institution that holds custody over the  assets in the account (including a financial institution that holds  assets in street name for an account holder in such institution). A  depository account is maintained by the financial institution that is  obligated to make payments with respect to the account (excluding an  agent of a financial institution regardless of whether such agent is a  financial institution under paragraph (e)(1) of this section). Any  equity or debt interest in   a financial institution that constitutes a financial account under  paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section is maintained by such financial  institution. A cash value insurance contract or an annuity contract  described in paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section is maintained by the  financial institution that is obligated to make payments with respect to  the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Definition of financial institution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (e)(4) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Investment advisor. Fund Manager is an investment entity  within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Fund  Manager, among its various business operations, organizes and manages a  variety of funds, including Fund A, a fund that invests primarily in  equities. Fund Manager hires Investment Advisor, a foreign entity, to  provide advice and discretionary management of a portion of the  financial assets held by Fund A. Investment Advisor earned more than 50%  of its gross income for the last three years from providing similar  services. Because Investment Advisor primarily conducts a business of  managing financial assets on behalf of clients, Investment Advisor is an  investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section and an  FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Entity that is managed by an FFI. The facts are the same  as in Example 1. In addition, in every year since it was organized, Fund  A has earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing in  financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity under  paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section because it is managed by Fund  Manager and Investment Advisor and its gross income is primarily  attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in financial assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Investment manager. Investment Manager, a U.S. entity, is  an investment entity within the meaning of paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of  this section. Investment Manager organizes and registers Fund A in  Country A. Investment Manager is authorized to facilitate purchases and  sales of financial assets held by Fund A in accordance with Fund A's  investment strategy. In every year since it was organized, Fund A has  earned more than 50% of its gross income from investing, reinvesting, or  trading in financial assets. Accordingly, Fund A is an investment entity  under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section and an FFI under paragraph  (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Foreign real estate investment fund that is managed by an  FFI. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that Fund A's assets  consist solely of non-debt, direct interests in real property located  within and without the United States. Fund A is not an   investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section, even  though it is managed by Investment Manager, because less than 50% of its  gross income is attributable to investing, reinvesting, or trading in  financial assets.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Trust managed by an individual. On January 1, 2013, X, an  individual, establishes Trust A, a nongrantor foreign trust for the  benefit of X's children, Y and Z. X appoints Trustee A, an individual,  to act as the trustee of Trust A. Trust A's assets consists solely of  financial assets, and its income consists solely of income from those  financial assets. Pursuant to the terms of the trust instrument, Trustee  A manages and administers the assets of the trust. Trustee A does not  hire any entity as a third-party service provider to perform any of the  activities described in paragraph (e)(4)(i)(A) of this section. Trust A  is not an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B) of this section  because it is managed solely by Trustee A, an individual.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Trust managed by a trust company. The facts are the same  as in Example 5, except that X hires Trust Company, an FFI, to act as  trustee on behalf of Trust A. As trustee, Trust Company manages and  administers the assets of Trust A in accordance with the terms of the  trust instrument for the benefit of Y and Z. Because Trust A is managed  by an FFI, Trust A is an investment entity under paragraph (e)(4)(i)(B)  of this section and an FFI under paragraph (e)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7.

A  distributor will also not be considered to have solicited customers or  account holders outside its country of incorporation or organization  merely because it advertises in print media or on a radio or television  station that is distributed or aired primarily within its country of  incorporation or organization but is also incidentally distributed or  aired in other countries, provided that the advertisement does not  indicate that the distributor maintains accounts for or provides  services to nonresidents and does not otherwise target or solicit U.S.  customers or account holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The distributor does not have more than $175 million in total  assets under management and has no more than $7 million in gross revenue  on its income statement for the most recent financial accounting year  and, if the distributor belongs to an expanded affiliated group, the  entire group does not have more than $500 million in total assets under  management or   more than $20 million in gross revenue for its most recent financial  accounting year on a combined or consolidated income statement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The distributor provides the restricted fund (or another  distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI or  registered deemed-compliant FFI, and with which the distributor has  entered into its distribution agreement) with a valid Form W-8  indicating that the distributor satisfies the requirements to be a  restricted distributor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt  or equity interests of the restricted fund--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Prohibits the distributor from distributing any securities to  specified U.S. persons, passive NFFEs that have one or more substantial  U.S. owners, and nonparticipating FFIs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Requires that if the distributor does distribute securities to  any of the persons described in this paragraph (f)(4)(vii), it will  cause the restricted fund to redeem or retire those interests, or it  will transfer those interests to a distributor that is a participating  FFI or reporting Model 1 FFI, within six months and the commission paid  to the distributor will be forfeited to the restricted fund or to the  participating FFI to which those interests are transferred; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Requires the distributor to notify the restricted fund (or  another distributor of the restricted fund that is a participating FFI,  reporting Model 1 FFI, or registered deemed-compliant FFI and with which  the distributor has entered into its distribution agreement) of a change  in the distributor's chapter 4 status within 90 days of the change in  status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> With respect to sales after December 31, 2011, and prior to  the time the restrictions described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii) of this  section were incorporated into the distribution agreement, either the  agreement governing the distributor's distribution of debt or equity  interests of the relevant FFI contained a prohibition of the sale of  such securities to U.S. entities or U.S. resident individuals, or the  distributor reviews all accounts relating to such sales in accordance  with the procedures (and time frames) described in Sec. 1.1471-4(c)  applicable to preexisting accounts and certifies that it has caused the  restricted fund to redeem or retire, or it has transferred all  securities sold to any of the persons described in paragraph (f)(4)(vii)  of this section. If the distribution agreement addressed in the prior  sentence contained only a prohibition on the sale of securities to U.S.  resident individuals, the distributor will not be required to review the  individual accounts relating to such sales but must review and make  certifications with respect to all entity accounts in the manner  described in the previous sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Recalcitrant account holders--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. This paragraph (g)  provides rules for determining when an account holder of a participating  FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI is a recalcitrant account holder.  Paragraph (g)(2) of this section defines the term recalcitrant account  holder.

For rules for determining the holder of an account, see  paragraph (a)(3) of this section. For the withholding requirements of an  FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see paragraph (f)  of this section and Sec. 1.1471-4(b). For the reporting requirements of  an FFI with respect to its recalcitrant account holders, see  Sec. 1.1471-4(d)(6), and, for the reporting required with respect to  payments made to such account holders, see Sec. 1.1474-1(d)(4)(iii). The  rules provided in this paragraph (g) to classify certain account holders  as recalcitrant account holders shall not, however, apply to a U.S.  branch of a participating FFI. Instead, a U.S. branch of a participating  FFI or registered deemed-compliant FFI that is treated as a U.S. person  shall apply the presumption rules of Sec. 1.1471-3(f) (for foreign  entity account holders) and chapter 3 or 61 (for individual payees) to  determine the status of a payee if it cannot reliably associate a  reportable payment made to the payee with valid documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Recalcitrant account holder.

Except as otherwise provided  in this paragraph (i), an expanded affiliated group is defined in  accordance with the principles of section 1504(a) to mean one or more  chains of members connected through ownership by a common parent entity  if the common parent entity directly owns stock or other equity  interests meeting the requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section  in at least one of the other members (for purposes of this paragraph  (i), the constructive ownership rules of section 318 do not apply).  Generally, only a corporation shall be treated as the common parent  entity of an expanded affiliated group, unless the taxpayer elects to  follow the approach described in paragraph (i)(10).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Member of expanded affiliated group. The term member of an  expanded affiliated group means a corporation or any entity other than a  corporation (such as a partnership or trust) with respect to which the  ownership requirements of paragraph (i)(4) of this section are met,  regardless of whether such entity is a U.S. person or a foreign person,  but excluding corporations described in paragraphs (1), (4), (6), (7),  or (8) of section 1504(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> are met if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em> of this section,  a corporation (except the common parent entity) will be considered owned  by another member entity or by the common parent entity if more than 50  percent of the total voting power of the stock of such corporation and  more than 50 percent of the total value of the stock of such corporation  is owned directly by one or more other members of the group (including  the common parent entity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Stock not to include certain preferred stock. For purposes of  this paragraph (i)(4), the term stock does not include any stock which  is described in section 1504(a)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Valuation. For purposes of section 1471(e) and this section, all  shares of stock within a single class are considered to have the same  value in determining the ownership percentage. Thus, control premiums  and minority blockage discounts within a single class are not taken into  account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnerships. For purposes of paragraph (i)(2) of this section,  a partnership will be considered owned by another member entity  (including the common parent entity) if more than 50 percent (by value)  of the capital or   profits interest in the partnership is owned directly by one or more  other members of the group (including the common parent entity).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Trusts.

A beneficial interest in  a trust includes an interest held by an entity treated as a grantor or  other owner of the trust under sections 671 through 679 and a beneficial  trust interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Treatment of warrants, options, and obligations convertible into  equity for determining ownership. For purposes of paragraph (i)(4) of  this section, ownership of warrants, options, obligations convertible  into the equity of a corporation or entity other than a corporation, and  other similar interests is not considered for purposes of determining  whether an entity is a member of an expanded affiliated group, except as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(4)</em> of this section to  the extent that the common parent or member of the expanded affiliated  group that holds such instrument also maintains voting rights with  respect to such corporation. However, interests described in  Sec. 1.1504-4(d)(2) will not be treated as options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Ownership of a warrant, option, obligation convertible into an  equity interest, or other similar instrument creating an interest in a  corporation or entity other than a corporation will be considered for  purposes of paragraph (i)(4) of this section to the extent that such  instrument is reasonably certain to be exercised, based on all of the  facts and circumstances and in accordance with the principles set forth  in Sec. 1.1504-4(g).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exception for FFIs holding certain capital investments.  Notwithstanding paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(4) of this section, an  investment entity will not be considered a member of an expanded  affiliated group as a result of a contribution of seed capital by a  member of such expanded affiliated group if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The member that owns the investment entity is an FFI that is in  the business of providing seed capital to form investment entities, the  interests in which it intends to sell to investors that do not have a  relationship with each other described in section 267(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The investment entity is created in the ordinary course of such  other FFI's business described in paragraph (i)(6)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> As of the date the FFI acquired the equity interest, any  equity interest in the investment entity in excess of 50 percent of the  total value of the stock of the investment entity is intended to be held  by such other FFI (including ownership by other members of such other  FFI's expanded affiliated group) for no more than three years from the  date on which such other FFI first acquired an equity interest in the  investment entity; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of an equity interest that has been held by such  other FFI for over three years from the date referenced in paragraph  (i)(6)(iii) of this section, the aggregate value of the equity interest  held by such other FFI and the equity interests held by other members of  its expanded affiliated group is 50 percent or less of the total value  of the stock of the investment entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Seed capital. For purposes of this paragraph (i), the term seed  capital means an initial capital contribution made to an investment  entity that is intended as a temporary investment and is deemed by the  manager of the entity to be necessary or appropriate for the  establishment of the entity, such as for the purpose of establishing a  track record of investment performance for such entity, achieving  economies of scale for diversified investment, avoiding an artificially  high expense to return ratio, or similar purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em>, a change in voting rights includes a separation of voting rights  and value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Exception for limited life debt investment entities.

For  purposes of determining the composition of an expanded affiliated group,  an entity other than a corporation may elect to be treated as the common  parent entity. Taxpayers following this approach may not, in a later  year, follow the rule described in paragraph (i)(2) without the approval  of the Commissioner.
