This  exclusion is justified because Federal agencies seeking the Council's  comments under section 106 have the responsibility for complying with  NEPA on the action they propose. The Council's role is advisory and its  comments are to be considered in the agency decisionmaking process.  Coordination between the section 106 and the NEPA processes is set forth  in 36 CFR 800.9.</p>
