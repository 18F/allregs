                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The notice to the applicant of opportunity for a hearing on a  proposal by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs (the Commissioner) to  refuse to approve a medicated feed mill license application or to revoke  the approval of a medicated feed mill license will specify the grounds  upon which the Commissioner proposes to issue this order. On request of  the applicant, the Commissioner will explain the reasons for the action.  The notice of opportunity for a hearing will be published in the Federal  Register and will specify that the applicant has 30 days after issuance  of the notice within which the Commissioner is required to file a  written appearance electing whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not to avail himself of the opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the applicant fails to file a written appearance in answer to  the notice of opportunity for hearing, this failure will be construed as  an election not to avail himself of the opportunity for the hearing, and  the Commissioner without further notice may enter a final order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the applicant elects to avail himself of the opportunity for  a hearing, the applicant is required to file a written appearance  requesting the hearing within 30 days after the publication of the  notice, giving the reason why the application should not be refused or  the medicated feed mill license should not be revoked, together with a  well-organized and full-factual analysis of the information the  applicant is prepared to prove in support of his opposition to the  Commissioner's proposal. A request for a hearing may not rest upon mere  allegations or denials, but must set forth specific facts showing there  is a genuine and substantial issue of fact that requires a hearing. When  it clearly appears from the information in the application and from the  reasons and factual analysis in the request for the hearing that no  genuine and substantial issue of fact precludes the refusal to approve  the application or the revocation of approval of the application, the  Commissioner will enter an order on this information, stating his/her  findings and conclusions. If a hearing is requested and is justified by  the applicant's response to the notice of opportunity for a hearing, the  issues will be defined, an Administrative Law Judge will be named, and  the Judge shall issue a written notice of the time and place at which  the hearing will commence. In the case of denial of approval, such time  shall be not more than 90 days after the expiration of such 30 days  unless the Administrative Law Judge and the applicant otherwise agree;  and, in the case of withdrawal of approval, such time shall be as soon  as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The hearing will be open to the public; however, if the  Commissioner finds that portions of the application which serve as a  basis for the hearing contain information concerning a method or process  entitled to protection as a trade secret, the part of the hearing  involving such portions will not be public, unless the respondent so  specifies in the appearance.</p>
