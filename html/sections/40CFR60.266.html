If a flare is used to comply with Sec. 60.263, the sampling site shall be upstream of the flare. The sampling time shall include an integral number of furnace cycles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When sampling emissions from open electric submerged arc furnaces with wet scrubber control devices, sealed electric submerged arc furnaces, or semienclosed electric arc furnaces, the sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 60 minutes and 1.80 dscm (63.6 dscf).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When sampling emissions from other types of installations, the sampling time and sample volume for each run shall be at least 200 minutes and 5.66 dscm (200 dscf).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measurement device of Sec. 60.265(b) shall be used to determine the average furnace power input (P) during each run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Method 9 and the procedures in Sec. 60.11 shall be used to determine opacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The emission rate correction factor, integrated sampling procedure of Method 3B shall be used to determine the CO concentration. The sample shall be taken simultaneously with each particulate matter sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the particulate matter run, the maximum open hood area (in hoods with segmented or otherwise moveable sides) under which the process is expected to be operated and remain in compliance with all standards shall be recorded. Any future operation of the hooding system with open areas in excess of the maximum is not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To comply with Sec. 60.265 (d) or (f), the owner or operator shall use the monitoring devices in Sec. 60.265 (c) or (e) to make the required measurements as determined during the performance test.
