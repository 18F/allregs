                            <p class="depth0">NCUA maintains current indices providing identifying information for the public for any matter referred to in Sec. 792.02, issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967. The listing of material in an index is for the convenience of possible users and does not constitute a determination that all of the items listed will be disclosed. NCUA has determined that publication of the indices is unnecessary and impractical. You may obtain copies of indices by making a request to the NCUA, Office of General Counsel, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, VA 22314-2387, Attn: FOIA Officer or as indicated on the NCUA Web site at www.ncua.gov. The indices are available for public inspection and copying and are provided at their duplication cost. The indices are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NCUA Publications List: Manuals relating to general and technical information, booklets published by NCUA, and the Credit Union Directory. The NCUA Publications list is available on the NCUA web site.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Directives Control Index: A list of statements of policy, NCUA Instructions, Bulletins, Letters to Credit Unions, and certain internal manuals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Popular FOIA Index: Records released in response to a FOIA request, that NCUA determines are likely to be

the subject of subsequent requests because of the nature of their subject matter. The Popular FOIA Index is available on the NCUA web site.
