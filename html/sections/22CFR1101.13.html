The term promptly in this paragraph means within thirty (30) days  (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays). If the PA Officer cannot  make the determination within thirty (30) days, the individual will be  advised in writing of the reason therefor and of the estimated date by  which the determination will be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Whenever an individual's record is corrected or amended pursuant  to a request by that individual, the PA Officer shall notify all persons  and agencies to which copies of the record had been disclosed prior to  its correction or amendment, if an accounting of such disclosure  required by the Act was made. The notification shall require a receipt  agency maintaining the record to acknowledge receipt of the  notification, to correct or amend the record, and to apprise any agency  or person to which it has disclosed the record of the substance of the  correction or amendment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following criteria will be considered by the PA Officer in  reviewing a request for correction or amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The sufficiency of the evidence submitted by the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The factual accuracy of the information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The relevance and necessity of the information in terms of  purpose for which it was collected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The timeliness and currency of the information in light of the  purpose for which it was collected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The completeness of the information in terms of the purpose for  which it was collected;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The degree of possibility that denial of the request could  unfairly result in determinations adverse to the individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The character of the record sought to be corrected or amended;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The propriety and feasibility of complying with the specific  means of correction or amendment requested by the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Section will not undertake to gather evidence for the  individual, but does reserve the right to verify the evidence which the  individual submits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Correction or amendment of a record requested by an individual  will be denied only upon a determination by the PA Officer that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual has failed to establish, by a preponderance of  the evidence, the propriety of the correction or amendment in light of  the criteria set forth in paragraph (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The record sought to be corrected or amended was compiled in a  terminated judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to  which the individual was a party or participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The record sought to be corrected or amended is the subject of a  pending   judicial, quasi-judicial or quasi-legislative proceeding to which the  individual is a party or participant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The correction or amendment would violate a duly enacted statute  or promulgated regulation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The individual unreasonably has failed to comply with the  procedural requirements of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a request is partially granted and partially denied, the PA  Officer shall follow the appropriate procedures of this section as to  the records within the grant and the records within the denial.</p>
