For any facility of a refiner or importer of conventional gasoline, the annual average baseline values of the facility's exhaust benzene emissions, exhaust toxics emissions, NOX emissions, sulfur, olefins and T90 shall be determined using the following equation:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR16FE94.012
