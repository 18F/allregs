An Interactive Data Financial Report must consist of only a complete set of information for all periods required to be presented in the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing, no more and no less, for the following categories, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The complete set of the electronic filer's financial statements (which includes the face of the financial statements and all footnotes); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All schedules set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter) related to the electronic filer's financial statements.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (b): It is not permissible for the Interactive Data Financial Report to present only partial face financial statements, such as by excluding comparative financial information for prior periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Format--Generally. An Interactive Data Financial Report must comply with the following requirements, except as modified by paragraph (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, with respect to the corresponding data in the Related Official Financial Report Filing consisting of footnotes to financial statements or financial statement schedules as set forth in Article 12 of Regulation S-X (Sec. Sec. 210.12-01 through 210.12-29 of this chapter):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Data elements and labels--(i) Element accuracy.

Each data element contained in the Interactive Data Financial Report is matched with an appropriate tag from the most recent version of the standard list of tags specified by the EDGAR Filer Manual. A tag is appropriate only when its standard definition, standard label, and other attributes as and to the extent identified in the list of tags match the information to be tagged, except that:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Labels. An electronic filer must create and use a new special label to modify a tag's existing standard label when that tag is an appropriate tag in

all other respects (i.e., in order to use a tag from the standard list of tags only its label needs to be changed); and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Elements. An electronic filer must create and use a new special element if and only if an appropriate tag does not exist in the standard list of tags for reasons other than or in addition to an inappropriate standard label; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional mark-up related content.
