Such activities normally  would include making campaign speeches, distributing campaign  literature, issuing press releases, maintaining a campaign committee,  and establishing campaign headquarters (even though the headquarters in  some instances might be the residence of the candidate or his or her  campaign manager). Not all of the listed activities are necessarily  required in each case to demonstrate a substantial showing, and there  may be activities not listed herein which would contribute to such a  showing.
