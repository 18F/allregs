                            <p class="depth0">Rule 24(b) of the 72 COLREGS states that when a pushing vessel and a vessel being pushed ahead are rigidly connected in a composite unit, they are regarded as a power-driven vessel and must exhibit the lights under Rule 23. A ``composite unit'' is interpreted to be a pushing vessel that is rigidly connected by mechanical means to a vessel being pushed so they react to sea and swell as one vessel. ``Mechanical means'' does not include the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hawsers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Wires.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Chains.
