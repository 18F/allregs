Under the provisions of General Note 3(a)(iv), Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTSUS), the following goods may be eligible for duty-free treatment when imported into the customs territory of the United States from an insular possession of the United States:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in Additional U.S. Note 5 to Chapter 91, HTSUS, and except as provided in Additional U.S. Note 2 to Chapter 96, HTSUS, and except as provided in section 423 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2703 note), goods which are the growth or product of any such insular possession, and goods which were manufactured or produced in any such insular possession from materials that were the growth, product or manufacture of any such insular possession or of the customs territory of the United States, or of both, provided that such goods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Do not contain foreign materials valued at either more than 70 percent of the total value of the goods or, in the case of goods described in section 213(b) of the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (19 U.S.C. 2703(b)), more than 50 percent of the total value of the goods; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Come to the customs territory of the United States directly from any such insular possession; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Goods previously imported into the customs territory of the United States with payment of all applicable duties and taxes imposed upon or by reason of importation, provided that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The goods were shipped from the United States directly to the insular possession and are returned from the insular possession to the United States by direct shipment; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There was no remission, refund or drawback of such duties or taxes in connection with the shipment of the goods from the United States to the insular possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Origin of goods. For purposes of this section, goods will be considered to be the growth or product of, or manufactured or produced in, an insular possession if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The goods are wholly the growth or product of the insular possession; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The goods became a new and different article of commerce as a result of production or manufacture performed in the insular possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Foreign materials. For purposes of this section, the term ``foreign materials'' covers any material incorporated in goods described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section other than:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A material which was wholly the growth or product of an insular possession or of the customs territory of the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A material which was substantially transformed in an insular possession or in the customs territory of the United States into a new and different article of commerce which was then used in an insular possession in the production or manufacture of a new and different article which is shipped directly to the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A material which may be imported into the customs territory of the United States from a foreign country and entered free of duty either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the time the goods which incorporate the material are entered; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At the time the material is imported into the insular possession, provided that the material was incorporated into the goods during the 18-month period after the date on which the material was imported into the insular possession.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign materials value limitation. For purposes of this section, the determination of whether goods contain foreign materials valued at more than 70 or 50 percent of the total value of the goods will be made based on a comparison between:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The landed cost of the foreign materials, consisting of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manufacturer's actual cost for the materials or, where a material is provided to the manufacturer without charge or at less than fair market value, the sum of all expenses incurred in the growth, production, or manufacture of the material, including general expenses, plus an amount for profit; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost of transporting those materials to the insular possession, but excluding any duties or taxes assessed

on the materials by the insular possession and any charges which may accrue after landing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The final appraised value of the goods imported into the customs territory of the United States, as determined in accordance with section 402 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1401a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Direct shipment--(1) General. For purposes of this section, goods will be considered to come to the United States directly from an insular possession, or to be shipped from the United States directly to an insular possession and returned from the insular possession to the United States by direct shipment, only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. For purposes of this section, goods will be considered to come to the United States directly from an insular possession, or to be shipped from the United States directly to an insular possession and returned from the insular possession to the United States by direct shipment, only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The goods proceed directly to or from the insular possession without passing through any foreign territory or country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The goods proceed to or from the insular possession through a foreign territory or country, the goods do not enter into the commerce of the foreign territory or country while en route to the insular possession or the United States, and the invoices, bills of lading, and other shipping documents show the insular possession or the United States as the final destination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The goods proceed to or from the insular possession through a foreign territory or country, the invoices and other shipping documents do not show the insular possession or the United States as the final destination, and the goods:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Remained under the control of the customs authority of the foreign territory or country;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Did not enter into the commerce of the foreign territory or country except for the purpose of sale other than at retail, and the port director is satisfied that the importation into the insular possession or the United States results from the original commercial transaction between the importer and the producer or the latter's sales agent; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Were not subjected to operations in the foreign territory or country other than loading and unloading and other activities necessary to preserve the goods in good condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evidence of direct shipment.

Evidence of direct shipment will not be required when the port director is otherwise satisfied, taking into consideration the kind and value of the merchandise, that the goods qualify for duty-free treatment under General Note 3(a)(iv), HTSUS, and paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Documentation.

The importer must provide CBP Form 3229 upon request by the port director or his delegate. Except in the case of goods which incorporate a material described in paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, a certificate of origin will not be required for any shipment eligible for informal entry under Sec. 143.21 of this chapter or in any case where the port director is otherwise satisfied that the goods qualify for duty-free treatment under paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When goods are sought to be admitted free of duty as provided in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, an importer must have in his possession at the time of entry or entry summary a completed certificate of origin on CBP Form 3229, showing that the goods comply with the requirements for duty-free entry set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.
