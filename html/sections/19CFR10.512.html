                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of  this subpart is responsible for the truthfulness of the claim and of all  the information and data contained in the supporting statement provided  for in Sec. 10.511 of this subpart, for submitting any supporting  documents requested by CBP, and for the truthfulness of the information  contained in those documents. However, an importer will not be subject  to civil or administrative penalties under 19 U.S.C. 1592 for making an  invalid claim for preferential tariff treatment or submitting an  incorrect supporting statement, provided that the importer promptly and  voluntarily corrects the claim or supporting statement and pays any duty  owing (see Sec. Sec. 10.561 and 10.562 of this subpart). In instances  in which CBP requests the submission of supporting documents, CBP will  allow for the direct submission by the exporter or producer of business  confidential or other sensitive information, including cost and sourcing  information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compliance. In order to make a claim for preferential tariff  treatment under Sec. 10.510(a) of this subpart, the importer:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must have records that explain how the importer came to the  conclusion that the good qualifies for preferential tariff treatment.  Those records must include documents that support a claim that the  article in question qualifies for preferential tariff treatment because  it meets the applicable rules of origin set forth in General Note 25,  HTSUS, and in this subpart. Those records may include a properly  completed importer's supporting statement as set forth in Sec. 10.511  of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> May be required to present evidence that the conditions set  forth in Sec. 10.542 of this subpart were met if the imported article  was shipped through an intermediate country.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Information provided by exporter or producer. The fact that the  importer has made a claim or supporting statement based on information  provided by an exporter or producer will not relieve the importer of the  responsibility referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (a) of  this section.</p>
