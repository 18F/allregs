                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Trustees. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an incident affects the interests of multiple  trustees, the trustees should act jointly under this part to ensure that  full restoration is achieved without double recovery of damages. For  joint assessments, trustees must designate one or more Lead  Administrative Trustee(s) to act as coordinators.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is a reasonable basis for dividing the natural resource  damage assessment, trustees may act independently under this part, so  long as there is no double recovery of damages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Trustees may develop pre-incident or incident-specific memoranda  of understanding to coordinate their activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Response agencies. Trustees must coordinate their activities  conducted concurrently with response operations with response agencies  consistent with the NCP and any pre-incident plans developed under Sec.  990.15(a) of this part. Trustees may develop pre-incident memoranda of  understanding to coordinate their activities with response agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Responsible parties--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Invitation. Trustees must invite the  responsible parties to participate in the natural resource damage  assessment described in this part. The invitation to participate should  be in writing, and a written response by the responsible parties is  required to confirm the desire to participate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Timing. The invitation to participate should be extended to  known responsible parties as soon as practicable, but not later than the  delivery of the ``Notice of Intent to Conduct Restoration Planning,''  under Sec. 990.44 of this part, to the responsible party.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agreements. Trustees and responsible parties should consider  entering into binding agreements to facilitate their interactions and  resolve any disputes during the assessment. To maximize cost- effectiveness and cooperation, trustees and responsible parties should  attempt to develop a set of agreed-upon facts concerning the incident  and/or assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nature and extent of participation. If the responsible parties  accept the invitation to participate, the scope of that participation  must be determined by the trustees, in light of the considerations in  paragraph (c)(5) of this section. At a minimum, participation will  include notice of trustee determinations required under this part, and  notice and opportunity to comment on documents or plans that  significantly affect the nature and extent of the assessment. Increased  levels of participation by responsible parties may be developed at the  mutual agreement of the trustees and the responsible parties. Trustees  will objectively consider all written comments provided by the  responsible parties, as well as any other recommendations or proposals  that the responsible parties submit in writing to the Lead  Administrative Trustee. Submissions by the responsible parties   will be included in the administrative record. Final authority to make  determinations regarding injury and restoration rest solely with the  trustees. Trustees may end participation by responsible parties who,  during the conduct of the assessment, in the sole judgment of the  trustees, cause interference with the trustees' ability to fulfill their  responsibilities under OPA and this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Considerations. In determining the nature and extent of  participation by the responsible parties or their representatives,  trustees may consider such factors as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the responsible parties have been identified;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The willingness of responsible parties to participate in the  assessment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The willingness of responsible parties to fund assessment  activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The willingness and ability of responsible parties to conduct  assessment activities in a technically sound and timely manner and to be  bound by the results of jointly agreed upon studies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The degree of cooperation of the responsible parties in the  response to the incident; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The actions of the responsible parties in prior assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Request for alternative assessment procedures. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The  participating responsible parties may request that trustees use  assessment procedures other than those selected by the trustees if the  responsible parties:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Identify the proposed procedures to be used that meet the  requirements of Sec. 990.27 of this part, and provide reasons  supporting the technical adequacy and appropriateness of such procedures  for the incident and associated injuries;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Advance to the trustees the trustees' reasonable estimate of the  cost of using the proposed procedures; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Agree not to challenge the results of the proposed procedures.  The request from the responsible parties may be made at any time, but no  later than, fourteen (14) days of being notified of the trustees'  proposed assessment procedures for the incident or the injury.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Trustees may reject the responsible parties' proposed  assessment procedures if, in the sole judgment of the trustees, the  proposed assessment procedures:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Are not technically feasible;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Are not scientifically or technically sound;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Would inadequately address the natural resources and services of  concern;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Could not be completed within a reasonable time frame; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Do not meet the requirements of Sec. 990.27 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Disclosure. Trustees must document in the administrative record  and Restoration Plan the invitation to the responsible parties to  participate, and briefly describe the nature and extent of the  responsible parties' participation. If the responsible parties'  participation is terminated during the assessment, trustees must provide  a brief explanation of this decision in the administrative record and  Restoration Plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public. Trustees must provide opportunities for public  involvement after the trustees' decision to develop restoration plans or  issuance of any notices to that effect, as provided in Sec. 990.55 of  this part. Trustees may also provide opportunities for public  involvement at any time prior to this decision if such involvement may  enhance trustees' decisionmaking or avoid delays in restoration.</p>
