                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. An easement is a property right of specified use and  enjoyment falling short of fee ownership. It follows that the value of  an easement is less than the market value of fee title to the same  portion of property (exclusive of severance damages to residual  portions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Measure of value. The measure of compensation for an easement is  the amount by which market value of the ownership is diminished by the  imposition of the easement. This should be developed by use of the  ``before'' and ``after'' method of appraisal, the difference being the  value of the taking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Flowage easements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appraisal of flowage easements will  not be undertaken until flood frequency surveys have been completed and  approved by proper authority. The flood frequency data will be made  available to the appraisers with the definite understanding that it is  to be accepted as one of the controlling factors in estimating the  market value of the easements. The appraiser's certificate should be  qualified to include the assumption that the frequency data is correct  and that he has no responsibility therefore.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The market value of fee simple title to each property over which  a flowage easement is required will first be appraised in the usual  manner. This estimate will be followed by appraisal of the market value  of the property after imposition of the easement. The market value of  the easement is then computed on the basis of the amount the market  value of fee title is reduced by imposition of the easement. The  appraiser will give full consideration to all factors having a bearing  on the reduction in value of the parcel on which the easement is to be  imposed. Each appraisal report will include complete information as to  estimated flood frequency pertaining to each parcel appraised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The appraiser's major problem in appraising tracts having  considerable value is the development of his value estimate after the  imposition of the easement. The market data approach to value is limited  in this phase of the appraisal to index sales of land reflecting the  ``use adaptability'' of lands to a less profitable purpose. Typical of  such change in highest and best use are the conversion of row crop land  and orchard land to pasture and forestry. Likewise, the cost approach to  value is applicable only to land improvements   and structures to be removed or destroyed. It is, therefore, considered  essential that flowage easement appraisals reflect, in adequate detail,  changes in utility by the development and use of the earnings approach  to value before and after imposition in all cases involving lands  capable of producing income. The ratios thus developed in ``before'' and  ``after'' values for income producing lands should prove to be helpful  in developing appropriate ratios for nonproductive lands.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In those instances where the type of land, topography, flood  frequency and duration data clearly indicate that a minimal change in  value (not to exceed $100) will result from exercise of the required  rights, a brief appraisal is authorized. The appraisal report will  contain as a minimum a complete statement of pertinent facts, including  information regarding flood frequency and duration data pertaining to  the property appraised. In the event condemnation is required to acquire  the necessary rights, an acceptable ``before'' and ``after'' appraisal  will be prepared prior to the institution of condemnation proceedings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A tract map showing each contour level of varying flood  frequency will be made a part of each appraisal report. This map should  facilitate review of the appraisals and serve as an aid to the  negotiator in his contacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Other easements. It is recognized that many other types of  easements, i.e., road, pipeline, restrictive, borrow, transmission line,  flight, spoil, etc. are to be appraised. In all instances, the measure  of value is still the same, the amount by which the market value of the  ownership is diminished by the imposition.</p>
