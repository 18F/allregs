                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For projects believed to maximize domestic energy supplies, a  person may request priority rating authority for scarce, critical, and  essential supplies of materials, equipment, and services (related to the  production of materials or equipment, or the installation, repair, or  maintenance of equipment) by submitting a request to the Department of  Energy. Further information may be obtained from the Department of  Energy, Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, 1000  Independence Avenue SW., Washington, DC 20585.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Department of Energy notifies the Department of Commerce  that the project maximizes domestic energy supplies and that the  materials, equipment, or services are critical and essential, the  Department of Commerce will determine whether the items in question are  scarce, and, if they are scarce, whether there is a need to use the  priorities authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Scarcity implies an unusual difficulty in obtaining the  materials, equipment, or services in a time frame consistent with the  timely completion of the energy project. In determining scarcity, the  Department of Commerce may consider factors such as the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Value and volume of material or equipment shipments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Consumption of material and equipment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Volume and market trends of imports and exports;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Domestic and foreign sources of supply;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Normal levels of inventories;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Rates of capacity utilization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Volume of new orders; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Lead times for new orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In finding whether there is a need to use the priorities  authority, the Department of Commerce may consider alternative supply  solutions and other measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> After the Department of Commerce has conducted its analysis, it  will advise the Department of Energy whether the two findings have been  satisfied. If the findings are satisfied, the Department of Commerce  will authorize the Department of Energy to grant the use of a priority  rating to the applicant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Schedule I to this part includes a list of approved programs to  support the maximization of domestic energy supplies. A Department of  Energy regulation setting forth the procedures and criteria used by the  Department of Energy in making its determination and findings is  published in 10 CFR part 216.
