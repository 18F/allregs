                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Alternative elections. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer entitled to the benefits  of section 1071 in respect of a sale or exchange of property may elect--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To treat such sale or exchange as an involuntary conversion  under the provisions of section 1033; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To treat such sale or exchange as an involuntary conversion  under the provisions of section 1033, and in addition elect to reduce  the basis of property, in accordance with the regulations prescribed in  Sec. 1.1071-3, by all or   part of the gain that would otherwise be recognized under section 1033;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> To reduce the basis of property, in accordance with the  regulations prescribed in Sec. 1.1071-3, by all or part of the gain  realized upon the sale or exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The effect of the provisions of subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph is, in general, to grant the taxpayer an election to treat the  proceeds of the sale or exchange as the proceeds of an involuntary  conversion subject to the provisions of section 1033, and a further  election to reduce the basis of certain property owned by the taxpayer  by the amount of the gain realized upon the sale or exchange to the  extent of that portion of the proceeds which is not treated as the  proceeds of an involuntary conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An election in respect to a sale or exchange under section 1071  shall be irrevocable and binding for the taxable year in which the sale  or exchange takes place and for all subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application of section 1033. (1) If the taxpayer elects, under  either paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of this section, to treat the sale  or exchange as an involuntary conversion, the provisions of section  1033, as modified by section 1071, together with the regulations  prescribed under such sections, shall be applicable in determining the  amount of recognized gain and the basis of property required as a result  of such sale or exchange. For the purposes of section 1071 and the  regulations thereunder, stock of a corporation operating a radio  broadcasting station shall be treated as property similar or related in  service or use to the property sold or exchanged. Securities of such a  corporation other than stock, or securities of a corporation not  operating a radio broadcasting station, do not constitute property  similar or related in service or use to the property sold or exchanged.  If the taxpayer exercises the election referred to in paragraph  (a)(1)(i) of this section, the gain realized upon such sale or exchange  shall be recognized to the extent of that part of the money received  upon the sale or exchange which is not expended in the manner prescribed  in section 1033 and the regulations thereunder. If, however, the  taxpayer exercises the elections referred to in paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of  this section, the amount of the gain which would be recognized,  determined in the same manner as in the case of an election under  paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> of this section, shall not be recognized but shall  be applied to reduce the basis of property, remaining in the hands of  the taxpayer after such sale or exchange or acquired by him during the  same taxable year, which is of a character subject to the allowance for  depreciation under section 167. Such reduction of basis shall be made in  accordance with and under the conditions prescribed by Sec. 1.1071-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the application of section 1033 to determine the recognized  gain and the basis of property acquired as a result of a sale or  exchange pursuant to an election under paragraph (a)(1) (i) or (ii) of  this section, the entire amount of the proceeds of such sale or exchange  shall be taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Example. The application of the provisions of section 1071 may  be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: A, who makes his return on a calendar year basis, sold in  1954, for $100,000 cash, stock of X Corporation, which operates a radio  broadcasting station. A's basis of this stock was $75,000. The sale was  certified by the Federal Communications Commission as provided in  section 1071. Soon after, in the same taxable year, A used $50,000 of  the proceeds of the sale to purchase stock in Y Corporation, which  operates a radio broadcasting station. A elected in his 1954 return to  treat such sale and purchase as an involuntary conversion subject to the  provisions of section 1033. He also elected at the same time to reduce  the basis of depreciable property by the amount of the gain that  otherwise would be recognized under the provisions of section 1033, as  made applicable by section 1071. The sale results in a recognized gain  of $25,000 under section 1033. However, this gain is not recognized in  this case because the taxpayer elected to reduce the basis of other  property by the amount of the gain. This may be shown as follows:  (1) Sale price of X Corporation stock..............             $100,000 Basis for gain or loss.............................               75,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------</p><p class="depth0">Gain realized....................................               25,000</p><p class="depth0">==================== Proceeds of sale...................................              100,000 Amount expended to replace property sold...........               50,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------</p><p class="depth0">Amount not expended in manner prescribed in                     50,000</p><p class="depth0">section 1033....................................</p><p class="depth0">====================</p><p class="depth0">Realized gain, recognized under section 1033 (not                 25,000</p><p class="depth0">to exceed the unexpended portion of proceeds of</p><p class="depth0">sale).............................................

The $50,000 basis is computed as follows:  Basis of property sold (converted).................              $75,000 Less: Amount of proceeds not expended..............               50,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------</p><p class="depth0">Balance..........................................               25,000 Plus amount of gain recognized under section 1033..               25,000</p><p class="depth0">--------------------</p><p class="depth0">Basis of Y Corporation stock in A's hands........               50,000</p><p class="depth0"></p>
