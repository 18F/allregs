                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (8) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions for four  consecutive pushes per operating day, except you may make fewer or non- consecutive observations as permitted by Sec. 63.7291(a)(3). Maintain  records of the pushing schedule for each oven and records indicating the  legitimate operational reason for any change in the pushing schedule  according to Sec. 63.7291(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Observe and record the opacity of fugitive emissions from each  oven in a battery at least once every 90 days. If an oven cannot be  observed during a 90-day period, observe and record the opacity of the  first push of that oven following the close of the 90-day period that  can be read in accordance with the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1)  through (8) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make all observations and calculations for opacity observations  of fugitive pushing emissions in accordance with Method 9 in appendix A  to 40 CFR part 60 using a Method 9 certified observer unless you have an  approved alternative procedure under paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Record pushing opacity observations at 15-second intervals as  required in section 2.4 of Method 9 (appendix A to 40 CFR part 60). The  requirement in section 2.4 of Method 9 for a minimum of 24 observations  does not apply, and the data reduction requirements in section 2.5 of  Method 9 do not apply. The requirement in Sec. 63.6(h)(5)(ii)(B) for  obtaining at least 3 hours of observations (thirty 6-minute averages) to  demonstrate initial compliance does not apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If fewer than six but at least four 15-second observations can  be made, use the average of the total number of observations to  calculate average opacity for the push. Missing one or more observations  during the push (e.g., as the quench car passes behind a building) does  not invalidate the observations before or after the interference for  that push. However, a minimum of four 15-second readings must be made  for a valid observation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Begin observations for a push at the first detectable movement  of the coke mass. End observations of a push when the quench car enters  the quench tower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a battery without a cokeside shed, observe fugitive pushing  emissions from a position at least 10 meters from the quench car that  provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences from the topside  of the battery. This may require the observer to be positioned at an  angle to the quench car rather than perpendicular to it. Typical  interferences to avoid include emissions from open standpipes and  charging. Observe the opacity of emissions above the battery top with  the sky as the background where possible. Record the oven number of any  push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For a battery with a cokeside shed, the observer must be in a  position that provides an unobstructed view and avoids interferences  from the topside of the battery. Typical interferences to avoid include  emissions from open standpipes and charging. Observations must include  any fugitive emissions that escape from the top of the shed, from the  ends of the shed, or from the area where the shed is joined to the  battery. If the observer does not have a clear view to identify when a  push starts or ends, a second person can be positioned to signal the  start or end of the push and notify the observer when to start or end  the observations. Radio communications with other plant personnel (e.g.,  pushing ram operator or quench car operator) may also serve to notify  the observer of the start or end of a push. Record the oven number of  any push not observed because of obstructions or interferences.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may reposition after the push to observe emissions during  travel if necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If it is infeasible to implement the procedures in paragraphs  (a)(1) through (6) of this section for an oven due to physical  obstructions, nighttime pushes, or other reasons, you may apply to your  permitting authority for permission to use an alternative procedure. The  application must provide a detailed explanation of why it is infeasible  to use the procedures in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this section,  identify the oven and battery numbers, and describe the alternative  procedure. An alternative procedure must identify whether the coke in  that oven is not completely coked, either before, during, or after an  oven is pushed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For each oven observed that exceeds an opacity of 30 percent for  any short battery or 35 percent for any tall battery, you must take  corrective action and/or increase the coking time in accordance with  Sec. 63.7291(a). Maintain records documenting conformance with the  requirements in Sec. 63.7291(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> through (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measuring and recording the temperature of all flues on two  ovens per day within 2 hours before the oven's scheduled pushing time  and ensuring that the temperature of each oven is measured and recorded  at least once every month;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recording the time each oven is charged and pushed and  calculating and recording the net coking time for each oven; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Increasing the coking time for each oven that falls below the  minimum flue temperature trigger established for that oven's coking time  in the written plan required in Sec. 63.7292(a)(1), assigning the oven  to the oven-directed program, and recording all relevant information  according to the requirements in Sec. 63.7292(a)(4) including, but not  limited to, daily pushing schedules, diagnostic procedures, corrective  actions, and oven repairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For each non-recovery coke oven battery subject to the work  practice standards in Sec. 63.7293(a), you must demonstrate continuous  compliance by maintaining records that document each visual inspection  of an oven prior to pushing and that the oven was not pushed unless  there was no smoke in the open space above the coke bed and there was an  unobstructed view of the door on the opposite side of the oven.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For each by-product coke oven battery subject to the work  practice   standard for soaking in Sec. 63.7294(a), you must demonstrate  continuous compliance by maintaining records that document conformance  with requirements in Sec. 63.7294(a)(1) through (5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> through  (3) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, including  records of the ambient temperature on any day that the baffles were not  washed; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintaining records of the source of makeup water to document  conformance with the requirement for acceptable makeup water in Sec.  63.7295(a)(2).</p>
