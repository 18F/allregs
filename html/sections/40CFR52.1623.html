                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General Conformity. (1) A letter, dated April 22, 1998, from the  Chief of Air Quality Bureau New Mexico Environment Department to the EPA  Regional Office, commits the State to remove Section 110.C from its rule  for making the State's rule consistent with Federal rule. Specifically,  the letter states that:</p><p class="depth0">This letter is regarding our general conformity rule, 20 NMAC 2.98-- Conformity of General Federal Actions to the State Implementation Plan.  We have been reviewing paragraph 110.C under Section 110--Reporting  Requirements. This is the paragraph in which the Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) had submitted a comment of concern to EPA, during  EPA's proposed/final approval period for our rule. This comment caused  EPA to withdraw its approval. The FAA had commented that New Mexico was  more stringent than EPA, since our rule does not apply to non-Federal  agencies. Our analysis has determined that our inclusion of this  paragraph may make our rule more   stringent than EPA, and should not have been included. The paragraph had  originally come from a STAPPA/ALAPCO model rule. New Mexico had never  intended to be more stringent than EPA with regards to general  conformity. Hence, the State commits to putting 20 NMAC 2.98 on our  regulatory agenda and plan to delete this paragraph within one year from  the Federal Register publication of final notice of conditional approval  to New Mexico's general conformity SIP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the State ultimately fails to meet its commitment to remove  this section from its rule within one year of publication of this  conditional approval, then EPA's conditional action will automatically  convert to a final disapproval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]  [63 FR 48109, Sept. 9, 1998]    Sec. Sec. 52.1624-52.1626  [Reserved]</p>
