                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operator responsible for the payment of benefits in a  claim adjudicated under this part (the ``responsible operator'') shall  be the potentially liable operator, as determined in accordance with  Sec. 725.494, that most recently employed the miner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If more than one potentially liable operator may be deemed to  have employed the miner most recently, then the liability for any  benefits payable as a result of such employment shall be assigned as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> First, to the potentially liable operator that directed,  controlled, or supervised the miner;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Second, to any potentially liable operator that may be  considered a successor operator with respect to miners employed by the  operator identified in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Third, to any other potentially liable operator which may be  deemed to have been the miner's most recent employer pursuant to Sec.  725.493.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the operator that most recently employed the miner may not be  considered a potentially liable operator, as determined in accordance  with Sec. 725.494, the responsible operator shall be the potentially  liable operator that next most recently employed the miner. Any  potentially liable operator that employed the miner for at least one day  after December 31, 1969 may be deemed the responsible operator if no  more recent employer may be considered a potentially liable operator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the miner's most recent employment by an operator ended while  the operator was authorized to self-insure its liability under part 726  of this title, and that operator no longer possesses sufficient assets  to secure the payment of benefits, the provisions of paragraph (a)(3)  shall be inapplicable with respect to any operator that employed the  miner only before he was employed by such self-insured operator. If no  operator that employed the miner after his employment with the self- insured operator meets the conditions of Sec. 725.494, the claim of the  miner or his survivor shall be the responsibility of the Black Lung  Disability Trust Fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in this section and Sec. 725.408(a)(3), with  respect to the adjudication of the identity of a responsible operator,  the Director shall bear the burden of proving that the responsible  operator initially found liable for the payment of benefits pursuant to  Sec. 725.410 (the ``designated responsible operator'') is a potentially  liable operator. It shall be presumed, in the absence of evidence to the  contrary, that the designated responsible operator is capable of  assuming liability for the payment of benefits in accordance with Sec.  725.494(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The designated responsible operator shall bear the burden of  proving either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That it does not possess sufficient assets to secure the payment  of benefits in accordance with Sec. 725.606; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That it is not the potentially liable operator that most  recently employed the miner. Such proof must include evidence that the  miner was employed as a miner after he or she stopped working for the  designated responsible operator and that the person by whom he or she  was employed is a potentially liable operator within the meaning of  Sec. 725.494. In order to establish that a more recent employer is a  potentially liable operator, the designated responsible operator must  demonstrate that the more recent employer possesses sufficient assets to  secure the payment of benefits in accordance with Sec. 725.606. The  designated responsible operator may satisfy its burden by presenting  evidence that the owner, if the more recent employer is a sole  proprietorship; the partners, if the more recent employer is a  partnership; or the president, secretary, and treasurer, if the more  recent employer is a corporation that failed to secure the payment of  benefits pursuant to part 726 of this subchapter, possess assets  sufficient to secure the payment of benefits, provided such assets may  be reached in a proceeding brought under subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> is not the operator that most  recently employed the miner, the record shall contain a statement from  the district director explaining the reasons for such designation. If  the reasons include the most recent employer's failure to meet the  conditions of Sec. 725.494(e), the record shall also contain a  statement that the Office has searched the files it maintains pursuant  to part 726, and that the   Office has no record of insurance coverage for that employer, or of  authorization to self-insure, that meets the conditions of Sec.  725.494(e)(1) or (e)(2). Such a statement shall be prima facie evidence  that the most recent employer is not financially capable of assuming its  liability for a claim. In the absence of such a statement, it shall be  presumed that the most recent employer is financially capable of  assuming its liability for a claim.</p>
