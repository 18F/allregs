If a trunk extends beyond such deck, the trunk volume shall be included.  Tonnage openings shall be considered as sealed for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Branch lines to the various cargo holds and 'tween decks shall  not be less than \3/4\-inch standard pipe size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No specific discharge rate need be applied to such systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em>. If fuel can drain from the compartment being  protected to an adjacent compartment, or if the compartments are not  entirely separate, the requirements for both compartments shall be used  to determine the amount of carbon dioxide to be provided.
