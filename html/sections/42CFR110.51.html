                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An injured countermeasure recipient (or his or her legal or personal representative) must submit all of the following documentation in order for the

Secretary to make a determination of eligibility:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A completed and signed Request Form submitted within the filing deadline described in Sec.  110.42; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient used or was administered a covered countermeasure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient sustained a covered injury, as defined in Sec.  110.3(g), in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec.  110.50; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A copy of each signed Authorization for Health Information Form authorizing the release of records to the Program that was sent by the requester to each healthcare provider instructing that the records be submitted directly to the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In certain circumstances, some of the above documentation may not be required, or additional documentation may be required, in which case the Secretary will so notify the requester. For example, the Secretary may require records sufficient to demonstrate that the injured countermeasure recipient was administered or used a covered countermeasure in accordance with the provisions of a Secretarial declaration, or in the good faith belief that it was so administered or used, if she is unable to determine this from the records submitted. In order to meet the specifications of a declaration, some individuals will need to show that the activity giving rise to the injury (i.e., administration or use of the covered countermeasure) was authorized in accordance with the public health and medical response of the Authority Having Jurisdiction, as defined in the pertinent declaration, to prescribe, administer, deliver, distribute or dispense the covered countermeasure following a declaration of an emergency, as defined in the pertinent declaration. For purposes of this part, this requirement can be satisfied by showing that the covered countermeasure was administered or used following the declaration of an emergency, as defined in the pertinent declaration, by an Authority Having Jurisdiction, as defined in the pertinent declaration either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pursuant to a written agreement or other formal arrangement with an Authority Having Jurisdiction; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with the written recommendations of an Authority Having Jurisdiction.</p>
