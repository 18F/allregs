                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability. Any respondent may move that the Office of  Enforcement produce for inspection and copying any statement of any  person called or to be called as a witness by the Office of Enforcement  that pertains, or is expected to pertain, to his or her direct testimony  and that would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18  U.S.C. 3500, if the adjudication proceeding were a criminal proceeding.  For purposes of this section, the term ``statement'' shall have the  meaning   set forth in 18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time  and place fixed by the hearing officer and shall be made available to  any party, provided, however, that the production shall be made under  conditions intended to preserve the items to be inspected or copied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to produce--harmless error. In the event that a  statement required to be made available to a respondent pursuant to this  section is not made available by the Office of Enforcement, no rehearing  or redecision of a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required  unless the respondent establishes that the failure to make the statement  available was not harmless error.</p>
