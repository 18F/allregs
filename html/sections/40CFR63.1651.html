                            <p class="depth0">Terms in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act (Act), in  subpart A of this part, or in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Bag leak detection system means a system that is capable of  continuously monitoring particulate matter (dust) loadings in the  exhaust of a baghouse in order to detect bag leaks and other upset  conditions. A bag leak detection system includes, but is not limited to,  an instrument that operates on triboelectric, light scattering, light  transmittance, or other effect to continuously monitor relative  particulate matter loadings.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means the equipment (including hoods, ducts, fans,  dampers,   etc.) used to capture or transport particulate matter generated by an  affected submerged arc furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Casting means the period of time from when molten ferroalloy falls  from the furnace tapping runner into the ladle until pouring into molds  is completed. This includes the following operations: ladle filling,  pouring alloy from one ladle to another, slag separation, slag removal,  and ladle transfer by crane, truck, or other conveyance.</p><p class="depth0">Crushing and screening equipment means the crushers, grinders,  mills, screens and conveying systems used to crush, size, and prepare  for packing manganese-containing materials, including raw materials,  intermediate products, and final products.</p><p class="depth0">Fugitive dust source means a stationary source from which manganese- bearing particles are discharged to the atmosphere due to wind or  mechanical inducement such as vehicle traffic. Fugitive dust sources  include plant roadways, yard areas, and outdoor material storage and  transfer operations.</p><p class="depth0">Furnace power input means the resistive electrical power consumption  of a submerged arc furnace, expressed as megawatts (MW).</p><p class="depth0">Malfunction means any sudden, infrequent, and not reasonably  preventable failure of air pollution control equipment, process  equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or usual manner which  causes, or has the potential to cause, the emission limitations in an  applicable standard to be exceeded. Failures caused in part by poor  maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions.</p><p class="depth0">Metal oxygen refining (MOR) process means the reduction of the  carbon content of ferromanganese through the use of oxygen.</p><p class="depth0">Open submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc furnace  that is equipped with a canopy hood above the furnace to collect primary  emissions.</p><p class="depth0">Operating time means the period of time in hours that the affected  source is in operation beginning at a startup and ending at the next  shutdown.</p><p class="depth0">Plant roadway means any area at a ferromanganese and silicomanganese  production facility that is subject to plant mobile equipment, such as  fork lifts, front end loaders, or trucks, carrying manganese-bearing  materials. Excluded from this definition are employee and visitor  parking areas, provided they are not subject to traffic by plant mobile  equipment.</p><p class="depth0">Primary emissions means gases and emissions collected by hoods and  ductwork located above an open furnace or under the cover of a semi- closed or sealed furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Sealed submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc furnace  equipped with a total enclosure or cover from which primary emissions  are evacuated directly.</p><p class="depth0">Semi-closed submerged arc furnace means an electric submerged arc  furnace equipped with a partially sealed cover over the furnace. This  cover is equipped with openings to allow penetration of the electrodes  into the furnace. Mix is introduced into the furnace around the  electrode holes forming a partial seal between the electrodes and the  cover. Furnace emissions generated under the cover are ducted to an  emission control device. Emissions that escape the cover are collected  and vented through stacks directly to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Shop means the building which houses one or more submerged arc  furnaces.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the cessation of operation of an affected source for  any purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the setting in operation of an affected source for any  purpose.</p><p class="depth0">Submerged arc furnace means any furnace wherein electrical energy is  converted to heat energy by transmission of current between electrodes  partially submerged in the furnace charge. The furnace may be of an  open, semi-sealed, or sealed design.</p><p class="depth0">Tapping emissions means a source of air pollutant emissions that  occur during the process of removing the molten product from the  furnace.</p><p class="depth0">Tapping period means the time from when a tap hole is opened until  the time a tap hole is closed.
