                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Compensation for personal services is allowable subject  to the following general criteria and additional requirements contained  in other parts of this cost principle:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for personal services must be for work performed by  the   employee in the current year and must not represent a retroactive  adjustment of prior years' salaries or wages (but see paragraphs (g),  (h), (j), (k), (m), and (o) of this subsection).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The total compensation for individual employees or job classes  of employees must be reasonable for the work performed; however,  specific restrictions on individual compensation elements apply when  prescribed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The compensation must be based upon and conform to the terms and  conditions of the contractor's established compensation plan or practice  followed so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make  the payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> No presumption of allowability will exist where the contractor  introduces major revisions of existing compensation plans or new plans  and the contractor has not provided the cognizant ACO, either before  implementation or within a reasonable period after it, an opportunity to  review the allowability of the changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Costs that are unallowable under other paragraphs of this  Subpart 31.2 are not allowable under this subsection 31.205-6 solely on  the basis that they constitute compensation for personal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compensation costs for certain individuals give rise to the  need for special consideration. Such individuals include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Owners of closely held corporations, members of limited  liability companies, partners, sole proprietors, or members of their  immediate families; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Persons who are contractually committed to acquire a substantial  financial interest in the contractor's enterprise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For these individuals, compensation must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Be reasonable for the personal services rendered; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Not be a distribution of profits (which is not an allowable  contract cost).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For owners of closely held companies, compensation in excess  of the costs that are deductible as compensation under the Internal  Revenue Code (26 U.S.C.) and regulations under it is unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasonableness--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation pursuant to labor-management  agreements. If costs of compensation established under ``arm's length''  labor-management agreements negotiated under the terms of the Federal  Labor Relations Act or similar state statutes are otherwise allowable,  the costs are reasonable unless, as applied to work in performing  Government contracts, the costs are unwarranted by the character and  circumstances of the work or discriminatory against the Government. The  application of the provisions of a labor-management agreement designed  to apply to a given set of circumstances and conditions of employment  (e.g., work involving extremely hazardous activities or work not  requiring recurrent use of overtime) is unwarranted when applied to a  Government contract involving significantly different circumstances and  conditions of employment (e.g., work involving less hazardous activities  or work continually requiring use of overtime). It is discriminatory  against the Government if it results in employee compensation (in  whatever form or name) in excess of that being paid for similar non- Government work under comparable circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compensation not covered by labor-management agreements.  Compensation for each employee or job class of employees must be  reasonable for the work performed. Compensation is reasonable if the  aggregate of each measurable and allowable element sums to a reasonable  total. In determining the reasonableness of total compensation, consider  only allowable individual elements of compensation. In addition to the  provisions of 31.201-3, in testing the reasonableness of compensation  for particular employees or job classes of employees, consider factors  determined to be relevant by the contracting officer. Factors that may  be relevant include, but are not limited to, conformity with  compensation practices of other firms--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Of the same size;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the same industry;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In the same geographic area; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Engaged in similar non-Government work under comparable  circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Form of payment. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for personal services includes  compensation paid or to be paid in the future to employees in the form  of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Cash;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Corporate securities, such as stocks, bonds, and other  financial instruments (see paragraph (d)(2) of this subsection regarding  valuation); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other assets, products, or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When compensation is paid with securities of the contractor or  of an affiliate, the following additional restrictions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Valuation placed on the securities is the fair market value on  the first date the number of shares awarded is known, determined upon  the most objective basis available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Accruals for the cost of securities before issuing the  securities to the employees are subject to adjustment according to the  possibilities that the employees will not receive the securities and  that their interest in the accruals will be forfeited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Income tax differential pay. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Differential allowances for  additional income taxes resulting from foreign assignments are  allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Differential allowances for additional income taxes resulting  from domestic assignments are unallowable. (However, payments for  increased employee income or Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes  incident to allowable reimbursed relocation costs are allowable under  31.205-35(a)(10).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Bonuses and incentive compensation. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Bonuses and incentive  compensation are allowable provided the--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Awards are paid or accrued under an agreement entered into in  good faith between the contractor and the employees before the services  are rendered or pursuant to an established plan or policy followed by  the contractor so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to  make such payment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basis for the award is supported.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the bonus and incentive compensation payments are deferred,  the costs are subject to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (k)  of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Severance pay. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Severance pay is a payment in addition to  regular salaries and wages by contractors to workers whose employment is  being involuntarily terminated. Payments for early retirement incentive  plans are covered in paragraph (j)(6) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Severance pay is allowable only to the extent that, in each  case, it is required by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Law;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer-employee agreement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Established policy that constitutes, in effect, an implied  agreement on the contractor's part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Circumstances of the particular employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments made in the event of employment with a replacement  contractor where continuity of employment with credit for prior length  of service is preserved under substantially equal conditions of  employment, or continued employment by the contractor at another  facility, subsidiary, affiliate, or parent company of the contractor are  not severance pay and are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Actual normal turnover severance payments shall be allocated to  all work performed in the contractor's plant. However, if the contractor  uses the accrual method to account for normal turnover severance  payments, that method will be acceptable if the amount of the accrual  is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reasonable in light of payments actually made for normal  severances over a representative past period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Allocated to all work performed in the contractor's plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Abnormal or mass severance pay is of such a conjectural nature  that accruals for this purpose are not allowable. However, the  Government recognizes its obligation to participate, to the extent of  its fair share, in any specific payment. Thus, the Government will  consider allowability on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Under 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(1)(M) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(13), the  costs of severance payments to foreign nationals employed under a  service contract performed outside the United States are unallowable to  the extent that such payments exceed amounts typically paid to employees  providing similar services in the same industry in the United States.  Further, under 10 U.S.C.   2324(e)(1)(N) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(a)(14), all such costs of severance  payments that are otherwise allowable are unallowable if the termination  of employment of the foreign national is the result of the closing of,  or the curtailment of activities at, a United States facility in that  country at the request of the government of that country; this does not  apply if the closing of a facility or curtailment of activities is made  pursuant to a status-of-forces or other country-to-country agreement  entered into with the government of that country before November 29,  1989. 10 U.S.C. 2324(e)(3) and 41 U.S.C. 4304(b) permit the head of the  agency to waive these cost allowability limitations under certain  circumstances (see 37.113 and the solicitation provision at 52.237-8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Backpay. Backpay is a retroactive adjustment of prior years'  salaries or wages. Backpay is unallowable except as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payments to employees resulting from underpaid work actually  performed are allowable, if required by a negotiated settlement, order,  or court decree.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments to union employees for the difference in their past and  current wage rates for working without a contract or labor agreement  during labor management negotiation are allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payments to nonunion employees based upon results of union  agreement negotiation are allowable only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A formal agreement or understanding exists between management  and the employees concerning these payments; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An established policy or practice exists and is followed by the  contractor so consistently as to imply, in effect, an agreement to make  such payments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Compensation based on changes in the prices of corporate  securities or corporate security ownership, such as stock options, stock  appreciation rights, phantom stock plans, and junior stock conversions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any compensation which is calculated, or valued, based on  changes in the price of corporate securities is unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any compensation represented by dividend payments or which is  calculated based on dividend payments is unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If a contractor pays an employee in lieu of the employee  receiving or exercising a right, option, or benefit which would have  been unallowable under this paragraph (i), such payments are also  unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> and in  paragraphs (j)(2) through (j)(6) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except for nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go  cost method, to be allowable in the current year, the contractor shall  fund pension costs by the time set for filing of the Federal income tax  return or any extension. Pension costs assigned to the current year, but  not funded by the tax return time, are not allowable in any subsequent  year. For nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go method, to  be allowable in the current year, the contractor shall allocate pension  costs in the cost accounting period that the pension costs are assigned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pension payments must be paid pursuant to an agreement entered  into in good faith between the contractor and employees before the work  or services are performed and to the terms and conditions of the  established plan. The cost of changes in pension plans are not allowable  if the changes are discriminatory to the Government or are not intended  to be applied consistently for all employees under similar circumstances  in the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided for early retirement benefits in paragraph  (j)(6) of this subsection, one-time-only pension supplements not  available to all participants of the basic plan are not allowable as  pension costs, unless the   supplemental benefits represent a separate pension plan and the benefits  are payable for life at the option of the employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increases in payments to previously retired plan participants  covering cost-of-living adjustments are allowable if paid in accordance  with a policy or practice consistently followed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Defined-benefit pension plans. The cost limitations and  exclusions pertaining to defined-benefit plans are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Except for nonqualified pension plans, pension costs (see 48  CFR 9904.412-40(a)(1)) assigned to the current accounting period, but  not funded during it, are not allowable in subsequent years (except that  a payment made to a fund by the time set for filing the Federal income  tax return or any extension thereof is considered to have been made  during such taxable year). However, any portion of pension cost computed  for a cost accounting period, that exceeds the amount required to be  funded pursuant to a waiver granted under the provisions of the Employee  Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), will be allowable in  those future accounting periods in which the funding of such excess  amounts occurs (see 48 CFR 9904.412-50(c)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For nonqualified pension plans, except those using the pay-as- you-go cost method, allowable costs are limited to the amount allocable  in accordance with 48 CFR 9904.412-50(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For nonqualified pension plans using the pay-as-you-go cost  method, allowable costs are limited to the amounts allocable in  accordance with 48 CFR 9904.412-50(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any amount funded in excess of the pension cost assigned to a  cost accounting period is not allowable in that period and shall be  accounted for as set forth at 48 CFR 9904.412-50(a)(4). The excess  amount is allowable in the future period to which it is assigned, to the  extent it is not otherwise unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increased pension costs are unallowable if the increase is  caused by a delay in funding beyond 30 days after each quarter of the  year to which they are assignable. If a composite rate is used for  allocating pension costs between the segments of a company and if,  because of differences in the timing of the funding by the segments, an  inequity exists, allowable pension costs for each segment will be  limited to that particular segment's calculation of pension costs as  provided for in 48 CFR 9904.413-50(c). The contractor shall make  determinations of unallowable costs in accordance with the actuarial  method used in calculating pension costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The contracting officer will consider the allowability of the  cost of indemnifying the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC)  under ERISA section 4062 or 4064 arising from terminating an employee  deferred compensation plan on a case-by-case basis, provided that if  insurance was required by the PBGC under ERISA section 4023, it was so  obtained and the indemnification payment is not recoverable under the  insurance. Consideration under the foregoing circumstances will be  primarily for the purpose of appraising the extent to which the  indemnification payment is allocable to Government work. If a beneficial  or other equitable relationship exists, the Government will participate,  despite the requirements of 31.205-19(c)(3) and (d)(3), in the  indemnification payment to the extent of its fair share.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Increased pension costs resulting from the withdrawal of assets  from a pension fund and transfer to another employee benefit plan fund,  or transfer of assets to another account within the same fund, are  unallowable except to the extent authorized by an advance agreement. If  the withdrawal of assets from a pension fund is a plan termination under  ERISA, the provisions of paragraph (j)(3) of this subsection apply. The  advance agreement shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> State the amount of the Government's equitable share in the  gross amount withdrawn or transferred; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Provide that the Government receives a credit equal to the  amount of the Government's equitable share of the gross withdrawal or  transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Pension adjustments and asset reversions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For segment  closings, pension plan terminations, or curtailment of benefits, the  amount of the adjustment shall be--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For contracts and subcontracts that are subject to full coverage  under the Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) Board rules and regulations,  the amount measured, assigned, and allocated in accordance with 48 CFR  9904.413-50(c)(12); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For contracts and subcontracts that are not subject to full  coverage under the CAS, the amount measured, assigned, and allocated in  accordance with 48 CFR 9904.413-50(c)(12), except the numerator of the  fraction at 48 CFR 9904.413-50(c)(12)(vi) is the sum of the pension plan  costs allocated to all non-CAS-covered contracts and subcontracts that  are subject to Subpart 31.2 or for which certified cost or pricing data  were submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> are unallowable in  accordance with 31.205-41(b)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Defined-contribution pension plans. In addition to defined- contribution pension plans, this paragraph also covers profit sharing,  savings plans, and other such plans, provided the plans fall within the  definition of a pension plan at 31.001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Allowable pension cost is limited to the net contribution  required to be made for a cost accounting period after taking into  account dividends and other credits, where applicable. However, any  portion of pension cost computed for a cost accounting period that  exceeds the amount required to be funded pursuant to a waiver granted  under the provisions of ERISA will be allowable in those future  accounting periods in which the funding of such excess amounts occurs  (see 48 CFR 9904.412-50(c)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> and (iv) of this  subsection apply to defined-contribution plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pension plans using the pay-as-you-go cost method. When using  the pay-as-you-go cost method, the contractor shall measure, assign, and  allocate the cost of pension plans in accordance with 48 CFR 9904.412  and 9904.413. Pension costs for a pension plan using the pay-as-you-go  cost method are allowable to the extent they are not otherwise  unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Early retirement incentives. An early retirement incentive is an  incentive given to an employee to retire early. For contract costing  purposes, costs of early retirement incentives are allowable subject to  the pension cost criteria contained in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) through (iv)  of this subsection provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The contractor measures, assigns, and allocates the costs in  accordance with the contractor's accounting practices for pension costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The incentives are in accordance with the terms and conditions  of an early retirement incentive plan;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The contractor applies the plan only to active employees. The  cost of extending the plan to employees who retired or were terminated  before the adoption of the plan is unallowable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The present value of the total incentives given to any employee  in excess of the amount of the employee's annual salary for the previous  fiscal year before the employee's retirement is unallowable. The  contractor shall compute the present value in accordance with its  accounting practices for pension costs. The contractor shall account for  any unallowable costs in accordance with 48 CFR 9904.412-50(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Deferred compensation other than pensions. The costs of deferred  compensation awards are allowable subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The costs shall be measured, assigned, and allocated in  accordance with 48 CFR 9904.415, Accounting for the Cost of Deferred  Compensation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The costs of deferred compensation awards are unallowable if the  awards are made in periods subsequent to the period when the work being  remunerated was performed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Compensation incidental to business acquisitions. The following  costs are unallowable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payments to employees under agreements in which they receive  special compensation, in excess of the contractor's normal severance pay  practice, if their employment terminates following a change in the  management control over, or ownership of, the contractor or a  substantial portion of its assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Payments to employees under plans introduced in connection with  a change (whether actual or prospective) in the management control over,  or ownership of, the contractor or a substantial portion of its assets  in which those employees receive special compensation, which is  contingent upon the employee remaining with the contractor for a  specified period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Fringe benefits. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fringe benefits are allowances and services  provided by the contractor to its employees as compensation in addition  to regular wages and salaries. Fringe benefits include, but are not  limited to, the cost of vacations, sick leave, holidays, military leave,  employee insurance, and supplemental unemployment benefit plans. Except  as provided otherwise in subpart 31.2, the costs of fringe benefit are  allowable to the extent that they are reasonable and are required by  law, employer-employee agreement, or an established policy of the  contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> That portion of the cost of company-furnished automobiles that  relates to personal use by employees (including transportation to and  from work) is unallowable regardless of whether the cost is reported as  taxable income to the employees (see 31.205-46(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Employee rebate and purchase discount plans. Rebates and  purchase discounts, in whatever form, granted to employees on products  or services produced by the contractor or affiliates are unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Postretirement benefits other than pensions (PRB). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> PRB  covers all benefits, other than cash benefits and life insurance  benefits paid by pension plans, provided to employees, their  beneficiaries, and covered dependents during the period following the  employees' retirement. Benefits encompassed include, but are not limited  to, postretirement health care; life insurance provided outside a  pension plan; and other welfare benefits such as tuition assistance, day  care, legal services, and housing subsidies provided after retirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) of this  subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pay-as-you-go. PRB costs are not accrued during the working  lives of employees. Costs are assigned to the period in which--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Benefits are actually provided; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The costs are paid to an insurer, provider, or other recipient  for current year benefits or premiums.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Terminal funding. PRB costs are not accrued during the working  lives of the employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Terminal funding occurs when the entire PRB liability is paid in  a lump sum upon the termination of employees (or upon conversion to such  a terminal-funded plan) to an insurer or trustee to establish and  maintain a fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing PRB to  retirees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Terminal funded costs shall be amortized over a period of 15  years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Accrual basis. PRB costs are accrued during the working lives  of employees. Accrued PRB costs shall comply with the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)(2)</em> of this subsection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> through (iii) of  this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the year of transition from the pay-as-you-go method to  accrual accounting for purposes of Government contract cost accounting,  the transition obligation shall be the excess of the accumulated PRB  obligation over the fair value of plan assets determined in accordance  with subparagraph (o)(2)(iii)(E) of this section; the fair   value must be reduced by the prepayment credit as determined in  accordance with subparagraph (o)(2)(iii)(F) of this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> PRB cost attributable to the transition obligation assigned to  the current year that is in excess of the amount assignable to  accounting periods on the basis of a straight line amortization of the  transition obligation over the average remaining working lives of active  employees covered by the PRB plan or a 20-year period, whichever period  is longer, is unallowable. However, if the plan is comprised of inactive  participants only, the PRB cost attributable to the transition  obligation assigned to the current year that is in excess of the amount  assignable to accounting periods on a straight line amortization of the  transition obligation over the average future life expectancy of the  participants is unallowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For a plan that transitioned from pay-as-you-go to accrual  accounting for Government contract cost accounting prior to July 22,  2013, the unallowable amount of PRB cost attributable to the transition  obligation amortization shall continue to be based on the cost principle  in effect at the time of the transition until the original transition  obligation schedule is fully amortized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contributions to a welfare benefit fund determined in accordance  with applicable Internal Revenue Code. Allowable PRB costs based on such  contributions shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be measured using reasonable actuarial assumptions, which shall  include a health care inflation assumption unless prohibited by the  Internal Revenue Code provisions governing welfare benefit funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Be assigned to accounting periods on the basis of the average  working lives of active employees covered by the PRB plan or a 15 year  period, whichever period is longer. However, if the plan is comprised of  inactive participants only, the cost shall be spread over the average  future life expectancy of the participants; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exclude Federal income taxes, whether incurred by the fund or  the contractor (including any increase in PRB costs associated with such  taxes), unless the fund holding the plan assets is tax-exempt under the  provisions of 26 U.S.C 501(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Be paid to an insurer or trustee to establish and maintain a  fund or reserve for the sole purpose of providing PRB to retirees. The  assets shall be segregated in the trust, or otherwise effectively  restricted, so that they cannot be used by the employer for other  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Be calculated in accordance with generally accepted actuarial  principles and practices as promulgated by the Actuarial Standards  Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Eliminate from costs of current and future periods the  accumulated value of any prior period costs that were unallowable in  accordance with paragraph (o)(3) of this section, adjusted for interest  under paragraph (o)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Calculate the unfunded actuarial liability (unfunded accumulated  postretirement benefit obligation) using the market (fair) value of  assets that have been accumulated by funding costs assigned to prior  periods for contract accounting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Recognize as a prepayment credit the market (fair) value of  assets that were accumulated by deposits or contributions that were not  used to fund costs assigned to previous periods for contract accounting  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Comply with the following when changing from one accrual  accounting method to another: the contractor shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Treat the change in the unfunded actuarial liability (unfunded  accumulated postretirement benefit obligation) as a gain or loss; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)(D)</em>, (E), and (F) of this section to ensure that no duplicate  recovery of costs exists.
