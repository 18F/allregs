In this case the port director will provide the employee with an opportunity to respond to the notice of proposed action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific grounds. Access to the Customs security area will be revoked or suspended, and surrender of an approved Customs access seal will be demanded, in any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There is probable cause to believe that an approved Customs access seal was obtained through fraud, a material omission, or the misstatement of a material fact;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employee is or has been convicted of, or found not guilty of by reason of insanity, or there is probable cause to believe that the employee has committed any act or omission involving, an offense listed in Sec. 122.183(a)(4);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employee has been arrested for, or charged with, an offense listed in Sec. 122.183(a)(4) and prosecution or other disposition of the arrest or charge is pending;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The employee has engaged in any other conduct that would constitute a ground for denial of access to the Customs security area under Sec. 122.183;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The employee permits the approved Customs access seal to be used by any other person or refuses to openly display or produce it upon the proper demand of a Customs officer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The employee uses the approved Customs access seal in connection with a matter not related to his employment or not constituting a duty described in the written justification required by Sec. 122.182(c)(1);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The employee refuses or neglects to obey any proper order of a Customs officer, or any Customs order, rule, or regulation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> For all employees of the bond holder, if the bond required by Sec. 122.182(c) is determined to be insufficient in amount or lacking sufficient sureties, and a satisfactory new bond with good and sufficient sureties is not furnished within a reasonable time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> The employee no longer requires access to the Customs security area for an extended period of time at the airport of issuance because of a change in duties, termination of employment, or other reason; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> The employee or employer fails to provide the notification of a change in circumstances as required under Sec. 122.184(b) or (c) or the employee fails to report the loss or theft of a Customs access seal as required under Sec. 122.185.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of revocation or suspension.
