                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What is the purpose of this section? This section limits the  amount of fugitive particulate matter that may be emitted from certain  air pollution sources operating within the Indian reservation to control  ground-level concentrations of particulate matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Who is affected by this section? This section applies to any  person who owns or operates a source of fugitive particulate matter  emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> What is exempted from this section? This section does not apply  to open burning, agricultural activities, forestry and silvicultural  activities, sweat houses or lodges, non-commercial smoke houses, public  roads owned or maintained by any Federal, Tribal, State, or local  government, or activities associated with single-family residences or  residential buildings with four or fewer dwelling units.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What are the requirements for sources of fugitive particulate  matter emissions? (1) The owner or operator of any source of fugitive  particulate matter emissions, including any source or activity engaged  in materials handling or storage, construction, demolition, or any other  operation that is or may be a source of fugitive particulate matter  emissions, must take all reasonable precautions to prevent fugitive  particulate matter emissions and must maintain and operate the source to  minimize fugitive particulate matter emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable precautions include, but are not limited to the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Use, where possible, of water or chemicals for control of dust  in the demolition of buildings or structures, construction operations,  grading of roads, or clearing of land.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Application of asphalt, oil (but not used oil), water, or other  suitable chemicals on unpaved roads, materials stockpiles, and other  surfaces that can create airborne dust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Full or partial enclosure of materials stockpiles in cases  where application of oil, water, or chemicals is not sufficient or  appropriate to prevent particulate matter from becoming airborne.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Implementation of good housekeeping practices to avoid or  minimize the accumulation of dusty materials that have the potential to  become airborne, and the prompt cleanup of spilled or accumulated  materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Installation and use of hoods, fans, and fabric filters to  enclose and vent the handling of dusty materials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Adequate containment during sandblasting or other similar  operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Covering, at all times when in motion, open bodied trucks  transporting materials likely to become airborne.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The prompt removal from paved streets of earth or other  material that does or may become airborne.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Are there additional requirements that must be met? (1) A person  subject to this section must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annually survey the air pollution source(s) during typical  operating conditions and meteorological conditions conducive to  producing fugitive dust to determine the sources of fugitive particulate  matter emissions. For new sources or new operations, a survey must be  conducted within 30 days after commencing operation. Document the  results of the survey, including the date and time of the survey and  identification of any sources of fugitive particulate matter emissions  found.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If sources of fugitive particulate matter emissions are  present, determine the reasonable precautions that will be taken to  prevent fugitive particulate matter emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prepare, and update as necessary following each survey, a  written plan that specifies the reasonable precautions that will be  taken and the procedures to be followed to prevent fugitive particulate  matter emissions, including appropriate monitoring and recordkeeping.  For construction or demolition activities, a written plan   must be prepared prior to commencing construction or demolition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Implement the written plan, and maintain and operate the source  to minimize fugitive particulate matter emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Maintain records for five years that document the surveys and  the reasonable precautions that were taken to prevent fugitive  particulate matter emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Regional Administrator may require specific actions to  prevent fugitive particulate matter emissions, or impose conditions to  maintain and operate the air pollution source to minimize fugitive  particulate matter emissions, in a permit to construct or a permit to  operate for the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Efforts to comply with this section cannot be used as a reason  for not complying with other applicable laws and ordinances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Definitions of terms used in this section. The following terms  that are used in this section are defined in Sec. 49.123 General  provisions: Agricultural activities, air pollutant, air pollution  source, ambient air, emission, forestry or silvicultural activities,  fugitive dust, fugitive particulate matter, owner or operator,  particulate matter, permit to construct, permit to operate, PM10, PM2.5,  Regional Administrator, source, stack, and uncombined water.</p>
