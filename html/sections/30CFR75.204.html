                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For roof bolts and accessories addressed in ASTM F432-95,  ``Standard Specification for Roof and Rock Bolts and Accessories,'' the  mine operator shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Obtain a manufacturer's certification that the material was  manufactured and tested in accordance with the specifications of ASTM  F432-95; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make this certification available to an authorized  representative of the Secretary and to the representative of miners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Roof bolts and accessories not addressed in ASTM F432-95 may be  used, provided that the use of such materials is approved by the  District Manager based on--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Demonstrations which show that the materials have successfully  supported the roof in an area of a coal mine with similar strata,  opening dimensions and roof stresses; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tests which show the materials to be effective for supporting  the roof in an area of the affected mine which has similar strata,  opening dimensions and roof stresses as the area where the roof bolts  are to be used. During the test process, access to the test area shall  be limited to persons necessary to conduct the test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A bearing plate shall be firmly installed with each roof  bolt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bearing plates used directly against the mine roof shall be at  least 6 inches square or the equivalent, except that where the mine roof  is firm and not susceptible to sloughing, bearing plates 5 inches square  or the equivalent may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Bearing plates used with wood or metal materials shall be at  least 4 inches square or the equivalent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wooden materials that are used between a bearing plate and the  mine roof in areas which will exist for three years or more shall be  treated to minimize deterioration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When washers are used with roof bolts, the washers shall conform  to the shape of the roof bolt head and bearing plate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The diameter of finishing bits shall be within a tolerance of  plus or minus 0.030 inch of the manufacturer's recommended hole diameter  for the anchor used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When separate finishing bits are used, they shall be  distinguishable from other bits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Tensioned roof bolts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Roof bolts that provide support by  creating a beam of laminated strata shall be at least 30 inches long.  Roof bolts that provide support by suspending the roof from overlying  stronger strata shall be long enough to anchor at least 12 inches into  the stronger strata.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Test holes, spaced at intervals specified in the roof control  plan, shall be drilled to a depth of at least 12 inches above the  anchorage horizon of mechanically anchored tensioned bolts being used.  When a test hole indicates that bolts would not anchor in competent  strata, corrective action shall be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The installed torque or tension ranges for roof bolts as  specified in the roof control plan shall maintain the integrity of the  support system and shall not exceed the yield point of the roof bolt nor  anchorage capacity of the strata.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In each roof bolting cycle, the actual torque or tension of the  first tensioned roof bolt installed with each drill head shall be  measured immediately after it is installed. Thereafter, for each drill  head used, at least one roof bolt out of every four installed shall be  measured for actual torque or tension. If the torque or tension of any  of the roof bolts measured is not within the range specified in the roof  control plan, corrective action shall be taken.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In working places from which coal is produced during any portion  of a 24-hour period, the actual torque or tension on at least one out of  every ten previously installed mechanically anchored tensioned roof  bolts shall be measured from the outby corner of the last open crosscut  to the face in each advancing section. Corrective action shall be taken  if the majority of the bolts measured--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Do not maintain at least 70 percent of the minimum torque or  tension specified in the roof control plan, 50 percent if the roof bolt  plates bear against wood; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have exceeded the maximum specified torque or tension by 50  percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The mine operator or a person designated by the operator shall  certify by signature and date that measurements required by paragraph  (f)(5) of this section have been made. This certification shall be  maintained for at least one year and shall be made available to an  authorized representative of the Secretary and representatives of the  miners.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Tensioned roof bolts installed in the roof support pattern shall  not be used to anchor trailing cables or used for any other purpose that  could affect the tension of the bolt. Hanging trailing cables, line  brattice, telephone lines, or other similar devices which do not place  sudden loads on the bolts are permitted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Angle compensating devices shall be used to compensate for the  angle when tensioned roof bolts are installed at angles greater than 5  degrees from the perpendicular to the bearing plate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Non-tensioned grouted roof bolts. The first non-tensioned  grouted roof bolt installed during each roof bolting cycle shall be  tested during or immediately after the first row of bolts has been  installed. If the bolt tested does not withstand at least 150 foot- pounds of torque without rotating in the hole, corrective action shall  be taken.
