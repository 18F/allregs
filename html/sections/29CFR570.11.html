The said authorized person shall request in writing through the appropriate channels that action be taken on the acceptability of the certificate as proof of age under the Fair Labor Standards Act and shall state the evidence of age of the minor which he has obtained and the reasons for such request. A copy of this request shall be sent to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division for further handling through the State agency responsible for the issuance of certificates, except that in those States where Federal certificates of age are issued, action necessary to establish the correct age of the minor and to revoke the certificate if it is found that the minor is under age shall be taken by the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division or his designated representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator shall have final authority in those States in which State certificates are accepted as proof of age under the Act for determining the continued acceptability of the certificate, and shall have final authority for such determination in those States in which Federal certificates of age are issued. When such determination has been made in any case, notice thereof shall be given to the employer and the minor. In those cases involving the continued acceptability of State certificates, the appropriate State agency and the official who issued the certificate shall also be notified.</p>
