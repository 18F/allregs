                            <p class="depth0">Producer milk means the skim milk (or the skim equivalent of components of skim milk), including nonfat components, and butterfat in milk of a producer that is:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Received by the operator of a pool plant directly from a producer or a handler described in Sec.  1000.9(c). All milk received pursuant to this paragraph shall be priced at the location of the plant where it is first physically received;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Received by a handler described in Sec.  1000.9(c) in excess of the quantity delivered to pool plants;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diverted by a pool plant operator to another pool plant. Milk so diverted shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Diverted by the operator of a pool plant or a cooperative association described in Sec.  1000.9(c) to a nonpool plant, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Milk of a dairy farmer shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of such dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant and the dairy farmer has continuously retained producer status since that time. If a dairy farmer loses producer status under the order in this part (except as a result of a temporary loss of Grade A approval), the dairy farmer's milk shall not be eligible for diversion until milk of the dairy farmer has been physically received as producer milk at a pool plant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The equivalent of at least one day's milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of January and February, and August through November;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The equivalent of at least one day's milk production is caused by the handler to be physically received at a pool plant in each of the months of March through July and December if the requirement of paragraph (d)(2) of this section (Sec.  1032.13) in each of the prior months of August through November and January through February are not met, except in the case of a dairy farmer who marketed no Grade A milk during each of the prior months of August through November or January through February.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Of the quantity of producer milk received during the month (including diversions, but excluding the quantity of producer milk received from a handler described in Sec.  1000.9(c)) the handler diverts to nonpool plants not more than 75 percent during the months of August through February, and not more than 80 percent during the months of March through July, provided that not less than 25 percent of such receipts in the months of August through February and 20 percent of the remaining months' receipts are delivered to plants described in Sec.  1032.7(a), (b), or (i).;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Receipts used in determining qualifying percentages shall be milk transferred to or diverted to or physically received by a plant described in Sec.  1032.7(a), (b) or (i) less any transfer or diversion of bulk fluid milk products from such plants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Diverted milk shall be priced at the location of the plant to which diverted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Any milk diverted in excess of the limits prescribed in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall not be producer milk. If the diverting handler or cooperative association fails to designate the dairy farmers' deliveries that are not to be producer milk, no milk diverted by the handler or cooperative association during the month to a nonpool plant shall be producer milk; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The applicable diversion limits in paragraph (d)(2) of this section may be increased or decreased by the market administrator if the market administrator finds that such revision is necessary to assure orderly marketing and efficient handling of milk in the marketing area. Before making such a finding, the market administrator shall investigate the need for the revision either on the market administrator's own initiative or at the request of interested persons if the request is made in writing at least 15 days prior to the month for which the requested revision is desired effective. If the investigation shows that a revision might be appropriate, the market administrator shall issue a notice stating that the revision is being considered and inviting written data, views, and arguments. Any decision to revise an applicable percentage must be issued in writing at least one day before the effective date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Producer milk shall not include milk of a producer that is subject to inclusion and participation in a marketwide equalization pool under a milk classification and pricing program imposed under the authority of a State government maintaining marketwide pooling of returns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The quantity of milk reported by a handler pursuant to Sec.  1032.30(a)(1) and/or Sec.  1032.30(c)(1) for the current month

may not exceed 125 percent of the producer milk receipts pooled by the handler during the prior month. Milk diverted to nonpool plants reported in excess of this limit shall be removed from the pool. Milk received at pool plants in excess of the 125 percent limit, other than pool distributing plants, shall be classified pursuant to Sec.  1000.44(a)(3)(v). The handler must designate, by producer pick-up, which milk is to be removed from the pool. If the handler fails to provide this information the provisions of paragraph (d)(5) of this section shall apply. The following provisions apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Milk shipped to and physically received at pool distributing plants shall not be subject to the 125 percent limitation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Producer milk qualified pursuant to Sec.  ----.13 of any other Federal Order in the previous month shall not be included in the computation of the 125 percent limitation; provided that the producers comprising the milk supply have been continuously pooled on any Federal Order for the entirety of the most recent three consecutive months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The market administrator may waive the 125 percent limitation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For a new handler on the order, subject to the provisions of paragraph (f)(3) of this section, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For an existing handler with significantly changed milk supply conditions due to unusual circumstances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A bloc of milk may be considered ineligible for pooling if the market administrator determines that handlers altered the reporting of such milk for the purpose of evading the provisions of this paragraph.
