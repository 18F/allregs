                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each agency of the Department shall consult with OEQ to  determine whether its programs and activities may affect the cultural  environment. Then, if needed, the agency, in consultation with the OEQ,  shall develop its own specific procedures for implementing section 106  of the National Historic Preservation Act, Executive Order 11593, the  regulations of the ACHP (36 CFR part 800), the American Indian Religious  Freedom Act of 1978 and other relevant legislation and regulations in  accordance with the agency's programs, mission and authorities. Such  implementing procedures shall be published as proposed and final  procedures in the Federal Register, and must be consistent with the  requirements of 36 CFR part 800 and this subpart. Where applicable, each  agency's procedures must contain mechanisms to insure:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compliance with section 106 of NHPA and mitigation of adverse  effects to cultural properties on or eligible for the National Register  of Historic Places;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Clear definition of the kind and variety of sites and properties  which should be managed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Development of a long-term program of management of the cultural  environment on lands administered by USDA as well as direction for  project-specific protection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identification of all properties listed on or eligible for  listing in the National Register that may be affected directly or  indirectly by a proposed activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Location, identification and nomination to the Register of all  sites, buildings, objects, districts, neighborhoods, and networks under  its management which appear to qualify (in compliance with E.O. 11593);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The exercise of caution to assure that properties managed by  USDA which may qualify for nomination are not transferred, sold,  demolished, or substantially altered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Early consultation with, and involvement of, the State Historic  Preservation Officer(s), the ACHP, Native American traditional religious  leaders and appropriate tribal leaders, and others with appropriate  interests or expertise;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Early notification to insure substantive and meaningful  involvement by the public in the agency's decisionmaking process as it  relates to the cultural environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Identification and consideration of alternatives to a proposed  undertaking that would mitigate or minimize adverse effects to a  property identified under paragraph (a)(4) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Funding of mitigation measures where required to minimize the  potential for adverse effects on the cultural environment. Funds for  mitigation shall be available and shall be spent when needed during the  life of the project to mitigate the expected loss; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Development of plans to provide for the management, protection,  maintenance and/or restoration of Register sites under its management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each agency of the Department which conducts programs or  activities that may have an effect on the cultural environment shall  recruit, place, develop, or otherwise have available, professional  expertise in anthropology, archeology, history, historic preservation,  historic architecture, and/or cultural resource management (depending  upon specific need). Such arrangements may include internal hiring,  Intergovernmental Personnel Act assignments, memoranda of agreement with  other agencies or Departments, or other mechanisms which insure a  professionally directed program. Agencies should use Department of the  Interior professional standards (36 CFR 61.5) as guidelines to insure  Departmentwide competence and consistency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance with cultural resource legislation is the  responsibility of each individual agency. Consideration of cultural  resource values must begin during the earliest planning stages of any  undertaking.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agency heads shall insure that cultural resource management  activities meet professional standards as promulgated by the Department  of the Interior (e.g., 36 CFR parts 60, 63, 66, 1208).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cultural resource review requirements and compliance with  section 106 of NHPA and Executive Order 11593 shall be integrated and  run concurrently, rather than consecutively, with the other  environmental considerations under NEPA regulations. As such, direct and  indirect impacts on cultural resources must be addressed in the  environmental assessment for every agency undertaking. In meeting these  requirements, agencies shall be guided by regulations implementing the  procedural provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1508) and Department of  Agriculture regulations (7 CFR part 3100, subpart B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each agency shall work closely with the appropriate State  Historic Preservation Officer(s) in their preparation of State plans,  determination of inventory needs, and collection of data relevant to  general plans or specific undertakings in carrying out mutual cultural  resource responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each agency shall, to the maximum extent possible, use existing  historic structures for administrative purposes in compliance with  Public Buildings Cooperative Use Act of 1976 and Executive Order 12072,  ``Federal Space Management''.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each agency should consult with Native American traditional  religious leaders or their representatives and other native leaders in  the development and implementation of cultural resource programs which  may affect their religious customs and practices.</p>
