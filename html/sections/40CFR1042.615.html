                            <p class="depth0">For Category 1 and Category 2 replacement engines, the provisions of  40 CFR 1068.240 apply except as described in this section. In unusual  circumstances, you may ask us to allow you to apply these provisions for  a new Category 3 engine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> do not apply  to a new replacement engine if all the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You use good engineering judgment to determine that no engine  certified to the current requirements of this part is produced by any  manufacturer with the appropriate physical or performance  characteristics to repower the vessel. We have determined that engines  certified to Tier 4 standards do not have the appropriate physical or  performance characteristics to replace uncertified engines or engines  certified to emission standards that are less stringent than the Tier 4  standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You make a record of your determination for each replacement  engine with the following information and keep these records for eight  years:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If you determine that no engine certified to the current  requirements of this part is available with the appropriate performance  characteristics, explain why certified engines produced by you and other  manufacturers cannot be used as a replacement because they are not  similar to the engine being replaced in terms of power or speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> You may determine that all engines certified to the current  requirements of this part that have appropriate performance  characteristics are not available because they do not have the  appropriate physical characteristics. If this is the case, explain why  these certified engines produced by you and other manufacturers cannot  be used as a replacement because their weight or dimensions are  substantially different than those of the engine being replaced, or  because they will not fit within the vessel's engine compartment or  engine room.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In evaluating appropriate physical or performance  characteristics, you may account for compatibility with vessel  components you would not otherwise replace when installing a new engine,  including transmissions or reduction gears, drive shafts or propeller  shafts, propellers, cooling systems, operator controls, or electrical  systems for generators or indirect-drive configurations. If you make  your determination on this basis, you must identify the vessel  components that are incompatible with engines certified to current  standards and explain how they are incompatible and why it would be  unreasonable to replace them.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In evaluating appropriate physical or performance  characteristics, you may account for compatibility in a set of two or  more propulsion engines on a vessel where only one of the engines needs  replacement, but only if each engine not needing replacement has  operated for less than 75 percent of its applicable useful life in hours  or years (see Sec.  1042.101). If any engine not otherwise needing  replacement exceeds this 75 percent threshold, your determination must  consider replacement of all the propulsion engines.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In addition to the determination specified in paragraph (a)(1)  of this section, you must make a separate determination for your own  product line addressing every tier of emission standards that is more  stringent than the emission standards for the engine being replaced. For  example, if the engine being replaced was built before the Tier 1  standards started to apply and engines of that size are currently  subject to Tier 3 standards, you must consider whether any Tier 1 or  Tier 2 engines that you produce have the appropriate physical and  performance characteristics for replacing the old engine; if you can  produce a Tier 2 engine with the appropriate physical and performance  characteristics, you must use it as the replacement engine.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must notify us within 30 days after you ship each  replacement engine under this section. Your notification must include  all the following things and be signed by an authorized representative  of your company:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of your records describing how you made the determination  described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section for this particular  engine.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total number of replacement engines you have shipped in the  applicable calendar year, from all your marine engine models.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following statement:</p><p class="depth4">I certify that the statements and information in the enclosed  document are true, accurate, and complete to the best of my knowledge. I  am aware that there are significant civil and criminal penalties for  submitting   false statements and information, or omitting required statements and  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The replacement engine must conform to the applicable  requirements of 40 CFR part 1043. Note that 40 CFR 1043.10 specifies  allowances for vessels that operate only domestically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The 40-year limit specified in 40 CFR 1068.240(a) does not apply  for engines subject to this part 1042. You may accordingly omit the  statement on the permanent labels specified in 40 CFR 1068.240  describing this limitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Modifying a vessel to significantly increase its value within  six months after installing a replacement engine produced under this  section is a violation of 40 CFR 1068.101(a)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We may void an exemption for an engine if we determine that any  of the conditions described in paragraph (a) of this section are not  met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We may reduce the reporting and recordkeeping requirements in  this section.
