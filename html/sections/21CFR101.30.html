                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies to any food that purports to be a beverage  that contains any fruit or vegetable juice (i.e., the product's  advertising, label, or labeling bears the name of, or variation on the  name of, or makes any other direct or indirect representation with  respect to, any fruit or vegetable juice), or the label or labeling  bears any vignette (i.e., depiction of a fruit or vegetable) or other  pictorial representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product  contains color and flavor that gives the beverage the appearance and  taste of containing a fruit or vegetable juice. The beverage may be  carbonated or noncarbonated, concentrated, full-strength, diluted, or  contain no juice. For example, a soft drink (soda) that does not  represent or suggest by its physical characteristics, name, labeling,  ingredient statement, or advertising that it contains fruit or vegetable  juice does not purport to contain juice and therefore does not require a  percent juice declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the beverage contains fruit or vegetable juice, the  percentage shall be declared by the words ``Contains -- percent (or %)  ------ juice'' or ``-- percent (or %) juice,'' or a similar phrase, with  the first blank filled in with the percentage expressed as a whole  number not greater than the actual percentage of the juice and the  second blank (if used) filled in with the name of the particular fruit  or vegetable (e.g., ``Contains 50 percent apple juice'' or ``50 percent  juice'').</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the beverage contains less than 1 percent juice, the total  percentage juice shall be declared as ``less than 1 percent juice'' or  ``less than 1 percent ------ juice'' with the blank filled in with the  name of the particular fruit or vegetable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the beverage contains 100 percent juice and also contains  non-juice ingredients that do not result in a diminution of the juice  soluble solids or, in the case of expressed juice, in a change in the  volume, when the 100 percent juice declaration appears on a panel of the  label that does not also bear the ingredient statement, it must be  accompanied by the phrase ``with added ------,'' the blank filled in  with a term such as ``ingredient(s),'' ``preservative,'' or  ``sweetener,'' as appropriate (e.g., ``100% juice with added  sweetener''), except that when the presence of the non-juice  ingredient(s) is declared as a part of the statement of identity of the  product, this phrase need not accompany the 100 percent juice  declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a beverage contains minor amounts of juice for flavoring and  is labeled with a flavor description using terms such as ``flavor'',  ``flavored'', or ``flavoring'' with a fruit or vegetable name and does  not bear:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``juice'' on the label other than in the ingredient  statement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explicit vignette depicting the fruit or vegetable from which  the flavor derives, such as juice exuding from a fruit or vegetable; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specific physical resemblance to a juice or distinctive juice  characteristic such as pulp then total percentage juice declaration is  not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the beverage does not meet the criteria for exemption from  total juice percentage declaration as described in paragraph (c) of this  section and contains no fruit or vegetable juice, but the labeling or  color and flavor of the beverage represents, suggests, or implies that  fruit or vegetable juice may be present (e.g., the product advertising  or labeling bears the name, a variation of the name, or a pictorial  representation of any fruit or vegetable, or the product contains color  and flavor that give the beverage the appearance and taste of containing  a fruit or vegetable juice), then the label shall declare ``contains  zero (0) percent (or %) juice''. Alternatively, the label may declare  ``Containing (or contains) no ------ juice'', or ``no ------ juice'', or   ``does not contain ------ juice'', the blank to be filled in with the  name of the fruits or vegetables represented, suggested, or implied, but  if there is a general suggestion that the product contains fruit or  vegetable juice, such as the presence of fruit pulp, the blank shall be  filled in with the word ``fruit'' or ``vegetable'' as applicable (e.g.,  ``contains no fruit juice'', or ``does not contain fruit juice'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the beverage is sold in a package with an information panel  as defined in Sec. 101.2, the declaration of amount of juice shall be  prominently placed on the information panel in lines generally parallel  to other required information, appearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Near the top of the information panel, with no other printed  label information appearing above the statement except the brand name,  product name, logo, or universal product code; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In easily legible boldface print or type in distinct contrast to  other printed or graphic matter, in a height not less than the largest  type found on the information panel except that used for the brand name,  product name, logo, universal product code, or the title phrase  ``Nutrition Facts'' appearing in the nutrition information as required  by Sec. 101.9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The percentage juice declaration may also be placed on the  principal display panel, provided that the declaration is consistent  with that presented on the information panel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the beverage is sold in a package that does not bear an  information panel as defined in Sec. 101.2, the percentage juice  declaration shall be placed on the principal display panel, in type size  not less than that required for the declaration of net quantity of  contents statement in Sec. 101.105(i), and be placed near the name of  the food.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In enforcing these regulations, the Food and Drug  Administration will calculate the labeled percentage of juice from  concentrate found in a juice or juice beverage using the minimum Brix  levels listed below where single-strength (100 percent) juice has at  least the

class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If there is no Brix level specified in paragraph (h)(1) of this  section, the labeled percentage of that juice from concentrate in a  juice or juice beverage will be calculated on the basis of the soluble  solids content of the single-strength (unconcentrated) juice used to  produce such concentrated juice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Juices directly expressed from a fruit or vegetable (i.e., not  concentrated and reconstituted) shall be   considered to be 100 percent juice and shall be declared as ``100  percent juice.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Calculations of the percentage of juice in a juice blend or a  diluted juice product made directly from expressed juice (i.e., not from  concentrate) shall be based on the percentage of the expressed juice in  the product computed on a volume/volume basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If the product is a beverage that contains a juice whose color,  taste, or other organoleptic properties have been modified to the extent  that the original juice is no longer recognizable at the time processing  is complete, or if its nutrient profile has been diminished to a level  below the normal nutrient range for the juice, then that juice to which  such a major modification has been made shall not be included in the  total percentage juice declaration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A beverage required to bear a percentage juice declaration on  its label, that contains less than 100 percent juice, shall not bear any  other percentage declaration that describes the juice content of the  beverage in its label or in its labeling (e.g., ``100 percent natural''  or ``100 percent pure''). However, the label or labeling may bear  percentage statements clearly unrelated to juice content (e.g.,  ``provides 100 percent of U.S. RDA of vitamin C'').</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Products purporting to be beverages that contain fruit or  vegetable juices are exempted from the provisions of this section until  May 8, 1994. All products that are labeled on or after that date shall  comply with this section.  [58 FR 2925, Jan. 6, 1993, as amended at 58 FR 44063, Aug. 18, 1993; 58  FR 49192, Sept. 22, 1993]</p>
