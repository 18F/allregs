trip setting shall not exceed 300 percent of the nominal current rating of the grounding diode;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Overcurrent devices must be used and installed in such a manner that the operating coil circuit of the main contactor will open when a fault current with a value of 25 percent or less of the diode rating flows through the diode;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The silicon diode installed must be suitable to the grounded polarity of the power system in which it is used and its threaded base must be solidly connected to the machine frame on which it is installed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> In addition to the grounding diode, a polarizing diode must be installed in the machine control circuit to prevent operation of the machine when the polarity of a trailing cable is reversed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> When installed on permissible equipment, all grounding diodes, overcurrent devices, and polarizing diodes must be placed in explosion proof compartments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> When grounding diodes are installed on a continuous miner, their nominal diode current rating must be at least 750 amperes or more; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> All grounding diodes shall be tested, examined and maintained as electrical equipment in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 75.512.</p>
