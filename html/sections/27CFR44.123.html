The charge against such bond shall be subject to increase upon receipt of tobacco products, and cigarette papers and tubes into the export warehouse and to decrease as satisfactory evidence of exportation, or satisfactory evidence of such other disposition as may be used as the lawful basis for crediting such bond, is received by the appropriate TTB officer with respect to such articles transferred or removed. When the limit of liability under a bond given in less than the maximum amount has been reached, no additional shipments shall be received into the warehouse until a strengthening or superseding bond is filed, as required by Sec. 44.124 or Sec. 44.125.
