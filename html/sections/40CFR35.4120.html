                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> After you submit an LOI, one of the first steps in applying for your TAG is determining whether your state requires review of your grant application. This review allows your governor to stay informed about the variety of grants awarded within your state. This process is called intergovernmental review. Your EPA regional office can provide you with the contact for your state's intergovernmental review process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You should call that state contact as early as possible in the application process so that you can allow time for this review process which may take up to 60 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA cannot process your application package without evidence that you have submitted it to the state for review, if your state requires it.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> EPA cannot award a TAG until the state has completed its intergovernmental review.</p>
