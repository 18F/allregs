The  referring agency shall give due weight to EEOC's determination that  reasonable cause exists to believe that title VII has been violated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the referring agency determines that the recipient has  violated any applicable civil rights provision(s) which the agency has a  responsibility to enforce, the agency shall so notify the complainant  and the recipient and determine whether further efforts to obtain  voluntary compliance are warranted. In reaching that determination, the  agency shall give due weight to the failure of EEOC's efforts to resolve  the complaint by informal methods. If the referring agency determines  that further efforts to obtain voluntary compliance are not warranted or  if such further efforts fail, the agency shall initiate appropriate  enforcement proceedings under its own regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the referring agency determines that the recipient has not  violated any applicable civil rights provision(s) which the agency has a  responsibility to enforce, the agency shall notify the complainant, the  recipient, the Assistant Attorney General and the Chairman of the EEOC  in writing of the basis of that determination.</p>
