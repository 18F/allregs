                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The temperature of the air supplied to the engine shall be between 68 F and 86 F. The engine fuel inlet temperature shall be 100 F [10 F and shall be measured at a point specified by the manufacturer. The observed barometric pressure shall be between 28.5 inches and 31 inches Hg. Higher air temperature or lower barometric pressure may be used, if desired, but no allowance will be made for possible increased smoke emissions because of such conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The governor and fuel system shall have been adjusted to provide engine performance at the levels in the application for certification required under Sec. 86.084-21.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The following steps shall be taken for each test:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Start cooling system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Warm up the engine by the procedure described in 40 CFR 1065.530.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determine by experimentation the dynamometer inertia and dynamometer load required to perform the acceleration in the dynamometer cycle for smoke emission tests (Sec. 86.884-7(a)(2)). In a manner appropriate for the dynamometer and controls being used, arrange to conduct the acceleration mode;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Install smokemeter optical unit and connect it to the recorder/data collection system. Connect the engine rpm and throttle position sensing devices to the recorder/data collection system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Turn on purge air to the optical unit of the smokemeter, if purge air is used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Check and record zero and span settings of the smokemeter. (If a recorder is used, a chart speed of approximately one inch per minute shall be used.) The optical unit shall be retracted from its position about the exhaust stream if the engine is left running;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Precondition the engine by operating it for 10 minutes at maximum rated horsepower;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Proceed with the sequence of smoke emission measurements on the engine dynamometer as prescribed in Sec. 86.884-7;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)(i)</em> During the test sequence of Sec. 86.884-7, continuously record smoke measurements, engine rpm, and throttle position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> During the test sequence of Sec. 86.884-7, continuously record smoke measurements, engine rpm, and throttle position.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a chart recorder is used for data collection, it shall be run at a minimum chart speed of one inch per minute during the idle mode and transitional periods, and eight inches per minute during the acceleration and lugging modes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Automatic data collection equipment, if used, shall sample at least two records per second.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The smoke meter zero and full scale response may be rechecked and reset during the idle mode of each test sequence.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If either zero or full-scale drift is in excess of 2 percent opacity, the smokemeter controls must be readjusted and the test must be repeated;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Turn off engine;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)(i)</em> Check zero and reset if necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Check zero and reset if necessary.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Check span response (linearity) of the smokemeter by inserting neutral density filters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If either zero drift or the linearity check is in excess of two percent opacity, the results shall be invalidated.
