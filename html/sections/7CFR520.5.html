ARS actions which, based on previous  experience, have been found to have limited scope and intensity and  produce little or no individual or cumulative impacts to the human  environment. Some examples are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Repair, replacement of structural components or equipment, or  other routine maintenance of facilities controlled in whole or in part  by ARS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Research programs or projects of limited size and magnitude or  with only short-term effects on the environment. Examples are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Research operations conducted within any laboratory, greenhouse  or other contained facility where research practices and safeguards  prevent environment impacts such as the release of hazardous materials  into the environment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inventories, studies or other such activities that have limited  context and minimal intensity in terms of changes in the environment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Testing outside of the laboratory, such as in small isolated  field plots, which does not involve the use of control agents requiring  containment or a special license or a permit from a regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions to categorical exclusions. An environmental  assessment shall be prepared for an activity which is normally within  the purview of categorical exclusion if there are extraordinary  circumstances which may cause such activity to have a significant  environmental effect.</p>
