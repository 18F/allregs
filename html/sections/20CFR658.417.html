Copies thereof shall be made available by the party submitting the document to other parties to the hearing upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Technical rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings conducted pursuant to this section, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination, shall be applied where reasonably necessary by the State hearing official. The State hearing official may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The case record, or any portion thereof, shall be available for inspection and copying by any party at, prior to, or subsequent to the hearing upon request.

Any documents submitted by the amicus curiae shall be included in the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The following standards shall apply to the location of hearings involving parties in more than one State or in locations within a State but which are separated geographically so that access to the hearing location is extremely inconvenient for one or more parties as determined by the State hearing official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever possible, the State hearing official shall hold a single hearing, at a location convenient to all parties or their representatives wishing to appear and present evidence, and with all such parties and/or their representatives present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a hearing location cannot be established by the State hearing official pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) of this section, the State hearing official may conduct, with the consent of the parties, the hearing by a telephone conference call from a State agency office with all parties and their representatives not choosing to be present at that location permitted to participate in the hearing from their distant locations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the State agency does not have the facilities to conduct hearings

by telephone pursuant to paragraph (m)(1) or (m)(2) of this section, the State agencies in the States where the parties are located shall take evidence and hold the hearing in the same manner as used for appealed interstate unemployment claims in those States, to the extent that such procedures are consistent with Sec. 658.416.
