                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of opt out--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided  in this section, the consumer's election to opt out prohibits any  affiliate covered by the opt out notice from using eligibility  information received from another affiliate as described in the notice  to make marketing solicitations to the consumer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Continuing relationship--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the consumer  establishes a continuing relationship with you or your affiliate, an opt  out notice may apply to eligibility information obtained in connection  with:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A single continuing relationship or multiple continuing  relationships that the consumer establishes with you or your affiliates,  including continuing relationships established subsequent to delivery of  the opt out notice, so long as the notice adequately describes the  continuing relationships covered by the opt out; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any other transaction between the consumer and you or your  affiliates as described in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of continuing relationships. A consumer has a  continuing relationship with you or your affiliate if the consumer:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Opens a brokerage account or enters into an advisory contract  with you or your affiliate;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Obtains a loan for which you or your affiliate owns the  servicing rights;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Purchases investment company shares in his or her own name;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Holds an investment through you or your affiliate; such as when  you act or your affiliate acts as a custodian for securities or for  assets in an individual retirement arrangement;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Enters into an agreement or understanding with you or your  affiliate whereby you or your affiliate undertakes to arrange or broker  a home mortgage loan for the consumer;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Enters into a lease of personal property with you or your  affiliate; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(G)</em> Obtains financial, investment, or economic advisory services  from you or your affiliate for a fee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> No continuing relationship--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. If there is no  continuing relationship between a consumer and you or your affiliate,  and you or your affiliate obtain eligibility information about a  consumer in connection with a transaction with the consumer, such as an  isolated transaction or an application that is denied, an opt out notice  provided to the consumer only applies to eligibility information  obtained in connection with that transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Examples of isolated transactions. An isolated transaction  occurs if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The consumer uses your or your affiliate's ATM to withdraw cash  from an account at another financial institution; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A broker-dealer opens a brokerage account for the consumer  solely for the purpose of liquidating or purchasing securities as an  accommodation, i.e., on a one-time basis, without the expectation of  engaging in other transactions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Menu of alternatives. A consumer may be given the opportunity to  choose from a menu of alternatives when electing to prohibit  solicitations, such as by electing to prohibit solicitations from  certain types of affiliates covered by the opt out notice but not other  types of affiliates covered by the notice, electing to prohibit  marketing solicitations based on certain types of eligibility  information but not other types of eligibility information, or electing  to prohibit marketing solicitations by certain methods of delivery but  not other methods of delivery. However, one of the alternatives must  allow the consumer to prohibit all marketing solicitations from all of  the affiliates that are covered by the notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for a notice following termination of all  continuing relationships--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. A consumer must be given a new  opt out notice if, after all continuing relationships with you or your  affiliate(s) are terminated, the consumer subsequently establishes  another continuing relationship with you or your affiliate(s) and the  consumer's eligibility information is to be used to make a marketing  solicitation. The new opt out notice must apply, at a minimum, to  eligibility information obtained in connection with the new continuing  relationship. Consistent   with paragraph (b) of this section, the consumer's decision not to opt  out after receiving the new opt out notice would not override a prior  opt out election by the consumer that applies to eligibility information  obtained in connection with a terminated relationship, regardless of  whether the new opt out notice applies to eligibility information  obtained in connection with the terminated relationship.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. A consumer has an advisory contract with a company  that is registered with the Commission as both a broker-dealer and an  investment adviser, and that is part of an affiliated group. The  consumer terminates the advisory contract. One year after terminating  the advisory contract, the consumer opens a brokerage account with the  same company. The consumer must be given a new notice and opportunity to  opt out before the company's affiliates may make marketing solicitations  to the consumer using eligibility information obtained by the company in  connection with the new brokerage account relationship, regardless of  whether the consumer opted out in connection with the advisory contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Duration of opt out. The election of a consumer to opt out must  be effective for a period of at least five years (the ``opt out  period'') beginning when the consumer's opt out election is received and  implemented, unless the consumer subsequently revokes the opt out in  writing or, if the consumer agrees, electronically. An opt out period of  more than five years may be established, including an opt out period  that does not expire unless revoked by the consumer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time of opt out. A consumer may opt out at any time.</p>
