                            <p class="depth0">This part describes how OWCP pays compensation under the FECA to employees of the United States who are neither citizens nor residents of the United States, any territory or Canada, as well as to any dependents of such employees. It has been determined that the compensation provided under the FECA is substantially disproportionate to the compensation for disability or death which is payable in similar cases under local law, regulation, custom or otherwise, in areas outside the United States, any territory or Canada and therefore a special schedule should apply to such cases This special schedule applies to any non-citizen non-resident Federal employee who is neither hired nor employed in the United States, Canada or in a possession or territory of the United States. Therefore, with respect to the claims of such employees whose injury (or injury resulting in death) has occurred subsequent to August 29, 2011, or may occur, the regulations in this part shall apply.</p>
