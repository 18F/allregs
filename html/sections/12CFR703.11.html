                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before purchasing or selling a security, a Federal credit union must obtain either price quotations on the security from at least two broker-dealers or a price quotation on the security from an industry-recognized information provider. This requirement to obtain price quotations does not apply to new issues purchased at par or at original issue discount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At least monthly, a Federal credit union must determine the fair value of each security it holds. It may determine fair value by obtaining a price quotation on the security from an industry-recognized information provider, a broker-dealer, or a safekeeper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At least annually, the Federal credit union's supervisory committee or its external auditor must independently assess the reliability of monthly price quotations received from a broker-dealer or safekeeper. The Federal credit union's supervisory committee or external auditor must follow generally accepted auditing standards, which require either re-computation or reference to market quotations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a Federal credit union is unable to obtain a price quotation required by this section for a particular security, then it may obtain a quotation for a security with substantially similar characteristics.</p>
