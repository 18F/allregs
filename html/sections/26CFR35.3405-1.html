                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to withholding on  pensions, annuities, and other deferred income under section 3405 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section 334 of the Tax Equity  and Fiscal Responsibility Tax Act of 1982 (Public Law 97-248) (TEFRA).</p><p class="depth0">a-1 through d-34 [Reserved]. For further guidance, see Sec. 35.3405- 1T.</p><p class="depth0">d-35. Q. Through what medium may a payor provide the notice required  under section 3405 to a payee?</p><p class="depth0">A. A payor may provide the notice required under section 3405  (including the abbreviated notice described in d-27 of Sec. 35.3405-1T  and the annual notice described in d-31 of Sec. 35.3405-1T) to a payee  on a written paper document. However, see Sec. 1.401(a)-21 of this  chapter for rules permitting the use of electronic media to provide  applicable notices to recipients with respect to retirement plans and  individual retirement plans.  [T.D. 8873, 65 FR 6007, Feb. 8, 2000; 65 FR 17149, Mar. 31, 2000, as  amended by T.D. 9294, 71 FR 61877, Oct. 20, 2006]    Sec. 35.3405-1T  Questions and answers relating to withholding on pensions, annuities, and certain other deferred income (temporary regulations).</p><p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to withholding on  pensions, annuities, and other deferred income under section 3405 of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as added by section 334 of the Tax Equity  and Fiscal Responsibility Tax Act of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-248) (TEFRA):</p><p class="depth0">a. In general.</p><p class="depth0">b. Periodic payments.</p><p class="depth0">c. Nonperiodic distributions.</p><p class="depth0">d. Notice and election procedures.</p><p class="depth0">e. Reporting and recordkeeping.</p><p class="depth0">a. In general</p><p class="depth0">a-1. Q. How did TEFRA change the law on withholding requirements for  pensions, annuities, and other deferred income?</p><p class="depth0">A. TEFRA amended the Internal Revenue Code to impose withholding  requirements on designated distributions paid after December 31, 1982.  Further, although under prior law individuals could elect to have  Federal income tax withheld from certain pension and annuity payments,  TEFRA requires withholding on all designated distributions unless the  payee elects not to have withholding apply.</p><p class="depth0">a-2. Q. What type of payment is a designated distribution that is  subject to the new withholding rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. A designated distribution is any distribution or payment from or  under an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement  plan (as defined in section 7701(a)(37)), or a commercial annuity.  However, a designated distribution does not include any portion of a  distribution which it is reasonable to believe is not includible in the  gross income of the payee. For rules concerning when it is reasonable to  believe that all or part of a distribution is not includible in the  gross income of the recipient, see questions a-24 through a-33. In  addition, a payment or distribution that is treated as wages under  section 3401(a) is not a designated distribution subject to the new  withholding rules. For examples of these payments, see questions a-18  through a-23.</p><p class="depth0">a-3 Q. What is an employer deferred compensation plan for purposes  of the new withholding rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. An employer deferred compensation plan is any pension, annuity,  profit-sharing, stock bonus, or other plan that defers the receipt of  compensation.</p><p class="depth0">a-4. Q. What is a commercial annuity for purposes of the new  withholding rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. A commercial annuity is an annuity, endowment, or life insurance  contract issued by an insurance company licensed to do business under  the laws of any State. See, also, question f-21.</p><p class="depth0">a-5. Q. When does the new law take effect?</p><p class="depth0">A. In general, withholding is required on any designated  distribution made after December 31, 1982. In the case of periodic  payments beginning before January 1, 1983, the first payment after  December 31, 1982 is treated as the first periodic payment for purposes  of the withholding requirements. The Secretary has authority to delay  (but not beyond June 30, 1983) the application of these withholding  provisions to any payor if the payor can establish that it is impossible  to comply with these provisions without undue hardship. Additionally, no  penalty will be imposed for failure to withhold on periodic payments if  the failure occurs before July 1, 1983, and if a good faith attempt is  made to comply.</p><p class="depth0">Procedures for requesting a delay in implementation of the  withholding provisions are under consideration.</p><p class="depth0">a-6. Q. What effect does the new law have on the old law provisions  relating to withholding of tax from annuity payments by request?</p><p class="depth0">A. If payment is part of a designated distribution, the rules of  section 3402(o) (relating to voluntary withholding on certain payments)  do not apply. Therefore, a payee receiving amounts that are subject to  withholding under the new provisions described in this regulation may  not choose to use the voluntary withholding system of section 3402(o)  with respect to those amounts. Also, if a payee had a fixed amount  withheld by request, a different amount will probably be withheld when  the new provisions take effect unless the rule provided in question a-7  applies. However, section 3402(o) will continue to apply to annuity  payments that are not designated distributions, to sick pay, and to  supplemental unemployment benefits.</p><p class="depth0">a-7. Q. If a recipient of a pension or annuity has previously  elected voluntary withholding under section 3402(o), is the Form W-4P  effective for withholding on payments after December 31, 1982?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, if the plan administrator or payor wishes to honor it; the  Form W-4P can be treated by the plan administrator or payor as an  election to withhold the flat dollar amount specified on the form if the  payee, is notified of his right to elect out of withholding and if he is  notified that his previously filed W-4P will remain effective unless he  elects out of withholding or files a new withholding certificate. If  these requirements are met the plan administrator or payor may treat the  Form W-4P as a voluntary withholding agreement under section 3402(p).  See, also, section 3402(i). These amounts withheld should be reported in  the same manner as amounts withheld under section 3405.</p><p class="depth0">a-8. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from  designated distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. The amount to be withheld by any payor (or, in certain cases, a  plan administrator) depends upon whether the payment is a periodic  payment, a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total  distribution, or a qualified total distribution. However, the maximum  amount to be withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money and  the fair market value of property (other than employer securities as  defined in section 402(a)(3)) received in the distribution.</p><p class="depth0">a-9. Q. What is a periodic payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. A periodic payment is an annuity or similar periodic payment  whether paid by a licensed life insurance company, a financial  institution, or a plan. The term ``annuity'' means a series of payments  payable over a period greater than one year and taxable under section 72  as amounts received as an annuity, whether or not the payments are  variable in amount.</p><p class="depth0">a-10. Q. How will federal income tax be withheld from a periodic  payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. In the case of a periodic payment, amounts are withheld as if the  payment were a payment of wages by an employer to the employee for the  appropriate payroll period. If the payee has not filed a withholding  certificate, the amount to be withheld is calculated by treating the  payee as a married individual claiming three withholding allowances.</p><p class="depth0">For additional questions and answers concerning periodic payments,  see part b.</p><p class="depth0">a-11. Q. How will Federal income tax be withheld from a ``qualified  total distribution?''</p><p class="depth0">A. A ``qualified total distribution'' means any designated  distribution which it is reasonable to believe is made within one  taxable year of the payee, is made from or under a qualified plan  described in section 401(a) or section 403(a), and consists of the  balance to the credit of the employee under the plans. For additional  questions and answers concerning qualified total distributions, see part  c. The amount to be withheld on qualified total distributions will be  determined under tables prescribed by the Secretary that approximate the  tax that would be imposed under section 402(e) if the payee elected to  treat the distribution as a lump sum distribution within the meaning of  section 402(e)(4)(A). See, in this respect, question c-8.</p><p class="depth0">a-12. Q. What amount of Federal income tax will be withheld from a  designated distribution that is not a periodic payment or a qualified  total distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. If a designated distribution is not a periodic payment or a  qualified total distribution, the amount to be withheld is computed by  multiplying the amount of the designated distribution by 10 percent.</p><p class="depth0">a-13. Q. Who must withhold?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, the payor of a designated distribution must withhold,  and is liable for payment of, the tax required to be withheld. However,  in the case of a distribution from a plan described in section 401(a)  (relating to pension, profit-sharing, and stock bonus plans), section  403(a) (relating to certain annuity plans), or section 301(d) of the Tax  Reduction Act of 1975 (relating to certain employee stock ownership  plans, sometimes called ``TRASOP's''), the plan administrator must  withhold, and is liable for payment of, the withheld tax unless he  directs the payor to withhold the tax and furnishes the payor with any  information that may be required by the Secretary in forms or  regulations. This provision applies to qualified plans as well as once  qualified plans that are no longer qualified. For a description of the  material that the plan administrator must furnish to the payor, see  question e-3.</p><p class="depth0">a-14. Q. Who is a plan administrator?</p><p class="depth0">A. Under section 414(g), the plan administrator is the person  specifically designated as the plan administrator by the terms of the  plan or trust. If the plan or trust does not specifically designate the  plan administrator (as provided in Sec. 1.414(g)-1(a) of the Income Tax  Regulations), then the plan administrator is generally determined as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a plan maintained by a single employer, the  employer is the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan maintained by two or more employers or  jointly by one or more employers and one or more employee organizations,  the association, committee, joint board of trustees, or other similar  group of representatives who maintain the plan is the plan  administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case in which (1) or (2) does not apply, the person  actually responsible for the control, disposition, or management of the  assets is the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0">a-15. Q. If a bank trustee, regulated investment company, or  insurance company makes a periodic payment to a payee solely at the  direction of an employer sponsored individual retirement account (IRA),  is the bank trustee, regulated investment company or insurance company a  payor subject to the pension withholding provisions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. the term ``payor'' generally means the person actually  paying the annuity or other payment (even if the person is acting as an  agent). Because this is not a payment from a plan described in section  401(a) or 403(a), responsibility for withholding is on the bank trustee,  regulated investment company, or insurance company and   not on the employer who sponsors the account.</p><p class="depth0">a-16. Q. If a bank trustee transfers plan funds to the employer who  sponsors a plan described in section 401(a) and the employer makes the  designated distributions, is the employer a payor?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The employer is a payor because it acts as an agent for the  bank trustee. Even though the plan administrator has transferred  liability to the bank trustee under section 3405(c)(2), the transfer of  funds to the employer does not relieve the bank trustee of its liability  for withholding because the rule on transfer of liability only applies  to plan administrators. Therefore, if the employer fails to withhold on  designated distributions, either the employer or the bank trustee may be  liable for failure to withhold. Note, however, that the plan  administrator could transfer liability for withholding to the employer  as payor under section 3405(c)(2). See, in this respect, questions e-2  and e-3.</p><p class="depth0">a-17. Q. Do the withholding provisions apply to annuities paid from  an employer deferred compensation plan, an individual retirement plan,  or a commercial annuity to the surviving spouse or other beneficiary of  a deceased payee?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes.</p><p class="depth0">a-18. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated  distributions under all nonqualified employer deferred compensation  plans?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The withholding provisions relating to pensions and annuities  do not apply to any amounts that are wages without regard to these  provisions. Wages to which the general wage withholding rules apply mean  any remuneration paid by an employer for services performed by an  employee unless the amount paid falls within one of the exceptions of  section 3401(a). For example, wages do not include remuneration paid to,  or on behalf of, an employee or beneficiary from or to a trust qualified  under section 401(a) and tax-exempt under section 501(a). There is no  exception for contributions to, or benefits paid from, some nonqualified  plans. In general, any contributions to, or benefits from, a  nonqualified plan that are taxable under section 83 are subject to wage  withholding at the time that they are includible in the recipient's  gross income.</p><p class="depth0">a-19. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated  distributions from a bond purchase plan described in section 405(a)?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Although a bond purchase plan is not a qualified plan,  section 3402(a) does not apply to contributions to, or distributions  from, such a plan. Therefore, designated distributions from a bond  purchase plan are subject to the new withholding rules of section 3405.  Similarly, the new withholding rules apply to designated distributions  of an individual retirement bond described in section 409 or from an  annuity plan described in section 403(a). For purposes of the  withholding provisions of section 3405, a designated distribution from a  bond purchase plan described in section 405(a) or an individual  retirement bond described in section 409 occurs when an individual  redeems a bond.</p><p class="depth0">a-20. Q. Do these withholding provisions apply to designated  distributions from a tax-sheltered annuity described in section 403(b)?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax  Regulations provides that there is no withholding required under the  wage withholding provisions to the extent that any amounts are taxable  under the rules of section 72 or 403. Because designated distributions  are not subject to the general wage withholding provisions, the new  provisions of section 3405 apply to these designated distributions.</p><p class="depth0">a-21. Q. An employer maintains a nonqualified deferred compensation  plan such as a supplemental executive retirement (``top hat'') plan.  Payments under the plan are made in the form of a single sum payment at  retirement. Amounts paid at retirement are includible in income as  compensation in the year received. Must the payor withhold on these  amounts according to the rules in section 3405?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Section 3405(d)(1)(B)(i) provides that a designated  distribution on which withholding is required does not include amounts  that are wages without regard to the rules of section 3405. Therefore,  withholding on payments that are includible in income as compensation  are based on the rules for   withholding on wages contained in section 3402.</p><p class="depth0">a-22. Q. Do the withholding provisions of section 3405 apply to a  retirement plan maintained by a State or local government on behalf of  its employees?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. A retirement plan maintained by a State or local government  on behalf of its employees is a plan that defers the receipt of  compensation. The fact that a plan deferring the receipt of compensation  is maintained by a governmental unit does not make the withholding  provisions inapplicable. Thus, annuity payments and other distributions  under the Federal Civil Service Retirement System or under the plan of  any State or municipality are subject to withholding.</p><p class="depth0">a-23. Q. Are payments from a state or local plan of deferred  compensation described in section 457 subject to the withholding  requirements of section 3405?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Amounts paid from a plan described in section 457 are paid  from a plan that defers the receipt of compensation. However, amounts  paid from a deferred compensation plan described in section 457 are  wages under section 3401(a). Therefore, the general wage withholding  rules, not the special rules of section 3405, apply to these payments.</p><p class="depth0">a-24. Q. An individual retires and begins receiving periodic  payments under a commercial annuity contract that was distributed to him  from a contributory qualified plan. The insurance company is the payor  and is liable for withholding because the plan administrator has  transferred liability under the rules of section 3405(c)(2). Must the  payor determine whether the employee's investment in the contract is  recoverable within three years?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Under section 72(d), if the annuity payments during the  first three years equal or exceed the amount contributed by the employee  to the plan, no amounts are includible in income until the employee's  contributions are recovered. Because the application of section 72(d)  may affect the extent to which it is reasonable to believe that amounts  are not includible in income and, therefore, not subject to withholding,  the payor must determine whether section 72(d) applies to the annuity  payments. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine the  employee's investment in the contract must be provided to the payor by  the plan administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.</p><p class="depth0">a-25. Q. If the payor in question a-24 determines that the  employee's investment in the contract is not recoverable within 3 years,  must the payor compute the exclusion ratio under section 72(b) to  calculate the amount of each payment that is not includible in gross  income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The operation of section 72(b) affects the extent to which  it is reasonable to believe that amounts are not includible in gross  income. Therefore, the payor must compute the exclusion ratio to  determine what portion of each payment is subject to withholding under  section 3405. As a general rule, the information necessary to determine  the employee's exclusion ratio must be provided to the payor by the plan  administrator. See, however, questions a-27 and a-33.</p><p class="depth0">a-26. Q. In questions a-24 and a-25, may the payor (i.e., the  insurance company) rely on the information furnished by the plan  administrator to determine the amounts that are includible in gross  income?</p><p class="depth0">A. In the absence of information to the contrary supplied by the  payee, the payor may rely on the information furnished by the plan  administrator. See, with respect to the plan administrator's duty to  report to the payor, questions e-2 and e-3.</p><p class="depth0">a-27. Q. What is the result in questions a-24 and a-25 if the plan  administrator fails to provide the payor with any information concerning  the amount of employee contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Until the earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the  plan administrator provides the payor with information concerning the  amount of employee contributions, it is reasonable for the payor to  assume that the employee's investment in the annuity contract is zero  unless the payor has independent specific knowledge of the amount of  employee contributions. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of  the amount of employee contributions, the payor must compute the taxable  portion of the payment based on the information supplied by the payee.  If the plan administrator   fails to provide the payor with this information on or before December  31, 1983, the plan administrator will be liable for failure to withhold  and pay the tax due. See questions e-2 through e-5 for rules on the plan  administrator's ability to transfer liability for withholding to the  payor. See also question a-33 with respect to the plan administrator's  failure to provide the necessary information prior to December 31, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">a-28. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of an  employee from an annuity described in section 403(b) on account of the  employee's death, is it reasonable to believe that the $5,000 death  benefit exclusion of section 101(b) is not includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Although the amount of the death benefit exclusion allowable  may be limited by section 101(b)(2)(B)(iii), the payor, for withholding  purposes, may use the maximum death benefit exclusion ($5,000) in  computing the amount of the distribution that is subject to withholding.  See also, in this respect, question c-3.</p><p class="depth0">a-29. Q. What is the appropriate treatment of a distribution  (whether periodic or nonperiodic) that includes employer securities?</p><p class="depth0">A. Employer securities are significant in the calculation of amounts  subject to withholding in two respects. First, the maximum amount to be  withheld cannot exceed the sum of the amount of money plus the fair  market value of property received, except employer securities. In other  words, a payor will not be forced to dispose of employer securities in  order to meet withholding tax liability. Thus, for example, if an  individual receives a distribution from a stock bonus plan that includes  $1,000 worth of employer stock and $5 in cash for payment of fractional  shares of stock, all of the cash, but none of the stock, may be retained  by the payor to satisfy the withholding obligation. Second, under  certain circumstances, the net unrealized appreciation in employer  securities is not includible in gross income. See, in this respect, the  rules of sections 402(a)(1) and 402(e)(4)(J).</p><p class="depth0">a-30. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that all net unrealized  appreciation from employer securities is not includible in gross income  in the case of a qualified total distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Although a qualified total distribution may include a  distribution that is not a lump sum distribution, it is reasonable to  believe that all net unrealized appreciation from employer securities is  not includible in gross income.</p><p class="depth0">a-31. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that a distribution is not  includible in gross income if the distribution consists of employee  contributions from a plan described in section 401(a) and the amount  distributed is not specifically designated as accumulated deductible  employee contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Employee contributions to a plan described in section 401(a)  are not deductible from gross income when contributed unless they are  deductible employee contributions under section 72(o)(5). Unless the  payor has specific knowledge that employee contributions distributed  from a plan described in section 401(a) are accumulated deductible  employee contributions, it is reasonable to assume that the amounts are  excludible from gross income in the year when received.</p><p class="depth0">a-32. Q. In the case of disability payments paid under a  noncontributory plan to a disability retiree who has not attained age  65, is it reasonable to believe that all amounts paid to the payee are  includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Whether or not all or part of the disability payments paid  under a noncontributory plan to a permanently disabled retiree who has  not attained age 65 are includible in gross income depends on the  adjusted gross income of the taxpayer and on whether the taxpayer is  permanently and totally disabled. In this situation, it is reasonable  for the payor to assume that all amounts paid to the payee are  includible in gross income unless the payor has specific independent  knowledge that all or part of the periodic payments are not includible  in gross income. Additionally, if the payee notifies the payor of the  amount excludible from gross income, the payor must compute the taxable  portion of the payment based on information provided by the payee.</p><p class="depth0">a-33. Q. In the case of a periodic payment, is it reasonable to  believe that all   amounts paid to the payee are includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. As an alternative to the general rule that a designated  distribution does not include amounts which it is reasonable to believe  are not includible in gross income, the payor of any periodic payment  may assume that the entire amount of the payment is includible in gross  income. The wage withholding tables must be used without adjustment for  the fact that Federal income tax is being withheld on the gross amount.  If the payor uses this alternative method of calculating the amount of  the designated distribution, he must include with the notice of the  election not to have withholding apply the following additional  statements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even  though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to  withholding because they are excludible from gross income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on  the payment; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The payee may adjust the allowances claimed on the withholding  certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he  may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the  taxable portion of each payment.</p><p class="depth0">This alternative will not apply to periodic payments made after the  earlier of December 31, 1983, or the date on which the plan  administrator supplies the payor with the information necessary to  calculate the taxable portion of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0">See, also, questions e-3, e-4, and e-5.</p><p class="depth0">a-34. Q. May the payor rely on a plan administrator's computation of  the amount to be withheld?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Although the plan administrator is not required to compute  the amount to be withheld in order to transfer liability for withholding  to the payor, the plan administrator may provide such information to the  payor, and the payor may rely on such computations unless the payor  knows or has reason to know that the computations are incorrect.</p><p class="depth0">a-35. Q. Under the plans of certain States, individuals may receive  payments from more than one retirement system, such as payments from the  state's teacher's retirement plan and from the state's regular  retirement plan. Must these payments be aggregated for purposes of  providing a single notice and election to a payee or for purposes of  determining whether the floor on withholding tax (i.e., $5,400 for a  married individual claiming three allowances) has been reached?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. However, if it is feasible to aggregate payments under more  than one retirement system, the payor is permitted to do so for these  purposes.</p><p class="depth0">a-36. Q. If a payment is made by one check to more than one  beneficiary, such as a surviving spouse and a minor child, how is the  amount to be withheld computed?</p><p class="depth0">A. The payor may compute the withholding on a payment made by one  check to more than one beneficiary as if the payment were made to only  one beneficiary. In this case, the payor must base withholding for the  total amount of the designated distribution on the withholding  certificate of the payee to whom the election was sent.</p><p class="depth0">Alternatively, if each payee files a withholding certificate and the  payor knows the amount of the payment of which each payee is entitled,  the payor may determine the amount to be withheld with respect to each  payee. If the payor does not know the amount of the payment to which  each payee is entitled, he may treat the payment as being made pro-rata  to each payee. If only one withholding certificate is received, the  payor must base withholding for the total amount of the designated  distribution on the withholding certificate of one of the payees, such  as the surviving spouse's certificate. Thus, if notice of the election  not to have withholding apply is supplied to each payee at the times  required in section 3405(c) (10) and only one payee makes the election  or files a certificate, the payor must assume that the election or  filing was made by the payee on behalf of the other payees.</p><p class="depth0">a-37. Q. If a payor makes an error in computing the amount of a  designated distribution that is subject to withholding, must the payor  make a retroactive correction of the error?</p><p class="depth0">A. No, provided the error was a reasonable one. Thus, if a payor  either   underwithholds or overwithholds because the amount of the designated  distribution (i.e., the taxable portion of the payment) was incorrectly  calculated, no retroactive make-up is required if one of the following  applies: (1) The payor reasonably relied on information furnished by the  plan administrator (including the computation of the amount to be  withheld), (2) the payor relied on a payee's representations on the  withholding certificate, (3) the payor reasonably relied on the rules of  this regulation, or (4) the payor made a mathematical error in  computations. However, if the amount of the designated distribution is  correctly computed, but the payor makes an error in applying the  withholding tables, the normal rules concerning failure to withhold and  pay the tax will apply.</p><p class="depth0">b. Withholding on Periodic Payments</p><p class="depth0">b-1. Q. Is the payor of periodic payments required to aggregate such  payments with a payee's compensation to determine the amount of tax to  be withheld under section 3405(a)(1)?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Although the payor must withhold from any periodic payment  the amount that has to be withheld if the payment were a payment of  wages by an employer to an employee for a payroll period, the amount to  be withheld under section 3405(a)(1) is calculated separately of any  amounts that actually are wages to the payee for the same period.</p><p class="depth0">b-2. Q. Can either the percentage method (section 3402(b)) or the  wage bracket method (section 3402(c)) be used to determine the  withholding liability on a periodic payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Withholding on a periodic payment is accomplished by  treating the payment as if it were wages. Therefore, unless the employee  has elected not to have withholding apply, any method of withholding  that is an appropriate method for withholding on wages is also an  appropriate method for withholding on periodic payments. Refer to the  Employer's Tax Guide (Circular E) and Publication 493, Alternative Tax  Withholding Methods and Tables for the general procedures on  withholding, deposit, payment, and reporting of Federal income tax  withheld. Note, however, that any specific procedures contained in this  regulation take precedence over any contrary rules in Circular E and  Publication 493.</p><p class="depth0">b-3. Q. Do rules similar to those for wage withholding applly to the  filing of a withholding certificate for periodic payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Unless the rules of section 3405 specifically conflict with  the rules of section 3402, the rules for withholding on periodic  payments will parallel the rules for wage withholding. Thus, if a  withholding certificate is filed by a payee, it will generally take  effect as provided in section 3402(f)(3) for certificates filed to  replace existing certificates. If a withholding certificate is furnished  by a payee on or before the date on which payments commence, it takes  effect with respect to payments made more than 30 days after the  certificate is furnished, unless the payor elects to make it effective  at an earlier date. If a withholding certificate is furnished by a payee  after the date on which payments commence, it takes effect with respect  to payments made on or after the status determination date (January 1,  May 1, July 1, or October 1) that is at least 30 days after the date the  certificate is filed, unless the payor elects to make it effective at an  earlier date. If no withholding certificate is filed, the amount  withheld is determined as if the payee were a married person claiming  three withholding allowances.</p><p class="depth0">b-4. Q. If no withholding certificate has been filed and the payor  is aware that the payee is single, is it still appropriate to base  withholding on a married individual claiming three allowances?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. If no withholding certificate is filed, the payor is not  required or permitted to base withholding on the amount of allowances  the payee actually is entitled to claim. Thus, the payor must base  withholding on the rates for a married person with three withholding  allowances.</p><p class="depth0">b-5. Q. May a payor determine whether payments to an individual are  subject to withholding based on the amount of the first periodic payment  for the year?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Periodic payments can vary during a calendar year because of   make-up of past due payments, variable rates of payments, or cost-of- living adjustments, so that withholding based on the first payment  within a year may be an inaccurate measure of withholding on total  payments for the year. Therefore, the amount to be withheld is  determined each payment period in the same manner as applies to  withholding on wages. See, in this respect, Circular E and the  regulations under section 3402.</p><p class="depth0">b-6. Q. If a payment period is specified as by the terms of a  commercial annuity contract, must this period be used as the appropriate  period for determining the amount to be withheld?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Similarly, if the payment period is designated in a plan  administrator's report or on an individual retirement account payout  schedule agreed to by payor and payee, this period must be used as the  appropriate payment period.</p><p class="depth0">b-7. Q. If the payor received no report from the plan administrator  or beneficiary concerning the payment period, but knows the frequency of  payments, can the known frequency be used as the appropriate payment  period?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. However, if no report is received and the payor has no  knowledge of the frequency of payments, then he must treat the  distribution as a nonperiodic distribution. Therefore, a distribution  cannot be a periodic payment unless the frequency of payments is known.  See, in this respect, questions b-8 and c-2. For rules concerning the  plan administrator's failure to provide this information, see questions  e-2 and e-3.</p><p class="depth0">b-8. Q. If a payee receives a one-time payment that is a make-up  payment resulting from an insurance company's incorrect calculation of a  monthly annuity amount, is the one-time payment part of a series of  periodic payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Because the one-time payment is a catch-up of prior amounts  due as periodic payments, it is treated as part of a series of periodic  payments. These payments are treated for withholding purposes in a  manner similar to the treatment of supplemental wage payments in  Sec. 31.3402(g)-1 of the Employment Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">c. Withholding on Nonperiodic Distributions</p><p class="depth0">c-1. Q. Must an individual receive a lump-sum distribution within  the meaning of section 402(e)(4) to have a qualified total distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. A ``qualified total distribution'' is any distribution that  (i) is a designated distribution, (ii) is reasonable to believe is made  within one taxable year of the recipient, (iii) is made under a plan  described in section 401(a) or 403(a), and (iv) consists of the balance  to the credit of the employee under such plan. Thus, a distribution from  a plan described in section 401(a) that does not meet the requirements  (such as the minimum 5-year period of participation in section  402(e)(4)(H)) for a lump sum distribution within the meaning of section  402(e)(4) may still be a qualified total distribution for purposes of  withholding.</p><p class="depth0">c-2. Q. If a class year plan permits annual withdrawal of  participants' vested amounts, are these withdrawals considered periodic  payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. A class year plan is a plan under which amounts contributed  by an employer for a year become vested a number of years (e.g., five  years) after the year in which the amounts are contributed. Generally,  class year plans permit withdrawals each year of amounts that have  vested during the year. However, these distributions are not made with  respect to an established frequency of payments, so the withdrawals must  be treated as nonperiodic distributions, subject to withholding at the  10 percent rate.</p><p class="depth0">c-3. Q. If a beneficiary receives the balance to the credit of a  payee from an annuity contract on account of the payee's death, is this  final payment a nonperiodic distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The lump sum death benefit in this situation is a one-time  payment that cannot be characterized as a periodic payment. The payment  may be a qualified total distribution if the requirements of section  3405(c)(4) are satisfied, but otherwise it will be treated as a  nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total distribution.</p><p class="depth0">c-4. Q. Is it permissible to assume that an individual is a calendar  year taxpayer   for purposes of determining whether a distribution is a ``qualified  total distribution?''</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, unless the payor or plan administrator has reason to believe  that the payee is not a calendar year taxpayer. The payor or plan  administrator has reason to believe that the payee is not a calendar  year taxpayer if the payee tells the payor or plan administrator that he  is not a calendar year taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0">c-5. Q. Is a distribution of accumulated deductible employee  contributions with earnings that is paid on account of an employee's  separation from service treated as a qualified total distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. As long as the other requirements for a qualified total  distribution are met, a distribution of accumulated deductible employee  contributions with earnings is eligible for withholding at the rate  applicable to qualified total distributions even though the distribution  could never be a lump sum distribution. Because accumulated deductible  employee contributions are treated separately in determining whether a  distribution is a qualified total distribution, the answer would be the  same even if the recipient received none (or a portion) of the vested  employer contributions in his account.</p><p class="depth0">c-6. Q. What is meant by the ``balance to the credit'' of an  employee under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a)?</p><p class="depth0">A. In general, the balance to the credit of an employee includes any  amount credited to the employee under the plan on the date the  distribution commences. The balance to the credit of an employee  includes an amount credited after the date the distribution commences if  it is attributable to services performed before that date or is  attributable to earnings on an amount credited to the employee before  that date. Additionally, the balance to the credit of an employee  includes any amount payable as an annuity with respect to the employee  under the plan. Amounts that have been placed in a separate account for  the funding of medical benefits under section 401(h) or amounts that are  forfeitable under the plan are not included in the balance to the credit  of an employee. Finally, accumulated deductible employee contributions  (within the meaning of section 72(o)(5)(B)) are not included in the  balance to the credit of an employee for the purposes of determining  whether a distribution is a ``qualified total distribution.''</p><p class="depth0">c-7. Q. Can a payor rely on a plan administrator's report in  determining whether a distribution consists of the balance to the credit  of an employee under a plan?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. If the plan administrator does not inform the payor that the  distribution consists of the balance to the credit of the employee, the  payor may not assume that the distribution is a qualified total  distribution and must treat the distribution as a nonperiodic  distribution that is not a qualified total distribution. However, the  payor may rely on the payee's representations that a distribution does  consist of the balance to the credit of the employee under the plan.</p><p class="depth0">c-8. Q. What table must be used to calculate the amount to be  withheld from a ``qualified total distribution?''</p><p class="depth0">A. The table to be used for withholding on ``qualified total  distributions'' will be published by the Secretary in the near future.</p><p class="depth0">d. Notice and Election Procedures</p><p class="depth0">d-1. Q. May a payee elect not to have Federal income tax withheld  from a designated distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Withholding is not required on any periodic payment or  nonperiodic distribution if the payee elects not to have withholding  apply. If the payee makes this election, it is effective until revoked.  The payor is required to provide each payee with notice of the right to  elect not to have withholding apply and of the right to revoke the  election.</p><p class="depth0">d-2. Q. In the case of a designated distribution made on account of  the death of an employee, who makes the election not to have withholding  apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. The election may be made by the beneficiary of plan benefits  specified by the decedent in accordance with plan procedures or, if  there is no designated beneficiary, by the beneficiary specified under  the terms of the plan. If there is not a designated beneficiary and the  terms of the plan do not specify a beneficiary, then the election may be  made by the executor or the personal representative of the decedent.</p><p class="depth0">d-3. Q. Who is required to provide notice to the payee of the  payee's right not to have withholding apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B) requires the payor to provide notice to  the payee of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding apply.  Thus, even if the plan administrator has failed to transfer liability  for withholding to the payor, the payor must provide notice to the  payees.</p><p class="depth0">d-4. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have  withholding apply be given for periodic payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. In the case of periodic payments, notice of the election must be  provided not earlier than six months before the first payment and not  later than when making the first payment. However, even if notice is  provided at a date before the first payment,notice must also be given  when making the first payment. Thereafter, notice must be provided at  least once each calendar year of the right to make the election and to  revoke the election.</p><p class="depth0">d-5. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding  apply be provided to those payees whose annual payments are less than  $5,400?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. However, under the statute, notice is only required to be  provided when making the first payment. Therefore, a payor may provide  notice to a payee with annual payments less than $5,400 by indicating to  the payee when making the first payment that no Federal income tax will  be withheld unless the payee chooses to have withholding apply by filing  a withholding certificate, if the payor also provides information  concerning where a withholding certificate may be obtained.</p><p class="depth0">d-6. Q. Must notice of the right to elect not to have withholding  apply be provided in the same manner to all payees?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. If the payor provides notice to all payees when making the  first payment, the payor may, in addition, provide earlier notice as  provided in section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I) to selected groups of payees,  such as those payees whose annual payments are over $5,400.</p><p class="depth0">d-7. Q. Must notice be attached to the first payment to satisfy the  requirement that notice be provided ``when making'' the first payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Because many payees utilize electronic funds transfer to  deposit their pension or annuity checks, notice does not have to be  attached physically to the check.</p><p class="depth0">d-8. Q. If a payee utilizes electronic funds transfer and notice is  mailed directly to the payee at the same time the check is issued, is  the notice requirement satisfied even though the payee receives the  notice fifteen days after the check is deposited?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Although it is desirable that the notice reach the payee  immediately prior to or concurrent with receipt of the check, the notice  requirement is deemed to be satisfied if the payee receives the notice  within 15 days before or after receipt of the first payment.</p><p class="depth0">d-9. Q. When is the payor required to notify the payee of his right  to elect not to have withholding apply to a nonperiodic distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(ii) requires that notice must be provided  to the payee at the time of a nonperiodic distribution. Since notice  provided at the time of the distribution could result in delay of  receipt of the benefit check if the payee elects out of withholding,  notice for nonperiodic distributions should be given not earlier than  six months prior to the distribution and not later than the time that  will give the payee reasonable time to elect not to have withholding  apply and to reply to the payor with the election information. What is  reasonable time depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case.</p><p class="depth0">d-10. Q. What is a ``reasonable time'' for notice with respect to a  nonperiodic distribution from a qualified plan?</p><p class="depth0">A. The ``reasonable time'' requirement is satisfied with respect to  a nonperiodic distribution if the notice is included in the basic claim  for benefits application that is provided to the participant by the plan  administrator.</p><p class="depth0">d-11. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment provides notice of the  election not to have withholding apply within the time specified by  section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(I), may the payor specify a time prior to  distribution by which the election must be made?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The election not to have withholding apply is generally  given effect as provided in section 3402(f)(3)   for a certificate filed to replace an existing certificate. However, the  payor may require that the election is made up to 30 days before the  first payment to be effective for the first payment. See question b-3.</p><p class="depth0">d-12. Q. If the payor of a nonperiodic distribution provides notice  of the election not to have withholding apply within a reasonable time  prior to the distribution, may the payor specify a time prior to  distribution by which the election must be made?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The payee has the right to make or revoke an election at any  time prior to the distribution. Therefore, the payor may place a  deadline on the time to elect without delaying payment of the  distribution, but must accept any election or revocation made up to the  time of distribution.</p><p class="depth0">d-13. Q. What is a ``reasonable time'' for notice with respect to a  distribution from an individual retirement account?</p><p class="depth0">A. A payor may provide notice of the election not to have  withholding apply at the time the beneficiary requests a withdrawal from  his individual retirement account. This rule also applies to  distributions from bank sponsored prototype plans and other plans that  permit withdrawals on request.</p><p class="depth0">d-14. Q. If notice is provided to a payee prior to the first payment  of a periodic payment, why must it also be provided at the time of the  first payment or distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(II) of the Internal Revenue Code  requires such notice. In addition, because the payee has the right to  make an election or to revoke a prior election at any time prior to the  beginning of the payment period, notice must be provided when making the  first payment in order to offer the payee ample opportunity to make or  revoke an election not to have withholding apply even if the election  will not be effective until later payments.</p><p class="depth0">d-15. Q. If a payee who has been receiving periodic payments is  rehired by the same employer, has his benefits suspended, and then  recommences receiving periodic payments, must notice again be provided  to the payee?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Upon recommencement of benefits, the first payment  thereafter is treated as the first payment for purposes of the notice  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">d-16. Q. Must a payor provide notice if it is reasonable to believe  that the entire amount payable is excludible from the payee's gross  income?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Amounts which it is reasonable to believe are not includible  in gross income are not designated distributions. Therefore, no notice  is required of the ability to elect not to have withholding apply.</p><p class="depth0">d-17. Q. If the payor of a periodic payment under a qualified plan  knows that an employee's investment in an annuity contract will be  recovered within three years, must he provide notice of the right to  elect out of withholding at the time the first payment is made?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The first payment is not a designated distribution, and,  therefore, is not a periodic payment subject to the notice requirements  of section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i). There is no withholding obligation until  the employee's investment in the contract is recovered because those  amounts that equal the investment in the contract are not includible in  gross income and, therefore, are not designated distributions.  Therefore, the first payment after the employee's investment in the  contract is recouped is the first payment for purposes of the notice  requirements.</p><p class="depth0">d-18. Q. What information concerning the election not to have  withholding apply must be provided by the payor to the payee?</p><p class="depth0">A. Notice to a payee must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notice of the payee's right to elect not to have withholding  apply to any payment or distribution and how to make that election,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notice of the payee's right to revoke such an election at any  time and a statement that the election remains effective until revoked,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A statement to advise payees that penalties may be incurred  under the estimated tax payment rules if the payments of estimated tax  are not adequate and sufficient tax is not withheld from the payment or  distribution.</p><p class="depth0">In the event that the payor does not know what part of a  distribution is includible in gross income and treats these payments as  provided in question   a-33, the following additional statements must be included with the  notice:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tax will be withheld on the gross amount of the payment even  though the payee may be receiving amounts that are not subject to  withholding because they are excludible from gross income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> This withholding procedure may result in excess withholding on  the payment, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The payee may adjust his allowances claimed on the withholding  certificate if he wants a lesser amount withheld from each payment or he  may provide the payor with the information necessary to calculate the  taxable portion of each payment.</p><p class="depth0">d-19. Q. Is there any information that, although not required, it is  desirable to include in the notice to payees?</p><p class="depth0">A. It is desirable to include a statement in the notice to payees  that the election not to have withholding apply is prospective only and  that any election made after a payment or distribution to the payee is  not an election with respect to that payment or distribution.</p><p class="depth0">d-20. Q. May the plan administrator provide the notice to payees on  behalf of the payor?</p><p class="depth0">A. The plan administrator may provide notice on behalf of the payor.  However, the payor has sole responsibility for providing this notice  whether or not the plan administrator has shifted liability for  withholding to the payor, and if the plan administrator fails to provide  adequate notice, the payor is responsible.</p><p class="depth0">d-21. Q. Is there a sample notice that can be used to satisfy the  notice requirement for periodic payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Any payor who uses the following sample notice is deemed to  satisfy the notice requirement if notice is timely provided:</p><p class="depth0">Notice of Withholding on Periodic Payments</p><p class="depth0">Beginning on January 1, 1983, the [pension] OR [annuity] payments  you receive from the [insert name of plan or company] will be subject to  Federal income tax withholding unless you elect not to have withholding  apply.

The payor may provide a single statement for the payee to  fill out and return that would enable the payee to elect not to have  withholding apply or to revoke a previous election and, at the same  time, would enable the payee to claim the number of withholding  allowances and, also, the dollar amount the payee wants withheld.</p><p class="depth0">d-24. Q. Will a notice mailed to the last known address of the payee  fulfill the notice requirement of section 3405(d)(10)(B)?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes.</p><p class="depth0">d-25. Q. Is there a sample notice that can be used to satisfy the  notice requirement for nonperiodic distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Any payor who uses the following sample notice is deemed to  satisfy the notice requirement if notice is timely provided:</p><p class="depth0">Notice of Withholding on Distributions or Withdrawals From Annuities,</p><p class="depth0">IRA's, Pension, Profit Sharing, Stock Bonus, and Other Deferred</p><p class="depth0">Compensation Plans</p><p class="depth0">The [distributions] OR [withdrawals] you receive from the [insert  name of plan or company] are subject to Federal income tax withholding  unless you elect not to have withholding apply.

It is permissible to provide with the payment a statement  that the payee has the right to elect out of withholding. For example,  the following sample notice could be used to satisfy the notice  requirement if the payor has provided notice previously:</p><p class="depth0">If Federal income taxes have been withheld from the [pension] OR  [annuity] payments you are receiving and if you do not wish to have  taxes withheld, you should notify [insert name and address]. However, if  you elect not to have withholding apply to your [pension] OR [annuity]  payments, or if you do not have enough Federal income tax   withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payment, you may be  responsible for payment of estimated tax. You may incur penalties under  the estimated tax rules if your withholding and estimated tax payments  are not sufficient.</p><p class="depth0">If Federal income taxes are not being withheld from your [pension]  OR [annuity] payment because you have elected not to have withholding  apply and if you wish to revoke that election and have Federal income  taxes withheld from your [pension] OR [annuity] payments, you should  notify [insert name and address].</p><p class="depth0">d-28. Q. Must an employee who receives a distribution from a plan  described in section 401(a) that includes amounts attributable to  employer contributions and to accumulated deductible employee  contributions make two elections not to have withholding apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Although accumulated deductible employee contributions are  treated separately in determining whether a distribution is a qualified  total distribution, an employee needs to make only one election not to  have withholding apply to any distributions occurring at the same time  from or under the same plan. However, the plan administrator could  require the employee to make separate elections with respect to the  distributions.</p><p class="depth0">d-29. Q. If the administrator of a plan described in section 401(a)  makes a qualified total distribution to an employee out of funds  contained in two or more trusts, must the employee make a separate  election not to have withholding apply with respect to the distribution  from each trust?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The fact that a plan may use several trusts does not  eliminate treatment of the distribution as a single qualified total  distribution for which only one election is necessary.</p><p class="depth0">d-30. Q. Is it permissible to provide notice to persons already in  pay status on January 1, 1983, in a newsletter of the plan  administrator?</p><p class="depth0">a. Yes, provided that this notice is received by the payee within 15  days of the payee's receipt of the first periodic payment after December  31, 1982, and such notice provides the means to make an election and  instructions for electing not to have withholding apply. It is desirable  that payees be afforded the maximum opportunity to make the election  provided by section 3405(a)(2). Payors are encouraged to give payees  notice of their election opportunities at least 30 days before the first  periodic payment after December 31, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">d-31. Q. Is it permissible to provide the annual notice required by  section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III) on January 1, 1984, December 31, 1985,  and January 1, 1986?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The annual notice required by section 3405(d)(10)(B)(i)(III)  should be provided at approximately the same time each calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">d-32. Q. Under what circumstances may an election made with respect  to a nonperiodic distribution apply to subsequent distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, any election not to have withholding apply to a  nonperiodic distribution may apply to any subsequent payment or  distribution from or under the same plan or arrangement. However, the  payor must still provide notice of the election and revocation  procedures upon each subsequent distribution and must include the  statement concerning liability for payment of estimated tax if the payee  does not have withholding applied.</p><p class="depth0">d-33. Q. How may a payee who intends to make a qualifying rollover  (as defined in section 402(a)(5) or section 408(d)(3)) of a distribution  elect not to have Federal income tax withheld from the distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. The payee may elect not to have withholding apply by making the  election on the form provided by the payor. Alternatively, if the payee  directs the payor to pay over the distribution to a qualified plan or an  individual retirement account, the payor may treat this direction as an  election not to have withholding apply.</p><p class="depth0">d-34. Q. If a payee claims more than 14 withholding allowances on a  withholding certificate, must the payor remit a copy of the withholding  certificate to the Internal Revenue Service?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Because a payee may, at any time, elect out of withholding,  the rules of Sec. 31.3402(f)(2)-1(g) of the Employment Tax Regulations  do not apply. Therefore, a payee may claim more than 14 allowances and  the payor need not remit the withholding certificate to the Internal  Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0">e. Reporting and Recordkeeping</p><p class="depth0">e-1. Q. If designated distributions are made from or under a plan  described in section 401(a), who has responsibility for making the  returns and reports required by section 6047(e)?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, the plan administrator, as defined in section 414(g),  is responsible for maintaining the records and making the reports  required by section 6047(e). However, if the plan administrator fails to  keep the required records and make the required reports, the employer  maintaining the plan is responsible for the reports and returns.</p><p class="depth0">e-2. Q. How may a plan administrator of a plan described in section  401(a) or 403(a) transfer his duty to withhold to a payor?</p><p class="depth0">A. A plan administrator of a plan described in section 401(a) or  403(a) may transfer the liability for withholding by (1) directing the  payor in writing to withhold the tax and (2) providing the payor with  any required information. This direction is presumed to remain in effect  until the plan administrator revokes it in writing.</p><p class="depth0">e-3. Q. What information must the plan administrator provide to the  payor in order to transfer his liability for withholding?</p><p class="depth0">A. The general rule is that the plan administrator must provide the  payor with all information necessary to compute correctly the  withholding tax liability. To satisfy this requirement, the plan  administrator must explicitly inform the payor of the information that  would be reportable on the Form W-2P or 1099R or that such information  is not applicable to a particular payee or to any payments under the  plan. For example, if the plan administrator is silent with respect to  any employee contributions, he has not satisfied his reporting  obligation even if there are no employee contributions to the plan.  Thus, the plan administrator is expected to provide the payor with the  following minimum information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and social security number of the payee and  the payee's spouse or other beneficiary if applicable,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The existence and amount of any employee contributions,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The amount of accumulated deductible employee contributions, if  any,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The payee's cost basis in any employer securities and the  current fair market value of the securities,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The existence and amount of any premiums paid for the current  cost of life insurance that were previously includible in income,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A statement of the reason (e.g., death, disability, retirement)  for the payment or distribution,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The date on which payments commence and the amount and frequency  of payments,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The age of the payee and of the payee's spouse or designated  beneficiary if applicable, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Any other information required by Form W-2P or 1099R.</p><p class="depth0">If, prior to December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to  provide the payor with the information required in items (2) through (5)  the payor is liable for withholding. However, the payor may withhold on  the payment as if all amounts are includible in gross income. See  question a-33.</p><p class="depth0">e-4. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator does not  notify the payor of the amount of employee contributions with respect to  one payee, has withholding liability shifted to the payor?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The plan administrator satisfies the requirements of  question e-3 as to the information that must be supplied to the payor so  long as the failure to provide the required information occurs on an  infrequent basis or the plan administrator informs the payor in writing  that he has made a good faith effort to supply all the required  information but the amount of employee contributions as to a particular  payee is unavailable.</p><p class="depth0">e-5. Q. If, after December 31, 1983, the plan administrator fails to  supply the payor with any information concerning the existence or amount  of any employee contributions, has withholding liability shifted to the  payor?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. The plan administrator has not satisfied his reporting  obligation as required in question e-3 as to employee contributions even  if there are no employee contributions unless he affirmatively states  that there are no employee contributions or states that the   reporting of this item is not applicable in determining the payee's tax  liability.</p><p class="depth0">e-6. Q. Is it permissible to satisfy the requirements of section  6047(e) by maintaining records necessary to provide the information  contained on Form W-2P and 1099R?</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 6047(e) will be satisfied if, in addition to the  information necessary to complete Forms W-2P and 1099R, the following  information is maintained:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payee's date of birth (if known), and date of spouse's or  designated beneficiary's birth (if applicable and known);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan administrator's name, address, and employer identification  number (EIN);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan's name and identification number and sponsor's name,  address, and EIN; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Date on which payments commence and amount and frequency of  payments.</p><p class="depth0">e-7. Q. If the interim method of withholding on periodic payments  (i.e., withholding on the gross amount) is used, must the employer, plan  administrator, or issuer of any contract still maintain the information  required by Form W-2P?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Even if this interim method is used, the recipient must be  provided with the information that will enable him to determine his tax  liability and adjust his claimed exemptions or claim a credit or refund.</p><p class="depth0">e-8. What events trigger the reporting requirements of section  6047(e)?</p><p class="depth0">A. Reporting is required any time there is a designated distribution  to which section 3405 applies. Therefore, the old law rule that  distributions of less than $600 per year do not require reporting no  longer applies. Additionally, an exchange of insurance contracts under  which any designated distribution (including a tax-free exchange under  section 1035) may be made is a reportable event even though a designated  distribution does not occur. To insure proper reporting when a  designated distribution is made under the new contract, it is  anticipated that the issuer of the contract to be exchanged will provide  the information necessary to compute the amount to be withheld to the  policyholder and to the issuer of the new contract.</p><p class="depth0">e-9. Q. Will the reporting requirement be satisfied if Form W-2P or  Form 1099R is filed?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In the absence of other forms or regulations, the reporting  requirement is satisfied if Form W-2P or Form 1099R is filed with  respect to each payee.</p><p class="depth0">e-10. Q. How should the payor or plan administrator remit payments  of amounts withheld under section 3405?</p><p class="depth0">A. The payor or plan administrator must deposit the amount withheld  under section 3405 an authorized financial institution in accordance  with the provisions of Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i) of the Procedure and  Administration Regulations, which provides the procedures for depositing  employment taxes. For purposes of applying these procedures to amounts  withheld under section 3405, the term ``taxes'' as defined in  Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(iii) includes the income tax withheld under  section 3405 with respect to designated distributions. A payor or plan  administrator who remits these amounts in accordance with those rules  must report the amounts deposited on the same Form 941 or 941E,  whichever is appropriate, that he uses to report the employment taxes he  had deposited under Sec. 31.6302(c)-1(a)(1)(i).</p><p class="depth0">f. Other</p><p class="depth0">f-1. Q. If a plan administrator or other payor distributes property  other than cash to payees, is it permissible to use the value of the  property as of the last preceding valuation date to determine the amount  of Federal income tax that must be withheld from each distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In many situations, the plan administrator or payor will not  be able to determine the value of property to be distributed as of the  date of distribution without delaying payment to the payee. In these  cases, the plan administrator or payor may determine the value of the  property to be distributed as of the last preceding valuation date prior  to the date of distribution, as long as the valuation is made at least  once each year. If the most recent valuation date occurred within the 90  days immediately preceding the date of   distribution, the next most recent valuation date may be used.</p><p class="depth0">f-2. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a payee receives only  property other than employer securities?</p><p class="depth0">A. A payor or plan administrator must satisfy the obligation to  withhold on distributions of property other than employer securities  even if this requires selling all or part of the property and  distributing the cash remaining after Federal income tax is withheld.  However, the payor or plan administrator may instead permit the payee to  remit to the payor or plan administrator sufficient cash to satisfy the  withholding obligation. Additionally, if a distribution of property  other than cash includes property that is not includible in a designated  distribution, such as the distribution of U.S. Savings Bonds or an  annuity contract, such property need not be sold or redeemed to meet any  withholding obligation.</p><p class="depth0">f-3. Q. If a designated distribution includes cash and property  other than employer securities, is it permissible to satisfy the  withholding obligation with respect to the entire distribution by using  the cash distributed, provided the cash distributed is sufficient to  satisfy the withholding obligation?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, as long as there is sufficient cash to satisfy the  withholding obligation for the entire distribution. There is no  requirement that tax be withheld from each type of property in portion  to its value.</p><p class="depth0">f-4. Q. If a loan from a qualified plan is treated as a distribution  under section 72(p), is the amount of the loan subject to withholding  under section 3405?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. If, and to the extent that, the loan is treated as a  distribution when made, withholding is accomplished by withholding tax  from the amount of the loan that is treated as a distribution. Thus, for  example, if a loan of $12,000 that must be repaid within 5 years is made  to a common law employee with a vested account balance of $5,000, $2,000  is treated as a distribution under section 72(p), and the payor or plan  administrator must withhold tax from the $2,000.</p><p class="depth0">f-5. Q. Is a loan that is treated as a distribution under section  72(p) a nonperiodic distribution other than a qualified total  distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes.</p><p class="depth0">f-6. Q. Must a payor or plan administrator withhold tax on a  nonperiodic distribution (including a qualified total distribution) if  the amount of the distribution is less than $200?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. However, all amounts received within one taxable year of the  payee from the payor or plan administrator under the same plan or  arrangement must be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the  $200 floor is reached. If the payor or plan administrator does not know  at the time a first payment of $200 or less is made whether there will  be additional payments during the year for which aggregation is  required, the payor or plan administrator need not withhold from the  first payment. If distributions are made within one taxable year under  more than one plan of an employer, the plan administrator or payor may,  but need not, aggregate the distributions for purposes of determining  whether the $200 floor is reached.</p><p class="depth0">f-7. Q. If a nonperiodic distribution (including a qualified total  distribution) to a payee will be less than $200, must the payor provide  notice to the payee of the right to elect not to have withholding apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. No.</p><p class="depth0">f-8. Q. How is withholding accomplished if a qualified total  distribution is paid in installments during one taxable year of the  payee?</p><p class="depth0">A. Withholding can be accomplished on a qualified total distribution  that is paid in installments within one taxable year by either one of  the following methods:</p><p class="depth0">Under Option 1, the tax on the first installment is calculated under  the qualified total distribution table. The tax on each subsequent  installment is calculated by finding the tax under the table on the  cumulative amount of the installments for the year and subtracting the  amount of tax already withheld from the tax due with respect to the  cumulative amount of the installments.</p><p class="depth0">Under Option 2, the payor or plan administrator can withhold the tax  on all installments except the final installment at a 10 percent rate.  The tax on the final installment may be calculated by finding the tax  under the   qualified total distribution table on the cumulative amount of the  installments for the year and subtracting the amount of tax already  withheld from the installments. Option 2 may be used even if the amount  of the tax that should be withheld from the final installment under the  qualified total distribution tables exceeds the amount of the final  installment. The plan administrator or payor will not be subject to  penalties under section 6651 with respect to the difference between the  tax that should have been withheld from the final installment under the  qualified total distribution tables and the amount of the final  installment.</p><p class="depth0">The effect of these alternatives is illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">An individual receives within one taxable year the balance to his  credit under a plan described in section 401(a) or 403(a). The balance  to his credit is paid in three installments of $1,000, $10,000, and  $60,000. The amount of tax to be withheld from the installments may be  calculated under Option 1 or Option 2.</p><p class="depth0">Option 1--Withholding on each installment computed by finding tax  under qualified total distribution tables on the cumulative amount of  the distribution and subtracting the tax already withheld.

Q. A plan described in section 401 (a) invests in life  insurance contracts for its participants. Each year the current cost of  the life insurance element (PS 58 cost) is taxable to the participants  under section 72. Is withholding required on this amount even though  there is no amount actually distributed to the participant?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Because the PS 58 costs are not distributed or deemed to be  distributed, they are not designated distributions for which withholding  is required.</p><p class="depth0">f-10. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in  section 401 (a) has been properly reporting distributions on a multiple  contract basis for purposes of section 72. How should the plan  administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is  includible in gross income for withholding purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A. In the absence of revenue rulings or regulations to the contrary,  the plan administrator or payor of a plan that properly reports  distributions on a multiple contract basis should use that method to  determine the taxable portion of a payment for withholding purposes.</p><p class="depth0">f-11. Q. The plan administrator or payor of a plan described in  section 401 (a) has been reporting distributions on a multiple contract  basis for purposes of section 72 and has properly switched to the single  contract method for reporting distributions. How should the plan  administrator or payor determine the amount of each payment that is  includible in gross income for withholding purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A. If a plan has properly switched from the multiple contract basis  to the single contract basis for reporting distributions, the plan  administrator or payor may assume that all amounts prior to the year of  switch were reported by the payees on a multiple contract basis.  Therefore, for example, in the case of an individual whose annuity  payments have not commenced prior to the date of the switch to a single  contract basis, the payee's investment in the contract can be assumed to  have been recovered on a multiple contract basis prior to the year of  the switch   and on a single contract basis thereafter for purposes of determining  the amount of each payment that is includible in gross income for  withholding purposes. This rule applies even though payees may have  amended their income tax returns for prior years to report all payments  on a single contract basis.</p><p class="depth0">f-12. Q. If a plan that makes payments subject to the withholding  and notice requirements of section 3405 makes separate payments to the  same individual as a retired participant and as a surviving spouse of a  retired participant, must the two payments be aggregated for withholding  purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A. No, unless the payor wishes to aggregate them.</p><p class="depth0">f-13. Q. An insurance company makes payments under certain variable  annuity contracts. The Investment Company Act of 1940 (section 22(e))  applies to these variable annuity contracts and requires that the  insurance company make a pay-out within 7 days after a payee requests a  withdrawal from his contract. Under these circumstances, how may notice  be provided to a payee of his right to elect out of withholding for a  nonperiodic distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A. In this situation, the insurance company has only seven days in  which to notify a payee of his right to elect out of withholding. It is  not feasible for the insurance company to secure an election in writing  unless the payee supplies the written election at the time he requests a  withdrawal. Therefore, the notice and election can be provided in the  following manner: (1) The insurance company may mail a notice to a payee  on the day the request for withdrawal is received and (2) the notice may  specify that unless the payee calls the company at a toll-free telephone  number supplied on the notice within seven days of the date the request  was received, the company will withhold from the distribution. Notice  provided in this manner is deemed to satisfy the ``reasonable time''  requirement of question d-9. Insurance companies that encounter this  problem are encouraged to supply an election form to a payee at the time  an annuity contract is purchased. If a payee supplies an election with  the request for withdrawal, notice still must be given but the insurance  company may honor the election received if no other communication is  received after notice is provided to the payee.</p><p class="depth0">f-14. Q. If an individual receives periodic payments from two or  more plans of one member of a controlled group of corporations, separate  periodic payments from two members of a controlled group of corporations  out of one plan, or periodic payments from separate plans of two members  of a controlled group, must the periodic payments be aggregated for  withholding purposes?</p><p class="depth0">A. No, unless the plan administrator or payor wishes to aggregate  the payments. Section 414(b) does not require that plans of a controlled  group of corporations be aggregated for withholding purposes. The same  rule applies to a group of trades or businesses under common control or  an affiliated service group described in section 414 (c) or (m).</p><p class="depth0">f-15. Q. How is withholding applied to a designated distribution  from an individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a)  that is payable upon demand even though payments are scheduled to be  made over a period certain greater than one year?</p><p class="depth0">A. Distributions from IRAs that are payable upon demand are not  periodic payments taxable under section 72 because they do not  constitute annuity contracts within the meaning of section 408(d)(2).  Therefore, designated distributions from an IRA that are payable upon  demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject to withholding  at the 10% rate even if the distributions are paid over a period  certain.</p><p class="depth0">f-16. Q. Under the rules of section 72, a portion of certain  payments that may vary because of investment experience, cost of living  indices, or similar criteria is treated as not received as an annuity.  For withholding purposes, must these amounts be treated as nonperiodic  distributions even though part of each payment is a periodic payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. For withholding purposes, amounts will be considered periodic  payments even though a portion of each payment is treated as an amount  not received as an annuity under Sec. 1.72-2(b)(3) of the Income Tax  Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">f-17. Q. Is the payor of distributions under a funded nonqualified  deferred compensation plan that are payable as an annuity and taxable  under section 72 required to withhold under section 3405?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Section 31.3401(a)-1(b)(1)(i) of the Employment Tax  Regulations provides that any amounts received as an annuity and taxable  under section 72 are excepted from the general definition of wages.  Therefore, to the extent that section 402(b) requires that distributions  from nonqualified plans which are received as an annuity are taxable  under the rules of section 72, section 3405 will apply. See, however,  question a-18 for the rules relating to distributions from a  nonqualified deferred compensation plan that are taxable under section  83. Therefore, whether the payor or plan administrator of a nonqualified  plan is required to withhold under section 3402 or section 3405 depends  upon what section of the Code governs the taxation of amounts  contributed or distributed.</p><p class="depth0">f-18. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete  surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity  subject to the new withholding rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete  surrender or upon the maturity or endowment of a commercial annuity are  subject to the new withholding rules to the extent that they are  designated distributions. Thus, withholding is required on the complete  or partial surrender of an annuity, life insurance or endowment contract  to the extent they are designated distributions.</p><p class="depth0">f-19. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial surrender of  a commercial annuity periodic payments?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, no. Unless the amount paid in connection with the  partial surrender is one of a series of payments payable over a period  of greater than one year and taxable under section 72 as an amount  received as an annuity, the amount paid is not a periodic payment.</p><p class="depth0">f-20. Q. Are amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete  surrender of an annuity contract subject to the new withholding rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Amounts paid in connection with a partial or complete  surrender of an annuity contract are subject to the new withholding  rules to the extent that they are designated distributions.</p><p class="depth0">f-21. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in  connection with a commercial annuity that was acquired on or before  August 13, 1982, or are otherwise described in section 72(e)(5), which  are not treated as amounts received as an annuity under section 72, will  not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, yes. Under the rules of section 72(e) prior to the  passage of TEFRA, amounts not received as an annuity were not taxable  until the investment in the contract was recovered. Thus, for  distributions that are not received as an annuity under a commercial  annuity contract acquired on or before August 13, 1982, it is reasonable  to believe that amounts distributed are not includible in the payee's  gross income to the extent they represent unrecovered investment in the  contract. The special transitional rule of question a-33, available for  plan administrators, may be used until December 31, 1983, by payors of  commercial annuities who lack records with regard to the payee's  unrecovered investment in the contract.</p><p class="depth0">f-22. Q. For commercial annuity contracts entered into after August  13, 1982, which are not described in section 72(e)(5), is it reasonable  to believe that amounts distributed, which are not amounts received as  an annuity under section 72, are not includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, no. TEFRA amended section 72(e) to provide that  amounts not received as an annuity will be includible in gross income  until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the investment  in the contract have been distributed. Thus, it is not reasonable to  believe that amounts distributed in connection with a commercial annuity  contract entered into after August 13, 1982, are excludible from gross  income until all earnings or other amounts that are not part of the  investment in the contract have been distributed. This new rule does not  apply to distributions from commercial annuities described in section  72(e)(5). Question f-21 provides the proper rule   with respect to distributions from commercial annuities described in  section 72(e)(5).</p><p class="depth0">f-23. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts involved solely in  connection with an exchange of commercial annuities under section 1035  of the Code will not be includible in the gross income of the recipient?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Designated distributions include only amounts that it is  reasonable to believe are includible in the gross income of the  recipient. In the case of a commercial annuity exchange under section  1035 in which no cash or other property is exchanged, it is reasonable  to believe that no portion is includible in the gross income of a  recipient. An annuity exchange includes an exchange of annuity,  endowment, or life insurance contracts issued by a life insurance  company licensed to do business under the laws of any State. Thus, such  exchanges are not subject to the withholding rules of section 3405.  However, see question e-8 concerning recordkeeping requirements with  respect to the nontaxable exchange of commercial annuity contracts under  section 1035.</p><p class="depth0">f-24. Q. Is it reasonable to believe that amounts distributed in  connection with a surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract,  or in connection with an exchange of life insurance or endowment  contracts in which cash or other property is distributed, will not be  includible in gross income?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, no. Amounts distributed in connection with the  surrender of a life insurance or endowment contract, or in connection  with an exchange of life insurance or endowment contracts in which cash  or other property is distributed are includible in income to the extent  that the amount received exceeds the policyholder's investment in the  contract. However, if a life insurance or endowment contract issued  before August 13, 1982, is surrendered within ten years of the date of  its issuance, or is exchanged within ten years of the date of its  issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the  gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received  by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the  life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $10,000. If a life  insurance or endowment contract issued before August 13, 1982, is  surrendered or exchanged ten years or more after the date of its  issuance, the payor may assume that no amounts are includible in the  gross income of the policyholder if the cash or other property received  by the policyholder in connection with the surrender or exchange of the  life insurance or endowment contract does not exceed $5,000. If the  payor utilizes the special rule in the two preceding sentences, the  payor must notify the policyholder, at the time described in question d- 4, that all or part of the amount distributed may be includible in the  policyholder's gross income. See question f-23 for additional rules  concerning certain exchanges of annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0">f-25. Q. Do the requirements of section 3405(d)(10), relating to the  time at which notice must be provided, also apply to the time at which  an election out of withholding may be made?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, yes. For example, an individual may not at  commencement of employment execute an election out of withholding to be  honored by a plan administrator or payor when the individual terminates  employment and receives a distribution from a deferred compensation  plan. See, however, question f-13 for a special rule applicable to  certain annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0">f-26. Q. If a payor provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, but  failed to include all of the information required by question d-18, may  the abbreviated notice of question d-27 be supplied when making the  first payment?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, as long as the abbreviated notice contains all of the  information required by question d-18 that was not supplied with the  earlier notice.</p><p class="depth0">f-27. Q. When must notice of the right to elect not to have  withholding apply be given as to designated distributions from an  individual retirement account (IRA) described in section 408(a) that is  payable on demand even though payments are scheduled to be made over a  period greater than one year?</p><p class="depth0">A. Under question f-15, designated distributions from an IRA that  are payable upon demand are treated as nonperiodic distributions subject  to withholding at the 10 percent rate even   if the distributions are paid over a certain period. Section  3405(d)(10)(B)(i) requires the payor of a nonperiodic distribution to  transmit to the payee notice, at the time of the distribution or at such  earlier time as may be provided in regulations, of the right to elect  not to have withholding apply. If distributions from an IRA have begun  and are scheduled to be made at quarterly or more frequent intervals,  then, in lieu of providing a notice at the time of each distribution,  the payor may furnish a blanket notice applicable to all such  distributions that are expected to be made to the payee from the account  during a calendar year. Such a blanket notice must be furnished at a  reasonable time before the first payment made in the calendar year to  which the notice relates, except that a blanket notice relating to  distributions from an IRA during 1983 may be made by the later of  October 1, 1983, or the date of the first designated distribution from  the IRA.</p><p class="depth0">g. Delay Procedures</p><p class="depth0">g-1. Q. When does the new law take effect?</p><p class="depth0">A. In general, withholding is required on any designated  distributions made after December 31, 1982.</p><p class="depth0">g-2. Q. Is there a penalty for failure to withhold under section  3405 on designated distributions made after December 31, 1982?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In general, section 6651 governs the failure to file a  return and to withhold tax under section 3405.</p><p class="depth0">g-3. Q. Are there any circumstances under which the withholding and  notice requirements of section 3405 may be delayed to a date later than  January 1, 1983?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. The Secretary has authority to delay, but not beyond June  30, 1983, the application of these withholding provisions to any payor  or plan administrator if the payor or plan administrator can establish  that he is unable to comply with these provisions without undue  hardship.</p><p class="depth0">g-4. Q. Under what circumstances may a payor or plan administrator  who is experiencing undue hardship in complying with section 3405 delay  implementation of the notice and withholding requirements?</p><p class="depth0">A. For those payors and plan administrators who experience undue  hardship in complying with the provisions of section 3405, the  withholding and notice requirements of section 3405 may be delayed so  long as undue hardship exists up to July 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">g-5. Q. Must approval be obtained from the Internal Revenue Service  to be entitled to the delay referred to in question g-4 if the delay  will be no later than April 1, 1983?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. If a payor or plan administrator can establish that undue  hardship would result if required to comply with the provisions of this  section before April 1, 1983, prior approval from the Internal Revenue  Service is not required and should not be requested. For purposes of  this delay up to April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be presumed to  exist, in the absence of bad faith, as long as the payor or plan  administrator can establish that at least one of the conditions listed  in question g-6 is present. The payor or plan administrator should  prepare and retain a statement of undue hardship as described in  question g-9 and should maintain any documents necessary to support the  representations made in that statement.</p><p class="depth0">g-6. Q. What constitutes undue hardship?</p><p class="depth0">A. For purposes of these delay procedures, the term ``undue  hardship'' generally means more than an inconvenience or increased costs  to the payor or plan administrator. In the case of a payor or plan  administrator who complies with the notice and withholding requirements  of section 3405 on or before April 1, 1983, undue hardship will be  presumed to exist if one or more of the following conditions is present:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The payor or plan administrator encounters significant delay or  other substantial difficulty in obtaining authorization for funds to  develop forms, to mail notices, to process responses, to develop new  computer programs, or to obtain and train personnel to implement  withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The payor or plan administrator incurs substantial increases in  unbudgeted costs to develop forms, to mail notices, to process  responses, to develop new computer programs, or to obtain and train  personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> There is difficulty in obtaining trained personnel, including  professional or semi-professional individuals, whose skills are  necessary to implement withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Training new or present employees or hiring new employees to  implement withholding would cause substantially increased costs or would  disrupt the payor's or plan administrator's operations, and such  disruption or increased costs would not occur if withholding were  implemented at a later date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Plan benefits change due to a collective bargaining agreement  concluded between October 1, 1982, and April 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A payor who provided notice prior to January 1, 1983, receives a  substantial number of inquiries from payees. These inquiries indicate  the payees' lack of understanding of the new withholding provisions and  the payor cannot answer all questions and receive responses by January  1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The payor or plan administrator is unable to implement  withholding on account of the occurrence of an event, such as fire,  flood, earthquake, explosion, or strike, beyond the control of the payor  or plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The payor or plan administrator is scheduled to install a new  data processing hardware package or system between December 1, 1982, and  July 1, 1983, that will be used for the process of pension withholding.</p><p class="depth0">An examble of a circumstance not considered as resulting in undue  hardship would be changes in the withholding tables effective July 1,  1983.</p><p class="depth0">The following examples illustrate situations in which an undue  hardship that will permit delay in implementation of the notice and  withholding provisions exists:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A is the payor and plan administrator of a deferred  compensation plan that is the subject of a collective bargaining  agreement. The collectively bargained plan has fewer than 100  participants receiving annuity payments. All of A's available budget is  scheduled to be used to pay plan benefits and administrative costs, and  no funds are available to implement the new withholding requirements. A  must obtain authorization to expend funds to implement withholding.  Meetings at which A can obtain such authorization are held August 1 and  February 1 of each year. After obtaining authorization on February 1,  1983, A will need to develop and mail withholding notices and elections,  process responses and determine the amount to be withheld from each  payee's annuity payment. A can implement withholding on April 1, 1983,  without substantially disrupting its operations, but earlier  implementation would disrupt its normal operations. Under these facts, A  experiences undue hardship until at least April 1, 1983, as a result of  the circumstances described in items (1) and (4) of question g-6.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. B, a bank, is a payor of pensions and annuities under  plans described in section 401(a). The plan administrators of all these  plans have transferred liability to B for withholding under section  3405. After T.D. 7839, relating to withholding from pensions, annuities  and other deferred income, was published in the Federal Register on  October 14, 1982, B determines that the withholding provisions can be  implemented before April 1, 1983, on a reasonaable schedule, without  substantial increases in costs or disruption of daily bank operations,  according to the following schedule:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> B's counsel analyzes regulations and reports requirements to  operations personnel; operations personnel develop new Forms, which are  reviewed and revised by management and legal personnel; new forms are  printed; personnel begin reprogramming computers, 8 weeks (Dec 9, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Forms distributed to branch offices, 1 week (Dec 16, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Forms mailed to payees, 1 week (Dec 23, 1982).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Time allowed for response to mailing of notices, answering  questions, mailing follow-up notices to payees, 6 weeks (Feb 3, 1983).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Withholding calculated and entered into payment system, 6 weeks  (Mar 17, 1983).</p><p class="depth0">Total: 22 weeks.</p><p class="depth0">Implementation is scheduled to begin March 17, 1983. Implementation  prior to March 17, 1983, would substantially increase costs and would  disrupt B's operations.</p><p class="depth0">Under these facts, B experiences undue hardship under item (4) of  question g-6, up to March 17, 1983, the scheduled date of  implementation.</p><p class="depth0">g-7. Q. If a payor or plan administrator qualifies for the delay  described in question g-5, is there a procedure for requesting an  additional delay up to July 1, 1983?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. However, any request made for this additional delay will be  considered on a case-by-case basis. It is anticipated these requests  will be carefully scrutinized and generally will be granted only in  circumstances where the payor or plan administrator can reasonably  expect that more than one of the conditions described in question   g-6 will exist on or after April 1, 1983, and up to July 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">g-8. Q. How may a payor or plan administrator request this  additional delay of up to 3 months for undue hardship?</p><p class="depth0">A. The payor or plan administrator may request an additional delay  of up to 3 months by filing in duplicate a written statement of undue  hardship signed under penalties of perjury with the director of the  service center where the payor or plan administrator files Form 941 or  Form 941E. This written request must state on the envelope and at the  top of the letter ``PENSION WITHHOLDING: Undue Hardship'' and must  include all the information required in a statement of undue hardship as  described in question g-9.</p><p class="depth0">g-9. Q. What information must the statement of undue hardship  include?</p><p class="depth0">A. The statement of undue hardship must include the following  information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer indentification number of the  payor or plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A complete statement of the facts upon which the payor is  relying to show why a delay beyond April 1, 1983, is warranted. This  statement must include as many of the conditions of undue hardship  listed in question g-6 as pertain to the payor or plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A schedule or plan of implementation showing dates on which the  payor will implement the provisions of this section, with no date later  than July 1, 1983. This schedule should provide a complete timetable  that includes such items as development of forms, mailing of notices,  time for responses, programming computers, and calculation of  withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> An explanation of the steps taken which demonstrate the payor's  or plan administrator's good faith attempt to comply with these notice  and withholding requirements.</p><p class="depth0">g-10. Q. When must the plan administrator or payor file this request  for delay and statement of undue hardship?</p><p class="depth0">A. Payors or plan administrators must file the statement of undue  hardship on or before March 1, 1983. However, no request for delay may  be filed with the Internal Revenue Service before January 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">g-11. Q. Who must request the delay?</p><p class="depth0">A. The delay should be requested by the payor or plan administrator  who is actually liable for withholding. Therefore, generally the payor  should request the delay. However, in the case of a distribution from a  plan described in section 401(a), section 403(a), or section 301(d) of  the Tax Reduction Act of 1975, the plan administrator is liable for  withholding and should request the delay unless the plan administrator  has transferred liability for withholding to the payor under section  3405(c).</p><p class="depth0">g-12. Q. If a plan administrator has not yet transferred liability  for withholding under section 3405(c) or has inadequately transferred  liability, and the payor requests a delay, will the request for delay be  treated as if the plan administrator had requested it?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes.</p><p class="depth0">g-13. Q. If a plan administrator and a payor both file requests for  delay and statements of undue hardship with respect to the same plan,  will there be two separate three-month extensions?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. A request for delay will delay the effective date only up to  three months and in no case will it extend it past July 1, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">g-14. Q. What are the consequences for failure to file the request  for delay and statement of undue hardship in a timely manner?</p><p class="depth0">A. If the request for delay and statement of undue hardship are not  filed in a timely manner, the payor or plan administrator will not be  entitled to any delay beyond the delay to which he may be entitled under  question g-5. This rule will not apply in the case of an event such as  strike, fire, flood, earthquake, or explosion that occurs after March 1,  1983, if compliance with the withholding provisions would have been  possible absent the occurrence of the event.</p><p class="depth0">g-15. Q. Will a payor or plan administrator receive a response from  the Internal Revenue Service as to whether a delay after April 1, 1983,  has been granted?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Since these requests for delay will be reviewed on a case- by-case basis, the payor or plan administrator will receive a response  by April 1, 1983, as to whether or not a requested delay has been  granted. If the request for   delay is denied by the director of the service center, the payor or plan  administrator is required to begin withholding by the later of April 1,  1983, or 10 days from the date on the response. No penalties will be  imposed under section 6651 for failure to withhold between April 1,  1983, and the day 10 days from the date on the response.</p><p class="depth0">g-16. Q. If the director of the service center grants a delay up to  July 1, 1983, must the payor or plan administrator retain a copy of the  response from the Internal Revenue Service?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In addition, the payor or plan administrator must attach a  copy of the response to the first Form 941 or 941E filed after the  response is received.</p><p class="depth0">g-17. Q. If a plan administrator or payor begins withholding before  April 1, 1983, or July 1, 1983, can the payee request a refund from the  plan administrator or payor of the amounts withheld?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Because plan administrators and payors are required to comply  with the withholding and notice requirements as soon as they no longer  experience undue hardship, they cannot refund any amounts withheld to a  payee, except as provided in the regulations under section 6413 (in the  case of a mistake by the payor or plan administrator).</p><p class="depth0">g-18. Q. If a payor or plan administrator properly files the  statement of undue hardship and receives a delay as provided in question  g-7, will withholding from payments made after the delay period be  required to make up for amounts that would have been withheld if there  had been no delay granted?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. No catch-up withholding is required for plan administrators  or payors who are entitled to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided  in question g-5 or granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, as provided in  question g-7. However, if a payor or plan administrator who is entitled  to a delay up to April 1, 1983, as provided in question g-5, is not  granted a delay up to July 1, 1983, but is unable to implement  withholding until July 1, 1983, despite a good faith effort to comply,  no penalties will be imposed under section 6651 if the payor or plan  administrator withholds between July 1, 1983, and December 31, 1983,  both the amounts required to be withheld during that period and the  amounts that should have been withheld between April 1, 1983, and June  30, 1983.</p><p class="depth0">g-19. Q. If a payor or plan administrator does not receive and is  not otherwise entitled to a delay under these regulations, will  withholding from future payments be required to make up for amounts that  would have been withheld if there had been no delay?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, to the extent possible. An example of a situation in which a  payor or plan administrator would not be able to withhold enough from  subsequent payments to satisfy pre-July 1, 1983, withholding obligations  is one where the recipient of a single life annuity died on July 1,  1983, before the payor or plan administrator began to withhold income  tax from the annuity. In addition, a payor or plan administrator would  not be able to satisfy the pre-July 1, 1983, withholding requirements if  the payee elects out of withholding before all of the make-up  withholding has been accomplished.</p><p class="depth0">g-20. Q. What are the consequences if the payor or plan  administrator cannot establish undue hardship and does not comply on  January 1, 1983?</p><p class="depth0">A. In general, if the payor or plan administrator cannot establish  undue hardship and fails to withhold beginning January 1, 1983, the  payor or plan administrator will be liable for the tax that should have  been withheld and, in addition, the penalties provided in section 6651  will apply. However, the payor or plan administrator will not be liable  for penalties for failure to file a return and for failure to pay the  tax if a good faith effort is made to comply, and if, to the extent  possible, withholding from post-implementation payments is sufficient to  satisfy the pre-implementation withholding obligation. Whether the payor  or plan administrator has made a good faith effort to comply depends on  the facts and circumstances of each case. The facts and circumstances  that will be considered include, but are not limited to, those  conditions listed in question g-6.</p><p class="depth0">g-21. Q. If a payor or plan administrator is required to make up  amounts that should have been withheld, must he   withhold from the first subsequent payment the entire amount that should  have been previously withheld?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. A payor or plan administrator may withhold a proportional  amount out of each subsequent payment made before January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0">g-22. Q. Will the notice requirements of section 3405 apply before  July 1, 1983, with respect to recipients of periodic payments that total  less than $5400 per year?</p><p class="depth0">A. No.</p><p class="depth0">g-23. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section  3405 apply before July 1, 1983, with respect to payments to nonresident  alien individuals?</p><p class="depth0">A. No.</p><p class="depth0">g-24. Q. Does a payor or plan administrator who requested a delay  prior to the publication of these procedures in the Federal Register  need to resubmit the request in light of these procedures?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In order to be entitled to a delay, payors and plan  adminstrators must follow the procedures required by these temporary  regulations.</p><p class="depth0">g-25. Q. Will the notice and withholding requirements of section  3405 apply before January 1, 1984, with respect to the exchange or  complete or partial surrender of a commercial annuity under which the  recipient had not irrevocably chosen, prior to January 1, 1984, to  receive payments in the form of an annuity?</p><p class="depth0">A. In the case of the exchange or complete or partial surrender of a  commercial annuity under which the recipient had not irrevocably chosen,  prior to January 1, 1984, to receive payments in the form of an annuity,  the application of the notice and withholding provisions of this section  may be delayed, so long as undue hardship exists, up to January 1, 1984.  Prior approval from the Internal Revenue Service is not required for  such delay, and should not be requested. For purposes of this delay,  undue hardship will be presumed to exist, in the absence of bad faith,  so long as the payor can establish that at least one of the conditions  in question g-6 is present. The payor should prepare and retain a  statement of undue hardship as described in question g-9 and should  maintain any documents necessary to support the representations made in  that statement.
