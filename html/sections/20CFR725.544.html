                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General effect of 31 U.S.C. 3711. In accordance with 31 U.S.C. 3711 and applicable regulations, claims by the Office against an individual for recovery of an overpayment under this part not exceeding the sum of $100,000, exclusive of interest, may be compromised, or collection suspended or terminated, where such individual or his or her estate does not have the present or prospective ability to pay the full amount of the claim within a reasonable time (see paragraph (c) of this section), or the cost of collection is likely to exceed the amount of recovery (see paragraph (d) of this section), except as provided under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When there will be no compromise, suspension, or termination of collection of a claim for overpayment. (1) In any case where the overpaid individual is alive, a claim for overpayment will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Office, if there is an indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of such individual or on the part of any other party having any interest in the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any case where the overpaid individual is alive, a claim for overpayment will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Office, if there is an indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of such individual or on the part of any other party having any interest in the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In any case where the overpaid individual is deceased:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A claim for overpayment in excess of $ 5,000 will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Office if there is an indication of fraud, the filing of a false claim, or misrepresentation on the part of such deceased individual; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A claim for overpayment, regardless of the amount, will not be compromised, nor will there be suspension or termination of collection of the claim by the Office if there is an indication that any person other than the deceased overpaid individual had a part

in the fraudulent action which resulted in the overpayment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inability to pay claim for recovery of overpayment. In determining whether the overpaid individual is unable to pay a claim for recovery of an overpayment under this part, the Office shall consider the individual's age, health, present and potential income (including inheritance prospects), assets (e.g., real property, savings account), possible concealment or improper transfer of assets, and assets or income of such individual which may be available in enforced collection proceedings. The Office will also consider exemptions available to such individual under the pertinent State or Federal law in such proceedings. In the event the overpaid individual is deceased, the Office shall consider the available assets of the estate, taking into account any liens or superior claims against the estate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cost of collection or litigative probabilities. Where the probable costs of recovering an overpayment under this part would not justify enforced collection proceedings for the full amount of the claim, or where there is doubt concerning the Office's ability to establish its claim as well as the time which it will take to effect such collection, a compromise or settlement for less than the full amount may be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Amount of compromise. The amount to be accepted in compromise of a claim for overpayment under this part shall bear a reasonable relationship to the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection proceedings, giving due consideration to the exemption available to the overpaid individual under State or Federal law and the time which collection will take.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment. Payment of the amount the Office has agreed to accept as a compromise in full settlement of a claim for recovery of an overpayment under this part shall be made within the time and in the manner set by the Office. A claim for the overpayment shall not be considered compromised or settled until the full payment of the compromised amount has been made within the time and manner set by the Office. Failure of the overpaid individual or his or her estate to make such payment as provided shall result in reinstatement of the full amount of the overpayment less any amounts paid prior to such default.</p>
