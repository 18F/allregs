                            <p class="depth0">EAS plans contain guidelines which must be followed by EAS  Participants' personnel, emergency officials, and National Weather  Service (NWS) personnel to activate the EAS. The plans include the EAS  header codes and messages that will be transmitted by key EAS sources  (NP, LP, SP and SR). State and local plans contain unique methods of EAS  message distribution such as the use of the Radio Broadcast Data System  (RBDS). The plans must be reviewed and approved by the Chief, Public  Safety and Homeland Security Bureau, prior to implementation to ensure  that they are consistent with national plans, FCC regulations, and EAS  operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(3)(iv)</em>, EAS  Participants shall provide the identifying information required by the  EAS Test Reporting System (ETRS) no later than sixty days after the  publication in the Federal Register of a notice announcing the approval  by the Office of Management and Budget of the modified information  collection requirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and an  effective date of the rule amendment, or within sixty days of the launch  of the ETRS, whichever is later,   and shall renew this identifying information on a yearly basis or as  required by any revision of the EAS Participant's State EAS Plan filed  pursuant to this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Local Area plan contains procedures for local officials or  the NWS to transmit emergency information to the public during a local  emergency using the EAS. Local plans may be a part of the State plan. A  Local Area is a geographical area of contiguous communities or counties  that may include more than one state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FCC Mapbook is based on the consolidation of the data table  required in each State EAS plan with the identifying data contained in  the ETRS. The Mapbook organizes all EAS Participants according to their  State, EAS Local Area, and EAS designation.
