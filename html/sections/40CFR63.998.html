The owner or operator may develop a written procedure that identifies the conditions that justify a delay of repair. In such cases, reasons for delay of repair may be documented by citing the relevant sections of the written procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Copies of the Periodic Reports as specified in Sec.  63.999(c), if records are not maintained on a computerized database capable of generating summary reports from the records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For each instrumental or visual inspection conducted in accordance with Sec.  63.983(b)(1) for closed vent systems collecting regulated material from a regulated source during which no leaks are detected, the owner or operator shall record that the inspection was performed, the date of the inspection, and a statement that no leaks were detected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Storage vessel and transfer rack records. An owner or operator shall keep readily accessible records of the information specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A record of the measured values of the parameters monitored in accordance with Sec.  63.985(c) or Sec.  63.987(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A record of the planned routine maintenance performed on the control system during which the control system does not meet the applicable specifications of Sec.  63.983(a), Sec.  63.985(a), or Sec.  63.987(a), as applicable, due to the planned routine maintenance. Such a record shall include the information specified in paragraphs (d)(2)(ii)(A) through (C) of this section.

For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing control device emissions to a backup control device (e.g., the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a ``checklist,'' or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Equipment leak records. The owner or operator shall maintain records of the information specified in paragraphs (d)(4)(i) and (ii) of this section for closed vent systems and control devices if specified by the equipment leak provisions in a referencing subpart.
