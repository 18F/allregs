                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, the official  worksite is the location of an employee's position of record where the  employee regularly performs his or her duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the employee's work involves recurring travel or the  employee's work location varies on a recurring basis, the official  worksite is the location where the work activities of the employee's  position of record are based, as determined by the employing agency,  subject to the requirement that the official worksite must be in a  locality pay area in which the employee regularly performs work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agency must document an employee's official worksite on an  employee's Notification of Personnel Action (Standard Form 50 or  equivalent).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For an employee who is relocated and authorized to receive  relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. chapter 57, subchapter II (or similar  authority), the official worksite is the established worksite for the  position in the area to which the employee has been relocated. For an  employee authorized to receive relocation expenses under 5 U.S.C. 5737  in connection with an extended assignment resulting in a temporary  change of station, the worksite associated with the extended assignment  is the official worksite. (See 41 CFR 302-1.1.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For an employee whose assignment to a new worksite is followed  within 3 workdays by a reduction in force resulting in the employee's  separation before he or she is required to report for duty at the new  location, the official worksite in effect immediately before the  assignment remains the official worksite through the date of separation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For an employee covered by a telework agreement, the following  rules apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the employee is scheduled to work at least twice each  biweekly pay period on a regular and recurring basis at the regular  worksite for the employee's position of record, the regular worksite  (where the employee's work activities are based) is the employee's  official worksite. However, in the case of such an employee whose work  location varies on a recurring basis, the employee need not work at  least twice each biweekly pay period at the regular official worksite  (where the employee's work activities are based) as long as the employee  is regularly performing work within the locality pay area for that  worksite.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An authorized agency official may make an exception to the  twice-in-a-pay-period standard in paragraph (d)(1) of this section in  appropriate situations of a temporary nature, such as the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An employee is recovering from an injury or medical condition;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An employee is affected by an emergency situation, which  temporarily prevents the employee from commuting to his or her regular  official worksite;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An employee has an extended approved absence from work (e.g.,  paid leave);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An employee is in temporary duty travel status away from the  official worksite; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An employee is temporarily detailed to work at a location other  than a location covered by a telework agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an employee covered by a telework agreement does not meet the  requirements of paragraphs (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section, the  employee's official worksite is the location of the employee's telework  site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An agency must determine a telework employee's official worksite  on a case-by-case basis. A determination made under this paragraph (d)  is within the sole and exclusive discretion of the authorized agency  official, subject only to OPM review and oversight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In applying paragraph (d) of this section for the purpose of  other location-based pay entitlements under other regulations that refer  to this section, the reference to a locality pay area is deemed to be a  reference to the applicable geographic area associated with the given  pay entitlement. For example, for the purpose of special rates under 5  CFR part 530, subpart C, the reference to a locality pay area is deemed  to be a reference to the geographic area covered by a special rate  schedule.
