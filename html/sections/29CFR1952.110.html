                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan identifies the Utah State Industrial Commission as the  State agency designated to administer the plan throughout the State. It  defines the covered occupational safety and health issues as defined by  the Secretary of Labor in 29 CFR 1902.2(c)(1). The plan states that the  Utah Industrial Commission currently is exercising statewide inspection  authority to enforce many State standards. It describes procedures for  the development and promulgation of additional safety standards, rule  making power for enforcement of standards, laws, and orders in all  places of employment in the State; the procedures for prompt restraint  or elimination of imminent danger conditions; and procedures for  inspection in response to complaints. The plan includes proposed draft  legislation to be considered by the Utah Legislature during its 1973  session amending title 35, chapter 1 of the Utah State Code and related  provisions, to bring them into conformity with the requirements of part  1902. Under this legislation all occupational safety and health  standards and amendments thereto which have been promulgated by the  Secretary of Labor, except those found in 29 CFR 1910.13, 1910.14,  1910.15, and 1910.16 (ship repairing, shipbuilding, shipbreaking, and  longshoring) will, after public hearing by the Utah agency be adopted  and enforced by that agency. The plan sets forth a timetable for the  proposed adoption of standards. The legislation will give the Utah  Industrial Commission full authority to administer and enforce all laws,  rules, and orders protecting employee safety and health in all places of  employment in the State. It also proposes to bring the plan into  conformity in procedures for providing prompt and effective standards  for the protection of employees against new and unforeseen hazards and  for furnishing information to employees on hazards, precautions,  symptoms, and emergency treatment; and procedures for variances and the  protection of employees from hazards. The proposed legislation will  ensure employer and employee representatives an opportunity to accompany  inspectors and call attention to possible violations before, during, and  after inspections; protection of employees against discharge or  discrimination in terms and conditions of employment; notice to  employees of their protections and obligations; adequate safeguards to  protect trade secrets; prompt notice to employers and employees of  alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements; effective  sanctions against employers; and employer's right to review alleged  violations, abatement periods, and proposed penalties with opportunity  for employee participation in the review proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Included in the plan is a statement of the Governor's support  for the proposed legislation and a statement of legal opinion that it  will meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of  1970, and is consistent with the Constitution and laws of Utah. The plan  sets out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full  conformity with part 1902 of this chapter upon enactment of the proposed  legislation by the State legislature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan includes the following documents as of the date of  approval:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plan with appendixes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A letter from Carlyle F. Gronning, Chairman of the Utah  Industrial Commission to the Office of State Programs with an attached  memo sheet of clarifications dated October 27, 1972.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A letter from Carlyle F. Gronning to the Office of State  Programs dated December 3, 1972, clarifying issues raised in the plan  review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A letter from Carlyle F. Gronning to the Office of Federal and  State Operations dated December 11, 1972, clarifying the remaining  issues raised in the review process.  [38 FR 1179, Jan. 10, 1973, as amended at 50 FR 28780, July 16, 1985]</p>
