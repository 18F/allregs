                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All parties to a petition may be represented in any matter  relating to the petition. The parties shall designate their  representatives, if any, in the petition or responsive pleading. Any  subsequent changes in representation shall also be in writing, and  submitted to the administrative judge and served upon the other parties.  Once a party has designated a representative, all documents required by  the Board's regulations to be served upon the party shall instead be  served upon the representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A party may choose any representative so long as the person is  willing and available to serve. However, the other party or parties may  challenge the representative on the grounds of conflict of interest or  conflict of position. This challenge must be made by motion to the  administrative judge within 10 days of service of the notice of  designation, and shall be ruled upon by the administrative judge prior  to any further proceeding in the case. These procedures apply equally to  original and subsequent designations of representatives. In the event  the selected representative is disqualified, the party affected shall be  given a reasonable time to obtain another representative.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The administrative judge, on his or her own motion, may  disqualify a party's representative on the grounds described in  paragraph (b) of this section.
