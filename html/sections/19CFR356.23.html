                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scheduling of hearing. The administrative law judge will  schedule the hearing at a reasonable time, date, and place, which will  be in Washington, DC, unless the administrative law judge determines  otherwise based upon good cause shown, that another location would  better serve the interests of justice. In setting the date, the  administrative law judge will give due regard to the need for the  parties adequately to prepare for the hearing and the importance of  expeditiously resolving the matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Joinder or consolidation. The administrative law judge may order  joinder or consolidation if sanctions are proposed against more than one  party or if violations of more than one protective order or disclosure  undertaking are alleged if to do so would expedite processing of the  cases and not adversely affect the interests of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hearing procedures. Hearings will be conducted in a fair and  impartial manner by the administrative law judge, who may limit  attendance at any hearing or portion thereof if necessary or advisable  in order to protect proprietary information from improper disclosure.  The rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law shall not apply, and  all evidentiary material the administrative law judge determines to be  relevant and material to the proceeding and not unduly repetitious may  be received into evidence and given appropriate weight. The  administrative law judge may make such orders and determinations  regarding the admissibility of evidence, conduct of examination and  cross-examination, and similar matters as are necessary or appropriate  to ensure orderliness in the proceedings. The administrative law judge  will ensure that a record of the hearing will be taken by reporter or by  electronic recording, and will order such part of the record to be  sealed as is necessary to protect proprietary information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rights of parties. At a hearing each party shall have the right  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Introduce and examine witnesses and submit physical evidence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Present oral argument; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Receive a transcript or recording of the proceedings, upon  request, subject to the administrative law judge's orders regarding  sealing the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Representation. Each charged or affected party has a right to  represent himself or herself or to retain private counsel for that  purpose. The Chief Counsel will represent the Department, unless the  General Counsel of the Department determines otherwise. The  administrative law judge may disallow   a representative if such representation constitutes a conflict of  interest or is otherwise not in the interests of justice and may debar a  representative for contumacious conduct relating to the proceedings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ex parte communications. The parties and their representatives  may not make any ex parte communications to the administrative law judge  concerning the merits of the allegations or any matters at issue, except  as provided in Sec. 356.18(j) regarding emergency interim sanctions.</p>
