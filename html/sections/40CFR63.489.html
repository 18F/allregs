                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. Each owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream that uses a control device to comply with the requirements in Sec. 63.487(a)(2) or Sec. 63.487(b)(2) shall install the monitoring equipment specified in paragraph (b) of this section. All monitoring equipment shall be installed, calibrated, maintained, and operated according to the manufacturer's specifications or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This monitoring equipment shall be in operation at all times when batch emission episodes, or portions thereof, that the owner or operator has selected to control are vented to the control device, or at all times when an aggregate batch vent stream is vented to the control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, the owner or operator shall operate control devices such that the daily average of monitored parameters, established as specified in paragraph (e) of this section, remains above

the minimum level or below the maximum level, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Batch front-end process vent and aggregate batch vent stream monitoring equipment. The monitoring equipment specified in paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(8) of this section shall be installed as specified in paragraph (a) of this section. The parameters to be monitored are specified in Table 6 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where an incinerator is used, a temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where an incinerator other than a catalytic incinerator is used, the temperature monitoring device shall be installed in the firebox or in the ductwork immediately downstream of the firebox in a position before any substantial heat exchange occurs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where a catalytic incinerator is used, temperature monitoring devices shall be installed in the gas stream immediately before and after the catalyst bed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a flare is used, a device (including, but not limited to, a thermocouple, ultra-violet beam sensor, or infrared sensor) capable of continuously detecting the presence of a pilot flame is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where a boiler or process heater of less than 44 megawatts design heat input capacity is used, a temperature monitoring device in the firebox equipped with a continuous recorder is required. Any boiler or process heater in which all batch front-end process vents or aggregate batch vent streams are introduced with the primary fuel or are used as the primary fuel is exempt from this requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where a scrubber is used with an incinerator, boiler, or process heater in concert with the combustion of halogenated batch front-end process vents or halogenated aggregate batch vent streams, the following monitoring equipment is required for the scrubber:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A pH monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder to monitor the pH of the scrubber effluent; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A flow measurement device equipped with a continuous recorder shall be located at the scrubber influent for liquid flow. Gas stream flow shall be determined using one of the procedures specified in paragraphs (b)(4)(ii)(A) through (b)(4)(ii)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator may determine gas stream flow using the design blower capacity, with appropriate adjustments for pressure drop.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the scrubber is subject to regulations in 40 CFR parts 264 through 266 that have required a determination of the liquid to gas (L/G) ratio prior to the applicable compliance date for this subpart, the owner or operator may determine gas stream flow by the method that had been utilized to comply with those regulations. A determination that was conducted prior to the compliance date for this subpart may be utilized to comply with this subpart if it is still representative.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The owner or operator may prepare and implement a gas stream flow determination plan that documents an appropriate method which will be used to determine the gas stream flow. The plan shall require determination of gas stream flow by a method which will at least provide a value for either a representative or the highest gas stream flow anticipated in the scrubber during representative operating conditions. The plan shall include a description of the methodology to be followed and an explanation of how the selected methodology will reliably determine the gas stream flow, and a description of the records that will be maintained to document the determination of gas stream flow. The owner or operator shall maintain the plan as specified in Sec. 63.506(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Where an absorber is used, a scrubbing liquid temperature monitoring device and a specific gravity monitoring device are required, each equipped with a continuous recorder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where a condenser is used, a condenser exit temperature (product side) monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where a carbon adsorber is used, an integrating regeneration steam flow, nitrogen flow, or pressure monitoring device having an accuracy of [10 percent of the flow rate, level, or pressure, or better, capable of recording the total regeneration steam flow or nitrogen flow, or pressure (gauge or absolute) for each regeneration cycle; and a

carbon bed temperature monitoring device, capable of recording the carbon bed temperature after each regeneration and within 15 minutes of completing any cooling cycle are required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> As an alternate to paragraphs (b)(5) through (b)(7) of this section, the owner or operator may install an organic monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternative monitoring parameters. An owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream may request approval to monitor parameters other than those required by paragraph (b) of this section. The request shall be submitted according to the procedures specified in Sec. 63.492(e) and Sec. 63.506(f). Approval shall be requested if the owner or operator:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Uses a control device other than those included in paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Uses one of the control devices included in paragraph (b) of this section, but seeks to monitor a parameter other than those specified in Table 6 of this subpart and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Monitoring of bypass lines. The owner or operator of a batch front-end process vent or aggregate batch vent stream using a vent system that contains bypass lines that could divert emissions away from a control device used to comply with Sec. 63.487(a) or Sec. 63.487(b) shall comply with either paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this section. Equipment such as low leg drains, high point bleeds, analyzer vents, open-ended valves or lines, and pressure relief valves needed for safety purposes are not subject to this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Properly install, maintain, and operate a flow indicator that takes a reading at least once every 15 minutes. Records shall be generated as specified in Sec. 63.491(e)(3). The flow indicator shall be installed at the entrance to any bypass line that could divert emissions away from the control device and to the atmosphere; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Secure the bypass line damper or valve in the non-diverting position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the damper or valve is maintained in the non-diverting position and emissions are not diverted through the bypass line. Records shall be generated as specified in Sec. 63.491(e)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. Parameter monitoring levels for batch front-end process vents and aggregate batch vent streams shall be established as specified in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each parameter monitored under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or operator shall establish a level, defined as either a maximum or minimum operating parameter as denoted in Table 7 of this subpart, that indicates proper operation of the control device. The level shall be established in accordance with the procedures specified in Sec. 63.505. The level may be based upon a prior performance test conducted for determining compliance with a regulation promulgated by the EPA, and the owner or operator is not required to conduct a performance test under Sec. 63.490, provided that the prior performance test meets the conditions of Sec. 63.490(b)(3).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For batch front-end process vents using a control device to comply with Sec. 63.487(a)(2), the established level shall reflect the control efficiency established as part of the initial compliance demonstration specified in Sec. 63.490(c)(2).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For aggregate batch vent streams using a control device to comply with Sec. 63.487(b)(2), the established level shall reflect the emission reduction requirement of either 90 percent or 20 ppmv specified in Sec. 63.487(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The established level, along with supporting documentation, shall be submitted in the Notification of Compliance Status or the operating permit application as required in Sec. 63.506(e)(5) or Sec. 63.506(e)(8), respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The operating day shall be defined as part of establishing the parameter monitoring level and shall be submitted with the information in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. The definition of operating day shall specify the

time(s) at which an operating day begins and ends. The operating day shall not exceed 24 hours.
