An alien classified pursuant to section  101(a)(15)(S) of the Act who applies for withholding of removal shall  have 10 days from the date the Warrant of Removal is served upon the  alien to file an application for such relief with the   district director initiating the removal order. The procedures contained  in Sec. Sec. 208.2 and 208.16 of this chapter shall apply to such an  alien who applies for withholding of removal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inadmissibility.

The district director having jurisdiction over the port-of- entry shall follow the notification procedures specified in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section.
