In addition to the factors listed in Sec. 304.104(b), the agency may consider factors such as job performance, contributions to agency mission, and the general pay increases granted to other Federal employees. Experts and consultants are not entitled to receive automatic adjustments in their rates of basic pay at the time of general pay increases under 5 U.S.C. 5303 unless specifically provided for in the official appointing document. In the absence of such automatic entitlement, any pay adjustments are at the agency's discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Experts and consultants paid on a daily rate basis are not entitled to overtime pay under section 5542 of title 5, United States Code.
