                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>, except those awarded under the commercial item  procedures of FAR Part 12, where the primary deliverable(s) is (are)  hardware with a total value (including options) greater than $25  million. Any exception to this requirement shall be approved in writing  by the head of the contracting activity. Performance incentives may be  included in supply and service contracts valued under $25 million,  acquired under procedures other than Part 12, at the discretion of the  contracting officer upon consideration of the guidelines in 1816.402.  Performance incentives, which are objective and measure performance  after delivery and acceptance, are separate from other incentives, such  as cost or delivery incentives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a performance incentive is used, it shall be structured to  be both positive and negative based on performance after acceptance,  unless the contract type requires complete contractor liability for  product performance (e.g., fixed price). In this latter case, a negative  incentive is not required. In structuring the incentives, the contract  shall establish a standard level of performance based on the salient  performance requirement. This standard performance level is normally the  contract's target level of performance. No performance incentive amount  is earned at this standard performance level. Discrete units of  measurement based on the same performance parameter shall be identified  for performance above and, when a negative incentive is used, below the  standard. Specific incentive amounts shall be associated with each  performance level from maximum beneficial performance (maximum positive  incentive) to, when a negative incentive is included, minimal beneficial  performance or total failure (maximum negative incentive). The  relationship between any given incentive, either positive or negative,  and its associated unit of measurement should reflect the value to the  Government of that level of performance. The contractor should not be  rewarded for above-standard performance levels that are of no benefit to  the Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final calculation of the performance incentive shall be done  when performance, as defined in the contract, ceases or when the maximum  positive incentive is reached. When performance ceases below the  standard established in the contract and a negative incentive is  included, the Government shall calculate the amount due and the  contractor shall pay the Government that amount. Once performance  exceeds the standard, the contractor may request payment of the  incentive amount associated with a given level of performance, provided  that such payments shall not be more frequent than monthly. When  performance ceases above the standard level of performance, or when the  maximum positive incentive is reached, the Government shall calculate  the final performance incentive earned and unpaid and promptly remit it  to the contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When the deliverable supply or service lends itself to multiple,  meaningful measures of performance, multiple performance incentives may  be established. When the contract requires the sequential delivery of  several items (e.g., multiple spacecraft), separate performance  incentive structures may be established to parallel the sequential  delivery and use of the deliverables.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In determining the value of the maximum performance incentives  available, the contracting officer shall follow the following rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a CPFF contract, the sum of the maximum positive performance  incentive and fixed fee shall not exceed the limitations in FAR 15.404- 4(c)(4)(i).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an award fee contract.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The individual values of the maximum positive performance  incentive and the total potential award fee (including any base fee)  shall each be at least one-third of the total potential contract fee.  The remaining one-third of the total potential contract fee may be  divided between award fee and the maximum performance incentive at the  discretion of the contracting officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum negative performance incentive for research and  development hardware (e.g., the first and second units) shall be equal  in amount to the total earned award fee (including any base fee). The  maximum negative   performance incentives for production hardware (e.g., the third and all  subsequent units of any hardware items) shall be equal in amount to the  total potential award fee (including any base fee). Where one contract  contains both cases described above, any base fee shall be allocated  reasonably among the items.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For cost reimbursement contracts other than award fee contracts,  the maximum negative performance incentives shall not exceed the total  earned fee under the contract.
