                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)(vii)</em> of Regulation D, a depository  institution's liability under informal arrangements as well as those  formally embodied in a document are within the coverage of Regulation D.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exemption in Sec. 204.2(a)(1)(vii)(A) applies to  obligations owed by a depository institution to a domestic office of any  entity listed in that section (the exempt institutions). The exempt  institutions explicitly include another depository institution, foreign  bank, Edge or agreement corporation, New York Investment (article XII)  Company, the Export-Import Bank of the United States, Minbanc Capital  Corp., and certain other credit sources. The term exempt institutions  also includes subsidiaries of depository institutions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That engage in businesses in which their parents are authorized  to engage; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The stock of which by statute is explicitly eligible for  purchase by national banks.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To assure that this exemption for liabilities to exempt  institutions is not used as a means by which nondepository institutions  may arrange through an exempt institution to sell Federal funds to a  depository institution, obligations within the exemption must be issued  to an exempt institution for its own account. In view of this  requirement, a depository institution that purchases Federal funds  should ascertain the character (not necessarily the identity) of the  actual seller in order to justify classification of its liability on the  transaction as Federal funds purchased rather than as a deposit. Any  exempt institution that has given general assurance to the purchasing  depository institution that sales by it of Federal funds ordinarily will  be for its own account and thereafter executes such transactions for the  account of others, should disclose the nature of the actual lender with  respect to each such transaction. If it fails to do so, the depository  institution would be deemed by the Board as indirectly violating section  19 of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation D.  [52 FR 47695, Dec. 16, 1987]</p>
