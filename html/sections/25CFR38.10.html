School boards may not direct, control, or interrupt the day-to-day activities of BIA employees carrying out Bureau-operated education programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee handbook. Employee handbook and recruiting guides shall be developed by each local school or agency to provide specific information regarding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The working and hiring conditions for various tribal jurisdictions and Bureau locations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The need for all education personnel to adapt to local situations; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirement of all education personnel to comply with and support duly adopted school board policies, including those relating to tribal culture or language.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contract renewal notification. Employees will be notified 60 calendar days before the end of the school term of the intent to renew or not renew their contract.

This agreement must be received within 14 calendar days of the date of the notice in order to complete the contract renewal. If this agreement is not received by the fourteenth day, the employee has voluntarily forfeited his or her right to continuing employment.
