                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for certifications of historic significance should be  made by the owner to determine--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That a property located within a registered historic district is  of historic significance to such district; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That a property located within a registered historic district is  not of historic significance to such district; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> That a property not yet on the National Register appears to meet  National Register criteria; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> That a property located within a potential historic district  appears to contribute to the significance of such district.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To determine whether or not a property is individually listed or  is part of a district in the National Register, the owner may consult  the listing of National Register properties in the Federal Register  (found in most large libraries), or contact the appropriate SHPO for  current information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a property is located within the boundaries of a registered  historic district and the owner wishes the Secretary to certify whether  the property contributes or does not contribute to the historic  significance of the district or if the owner is requesting a preliminary  determination of significance in accordance with Sec. 67.3(a)(4), the  owner must complete part 1 of the Historic Preservation Certification  Application according to instructions accompanying the application. Such  documentation includes but is not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name and mailing address of owner;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name and address of property;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name of historic district;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Current photographs of property; photographs of the building and  its site and landscape features prior to alteration if rehabilitation  has been completed; photograph(s) showing the property along with  adjacent properties and structures on the street; and photographs of  interior features and spaces adequate to document significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Brief description of appearance including alterations,  distinctive features and spaces, and date(s) of construction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Brief statement of significance summarizing how the property  does or does not reflect the values that give the district its  distinctive historical and visual character, and explaining any  significance attached to the property itself (i.e., unusual building  techniques, important event that took place there, etc.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Sketch map clearly delineating property's location within the  district; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Signature of fee simple owner requesting or concurring in a  request for evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a property is individually listed in the National Register,  it is generally considered a certified historic structure and no further  certification is required. More specific considerations in this regard  are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the property is individually listed in the National Register  and the owner believes it has lost the characteristics which caused it  to be nominated and therefore wishes it delisted, the owner should refer  to the delisting procedures outlined in 36 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Some properties individually listed in the National Register  include more than one building. In such cases, the owner must submit a  single part 1 application, as described in paragraph (c) of this  section, which includes descriptions of all the buildings within the  listing. The Secretary will utilize the Standards for Evaluating  Significance within Registered Historic Districts (Sec. 67.5) for the  purpose of determining which of the buildings included within the  listing are of historic significance to the property. The requirements  of this paragraph are applicable to certification requests received by  the SHPOs (and the NPS WASO in the case of nonparticipating States only)   upon the effective date of these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Properties containing more than one building where the buildings  are judged by the Secretary to have been functionally related  historically to serve an overall purpose, such as a mill complex or a  residence and carriage house, will be treated as a single certified  historic structure, whether the property is individually listed in the  National Register or is located within a registered historic district,  when rehabilitated as part of an overall project. Buildings that are  functionally related historically are those which have functioned  together to serve an overall purpose during the property's period of  significance. In the case of a property within a registered historic  district which contains more than one building where the buildings are  judged to be functionally related historically, an evaluation will be  made to determine whether the component buildings contribute to the  historic significance of the property and whether the property  contributes to the significance of the historic district as in Sec.  67.4(i). For questions concerning demolition of separate structures as  part of an overall rehabilitation project, see Sec. 67.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applications for preliminary determinations for individual  listing must show how the property individually meets the National  Register Criteria for Evaluation. An application for a property located  in a potential historic district must document how the district meets  the criteria and how the property contributes to the significance of  that district. An application for a preliminary determination for a  property in a registered historic district which is outside the period  or area of significance in the district documentation on file with the  NPS must document and justify the expanded significance of the district  and how the property contributes to the significance of the district or  document the individual significance of the property. Applications must  contain substantially the same level of documentation as National  Register nominations, as specified in 36 CFR part 60 and National  Register Bulletin 16, ``Guidelines for Completing National Register of  Historic Places Forms'' (available from SHPOs and NPS WASO).  Applications must also include written assurance from the SHPO that the  district nomination is being revised to expand its significance or, for  certified districts, written assurance from the duly authorized  representative that the district documentation is being revised to  expand its significance, or that the SHPO is planning to nominate the  property or the district. Owners should understand that confirmation of  intent to nominate by a SHPO does not constitute listing in the National  Register, nor does it constitute a certification of significance as  required by law for Federal tax incentives. Owners should further  understand that they are proceeding at their own risk. If the property  or district is not listed in the National Register for procedural,  substantive or other reasons; if the district documentation is not  formally amended; or if the significance of the property has been lost  as a result of alterations or damage, these preliminary determinations  of significance will not become final. The SHPO must nominate the  property or the district or the SHPO for National Register districts and  the duly authorized representative in the case of certified districts  must submit documentation and have it approved by the NPS to amend the  National Register nomination or certified district or the property or  district must be listed before the preliminary certification of  significance can become final.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of the other rehabilitation tax credits under  section 47 of the Internal Revenue Code, properties within registered  historic districts are presumed to contribute to the significance of  such districts unless certified as nonsignificant by the Secretary.  Owners of non-historic properties within registered historic districts,  therefore, must obtain a certification of nonsignificance in order to  qualify for those investment tax credits. If an owner begins or  completes a substantial rehabilitation (as defined by the Internal  Revenue Service) of a property in a registered historic district without  knowledge of requirements for certification of nonsignificance, he or  she may request certification that the   property was not of historic significance to the district prior to  substantial rehabilitation in the same manner as stated in paragraph (c)  of this section. The owner should be aware, however, that the taxpayer  must certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that, at the beginning of  such substantial rehabilitation, he or she in good faith was not aware  of the certification requirement by the Secretary of the Interior.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Secretary discourages the moving of historic buildings from  their original sites. However, if a building is to be moved as part of a  rehabilitation for which certification is sought, the owner must follow  different procedures depending on whether the building is individually  listed in the National Register or is within a registered historic  district. When a building is moved, every effort should be made to re- establish its historic orientation, immediate setting, and general  environment. Moving a building may result in removal of the property  from the National Register or, for buildings within a registered  historic district, denial or revocation of a certification of  significance; consequently, a moved building may, in certain  circumstances, be ineligible for rehabilitation certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documentation must be submitted that demonstrates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effect of the move on the building's integrity and  appearance (any proposed demolition, proposed changes in foundations,  etc.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Photographs of the site and general environment of the proposed  site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Evidence that the proposed site does not possess historical  significance that would be adversely affected by the moved building;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The effect of the move on the distinctive historical and visual  character of the district, where applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The method to be used for moving the building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For buildings individually listed in the National Register, the  procedures contained in 36 CFR part 60 must be followed prior to the  move, or the building will be removed from the National Register, will  not be considered a certified historic structure, and will have to be  renominated for listing. The owner may submit a part 1 application in  order to receive a preliminary determination from the NPS of whether a  move will cause the property to be removed from the National Register.  However, preliminary approval of such a part 1 application does not  satisfy the requirements of 36 CFR part 60. The SHPO must follow the  remaining procedures in that regulation so that the NPS can determine  that the moved building will remain listed in the National Register and  retain its status as a certified historic structure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If an owner moves (or proposes to move) a building into a  registered historic district or moves (or proposes to move) a building  elsewhere within a registered historic district, a part 1 application  containing the required information described in paragraph (h)(1) of  this section must be submitted. The building to be moved will be  evaluated to determine if it contributes to the historic significance of  the district both before and after the move as in Sec. 67.4(i).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Properties within registered historic districts will be  evaluated to determine if they contribute to the historic significance  of the district by application of the Secretary's Standards for  Evaluating Significance within Registered Historic Districts as set  forth in Sec. 67.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Once the significance of a property located within a registered  historic district or a potential historic district has been determined  by the Secretary, written notification will be sent to the owner and the  SHPO in the form of a certification of significance or nonsignificance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Owners shall report to the Secretary through the SHPO any  substantial damage, alteration or changes to a property that occurs  after issuance of a certification of significance and prior to a final  certification of rehabilitation. The Secretary may withdraw a  certification of significance, upon thirty days notice to the owner, if  a property has been damaged, altered or changed effective as of the date  of the occurrence. The property may also be removed from the National  Register, in accordance with the procedures in 36 CFR part 60. A  revocation of certification of significance pursuant to this part may be  appealed under Sec. 67.10. For damage, alteration or changes caused   by unacceptable rehabilitation work, see Sec. 67.6(f).  [54 FR 6771, Feb. 26, 1990, as amended at 76 FR 30541, May 26, 2011]</p>
