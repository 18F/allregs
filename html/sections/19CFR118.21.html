The port director may immediately suspend, for a temporary period of time or until revocation and cancellation proceedings are concluded pursuant to Sec. 118.23, a CES operator's or entity's selection and the written agreement to operate the CES if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The selection and written agreement were obtained through fraud or the misstatement of a material fact; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CES operator or an officer of a corporation which is a CES operator or a person the port director determines is exercising substantial ownership or control over such operator or officer is indicted for, convicted of, or has committed acts, which would constitute a felony, or a misdemeanor involving theft or a theft-connected crime. In the absence of an indictment or conviction, the port director must have probable cause to believe the proscribed acts occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposed revocation and cancellation. The port director may propose to revoke the selection as operator and cancel the agreement to operate a CES if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The CES operator refuses or otherwise fails to follow any proper order of a Customs officer or any Customs order, rule, or regulation relative to the operation of a CES, or fails to operate in accordance with the terms of his agreement or to comply with any of the provisions of Sec. 118.4 of this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The CES operator fails to retain merchandise which has been designated for examination;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The CES operator does not provide secure facilities or properly safeguard merchandise within the CES;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The CES operator fails to furnish a current list of names, addresses and other information required by Sec. 118.4 of this part; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The custodial bond required by Sec. 118.4 of this part is determined to be insufficient in amount or lacking sufficient sureties, and a satisfactory new bond with good and sufficient sureties is not furnished within a reasonable time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The CES operator or an officer of a corporation which is a CES operator or a person the port director determines is exercising substantial ownership or control over such operator or officer is indicted for, convicted of, or has committed acts, which would constitute any of the offenses listed under paragraph (a) of this section. Where adverse action is initiated by the port director pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section and continued under this paragraph, the suspension of CES activities remains in effect through the appeal procedures provided under Sec. 118.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Circumstance of change in employment not a bar to adverse action. Any change in the employment status of a corporate officer (for example, discharge, resignation, demotion, or promotion) prior to indictment or conviction or after committing any acts which would constitute the culpable behavior described under paragraph (a) of this section, will not preclude application of this section, but may be taken into account by the port director in exercising discretion to take adverse action. If the person whose employment status changed remains in a substantial ownership, control, or beneficial relationship with the CES operator, this factor will also be considered

in exercising discretion under this section.
