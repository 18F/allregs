                                Sec. 75.446  Idle facilities and idle capacity.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As used in this section the following terms have the meanings  set forth in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities means land and buildings or any portion thereof,  equipment individually or collectively, or any other tangible capital  asset, wherever located, and whether owned or leased by the non-Federal  entity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Idle facilities means completely unused facilities that are  excess to the non-Federal entity's current needs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Idle capacity means the unused capacity of partially used  facilities. It is the difference between:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That which a facility could achieve under 100 percent operating  time on a one-shift basis less operating interruptions resulting from  time lost for repairs, setups, unsatisfactory materials, and other  normal delays and;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The extent to which the facility was actually used to meet  demands during the accounting period. A multi-shift basis should be used  if it can be shown that this amount of usage would normally be expected  for the type of facility involved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Cost of idle facilities or idle capacity means costs such as  maintenance, repair, housing, rent, and other related costs, e.g.,  insurance, interest, and depreciation. These costs could include the  costs of idle public safety emergency facilities, telecommunications, or  information technology system capacity that is built to withstand major  fluctuations in load, e.g., consolidated data centers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The costs of idle facilities are unallowable except to the  extent that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are necessary to meet workload requirements which may  fluctuate and are allocated appropriately to all benefiting programs; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Although not necessary to meet fluctuations in workload, they  were necessary when acquired and are now idle because of changes in  program requirements, efforts to achieve more economical operations,  reorganization, termination, or other causes which could not have been  reasonably foreseen. Under the exception stated in this subsection,  costs of idle facilities are allowable for a reasonable period of time,  ordinarily not to exceed one year, depending on the initiative taken to  use, lease, or dispose of such facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The costs of idle capacity are normal costs of doing business  and are a factor in the normal fluctuations of usage or indirect cost  rates from period to period. Such costs are allowable, provided that the  capacity is reasonably anticipated to be necessary to carry out the  purpose of the Federal award or was originally reasonable and is not  subject to reduction or elimination by use on other Federal awards,  subletting, renting, or sale, in accordance with sound business,  economic, or security practices. Widespread idle capacity throughout an  entire facility or among a group of assets having substantially the same  function may be considered idle facilities.</p>
