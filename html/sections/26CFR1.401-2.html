                                Sec. 1.401-2  Impossibility of diversion under the trust instrument.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under section 401(a)(2) a trust is not qualified  unless under the trust instrument it is impossible (in the taxable year  and at any time thereafter before the satisfaction of all liabilities to  employees or their beneficiaries covered by the trust) for any part of  the trust corpus or income to be used for, or diverted to, purposes  other than for the exclusive benefit of such employees or their  beneficiaries. This section does not apply to funds of the trust which  are allocated to provide medical benefits described in section 401(h) as  defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.401-14. For the rules prohibiting  diversion of such funds and the requirement of reversion to the employer  after satisfaction of all liabilities under the medical benefits  account, see paragraph (c) (4) and (5) of Sec. 1.401-14. For rules  permitting reversion to the employer of amounts held in a section 415  suspense acount, see Sec. 1.401(a)-2(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, the phrase ``if under the trust  instrument it is impossible'' means that the trust instrument must  definitely and affirmatively make it impossible for the nonexempt  diversion or use to occur, whether by operation or natural termination  of the trust, by power of revocation or amendment, by the happening of a  contingency, by collateral arrangement, or by any other means. Although  it is not essential that the employer relinquish all power to modify or  terminate the rights of certain employees covered by the trust, it must  be impossible for the trust funds to be used or diverted for purposes  other than for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their  beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As used in section 401(a)(2), the phrase ``purposes other than  for the exclusive benefit of his employees or their beneficiaries''  includes all objects or aims not solely designed for the proper  satisfaction of all liabilities to employees or their beneficiaries  covered by the trust.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Meaning of ``liabilities''. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The intent and purpose in  section 401(a)(2) of the phrase ``prior to the satisfaction of all  liabilities with respect to employees and their beneficiaries under the  trust'' is to permit the employer to reserve the right to recover at the  termination of the trust, and only at such termination, any balance  remaining in the trust which is due to erroneous actuarial computations  during the previous life of the trust. A balance due to   an ``erroneous actuarial computation'' is the surplus arising because  actual requirements differ from the expected requirements even though  the latter were based upon previous actuarial valuations of liabilities  or determinations of costs of providing pension benefits under the plan  and were made by a person competent to make such determinations in  accordance with reasonable assumptions as to mortality, interest, etc.,  and correct procedures relating to the method of funding. For example, a  trust has accumulated assets of $1,000,000 at the time of liquidation,  determined by acceptable actuarial procedures using reasonable  assumptions as to interest, mortality, etc., as being necessary to  provide the benefits in accordance with the provisions of the plan. Upon  such liquidation it is found that $950,000 will satisfy all of the  liabilities under the plan. The surplus of $50,000 arises, therefore,  because of the difference between the amounts actuarially determined and  the amounts actually required to satisfy the liabilities. This $50,000,  therefore, is the amount which may be returned to the employer as the  result of an erroneous actuarial computation. If, however, the surplus  of $50,000 had been accumulated as a result of a change in the benefit  provisions or in the eligibility requirements of the plan, the $50,000  could not revert to the employer because such surplus would not be the  result of an erroneous actuarial computation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> includes  both fixed and contingent obligations to employees. For example, if  1,000 employees are covered by a trust forming part of a pension plan,  300 of whom have satisfied all the requirements for a monthly pension,  while the remaining 700 employees have not yet completed the required  period of service, contingent obligations to such 700 employees have  nevertheless arisen which constitute ``liabilities'' within the meaning  of that term. It must be impossible for the employer (or other non  employee) to recover any amounts other than such amounts as remain in  the trust because of ``erroneous actuarial computations'' after the  satisfaction of all fixed and contingent obligations. Furthermore, the  trust instrument must contain a definite affirmative provision to this  effect, irrespective of whether the obligations to employees have their  source in the trust instrument itself, in the plan of which the trust  forms a part, or in some collateral instrument or arrangement forming a  part of such plan, and regardless of whether such obligations are,  technically speaking, liabilities of the employer, of the trust, or of  some other person forming a part of the plan or connected with it.
