Plants which have been previously inspected must be exported through a designated port (unless allowed by the United States Department of the Interior to be exported through a nondesignated port) in order to comply with section 9(f) of the Act [16 U.S.C. 1538(f)]. Plants which are inspected at the premises of origin must be available at the port of export for monitoring inspections and for other inspections deemed need for enforcement purposes, but, unless so inspected, will not need to be unpacked, inspected and repacked at the port.
