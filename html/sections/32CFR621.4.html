Loan agreements are mutually developed preceding the  actual lending of the equipment. Paragraph 1-16, AR 735-5, General  Principles, Policies and Basic Procedures, is used as the guide for  preparation of loan agreements.

Many Scouts and Leaders will travel in  groups and their itinerary will provide for visits to places of interest  in CONUS en route to and from Jamborees. Such group travel may begin in  June and extend into September and October of the Jamboree year. In  keeping with Department of the Army policies, commanders of Army  installations may extend an invitation to and honor requests from Scout  groups enroute to and from the Jamboree to visit and encamp at their  installation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Commissary and post privileges.

These privileges will be extended only to  Scout groups which are en route to or from the Jamboree and who are  encamped or quartered at the installation or the Jamboree site.  Commissary and post exchange privileges extended to Scout groups while  encamped at the Jamboree site for supply and food items will only be  honored upon-application by officials of the Boy Scouts of America to  supplement supplies and rations not considered adequate for American  Scouts or Scouters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Arrangements. Regional Scout Executives have been informed by  the National Headquarters of the contents of this subchapter and that  arrangements pursuant to this subchapter must be made in advance  directly with the installation commanders. However, commanders will  consider factors of extenuation or emergency which may preclude advance  arrangements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Hospitalization.
