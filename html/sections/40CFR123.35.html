                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must comply with the requirements for all NPDES permitting  authorities under Parts 122, 123, 124, and 125 of this chapter. (This  section is meant only to supplement those requirements and discuss  specific issues related to the small MS4 storm water program.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must develop a process, as well as criteria, to designate  small MS4s other than those described in Sec. 122.32(a)(1) of this  chapter, as regulated small MS4s to be covered under the NPDES storm  water discharge control program. This process must include the authority  to designate a small MS4 waived under paragraph (d) of this section if  circumstances change. EPA may make designations under this section if a  State or Tribe fails to comply with the requirements listed in this  paragraph. In making designations of small MS4s, you must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Develop criteria to evaluate whether a storm water discharge  results in or has the potential to result in exceedances of water  quality standards, including impairment of designated uses, or other  significant water quality impacts, including habitat and biological  impacts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Guidance: For determining other significant water quality  impacts, EPA recommends a balanced consideration of the following  designation criteria on a watershed or other local basis: discharge to  sensitive waters, high growth or growth potential, high population  density, contiguity to an urbanized area, significant contributor of  pollutants to waters of the United States, and ineffective protection of  water quality by other programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apply such criteria, at a minimum, to any small MS4 located  outside of an urbanized area serving a jurisdiction with a population  density of at least 1,000 people per square mile and a population of at  least 10,000;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Designate any small MS4 that meets your criteria by December 9,   2002. You may wait until December 8, 2004 to apply the designation  criteria on a watershed basis if you have developed a comprehensive  watershed plan. You may apply these criteria to make additional  designations at any time, as appropriate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Designate any small MS4 that contributes substantially to the  pollutant loadings of a physically interconnected municipal separate  storm sewer that is regulated by the NPDES storm water program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You must make a final determination within 180 days from receipt  of a petition under Sec. 122.26(f) of this chapter (or analogous State  or Tribal law). If you do not do so within that time period, EPA may  make a determination on the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must issue permits consistent with Sec. Sec. 122.32 through  122.35 of this chapter to all regulated small MS4s. You may waive or  phase in the requirements otherwise applicable to regulated small MS4s,  as defined in Sec. 122.32(a)(1) of this chapter, under the following  circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You may waive permit coverage for each small MS4s in  jurisdictions with a population under 1,000 within the urbanized area  where all of the following criteria have been met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Its discharges are not contributing substantially to the  pollutant loadings of a physically interconnected regulated MS4 (see  paragraph (b)(4) of this section); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the small MS4 discharges any pollutant(s) that have been  identified as a cause of impairment of any water body to which it  discharges, storm water controls are not needed based on wasteload  allocations that are part of an EPA approved or established ``total  maximum daily load'' (TMDL) that address the pollutant(s) of concern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may waive permit coverage for each small MS4 in  jurisdictions with a population under 10,000 where all of the following  criteria have been met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You have evaluated all waters of the U.S., including small  streams, tributaries, lakes, and ponds, that receive a discharge from  the MS4 eligible for such a waiver.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For all such waters, you have determined that storm water  controls are not needed based on wasteload allocations that are part of  an EPA approved or established TMDL that addresses the pollutant(s) of  concern or, if a TMDL has not been developed or approved, an equivalent  analysis that determines sources and allocations for the pollutant(s) of  concern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For the purpose of paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section, the  pollutant(s) of concern include biochemical oxygen demand (BOD),  sediment or a parameter that addresses sediment (such as total suspended  solids, turbidity or siltation), pathogens, oil and grease, and any  pollutant that has been identified as a cause of impairment of any water  body that will receive a discharge from the MS4.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You have determined that current and future discharges from the  MS4 do not have the potential to result in exceedances of water quality  standards, including impairment of designated uses, or other significant  water quality impacts, including habitat and biological impacts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Guidance: To help determine other significant water quality  impacts, EPA recommends a balanced consideration of the following  criteria on a watershed or other local basis: discharge to sensitive  waters, high growth or growth potential, high population or commercial  density, significant contributor of pollutants to waters of the United  States, and ineffective protection of water quality by other programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You may phase in permit coverage for small MS4s serving  jurisdictions with a population under 10,000 on a schedule consistent  with a State watershed permitting approach. Under this approach, you  must develop and implement a schedule to phase in permit coverage for  approximately 20 percent annually of all small MS4s that qualify for  such phased-in coverage. Under this option, all regulated small MS4s are  required to have coverage under an NPDES permit by no later than March  8, 2007. Your schedule for phasing in permit coverage for small MS4s  must be approved by the Regional Administrator no later than December  10, 2001.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you choose to phase in permit coverage for small MS4s in  jurisdictions with a population under 10,000, in   accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section, you may also provide  waivers in accordance with paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section  pursuant to your approved schedule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you do not have an approved schedule for phasing in permit  coverage, you must make a determination whether to issue an NPDES permit  or allow a waiver in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) or (d)(2) of this  section, for each eligible MS4 by December 9, 2002.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> You must periodically review any waivers granted in accordance  with paragraph (d)(2) of this section to determine whether any of the  information required for granting the waiver has changed. At a minimum,  you must conduct such a review once every five years. In addition, you  must consider any petition to review any waiver when the petitioner  provides evidence that the information required for granting the waiver  has substantially changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must specify a time period of up to 5 years from the date of  permit issuance for operators of regulated small MS4s to fully develop  and implement their storm water program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> You must include the requirements in Sec. Sec. 122.33 through  122.35 of this chapter in any permit issued for regulated small MS4s or  develop permit limits based on a permit application submitted by a  regulated small MS4. (You may include conditions in a regulated small  MS4 NPDES permit that direct the MS4 to follow an existing qualifying  local program's requirements, as a way of complying with some or all of  the requirements in Sec. 122.34(b) of this chapter. See Sec. 122.34(c)  of this chapter. Qualifying local, State or Tribal program requirements  must impose, at a minimum, the relevant requirements of Sec. 122.34(b)  of this chapter.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If you issue a general permit to authorize storm water  discharges from small MS4s, you must make available a menu of BMPs to  assist regulated small MS4s in the design and implementation of  municipal storm water management programs to implement the minimum  measures specified in Sec. 122.34(b) of this chapter. EPA plans to  develop a menu of BMPs that will apply in each State or Tribe that has  not developed its own menu. Regardless of whether a menu of BMPs has  been developed by EPA, EPA encourages State and Tribal permitting  authorities to develop a menu of BMPs that is appropriate for local  conditions. EPA also intends to provide guidance on developing BMPs and  measurable goals and modify, update, and supplement such guidance based  on the assessments of the NPDES MS4 storm water program and research to  be conducted over the next thirteen years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must incorporate any additional measures necessary to  ensure effective implementation of your State or Tribal storm water  program for regulated small MS4s.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Guidance: EPA recommends consideration of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You are encouraged to use a general permit for regulated small  MS4s;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that your State or Tribe administers a dedicated  funding source, you should play an active role in providing financial  assistance to operators of regulated small MS4s;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You should support local programs by providing technical and  programmatic assistance, conducting research projects, performing  watershed monitoring, and providing adequate legal authority at the  local level;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You are encouraged to coordinate and utilize the data collected  under several programs including water quality management programs, TMDL  programs, and water quality monitoring programs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Where appropriate, you may recognize existing responsibilities  among governmental entities for the control measures in an NPDES small  MS4 permit (see Sec. 122.35(b) of this chapter); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> You are encouraged to provide a brief (e.g., two page)  reporting format to facilitate compiling and analyzing data from  submitted reports under Sec. 122.34(g)(3) of this chapter. EPA intends  to develop a model form for this purpose.  [64 FR 68850, Dec. 8, 1999]</p>
