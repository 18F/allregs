Within 30 days of establishing or designating a U.S. intermediate holding company under this section, a foreign banking organization must provide to the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the U.S. intermediate holding company, including its name, location, corporate form, and organizational structure;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A certification that the U.S. intermediate holding company meets the requirements of this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any other information that the Board determines is appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Holdings and regulation of the U.S. intermediate holding company--(1) General.
