                                Sec. 190.233  Corrective action orders.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. Except as provided by paragraph (b) of this section,  if the Associate Administrator finds, after reasonable notice and  opportunity for hearing in accord with paragraph (c) of this section, a  particular pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to life, property,  or the environment, the Associate Administrator may issue an order  pursuant to this section requiring the operator of the facility to take  corrective action. Corrective action may include suspended or restricted  use of the facility, physical inspection, testing, repair, replacement,  or other appropriate action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Waiver of notice and expedited review. The Associate  Administrator may waive the requirement for notice and opportunity for  hearing under paragraph (a) of this section before issuing an order  whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the failure to do  so would result in the likelihood of serious harm to life, property, or  the environment. When an order is issued under this paragraph, a  respondent that contests the order may obtain expedited review of the  order either by answering in writing to the order within 10 days of  receipt or requesting a hearing under Sec. 190.211 to be held as soon as  practicable in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. For  purposes of this section, the term ``expedited review'' is defined as  the process for making a prompt determination of whether the order  should remain in effect or be amended or terminated. The expedited  review of an order issued under this paragraph will be complete upon  issuance of such determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice and hearing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Written notice that OPS intends to issue an order under this  section will be served upon the owner or operator of an alleged  hazardous facility in accordance with Sec. 190.5. The notice must allege  the existence of a hazardous facility and state the facts and  circumstances supporting the issuance of a corrective action order. The  notice must provide the owner or operator with an opportunity to respond  within 10 days of receipt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An owner or operator that elects to exercise its opportunity for  a hearing under this section must notify the Associate Administrator of  that election in writing within 10 days of receipt of the notice  provided under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, or the order under  paragraph (b) of this section when applicable. The absence of such  written notification waives an owner or operator's opportunity for a  hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At any time after issuance of a notice or order under this  section, the respondent may request a copy of the case file as set forth  in Sec. 190.209.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A hearing under this section is conducted pursuant to  Sec. 190.211. The hearing should be held within 15 days of receipt of  the respondent's request for a hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> After conclusion of a hearing under this section, the Presiding  Official submits a recommended decision to the Associate Administrator  as to whether or not the facility is or would be hazardous to life,  property, or the environment, and if necessary, requiring expeditious  corrective action. If a notice or order is contested in writing without  a hearing, an attorney from the Office of Chief Counsel prepares the  recommended decision. The recommended decision should be submitted to  the Associate Administrator within five business days after conclusion  of the hearing or after receipt of the respondent's written objection if  no hearing is held. Upon receipt of the recommendation, the Associate  Administrator will proceed in accordance with paragraphs (d) through (h)  of this section. If the Associate Administrator finds the facility is or  would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the Associate  Administrator issues a corrective action order in accordance with this  section, or confirms   (or amends) the corrective action order issued under paragraph (b) of  this section. If the Associate Administrator does not find the facility  is or would be hazardous to life, property, or the environment, the  Associate Administrator withdraws the notice or terminates the order  issued under paragraph (b) of this section, and promptly notifies the  operator in writing by service as prescribed in Sec. 190.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Associate Administrator may find a pipeline facility to be  hazardous under paragraph (a) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If under the facts and circumstances the Associate Administrator  determines the particular facility is hazardous to life, property, or  the environment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the pipeline facility or a component thereof has been  constructed or operated with any equipment, material, or technique which  the Associate Administrator determines is hazardous to life, property,  or the environment, unless the operator involved demonstrates to the  satisfaction of the Associate Administrator that, under the particular  facts and circumstances involved, such equipment, material, or technique  is not hazardous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In making a determination under paragraph (d) of this section,  the Associate Administrator shall consider, if relevant:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The characteristics of the pipe and other equipment used in the  pipeline facility involved, including its age, manufacturer, physical  properties (including its resistance to corrosion and deterioration),  and the method of its manufacture, construction or assembly;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature of the materials transported by such facility  (including their corrosive and deteriorative qualities), the sequence in  which such materials are transported, and the pressure required for such  transportation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The characteristics of the geographical areas in which the  pipeline facility is located, in particular the climatic and geologic  conditions (including soil characteristics) associated with such areas,  and the population density and population and growth patterns of such  areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any recommendation of the National Transportation Safety Board  issued in connection with any investigation conducted by the Board; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other factors as the Associate Administrator may consider  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A corrective action order shall contain the following  information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A finding that the pipeline facility is or would be hazardous to  life, property, or the environment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relevant facts which form the basis of that finding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The legal basis for the order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The nature and description of any particular corrective action  required of the respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The date by which the required corrective action must be taken  or completed and, where appropriate, the duration of the order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If the opportunity for a hearing was waived pursuant to  paragraph (b) of this section, a statement that an opportunity for a  hearing will be available at a particular time and location after  issuance of the order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Associate Administrator will terminate a corrective action  order whenever the Associate Administrator determines that the facility  is no longer hazardous to life, property, or the environment. If  appropriate, however, a notice of probable violation may be issued under  Sec. 190.207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> At any time after a corrective action order issued under this  section has become effective, the Associate Administrator may request  the Attorney General to bring an action for appropriate relief in  accordance with Sec. 190.235.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Upon petition by the Attorney General, the District Courts of  the United States shall have jurisdiction to enforce orders issued under  this section by appropriate means.  [70 FR 11138, Mar. 8, 2005, as amended by Amdt. 190-16, 78 FR 58912,  Sept. 25, 2013]</p>
