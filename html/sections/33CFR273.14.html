                            <p class="depth0">Investigation of new problems and/or additional control operations not covered by previously approved plans will begin with preparation of a preliminary report based on reconnaissance-type investigations. If it is determined that further planning of a more detailed nature is warranted, approval of a reconnaissance report by HQDA (DAEN-CWO-R) Washington, D.C. 20314 will be followed by further investigations. Normally, a detailed State design memorandum encompassing all aspects of the problem and a proposed plan of action for dealing with it will be prepared.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Reconnaissance reports. Investigations for reconnaissance reports will be limited to readily available data and information. Field surveys and office studies should be limited to minimum essentials for further detailed planning. The reconnaissance report will be used for the overall program planning and should contain adequate information for these purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorization. Preparation of a reconnaissance report will be authorized by OCE granting of work allocations and allotment of funds based on requests submitted by reporting officers. Funds for such reports may be requested in annual submissions of budget requests and subsequently to DAEN-CWO-R as required to meet unanticipated needs. Since the program is proceeding under a limited budget, costs should be limited to minimum requirements. Only in exceptional cases will more than $3,000 be made available for a reconnaissance report on a problem in any one district.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Content of reports. Where findings and conclusions are unfavorable to undertaking further detailed planning, a brief letter report summarizing the problem and findings should be submitted to OCE to provide a basis for answering outstanding inquiries. Where findings and conclusions are favorable, a more detailed report should include, but not be limited to, the information contained in Appendix B.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State design memorandum. When authorized to prepare a detailed planning report, the reporting officer will proceed with necessary investigations and develop plans and data in sufficient detail to assure a complete and fully operable aquatic plant control operation. The report will be in the form of a State design memorandum (SDM). The SDM will be prepared by the District, reviewed by the Division, then forwarded to DAEN-CWO-R for review and approval. The data presented will be used to set priorities and request funds to finance activities on various projects. Fund requirements are divided into four categories: applied research; planning; control operations; and development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Review of the proposed design Memoranda. Review of State design memoranda should insure that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The work involved is not the type normally provided by local entities or private interests as a local responsibility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The cost of control operation will be shared between the Federal Government (70 percent) and the State receiving the benefit (30 percent).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The actual control operation can be done by Federal, State, and/or private company facilities, under agreements specifying the details and standards of work to be performed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Consideration will be given in the planning procedure to include physical, chemical and biological methods of control. Priority will be given to biological systems where feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Environmental impact statement requirements. Prior to funding of a plant control project programs which involve pest control operations, such as aquatic plant control, and affect either man's health or his environment (soil, flora, fauna, aesthetics, water resources), are candidates for review and possible preparation of an environmental impact statement (EIS) under the National Environmental Policy Act. (The information outlined in Appendix C should be included in the analysis section of an EIS in addition to the treatment prescribed by 33 CFR 209.410.) \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ 33 CFR 209.410 was removed at 45 FR 56761, Aug. 25, 1980.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
