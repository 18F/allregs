The batch sequence  will be accepted or rejected based upon the number of rejected batches.  A sufficient number of consecutive batches will be inspected until the  cumulative number of rejected batches is less than or equal to the  sequence acceptance number or greater than or equal to the sequence  rejection number appropriate for the cumulative number of batches  inspected. The acceptance and rejection numbers listed in Appendix I,  Table III at the appropriate code letter obtained according to Sec.  204.57-2 will be used in determining whether the acceptance or rejection  of a batch sequence has occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Acceptance or rejection of a batch sequence takes places when  the decision is made on the last compressor required to make a decision  under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the batch sequence is accepted, the manufacturer will not be  required to perform any additional testing on   compressors from subsequent batches pursuant to the initiating test  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Administrator may terminate testing earlier than required in  paragraph (b) of this section based on a request by the manufacturer  accompanied by voluntary cessation of distribution in commerce, from all  plants, of compressors from the configuration in question: Provided,  That once production is reinitiated, the manufacturer must take the  action described in Sec. 204.57-9 (a)(1) and (a)(2) prior to  distribution in commerce of any compressors from any plant of the  compressor category or configuration in question.</p>
