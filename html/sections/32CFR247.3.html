                            <p class="depth0">Civilian Enterprise (CE) guides and installation maps. Authorized publications containing advertising that are prepared and published under contract with commercial publishers. The right to circulate the advertising in these publications to the DoD readership constitutes contractual consideration to pay for these DoD publications. The publications become the property of the command, installation, or intended recipient upon delivery in accordance with terms of the contract. Categories of these publications are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Guides. Publications that provide DoD personnel with information about the mission of their command; the availability of command, installation, or community services; local geography; historical background; and other information. These publications may include installation telephone directories at the discretion of the commander.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Installation maps.

letters to the editor; editorials; commentaries; features; sports; entertainment items; morale, welfare, and recreation news and announcements; photography; line art; and installation and local community news and announcements.

CE contractor personnel may provide material for use in the newspaper if approved by the commander or public affairs officer (PAO), as the commander's representative. These newspapers contain advertising sold by the commercial publisher on the same basis as for CE guides and installation maps and may contain supplements or inserts. They become the property of the command, installation, or intended recipient upon delivery in accordance with terms of the contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Funded newspapers. Newspapers published by the DoD Components or their subordinate commands using appropriated funds. The editorial content of these newspapers is prepared by the internal information section of the public affairs staff or other internal sources.

DoD Directive 5330.3 \3\ specifies DPS as the sole DoD conduit to the GPO.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\3\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 247.1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Overseas Combatant Command newspapers.

Authorized, unofficial publications, serving as part of the commander's internal information program. They are produced and distributed periodically, usually monthly, and contain information of interest to personnel of the publishing DoD component or organization. They usually reflect a continuing policy as to purpose, format, and content. They are normally non-directive in nature and are published to inform, motivate, and improve the performance of the personnel and organization. They may be published as funded magazines or under the CE concept.</p><p class="depth0">Option.
