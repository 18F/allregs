                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A State plan that offers exempt individuals as  defined in Sec.  440.315 the option to enroll in benchmark or benchmark- equivalent coverage must identify in its State plan the exempt groups  for which this coverage is available, and must comply with the following  provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In any case in which the State offers an exempt individual the  option to obtain coverage in a benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit  package,   the State must effectively inform the individual prior to enrollment  that the enrollment is voluntary and that the individual may disenroll  from the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent coverage at any time and  regain immediate access to standard full Medicaid coverage under the  State plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prior to any enrollment in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent  coverage, the State must inform the exempt individual of the benefits  available under the benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit package  and the costs under such a package and provide a comparison of how they  differ from the benefits and costs available under the standard full  Medicaid program. The State must also inform exempt individuals that  they may disenroll at any time and provide them with information about  the process for disenrolling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State must document in the exempt individual's eligibility  file that the individual was informed in accordance with this section  prior to enrollment, was given ample time to arrive at an informed  choice, and voluntarily and affirmatively chose to enroll in the  benchmark or benchmark-equivalent benefit package.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For individuals who the State determines have become exempt  individuals while enrolled in benchmark or benchmark-equivalent  coverage, the State must comply with the requirements in paragraphs  (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section above within 30 days after such  determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Disenrollment Process. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State must act upon requests  promptly for exempt individuals who choose to disenroll from benchmark  or benchmark-equivalent coverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State must have a process in place to ensure that exempt  individuals have access to all standard State plan services while  disenrollment requests are being processed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State must maintain data that tracks the total number of  beneficiaries that have voluntarily enrolled in a benchmark plan and the  total number of individuals that have disenrolled from the benchmark  plan.</p>
