                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Coal-fired units. The owner or operator shall meet the general  operating requirements in Sec. 75.10 for an SO2 continuous  emission monitoring system and a flow monitoring system for each  affected coal-fired unit while the unit is combusting coal and/or any  other fuel, except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, in  Sec. 75.16, and in subpart E of this part. During hours in which only  gaseous fuel is combusted in the unit, the owner or operator shall  comply with the applicable provisions of paragraph (e)(1), (e)(2), or  (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Moisture correction. Where SO2 concentration is  measured on a dry basis, the owner or operator shall either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report the appropriate fuel-specific default moisture value for  each unit operating hour, selected from among the following: 3.0%, for  anthracite coal; 6.0% for bituminous coal; 8.0% for sub-bituminous coal;  11.0% for lignite coal; 13.0% for wood and 14.0% for natural gas  (boilers, only); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Install, operate, maintain, and quality assure a continuous  moisture monitoring system for measuring and recording the moisture  content of the flue gases, in order to correct the measured hourly  volumetric flow rates for moisture when calculating SO2 mass  emissions (in lb/hr) using the procedures in appendix F to this part.  The following continuous moisture monitoring systems are acceptable: a  continuous moisture sensor; an oxygen analyzer (or analyzers) capable of  measuring O2 both on a wet basis and on a dry basis; or a  stack temperature sensor and a moisture look-up table, i.e., a  psychrometric chart (for saturated gas streams following wet scrubbers  or other demonstrably saturated gas streams, only). The moisture  monitoring system shall include as a component the automated data  acquisition and handling system (DAHS) for recording and reporting both  the raw data (e.g., hourly average wet-and dry-basis O2  values) and the hourly average values of the stack gas moisture content  derived from those data. When a moisture look-up table is used, the  moisture monitoring system shall be represented as a single component,  the certified DAHS, in the monitoring plan for the unit or common stack.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unit with no location for a flow monitor meeting siting  requirements.   Where no location exists that satisfies the minimum physical siting  criteria in appendix A to this part for installation of a flow monitor  in either the stack or the ducts serving an affected unit or  installation of a flow monitor in either the stack or ducts is  demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator to be technically  infeasible, either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The designated representative shall petition the Administrator  for an alternative method for monitoring volumetric flow in accordance  with Sec. 75.66; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall construct a new stack or modify  existing ductwork to accommodate the installation of a flow monitor, and  the designated representative shall petition the Administrator for an  extension of the required certification date given in Sec. 75.4 and  approval of an interim alternative flow monitoring methodology in  accordance with Sec. 75.66. The Administrator may grant existing Phase I  affected units an extension to January 1, 1995, and existing Phase II  affected units an extension to January 1, 1996 for the submission of the  certification application for the purpose of constructing a new stack or  making substantial modifications to ductwork for installation of a flow  monitor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator shall install a flow monitor in any  existing location in the stack or ducts serving the affected unit at  which the monitor can achieve the performance specifications of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Gas-fired and oil-fired units. The owner or operator of an  affected unit that qualifies as a gas-fired or oil-fired unit, as  defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter, based on information submitted by  the designated representative in the monitoring plan, shall measure and  record SO2 emissions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (e)(2),  or (e)(3) of this section during hours in which the unit combusts only  gaseous fuel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> By providing other information satisfactory to the Administrator  using the applicable procedures specified in appendix D to this part for  estimating hourly SO2 mass emissions; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> By using the low mass emissions excepted methodology in  Sec. 75.19(c) for estimating hourly SO2 mass emissions if the  affected unit qualifies as a low mass emissions unit under Sec. 75.19(a)  and (b). If this option is selected for SO2, the LME  methodology must also be used for NOX and CO2 when  these parameters are required to be monitored by applicable program(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(3)</em> of this section,  as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the gaseous fuel qualifies for a default SO2  emission rate under Section 2.3.1.1, 2.3.2.1.1, or 2.3.6(b) of appendix  D to this part, the owner or operator may determine SO2  emissions by using Equation F-23 in appendix F to this part. Substitute  into Equation F-23 the hourly heat input, calculated using the certified  flow monitoring system and the certified diluent monitor (according to  the applicable equation in section 5.2 of appendix F to this part), in  conjunction with the appropriate default SO2 emission rate  from section 2.3.1.1, 2.3.2.1.1, or 2.3.6(b) of appendix D to this part.  When this option is chosen, the owner or operator shall perform the  necessary data acquisition and handling system tests under  Sec. 75.20(c), and shall meet all quality control and quality assurance  requirements in appendix B to this part for the flow monitor and the  diluent monitor; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The owner or operator may determine SO2 mass  emissions by using a certified SO2 continuous monitoring  system, in conjunction with the certified flow rate monitoring system.  However, if the gaseous fuel is very low sulfur fuel (as defined in  Sec. 72.2 of this chapter), the SO2 monitoring system   shall meet the following quality assurance provisions when the very low  sulfur fuel is combusted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When conducting the daily calibration error tests of the  SO2 monitoring system, as required by section 2.1.1 in  appendix B of this part, the zero-level calibration gas shall have an  SO2 concentration of 0.0 percent of span. This restriction  does not apply if gaseous fuel is burned in the affected unit only  during unit startup.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> EPA recommends that the calibration response of the  SO2 monitoring system be adjusted, either automatically or  manually, in accordance with the procedures for routine calibration  adjustments in section 2.1.3 of appendix B to this part, whenever the  zero-level calibration response during a required daily calibration  error test exceeds the applicable performance specification of the  instrument in section 3.1 of appendix A to this part (i.e., 2.5 percent of the span value or 5  ppm, whichever is less restrictive).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any bias-adjusted hourly average SO2 concentration  of less than 2.0 ppm recorded by the SO2 monitoring system  shall be adjusted to a default value of 2.0 ppm, for reporting purposes.  Such adjusted hourly averages shall be considered to be quality-assured  data, provided that the monitoring system is operating and is not out- of-control with respect to any of the quality assurance tests required  by appendix B of this part (i.e., daily calibration error, linearity and  relative accuracy test audit).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In accordance with the requirements of section 2.1.1.2 of  appendix A to this part, for units that sometimes burn gaseous fuel that  is very low sulfur fuel (as defined in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter) and at  other times burn higher sulfur fuel(s) such as coal or oil, a second  low-scale SO2 measurement range is not required when the very  low sulfur gaseous fuel is combusted. For units that burn only gaseous  fuel that is very low sulfur fuel and burn no other type(s) of fuel(s),  the owner or operator shall set the span of the SO2  monitoring system to a value no greater than 200 ppm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, may also be  used for the combustion of a solid or liquid fuel that meets the  definition of very low sulfur fuel in Sec. 72.2 of this chapter,  mixtures of such fuels, or combinations of such fuels with gaseous fuel,  if the owner or operator submits a petition under Sec. 75.66 for a  default SO2 emission rate for each fuel, mixture or  combination, and if the Administrator approves the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other units. The owner or operator of an affected unit that  combusts wood, refuse, or other material in addition to oil or gas shall  comply with the monitoring provisions for coal-fired units specified in  paragraph (a) of this section, except where the owner or operator has an  approved petition to use the provisions of paragraph (e)(1) of this  section.
