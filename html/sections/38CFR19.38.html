                                Sec. 19.38  Action by agency of original jurisdiction when remand
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When a case is remanded by the Board of Veterans' Appeals, the  agency of original jurisdiction will complete the additional development  of the evidence or procedural development required. Following completion  of the development, the case will be reviewed to determine whether the  additional development, together with the evidence which was previously  of record, supports the allowance of all benefits sought on appeal. If  so, the appellant and his or her representative, if any, will be  promptly informed. If any benefits sought on appeal remain denied  following this review, the agency of original jurisdiction will issue a  Supplemental Statement of the Case concerning the additional development  pertaining to those issues in accordance with the provisions of Sec.  19.31 of this part. Following the 30-day period allowed for a response  to the Supplemental Statement of the Case pursuant to Rule of Practice  302, paragraph (c) (Sec. 20.302(c) of this chapter), the case will be  returned to the Board for further appellate processing unless the appeal  is withdrawn or review of the response to the Supplemental Statement of  the Case results in the allowance of all benefits sought on appeal.  Remanded cases will not be closed for failure to respond to the  Supplemental Statement of the Case.  (Authority 38 U.S.C. 7105(d)(1))  [57 FR 4104, Feb. 3, 1992, as amended at 69 FR 53808, Sept. 3, 2004; 73  FR 40748, July 16, 2008]    Sec. Sec. 19.39-19.49  [Reserved]</p>
