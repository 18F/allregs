                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When a licensee of a station using a directional antenna system  finds that a field monitoring point, as specified on the station  authorization, is no longer accessible or is unsuitable because of  nearby construction or other disturbances to the measured field, an  application to change the monitoring point location, including FCC Form  302-AM, is to be promptly submitted to the FCC in Washington, DC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the monitoring point has become inaccessible or otherwise  unsuitable, but there has been no significant construction or other  change in the vicinity of the monitoring point which may affect field  strength readings, the licensee shall select a new monitoring point from  the points measured in the last full proof of performance. A recent  field strength measurement at the new monitoring point shall also be  provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternatively, if changes in the electromagnetic environment  have affected field strength readings at the monitoring point, the  licensee shall submit the results of a partial proof of performance,  analyzed in accordance with Sec.  73.154, on the affected radial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The licensee shall submit an accurate, written description of  the new monitoring point in relation to nearby permanent landmarks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The licensee shall submit a photograph showing the new  monitoring point in relation to nearby permanent landmarks that can be  used in locating the point accurately at all times throughout the year.  Do not use seasonal or temporary features in either the written  descriptions or photographs as landmarks for locating field points.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the description of the monitoring point as shown on the  station license is no longer correct due to road or building  construction or other changes, the licensee must prepare and file with  the FCC, in Washington, DC, a request for a corrected station license  showing the new monitoring point description. The request shall include  the information specified in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this  section, and a copy of the station's current license. A copy of the  description is to be posted with the existing station license.  [66 FR 20757, Apr. 25, 2001]</p>
