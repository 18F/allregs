                                Sec. 121.1008  What occurs after SBA receives a size protest or request
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> concern whose size status has been protested.  SBA will provide a copy of the protest to the protested concern together  with SBA Form 355, Application for Small Business Size Determination, by  certified mail, return receipt requested, or by any overnight delivery  service that provides proof of receipt. SBA will ask the protested  concern to complete the form and respond to the allegations in the  protest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, SBA will provide a blank copy of SBA Form  355 to the concern whose size is at issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The protested concern or concern whose size is at issue must  return the completed SBA Form 355 and all other requested information to  SBA within 3 working days from the date of receipt of the blank form  from SBA. SBA has discretion to grant an extension of time to file the  form. The firm must attach to the completed SBA Form 355 its answers to  the allegations contained in the protest, where applicable, together  with any supporting material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a concern whose size status is at issue fails to submit a  completed SBA Form 355, responses to the allegations of the protest, or  other requested information within the time allowed by SBA, or if it  submits incomplete information, SBA may presume that disclosure of the  information required by the form or other missing information would  demonstrate that the concern is other than a small business. A concern  whose size status is at issue must furnish information about its alleged  affiliates to SBA, despite any third party claims of privacy or  confidentiality, because SBA will not disclose information obtained in  the course of a size determination except as permitted by Federal law.
