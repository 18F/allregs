                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State shall develop a long-range statewide transportation plan, with a minimum 20-year forecast period at the time of adoption, that provides for the development and implementation of the multimodal transportation system for the State. The long-range statewide transportation plan shall consider and include, as applicable, elements and connections between public transportation, non-motorized modes, rail, commercial motor vehicle, waterway, and aviation facilities, particularly with respect to intercity travel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan should include capital, operations and management strategies, investments, procedures, and other measures to ensure the preservation and most efficient use of the existing transportation system. The long-range statewide transportation plan may consider projects and strategies that address areas or corridors where current or projected congestion threatens the efficient functioning of key elements of the State's transportation system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan shall reference, summarize, or contain any applicable short-range planning studies; strategic planning and/or policy studies; transportation needs studies; management systems reports; emergency relief and disaster preparedness plans; and any statements of policies, goals, and objectives on issues (e.g., transportation, safety, economic development, social and environmental effects, or energy) that were relevant to the development of the long-range statewide transportation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan should include a safety element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, countermeasures, or projects contained in the Strategic Highway Safety Plan required by 23 U.S.C. 148.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan should include a security element that incorporates or summarizes the priorities, goals, or projects set forth in other transit safety and security planning and review processes, plans, and programs, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Within each metropolitan area of the State, the long-range statewide transportation plan shall be developed in cooperation with the affected MPOs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For non-metropolitan areas, the long-range statewide transportation plan shall be developed in consultation with affected non-metropolitan officials with responsibility for transportation using the State's consultation process(es) established under Sec. 450.210(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For each area of the State under the jurisdiction of an Indian Tribal government, the long-range statewide transportation plan shall be developed in consultation with the Tribal government and the Secretary of the Interior consistent with Sec. 450.210(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan shall be developed, as appropriate, in consultation with State, Tribal, and local agencies responsible for land use management, natural resources, environmental protection, conservation, and historic preservation. This consultation shall involve comparison of transportation plans to State and Tribal conservation plans or maps, if available, and comparison of transportation plans to inventories of natural or historic resources, if available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A long-range statewide transportation plan shall include a discussion of potential environmental mitigation activities and potential areas to carry out these activities, including activities that may have the greatest potential to restore and maintain the environmental functions affected by the long-range statewide transportation plan. The discussion may focus on policies, programs, or strategies, rather than at the project level. The discussion shall be developed in consultation with Federal, State, and Tribal land management, wildlife, and regulatory agencies. The State may establish reasonable timeframes for performing this consultation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In developing and updating the long-range statewide transportation plan, the State shall provide citizens, affected public agencies, representatives of public transportation employees, freight shippers, private providers of transportation, representatives of users of public transportation, representatives of users of pedestrian walkways and bicycle transportation facilities, representatives of the disabled, providers of freight transportation services, and other interested parties with a reasonable opportunity to comment on the proposed long-range statewide transportation plan. In carrying out these requirements, the State shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize the public involvement process described under Sec. 450.210(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan may (but is not required to) include a financial plan that demonstrates how the adopted long-range statewide transportation plan can be implemented, indicates resources from public and private sources that are reasonably expected to be made available to carry out the plan, and recommends any additional financing strategies for needed projects and programs. In addition, for illustrative purposes, the financial plan may (but is not required to) include additional projects that would be included in the adopted long-range statewide transportation plan if additional resources beyond those identified in the financial plan were to become available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> The State shall not be required to select any project from the illustrative list of additional projects included in the financial plan described in paragraph (l) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> The long-range statewide transportation plan shall be published or otherwise made available, including (to the maximum extent practicable) in electronically accessible formats and means, such as the World Wide Web, as described in Sec. 450.210(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The State shall continually evaluate, revise, and periodically update the long-range statewide transportation plan, as appropriate, using the procedures in this section for development and establishment of the long-range statewide transportation plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> Copies of any new or amended long-range statewide transportation plan documents shall be provided to the FHWA and the FTA for informational purposes.</p>
