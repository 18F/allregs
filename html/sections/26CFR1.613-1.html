                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. In the case of a taxpayer computing the deduction  for depletion under section 611 with respect to minerals on the basis of  a percentage of gross income from the property, as defined in section  613(c) and Secs. 1.613-3 and 1.613-4, the deduction shall be the  percentage of the gross income as specified in section 613(b) and  Sec. 1.613-2. The deduction shall not exceed 50 percent (100 percent in  the case of oil and gas properties for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1990) of the taxpayer's taxable income from the property  (computed without regard to the allowance for depletion). The taxable  income shall be computed in accordance with Sec. 1.613-5. In no case  shall the deduction for depletion computed under this section be less  than the deduction computed upon the cost or other basis of the property  provided in section 612 and the regulations thereunder. The  apportionment of the deduction between the several owners of economic  interests in a mineral deposit will be made as provided in paragraph (c)  of Sec. 1.611-1. For rules with respect to ``gross income from the  property'' and for definition of the term ``mining,'' see Secs. 1.613-3  and 1.613-4. For definitions of the terms ``property,'' ``mineral  deposit,'' and ``minerals,'' see paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.611-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Denial of percentage depletion in case of oil and gas wells.  Except as otherwise provided in section 613A and the regulations  thereunder, in the case of oil or gas which is produced after December  31, 1974, and to which gross income is attributable after that date, the  allowance for depletion shall be computed without regard to section 613.  [T.D. 8348, 56 FR 21938, May 13, 1991, as amended by T.D. 8437, 57 FR  43899, Sept. 23, 1992]</p>
