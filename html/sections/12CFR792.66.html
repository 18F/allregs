                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NCUA maintains several systems of records that are exempted from  some provisions of the Privacy Act. The system number and name,  description of records contained in the system, exempted provisions and  reasons for exemption are as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> System NCUA-1, entitled ``Employee Suitability Security  Investigations Containing Adverse Information,'' consists of adverse  information about NCUA employees that had been obtained as a result of  routine U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) security  investigations. To the extent that NCUA maintains records in this system  pursuant to OPM guidelines that may require retrieval of information by  use of individual identifiers, those records are encompassed by and  included in the OPM Central system of records number Central-9 entitled,  ``Personnel Investigations Records,'' and thus are subject to the  exemptions promulgated by OPM. Additionally, in order to ensure the  protection of properly confidential sources, particularly as to those  records which are not maintained pursuant to such Office of Personnel  Management requirements, the records in these systems of records are  exempted, pursuant to section k(5) of the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C.  552a(k)(5)), from section (d) of the Act (5 U.S.C. 552a(d)). To the  extent that disclosure of a record would reveal the identity of a  confidential source, NCUA need not grant access to that record by its  subject. Information which would reveal a confidential source shall,  however, whenever possible, be extracted or summarized in a manner which  protects the source and the summary or extract shall be provided to the  requesting individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, (e)(4)(G), (e)(4)(H), (f), and  (g). Where possible, information that would identify a confidential  source will be extracted or summarized in a manner that protects the  source and the summary or extract will be provided to the requesting  individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, and (g). NCUA need not make an accounting of previous  disclosures of a record in this system of records available to its  subject, and NCUA need not grant access to any records in this system of  records by their subject. Further, whenever individuals request records  about themselves and maintained in this system of records, the NCUA will  advise the individuals only that no records available to them pursuant  to   the Privacy Act of 1974 have been identified. However, if review of the  record reveals that the information contained therein has been used or  is being used to deny the individuals any right, privilege or benefit  for which they are eligible or to which they would otherwise be entitled  under federal law, the individuals will be advised of the existence of  the information and will be provided the information, except to the  extent disclosure would identify a confidential source. Where possible,  information which would identify a confidential source will be extracted  or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or  extract will be provided to the requesting individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(G)</em>, (H),  (I) and (f). However, if an individual is denied any right, privilege,  or benefit to which he would otherwise be entitled by federal law, or  for which he otherwise would be eligible, as a result of the maintenance  of such records, the records or information will be made available to  him, provided the identity of a confidential source is not disclosed.  NCUA need not make an accounting of previous disclosures of a record in  this system of records available to its subject, and NCUA need not grant  access to any records in this system of records by their subject.  Further, whenever individuals request records about themselves and  maintained in this system of records, the NCUA will advise the  individuals only that no records available to them pursuant to the  Privacy Act of 1974 have been identified. However, if review of the  record reveals that the information contained therein has been used or  is being used to deny the individuals any right, privilege or benefit  for which they are eligible or to which they would otherwise be entitled  under federal law, the individuals will be advised of the existence of  the information and will be provided the information, except to the  extent disclosure would identify a confidential source. Where possible,  information that would identify a confidential source will be extracted  or summarized in a manner which protects the source and the summary or  extract will be provided to the requesting individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of this section, a ``confidential source'' means a  source who furnished information to the Government under an express  promise that the identity of the source would remain confidential, or,  prior to September 27, 1976, under an implied promise that the identity  of the source would be held in confidence.
