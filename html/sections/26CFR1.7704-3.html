                                Sec. 1.7704-3  Qualifying income.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certain investment income--(1) In general. For purposes of  section 7704(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, qualifying income includes capital gain from the  sale of stock, income from holding annuities, income from notional  principal contracts (as defined in Sec. 1.446-3), and other  substantially similar income from ordinary and routine investments to  the extent determined by the Commissioner. Income from a notional  principal contract is included in qualifying income only if the  property, income, or cash flow that measures the amounts to which the  partnership is entitled under the contract would give rise to qualifying  income if held or received directly by the partnership.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Limitations. Qualifying income described in paragraph (a)(1) of  this section does not include income derived in the ordinary course of a  trade or business. For purposes of the preceding sentence, income  derived from an asset with respect to which the partnership is a broker,  market maker, or dealer is income derived in the ordinary course of a  trade or business; income derived from an asset with respect to which  the taxpayer is a trader or investor is not income derived in the  ordinary course of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of gross income and qualifying income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment  of losses. Except as otherwise provided in this section, in computing  the gross income and qualifying income of a partnership for purposes of  section 7704(c)(2) and this section, losses do not enter into the  computation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certain positions that are marked to market. Gain recognized  with respect to a position that is marked to market (for example, under  section 475(f), 1256, 1259, or 1296) shall not fail to be qualifying  income solely because there is no sale or disposition of the position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Certain items of ordinary income. Gain recognized with respect  to a capital asset shall not fail to be qualifying income solely because  it is characterized as ordinary income under section 475(f), 988, 1258,  or 1296.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>. For purposes of the preceding sentence, two or  more straddles that are part of a larger straddle shall be treated as a  single straddle. The amount of the gain from any straddle to be taken  into account shall be computed as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Straddles other than mixed straddle accounts. With respect to  each straddle (whether or not a straddle during the taxable year) other  than a mixed straddle account, the amount of gain taken into account  shall be the excess, if any, of gain recognized during the taxable year  with respect to property that was at any time a position in that  straddle over any loss recognized during the taxable year with respect  to property that was at any time a position in that straddle (including  loss realized in an earlier taxable year).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mixed straddle accounts. With respect to each mixed straddle  account (as defined in Sec. 1.1092(b)-4T(b)), the amount of gain taken  into account shall be the annual account gain for that mixed straddle  account, computed pursuant to Sec. 1.1092(b)-4T(c)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Certain transactions similar to straddles. In computing the  gross income and qualifying income of a partnership for purposes of  section 7704(c)(2) and this section, related interests in property  (whether or not personal property as defined in section 1092(d)(1)) that  produce a substantial diminution of the partnership's risk of loss  similar to that of a straddle (as defined in section 1092(c)) shall be  combined so that the amount of gain taken into account by the  partnership in computing its gross income shall be the excess, if any,  of gain recognized during the taxable year with respect to such  interests over any loss recognized during the taxable year with respect  to such interests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Wash sale rule--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gain not taken into account. Solely for  purposes of section 7704(c)(2) and this section, if a partnership  recognizes gain in a section 7704 wash sale transaction with respect to  one or more positions in either a straddle (as defined in section  1092(c)) or an arrangement described in paragraph (b)(5) of this  section, then the gain shall not be taken into account to the extent of  the amount of unrecognized loss (as of the close of the taxable year) in  one or more offsetting positions of the straddle or arrangement  described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Section 7704 wash sale transaction. For purposes of this  paragraph (b)(6), a section 7704 wash sale transaction is a transaction  in which--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A partnership disposes of one or more positions of a straddle  (as defined in section 1092(c)) or one or more related positions  described in paragraph (b)(5) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The partnership acquires a substantially similar position or  positions within a period beginning 30 days before the date of the  disposition and ending 30 days after such date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. This section applies to taxable years of a  partnership beginning on or after December 17, 1998. However, a  partnership may apply this section in its entirety for all of the  partnership's open taxable years beginning after any earlier date  selected by the partnership.  [T.D. 8799, 63 FR 69553, Dec. 17, 1998]    Sec. Sec. 1.7872-1--1.7872-4  [Reserved]</p>
