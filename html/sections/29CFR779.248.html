                                Sec. 779.248  Purchase or receive ``goods for resale.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Goods will be considered purchased or received ``for resale'' for purposes of the inflow test contained in section 3(s)(1) of the prior Act if they are purchased or received with the intention of being resold. This includes goods, such as stock in trade which is purchased or received by the enterprise for resale in the ordinary course of business. It does not include machinery, equipment, supplies, and other goods which the enterprise purchases to use in conducting its business. This is true even if such capital goods or other equipment, which the enterprise originally purchased for use in conducting its business, are at some later date actually resold. The distinction is to be found in whether the goods are purchased or received by the enterprise with the intention of reselling them in the same form or after further processing or manufacturing, or whether they are purchased with the intent of being consumed or used by the enterprise itself in the performance of its activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Goods, such as raw materials or ingredients, are considered purchased or received by the enterprise ``for resale,'' even if such goods are purchased or received for the purpose of being processed or used as parts or ingredients in the manufacture of other goods which the enterprise intends to sell. For example, where the enterprise purchases flour for use in baking bread or pastries for sale, the goods will be considered to have been purchased ``for resale.'' It is immaterial whether the goods will be resold by the enterprise at retail or at wholesale.</p>
