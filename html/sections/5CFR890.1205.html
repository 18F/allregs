The change may be made at the written request of the enrollee at any time after the last family member is lost and it becomes effective on the 1st day of the pay period after the pay period during which the request is received by the U.S. Department of State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A family member may file a request to change the type of enrollment on behalf of a hostage during the period of hostage status or on behalf of an eligible former hostage who cannot file the election on his or her own behalf because of a mental or physical disability.
