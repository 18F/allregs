                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. As required by Sec. Sec. 51.50, 51.53, 51.54, 51.55,  51.60, 51.61, 51.62, or 51.68, as appropriate, each applicant or  petitioner for rulemaking shall submit with its application or petition  for rulemaking one signed original of a separate document entitled  ``Applicant's'' or ``Petitioner's Environmental Report,'' as  appropriate. An applicant or petitioner for rulemaking may submit a  supplement to an environmental report at any time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Environmental considerations. The environmental report shall  contain a description of the proposed action, a statement of its  purposes, a description of the environment affected, and discuss the  following considerations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The impact of the proposed action on the environment. Impacts  shall be discussed in proportion to their significance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should  the proposal be implemented;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Alternatives to the proposed action. The discussion of  alternatives shall be sufficiently complete to aid the Commission in  developing and exploring, pursuant to section 102(2)(E) of NEPA,  ``appropriate alternatives to recommended courses of action in any  proposal which involves unresolved conflicts concerning alternative uses  of available resources.'' To the extent practicable, the environmental  impacts of the proposal and the alternatives should be presented in  comparative form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The relationship between local short-term uses of man's  environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term  productivity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources  which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> need not discuss issues not related to the  environmental effects of the proposed action and its alternatives. The  analyses for environmental reports shall, to the fullest extent  practicable, quantify the various factors considered. To the extent that  there are important qualitative considerations or factors that cannot be  quantified, those considerations or factors shall be discussed in  qualitative terms. The environmental report should contain sufficient  data to aid the Commission in its development of an independent  analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Status of compliance. The environmental report shall list all  Federal permits, licenses, approvals and other entitlements which must  be obtained in connection with the proposed action and shall describe  the status of compliance with these requirements. The environmental  report shall also include a discussion of the status of compliance with  applicable environmental quality standards and requirements including,  but not limited to, applicable zoning and land-use regulations, and  thermal and other water pollution limitations or requirements which have  been imposed by Federal, State, regional, and local agencies having  responsibility for environmental protection. The discussion of  alternatives in the report shall include a discussion of whether the  alternatives will comply with such applicable environmental quality  standards and requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adverse information. The information submitted pursuant to  paragraphs (b) through (d) of this section should not be confined to  information supporting the proposed action but should also include  adverse information.
