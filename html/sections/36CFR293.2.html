In carrying out such purposes, National Forest Wilderness resources shall be managed to promote, perpetuate, and, where necessary, restore the wilderness character of the land and its specific values of solitude, physical and mental challenge, scientific study, inspiration, and primitive recreation. To that end:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Natural ecological succession will be allowed to operate freely to the extent feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Wilderness will be made available for human use to the optimum extent consistent with the maintenance of primitive conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In resolving conflicts in resource use, wilderness values will be dominant to the extent not limited by the Wilderness Act, subsequent establishing legislation, or the regulations in this part.</p>
