No handler shall handle any inshell or shelled hazelnuts unless such inshell hazelnuts meet requirements of Oregon No. 1 grade and medium size (as defined in the Oregon Grade Standards Hazelnuts In Shell), and such shelled hazelnuts meet such requirements as are established by the Secretary on the basis of a recommendation of the Board, except as may be otherwise provided in Sec. 982.57. These minimum standards may be modified by the Secretary on the basis of a recommendation of the Board or other information whenever he finds that such modification would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act. Such minimum standards and the provisions of this part relating to the administration thereof shall continue in effect irrespective of whether the season average price of hazelnuts is above the parity level specified in section 2(1) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additional grade and size regulations. When the season average price of hazelnuts is not determined to be above parity, the Secretary may establish additional grade and size regulations for inshell hazelnuts in the form of a more restrictive minimum standard than that specified in paragraph (a) of this section, or pack specifications as to grades and sizes that may be handled, if he finds, on the basis of a recommendation of the Board or other information, that such regulations would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the act.
