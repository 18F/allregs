                                Sec. 416.1222  How income-producing property essential to self-support
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When deciding the value of property used in a trade or  business or nonbusiness income-producing activity, only the individual's  equity in the property is counted. We will exclude as essential to self- support up to $6,000 of an individual's equity in income-producing  property if it produces a net annual income to the individual of at  least 6 percent of the excluded equity. If the individual's equity is  greater than $6,000, we count only the amount that exceeds $6,000 toward  the allowable resource limit specified in Sec. 416.1205 if the net  annual income requirement of 6 percent is met on the excluded equity. If  the activity produces less than a 6-percent return due to circumstances  beyond the individual's control (for example, crop failure, illness,  etc.), and there is a reasonable expectation that the individual's  activity will again produce a 6-percent return, the property is also  excluded. If the individual owns more than one piece of property and  each produces income, each is looked at to see if the 6-percent rule is  met and then the amounts of the individual's equity in all of those  properties producing 6 percent are totaled to see if the total equity is  $6,000 or less. The equity in those properties that do not meet the 6- percent rule is counted toward the allowable resource limit specified in  Sec. 416.1205. If the individual's total equity in the properties  producing 6-percent income is over the $6,000 equity limit, the amount  of equity exceeding $6,000 is counted as a resource toward the allowable  resource limit.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Sharon has a small business in her home making hand-woven  rugs. The looms and other equipment used in the business have a current  market value of $7,000. The value of her equity is $5,500 since she owes  $1,500 on the looms. Sharon's net earnings from self-employment is $400.  Since Sharon's equity in the looms and other equipment ($5,500) is under  the $6,000 limit for property essential to self-support and her net  income after expenses ($400) is greater than 6 percent of her equity,  her income-producing property is excluded from countable resources. The  home is not considered in any way in valuing property essential to self- support.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Charlotte operates a farm. She owns 3 acres of land on  which her home is located. She also owns 10 acres of farm land not  connected to her home. There are 2 tool sheds and 2 animal shelters  located on the 10 acres. She has various pieces of farm equipment that  are necessary for her farming activities. We exclude the house and the 3  acres under the home exclusion (see Sec. 416.1212). However, we look at  the other 10 acres of land, the buildings and equipment separately to  see if her total equity in them is no more than $6,000 and if the annual  rate of return is 6 percent of her equity. In this case, the 10 acres  and buildings are valued at $4,000 and the few items of farm equipment  and other inventory are valued at $1,500. Charlotte   sells produce which nets her more than 6 percent for this year. The 10  acres and other items are excluded as essential to her self-support and  they continue to be excluded as long as she meets the 6-percent annual  return requirement and the equity value of the 10 acres and other items  remains less than $6,000.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Henry has an automobile repair business valued at $5,000.  There are no debts on the property and bills are paid monthly. For the  past 4 years the business has just broken even. Since Henry's income  from the business is less then 6 percent of his equity, the entire  $5,000 is counted as his resources. Since this exceeds the resources  limit as described in Sec. 416.1205, he is not eligible for SSI  benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Property that represents the authority granted by a  governmental agency to engage in an income-producing activity is  excluded as property essential to self-support if it is:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Used in a trade or business or nonbusiness income-producing  activity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Not used due to circumstances beyond the individual's control,  e.g., illness, and there is a reasonable expectation that the use will  resume.</p><p class="depth3">Example: John owns a commercial fishing permit granted by the State  Commerce Commission, a boat, and fishing tackle. The boat and tackle  have an equity value of $6,500. Last year, John earned $2,000 from his  fishing business. The value of the fishing permit is not detemined  because the permit is excluded under the exception. The boat and tackle  are producing in excess of a 6 percent return on the excluded equity  value, so they are excluded under the general rule (see paragraph (a) of  this section) up to $6,000. The $500 excess value is counted toward the  resource limit as described in Sec. 416.1205.  [50 FR 42687, Oct. 22, 1985]</p>
