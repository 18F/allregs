                                Sec.  144.89  How do I close my Class V injection well?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following describes the requirements for closing your Class V  injection well.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Closure. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to closing a Class V large-capacity cesspool  or motor vehicle waste disposal well, you must plug or otherwise close  the well in a manner that complies with the prohibition of fluid  movement standard in Sec.  144.12 and summarized in Sec.  144.82(a). If  the UIC Program Director in your State or EPA Region has any additional  or more specific closure standards, you have to meet those standards  too. You also must dispose or otherwise manage any soil, gravel, sludge,  liquids, or other materials removed from or adjacent to your well in  accordance with all applicable Federal, State, and local regulations and  requirements, as in Sec.  144.82(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Closure does not mean that you need to cease operations at your  facility, only that you need to close your well. A number of  alternatives are available for disposing of waste fluids. Examples of  alternatives that may be available to motor vehicle stations include:  recycling and reusing wastewater as much as possible; collecting and  recycling petroleum-based fluids, coolants, and battery acids drained  from vehicles; washing parts in a self-contained, recirculating solvent  sink, with spent solvents being recovered and replaced by the supplier;  using absorbents to clean up minor leaks and spills, and placing the  used materials in approved waste containers and disposing of them  properly; using a wet vacuum or mop to pick up accumulated rain or snow  melt, and if allowed, connecting floor drains to a municipal sewer  system or holding tank, and if allowed, disposing of the holding tank  contents through a publicly owned treatment works. You should check with  the publicly owned treatment works you might use to see if they would  accept your wastes. Alternatives that may be available to owners and  operators of a large-capacity cesspool include: conversion to a septic  system; connection to sewer; and installation of an on-site treatment  unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conversions. In limited cases, the UIC Director may authorize  the conversion (reclassification) of a motor vehicle waste disposal well  to another type of Class V well. Motor vehicle wells may only be  converted if: all motor vehicle fluids are segregated by   physical barriers and are not allowed to enter the well; and, injection  of motor vehicle waste is unlikely based on a facility's compliance  history and records showing proper waste disposal. The use of a semi- permanent plug as the means to segregate waste is not sufficient to  convert a motor vehicle waste disposal well to another type of Class V  well.
