                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General objective. The allocation planning process should provide for the equitable distribution of available budget authority, consistent with the relative housing needs of each allocation area within the field office jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishing allocation areas. Allocation areas, consisting of one or more counties or independent cities, shall be established by the field office in accordance with the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each allocation shall be to the smallest practicable area, but of sufficient size so that at least three eligible entities are viable competitors for funds in the allocation area, and so that all applicable statutory requirements can be met. (It is expected that in many instances individual MSAs will be established as metropolitan allocation areas.) For the section 202 program for the elderly, the allocation area must include sufficient units to promote a meaningful competition among disparate types of providers of such housing (e.g., local as well as national sponsors, minority as well as non-minority sponsors). The preceding

sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 21A(c) of the Federal Home Loan Bank Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each allocation area shall also be of sufficient size, in terms of population and housing need, that the amount of budget authority being allocated to the area will support at least one feasible program or project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In establishing allocation areas, counties and independent cities within MSAs should not be combined with counties that are not in MSAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determining the amount of budget authority. Where the field office establishes more than one allocation area, it shall determine the amount of budget authority to be allocated to each allocation area, based upon a housing needs percentage which represents the needs of that area relative to the field office jurisdiction. For each program, a composite housing needs percentage developed under Sec. 791.402 for those counties and independent cities comprising the allocation area shall be aggregated into allocation area totals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Planning for the allocation. The field office should develop an allocation plan which reflects the amount of budget authority determined for each allocation area in paragraph (c). The plan should include a map or maps clearly showing the allocation areas within the field office jurisdiction. The relative share of budget authority by individual program type need not be the same for each allocation area, so long as the total amount of budget authority made available to the allocation area is not significantly reduced.
