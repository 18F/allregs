                                Sec. 4.111  Contracts ``to furnish services.''
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> ``Principal purpose'' as criterion. Under its terms, the Act  applies to a ``contract * * * the principal purpose of which is to  furnish services * * *.'' If the principal purpose is to provide  something other than services of the character contemplated by the Act  and any such services which may be performed are only incidental to the  performance of a contract for another purpose, the Act does not apply.  However, as will be seen by examining the illustrative examples of  covered contracts in Sec. Sec. 4.130 et seq., no hard and fast rule can  be laid down as to the precise meaning of the term principal purpose.  This remedial Act is intended to be applied to a wide variety of  contracts, and the Act does not define or limit the types of services  which may be contracted for under a contract the principal purpose of  which is to furnish services. Further, the nomenclature, type, or  particular form of contract used by procurement agencies is not  determinative of coverage. Whether the principal purpose of a particular  contract is the furnishing of services through the use of service  employees is largely a question to be determined on the basis of all the  facts in each particular case. Even where tangible items of substantial  value are important elements of the subject matter of the contract, the  facts may show that they are of secondary import to the furnishing of  services in the particular case. This principle is illustrated by the  examples set forth in Sec. 4.131.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> of the Act (see Sec. 4.113).  Examples of some such contracts are set forth in Sec. Sec. 4.130 et  seq. In determining questions of contract coverage, due regard must be  given to the apparent legislative intent to include generally as  contracts for services those contracts which have as their principal  purpose the procurement of something other than the construction  activity described in the Davis-Bacon Act or the materials, supplies,  articles, and equipment described in the Walsh-Healey Act. The Committee  reports in both the House and Senate, and statements made on the floor  of the House, took note of the labor standards protections afforded by  these two Acts to employees engaged in the performance of construction  and supply contracts and observed: ``The service contract is now the  only remaining category of Federal contracts to which no labor standards  protections apply'' (H. Rept. 948, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1; see also  S. Rept. 798, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., p. 1; daily Congressional Record,  Sept. 20, 1965, p. 23497). A similar understanding of contracts  principally for services as embracing contracts other than those for  construction or supplies is reflected   in the statement of President Johnson upon signing the Act (1 Weekly  Compilation of Presidential Documents, p. 428).</p>
