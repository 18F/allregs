Carriers thus required to submit their evidence when they file their schedules are hereby notified that special permission to file those schedules shall be conditioned upon the publishing of an effective date at least 45 days later than the date of filing, to enable proper evaluation of the evidence presented. Data to be submitted in accordance with Sec. Sec.  1139.2 through 1139.5 of this part represent the minimum data required to be filed and served, and in no way shall be considered as limiting the type of evidence that may be presented at the time of filing of the schedules. If a formal proceeding is instituted, the carriers are not precluded from updating the evidence submitted at the time of filing of the schedules to reflect the contemporary situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The motor common carriers of general freight which are subject to the provisions of this section are those which are members of the following tariff publishing agencies:

In any proceeding involving a proposed rate restructuring which would produce additional net revenue of less than $1 million the carriers will be required to submit only the data sought in Sec. Sec.  1139.2 and 1139.3. Nothing stated in this part shall relieve the carriers of their burden of proof imposed under the Interstate Commerce Act.</p>
