Sec. Appendix E to Part 197--Form Letter--Conditions Governing Access to</p><p class="depth0">Official Records for Historical Research Purposes
Date:OSD Records Administrator1155 Defense PentagonWashington, DC 20301-1155
Dear</p><p class="depth0">I understand that the classified information to which I have requested access for historical research purposes is concerned with the national defense or foreign relations of the United States, and the unauthorized disclosure of it could reasonably be expected to cause damage, serious damage, or exceptionally grave damage to the national security depending on whether the information is classified Confidential, Secret, or Top Secret, respectively. If granted access, I therefore agree to the following conditions governing access to the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) files:</p><p class="depth0">1. I will abide by any rules and restrictions promulgated in your letter of authorization, including those of other Agencies whose information is interfiled with that of the OSD.</p><p class="depth0">2. I agree to safeguard the classified information, to which I gain possession or knowledge because of my access, in a manner consistent with Part 4 of Executive Order 12958, ``National Security Information,'' and the applicable provisions of the Department of Defense regulations concerning safeguarding classified information, including DoD 5200.1-R, ``Information Security Program.''</p><p class="depth0">3. I agree not to reveal to any person or Agency any classified information obtained as a result of this access except as authorized in the terms of your authorization letter or a follow-on letter, and I further agree that I shall not use the information for purposes other than those set forth in my request for access.</p><p class="depth0">4. I agree to submit my research notes for security review, to determine if classified information is contained in them, before their removal from the specific area assigned to me for research. I further agree to submit my manuscript for a similar review before its publication or presentation. In each of these reviews, I agree to comply with any decision of the reviewing official in the interests of the security of the United States, including the retention or deletion of any classified parts of such notes and manuscript whenever the Federal Agency concerned deems such retention or deletion necessary.</p><p class="depth0">5. I understand that failure to abide by the conditions in this statement shall constitute sufficient cause for canceling my access to classified information and for denying me any future access, and may subject me to criminal provisions of Federal Law as referred to in item 6.</p><p class="depth0">6. I have been informed that provisions of title 18 of the United States Code impose criminal penalties, under certain circumstances, for the unauthorized disclosure, loss, copying, or destruction of defense information.</p><p class="depth0">THIS STATEMENT IS MADE TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT TO ENABLE IT TO EXERCISE ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PROTECTION OF INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL SECURITY. I UNDERSTAND THAT ANY MATERIAL FALSE STATEMENT THAT I MAKE KNOWINGLY AND WILFULLY SHALL SUBJECT ME TO THE PENALTIES OF TITLE 18, U.S. CODE, SECTION 1001.Signature:

Sec. Appendix F to Part 197--Procedures for Copying of Documents for the</p><p class="depth0">Foreign Relations of the United States Series</p><p class="depth0">1. The records will be reviewed and copied at the WNRC, Suitland, Maryland.</p><p class="depth0">2. The requested records have been reviewed under the declassification provisions of E.O. 12958. Part of NARA's government-wide procedures for the review process requires that certain types of documents be tabbed for easy identification. Any tabs removed during the research and copying must be replaced.</p><p class="depth0">3. When documents are being copied, a DoD/WHS/declassification and historical research branch staff member must be present at all times.</p><p class="depth0">4. OSD will supply the copier, but the DoS must supply the toner cartridge, paper, staples, staple remover, stapler, and Post-It Notes. The copier is a Cannon Personal Copier-Model PC 425. It takes one of two cartridges--Cannon E20, which makes 2,000 copies and Cannon E40, which makes 4,000 copies.</p><p class="depth0">5. The number of boxes to be reviewed will determine which of the following two procedures will apply. The Declassification and Historical Research Branch staff will make that determination at the time the request is processed. When the historian completes the review of the boxes, he or she must contact the Declassification and Historical Research Branch to establish a final schedule for copying the needed documents. To avoid a possible delay, a tentative schedule will be established at the time that the review schedule is set.</p><p class="depth0">a. For a small number of boxes--the review and copying will take place simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0">b. For a large number of boxes--the historian will review the boxes and mark the documents that are to be copied using Post-It Notes or WNRC Reproduction Tabs.</p><p class="depth0">6. The documents must be given to the Declassification and Historical Research Branch staff member for transmittal to the Declassification and Historical Research Branch Office for processing.</p><p class="depth0">7. The Declassification and Historical Research Branch will notify the historian when the documents are ready to be picked-up.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix G to Part 197--Procedures for Copying Documents</p><p class="depth0">1. The records will be reviewed and copied at the WNRC, Suitland, Maryland.</p><p class="depth0">2. The requested records have been reviewed under the declassification provisions of E.O. 12958.
