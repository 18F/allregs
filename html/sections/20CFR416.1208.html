                                Sec. 416.1208  How funds held in financial institution accounts
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Funds held in a financial institution account  (including savings, checking, and time deposits, also known as  certificates of deposit) are an individual's resource if the individual  owns the account and can use the funds for his or her support and  maintenance. We determine whether an individual owns the account and can  use the funds for his or her support and maintenance by looking at how  the individual holds the account. This is reflected in the way the  account is titled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individually-held account. If an individual is designated as  sole owner by the account title and can withdraw funds and use them for  his or her support and maintenance, all of the funds, regardless of  their source, are that individual's resource. For as long as these  conditions are met, we presume that the individual owns 100 percent of  the funds in the account. This presumption is non-rebuttable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Jointly-held account--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Account holders include one or more  SSI claimants or recipients. If there is only one SSI claimant or  recipient account holder on a jointly held account, we presume that all  of the funds in the account belong to that individual. If there is more  than one claimant or recipient account holder, we presume that all the  funds in the account belong to those individuals in equal shares.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Account holders include one or more deemors. If none of the  account holders is a claimant or recipient, we presume that all of the  funds in a jointly-held account belong to the deemor(s), in equal shares  if there is more than one deemor. A deemor is a person whose income and  resources are required to be considered when determining eligibility and  computing the SSI benefit for an eligible individual (see Secs. 416.1160  and 416.1202).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Right to rebut presumption of ownership. If the claimant,  recipient, or deemor objects or disagrees with an ownership presumption  as described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, we give the  individual the opportunity to rebut the presumption. Rebuttal is a  procedure as described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, which  permits an individual to furnish evidence and establish that some or all  of the funds in a jointly-held account do not belong to him or her.  Successful rebuttal establishes that the individual does not own some or  all of the funds. The effect of successful rebuttal may be retroactive  as well as prospective.</p><p class="depth3">Example: The recipient's first month of eligibility is January 1993.  In May 1993 the recipient successfully establishes that none of the  funds in a 5-year-old jointly-held account belong to her. We do not  count any of the funds as resources for the months of January 1993 and  continuing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Procedure for rebuttal. To rebut an ownership presumption as  described in paragraph (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, the individual  must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submit his/her statement, along with corroborating statements  from other account holders, regarding who owns the funds in the joint  account, why there is a joint account, who has made deposits to and  withdrawals from the account, and how withdrawals have been spent;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Submit account records showing deposits, withdrawals, and  interest (if any) in the months for which ownership of funds is at  issue; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Correct the account title to show that the individual is no  longer a co-owner if the individual owns none of the funds; or, if the  individual owns only a portion of the funds, separate the funds owned by  the other account holder(s) from his/her own funds and correct the  account title on the individual's own funds to show they are solely- owned by the individual.
