                                Sec. 721.4568  Methylpolychloro aliphatic ketone.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Chemical substance and significant new uses subject to  reporting. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The chemical substance identified generically as  methylpolychloro aliphatic ketone (PMN No. P-91-1321) is subject to  reporting under this section for the significant new uses described in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The significant new uses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em>, (a)(2)(ii), (a)(2)(iii), (a)(3), (a)(6)(ii),  (a)(6)(iii), (a)(6)(v), (b) (concentration set at 0.1 percent), and (c).  The employer is able to demonstrate that the gloves selected for  handling P-91-1321 provide an impervious barrier to prevent dermal  exposure during normal and expected duration and conditions of exposure  within the work area by testing the material used to make the gloves and  the construction of the gloves to establish that they will be impervious  for the expected duration and conditions of exposure. The testing must  subject the gloves to the expected conditions of exposure, including the  likely combinations of chemical substances to which the gloves may be  exposed in the work area. There must be no permeation of P-91-1321  greater than 0.017 mg/cm\2\/min after 8 h of testing in accordance with  the most recent versions of the American Society for Testing and  Materials (ASTM) F739 ``Standard Test Method for Resistance of  Protective Clothing Materials to Permeation by Liquids or Gases'' and  ASTM F1194 ``Guide for Documenting the Results of Chemical Permeation  Testing of Protective Clothing Materials.'' The employer must submit all  test data to the Agency and must receive written Agency approval of the  test results for each type of glove tested prior to use of such gloves.  Neoprene gloves with a minimum thickness of 1.50 mm have already been  tested and found to satisfy the terms of this rule. Nitrile gloves with  a minimum thickness of 0.61 mm also satisfy the terms of this rule, as  long as the duration of exposure to P-91-1321 is less than 2 h per work  shift. If the duration of exposure is longer than 2 h, nitrile gloves  shall be discarded and replaced every 2 h. Unless otherwise indicated,  gloves contaminated with P-91-1321 shall be disposed of after every work  shift.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, (g)(4)(iii), and (g)(5).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Industrial, commercial, and consumer activities.

Requirements as specified in Sec.  721.90(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Specific requirements.
