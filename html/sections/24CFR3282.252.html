A sales transaction with a purchaser is considered completed when all the goods and services that the retailer agreed to provide at the time the contract was entered into have been provided. Completion of a retail sale will be at the time the retailer completes set-up of the manufactured home if the retailer has agreed to provide the set-up, or at the time the retailer delivers the home to a transporter, if the retailer has not agreed to transport or set up the manufactured home, or to the site if the retailer has not agreed to provide set-up.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This prohibition of sale does not apply to manufactured homes which are placed in production prior to the effective date of the standards, and it does not apply to ``used'' manufactured homes which are being sold or offered for sale after the first purchase in good faith for purposes other than the resale.</p>
