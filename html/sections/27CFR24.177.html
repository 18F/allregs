                            <p class="depth0">In producing natural grape wine from juice having a low sugar  content, pure dry sugar or concentrated grape juice may be added before  or during fermentation to develop alcohol. In producing natural fruit  wine from juice having a low sugar content, sugar, or concentrated juice  of the same kind of fruit may be added before or during fermentation to  develop alcohol. The quantity of sugar or concentrated juice added may  not raise the original density of the juice above 25 degrees Brix. If  grape juice or grape wine is ameliorated after chaptalization, the  quantity of pure dry sugar added to juice for chaptalization will be  included as ameliorating material. If fruit juice or fruit wine is  ameliorated after chaptalization, pure dry sugar added under this  section is not considered as ameliorating material. However, if fruit  juice or fruit wine is ameliorated after chaptalization and liquid sugar  or invert sugar syrup is used to chaptalize the fruit juice, the volume  of water contained in the liquid sugar or invert sugar syrup will be  included as ameliorating material.
