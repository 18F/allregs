In conjunction with the Office of the Solicitor, DAMS will review all issuances whether or not they will be published in the Federal Register as a part of the DOLAR System. In the case of internal procurement policy instructions, the purpose of the review is to ascertain that such instructions are consistent with the FAR and the DOLAR and that they do not contain information which should be issued under the DOLAR.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 2901.4_Deviations From the FAR and DOLAR</p>
