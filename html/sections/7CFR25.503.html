A rural area may consist of any area  that lies outside the boundaries of a Metropolitan Area, as designated  by the Office of Management and Budget, or, is an area that has a  population density less than or equal to 1,000 persons per square mile,  the land use of which is primarily agricultural.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions to the definition. On a case by case basis, the  Secretary may grant requests for waiver from the definition of ``rural''  stated in paragraph (a) of this section upon a showing of good cause.  Applicants seeking to apply for a rural designation who do not satisfy  the definition in paragraph (a) of this section must submit a request  for waiver in writing to the Deputy Administrator, USDA Office of  Community Development, Reporters Building, Room 701, STOP 3203, 300 7th  Street, SW., Washington, DC 20024-3202. Requests must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name, address and daytime phone number of the contact person  for the applicant seeking the waiver; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sufficient information regarding the area that would support the  infrequent exception from the definition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Waiver process. The Secretary, in consultation with the  Department of Commerce, will have discretion to permit rural  applications for communities that do not meet the above rural criteria.    Sec.
