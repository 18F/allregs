                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opening. In a removal proceeding, the immigration judge shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Advise the respondent of his or her right to representation, at  no expense to the government, by counsel of his or her own choice  authorized to practice in the proceedings and require the respondent to  state then and there whether he or she desires representation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise the respondent of the availability of free legal services  provided by organizations and attorneys qualified under 8 CFR part 1003  and organizations recognized pursuant to Sec. 1292.2 of this chapter,  located in the district where the removal hearing is being held;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ascertain that the respondent has received a list of such  programs, and a copy of appeal rights;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Advise the respondent that he or she will have a reasonable  opportunity to examine and object to the evidence against him or her, to  present evidence in his or her own behalf and to cross-examine witnesses  presented by the government (but the respondent shall not be entitled to  examine such national security information as the government may proffer  in opposition to the respondent's admission to the United States or to  an application by the respondent for discretionary relief);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Place the respondent under oath;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Read the factual allegations and the charges in the notice to  appear to the respondent and explain them in non-technical language; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Enter the notice to appear as an exhibit in the Record of  Proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Public access to hearings. Removal hearings shall be open to the  public, except that the immigration judge may, in his or her discretion,  close proceedings as provided in Sec. 1003.27 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pleading by respondent. The immigration judge shall require the  respondent to plead to the notice to appear by stating whether he or she  admits or denies the factual allegations and his or her removability  under the charges contained therein. If the respondent admits the  factual allegations and admits his or her removability under the charges  and the immigration judge is satisfied that no issues of law or fact  remain, the immigration judge may determine that removability as charged  has been established by the admissions of the respondent. The  immigration judge shall not accept an admission of removability from an  unrepresented respondent who is incompetent or under the age of 18 and  is not accompanied by an attorney or legal representative, a near  relative, legal guardian, or friend; nor from an officer of an  institution in which a respondent is an inmate or patient. When,  pursuant to this paragraph, the immigration judge does not accept an  admission of removability, he or she shall direct a hearing on the  issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issues of removability. When removability is not determined  under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, the immigration  judge shall request the assignment of an Service counsel, and shall  receive evidence as to any unresolved issues, except that no further  evidence need be received as to any facts admitted during the pleading.  The alien shall provide a court certified copy of a Judicial  Recommendation Against Deportation (JRAD) to the immigration judge when  such recommendation will be the basis of denying any charge(s) brought  by the Service in the proceedings against the alien. No JRAD is  effective against a charge of deportability under former section  241(a)(11) of the Act or if the JRAD was granted on or after November  29, 1990.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Additional charges in removal hearings. At any time during the  proceeding, additional or substituted charges of inadmissibility and/or  deportability and/or factual allegations may be lodged by the Service in  writing. The alien in removal proceedings shall be served with a copy of  these additional charges and allegations. The immigration judge shall  read the additional factual allegations and charges to the alien and  explain them to him or her. The immigration judge shall advise the  alien, if he or she is not represented by counsel, that the alien may be  so represented, and that he or she may be given a reasonable continuance  to respond to the additional factual allegations and charges.  Thereafter, the   provision of Sec. 1240.6(b) relating to pleading shall apply to the  additional factual allegations and charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Country of removal. With respect to an arriving alien covered by  section 241(b)(1) of the Act, the country, or countries in the  alternative, to which the alien may be removed will be determined  pursuant to section 241(b)(1) of the Act. In any other case, the  immigration judge shall notify the respondent that if he or she is  finally ordered removed, the country of removal will in the first  instance be the country designated by the respondent, except as  otherwise provided under section 241(b)(2) of the Act, and shall afford  him or her an opportunity then and there to make such designation. The  immigration judge shall also identify for the record a country, or  countries in the alternative, to which the alien's removal may be made  pursuant to section 241(b)(2) of the Act if the country of the alien's  designation will not accept him or her into its territory, or fails to  furnish timely notice of acceptance, or if the alien declines to  designate a country. In considering alternative countries of removal,  acceptance or the existence of a functioning government is not required  with respect to an alternative country described in section  241(b)(1)(C)(i)-(iii) of the Act or a removal country described in  section 241(b)(2)(E)(i)-(iv) of the Act. See 8 CFR 241.15.  [62 FR 10367, Mar. 6, 1997. Redesignated in part and duplicated in part  from part 240 at 68 FR 9838, 9840, Feb. 28, 2003; 70 FR 674, Jan. 5,  2005]</p>
