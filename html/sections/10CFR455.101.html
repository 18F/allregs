                            <p class="depth0">The non-Federal share of the costs of acquiring and installing energy conservation measures may be provided by using financing or other forms of borrowed funds, such as those provided by loans and performance contracts, even if such financing does not provide for the grantee to receive clear title to the equipment being financed until after the grant is closed out. However, grantees in such cases must otherwise meet all the requirements of this part, and financing and loan agreements and performance contracts under this section are subject to the requirements of 10 CFR part 600 and the certification requirements under Sec. 455.111(e). Grantees must receive clear title to the equipment when the loan is paid off.</p>
