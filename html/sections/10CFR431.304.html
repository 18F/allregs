This section provides test procedures for measuring, pursuant to EPCA, the energy consumption of walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This paragraph (b) shall be used for the purposes of certifying compliance with the applicable R-value energy conservation standards for panels until compliance with amended standards is required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The R value shall be the 1/K factor multiplied by the thickness of the panel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The K factor shall be based on ASTM C518 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.303).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When calculating the R value for freezers, the K factor of the foam at 20 1 degrees Fahrenheit (average foam temperature) shall be used. Test results from a test sample 1 0.1-inches in thickness may be used to determine the R value of panels with various foam thickness as long as the foam is of the same final chemical form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When calculating the R value for coolers, the K factor of the foam at 55 1 degrees Fahrenheit (average foam temperature) shall be used. Test results from a test sample 1 0.1-inches in thickness may be used to determine the R value of panels with various foam thickness as long as the foam is of the same final chemical form.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Foam shall be tested after it is produced in its final chemical form. (For foam produced inside of a panel (``foam-in-place''), ``final chemical form'' means the foam is cured as intended and ready for use as a finished panel.

Foam from foam-in-place panels must not include any structural members or non-foam materials. Foam produced as board stock may be tested prior to its incorporation into a final panel. A test sample 1 0.1-inches in thickness must be taken from the center of a panel and any protective skins or facers must be removed. A high-speed band-saw and a meat slicer are two types of recommended cutting tools. Hot wire cutters or other heated tools must not be used for cutting foam test samples. The two surfaces of the test sample that will contact the hot plate assemblies (as defined in ASTM C518 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.303)) must both maintain 0.03 inches flatness tolerance and also maintain parallelism with respect to one another within 0.03 inches. Testing must be completed within 24 hours of samples being cut for testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Internal non-foam member and/or edge regions shall not be considered in ASTM C518 testing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For panels consisting of two or more layers of dissimilar insulating materials (excluding facers or protective skins), test each material as described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (6) of this section.
