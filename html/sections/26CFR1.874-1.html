                                Sec. 1.874-1  Allowance of deductions and credits to nonresident
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Return required. A nonresident alien individual shall receive  the benefit of the deductions and credits otherwise allowable with  respect to the income tax, only if the nonresident alien individual  timely files or causes to be filed with the Philadelphia Service Center,  in the manner prescribed in subtitle F, a true and accurate return of  the income which is effectively connected, or treated as effectively  connected, with the conduct of a trade or business within the United  States by the nonresident alien individual. No provision of this section  (other than paragraph (c)(2)) shall be construed, however, to deny the  credits provided by sections 31, 32, 33, 34 and 852(b)(3)(D)(ii). In  addition, notwithstanding the requirement that a nonresident alien must  file a timely return in order to receive the benefit of the deductions  and credits otherwise allowable with respect to the income tax, the  nonresident alien individual may, for purposes of determining the amount  of tax to be withheld under section 1441 from remuneration paid for  labor or personal services performed within the United States, receive  the benefit of the deduction for personal exemptions provided in section  151, to the extent allowable under section 873(b)(3) and paragraph  (c)(3) of Sec. 1.873-1, or in any applicable tax convention, by filing  a claim therefore with the withholding agent. The amount of the  deduction for the personal exemptions and the amount of the tax to be  withheld under those circumstances shall be determined in accordance  with paragraph (e)(2) of Sec. 1.1441-3. The deductions and credits  allowed such a nonresident alien individual electing under a tax  convention to be subject to tax on a net basis may be obtained by filing  a return of income in the manner prescribed in the regulations (if any)  under the tax convention or under any other guidance issued by the  Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing deadline for return--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. As provided in  paragraph (a) of this section, for purposes of computing the nonresident  alien individual's taxable income for any taxable year, otherwise  allowable deductions and credits will be allowed only if a true and  accurate return for that taxable year is filed by the nonresident alien  individual on a timely basis. For taxable years of a nonresident alien  individual ending after July 31, 1990, whether a return for the current  taxable year has been filed on a timely basis is dependent upon whether  the nonresident alien individual filed a return for the taxable year  immediately preceding the current taxable year. If a return was filed  for that immediately preceding taxable year, or if the current taxable  year is the first taxable year of the nonresident alien individual for  which a return is required to be filed, the required return for the  current taxable year must be filed within 16 months of the due date, as  set forth in section 6072 and the regulations under that section, for  filing the return for the current taxable year. If no return for the  taxable year immediately preceding the current taxable year has been  filed, the required return for the current taxable year (other than the  first taxable year of the nonresident alien individual for which a  return is required to be filed) must have been filed no later than the  earlier of the   date which is 16 months after the due date, as set forth in section  6072, for filing the return for the current taxable year or the date the  Internal Revenue Service mails a notice to the nonresident alien  individual advising the nonresident alien individual that the current  year tax return has not been filed and that no deductions or credits  (other than those provided in sections 31, 32, 33, 34 and  852(b)(3)(D)(ii)) may be claimed by the nonresident alien individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Waiver. The filing deadlines set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of  this section may be waived if the nonresident alien individual  establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner or his or her  delegate that the individual, based on the facts and circumstances,  acted reasonably and in good faith in failing to file a U.S. income tax  return (including a protective return (as described in paragraph (b)(6)  of this section)). For this purpose, a nonresident alien individual  shall not be considered to have acted reasonably and in good faith if  the individual knew that he or she was required to file the return and  chose not to do so. In addition, a nonresident alien individual shall  not be granted a waiver unless the individual cooperates in determining  his or her U.S. income tax liability for the taxable year for which the  return was not filed. The Commissioner or his or her delegate shall  consider the following factors in determining whether the nonresident  alien individual, based on the facts and circumstances, acted reasonably  and in good faith in failing to file a U.S. income tax return--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Whether the individual voluntarily identifies himself or herself  to the Internal Revenue Service as having failed to file a U.S. income  tax return before the Internal Revenue Service discovers the failure to  file;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the individual did not become aware of his or her  ability to file a protective return (as described in paragraph (b)(6) of  this section) by the deadline for filing the protective return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the individual had not previously filed a U.S. income  tax return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the individual failed to file a U.S. income tax return  because, after exercising reasonable diligence (taking into account his  or her relevant experience and level of sophistication), the individual  was unaware of the necessity for filing the return;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Whether the individual failed to file a U.S. income tax return  because of intervening events beyond the individual's control; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Whether other mitigating or exacerbating factors existed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (b). In all examples, A is a nonresident alien individual and  uses the calendar year as A's taxable year. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Nonresident alien individual discloses own failure to  file. In Year 1, A became a limited partner with a passive investment in  a U.S. limited partnership that was engaged in a U.S. trade or business.  During Year 1 through Year 4, A incurred losses with respect to A's U.S.  partnership interest. A's foreign tax advisor incorrectly concluded that  because A was a limited partner and had only losses from A's partnership  interest, A was not required to file a U.S. income tax return. A was  aware neither of A's obligation to file a U.S. income tax return for  those years nor of A's ability to file a protective return for those  years. A had never filed a U.S. income tax return before. In Year 5, A  began realizing a profit rather than a loss with respect to the  partnership interest and, for this reason, engaged a U.S. tax advisor to  handle A's responsibility to file U.S. income tax returns. In preparing  A's U.S. income tax return for Year 5, A's U.S. tax advisor discovered  that returns were not filed for Year 1 through Year 4. Therefore, with  respect to those years for which applicable filing deadlines in  paragraph (b)(1) of this section were not met, A would be barred by  paragraph (a) of this section from claiming any deductions that  otherwise would have given rise to net operating losses on returns for  these years, and that would have been available as loss carryforwards in  subsequent years. At A's direction, A's U.S. tax advisor promptly  contacted the appropriate examining personnel and cooperated with the  Internal Revenue Service in determining A's income tax liability, for  example, by preparing and filing the appropriate income tax returns for  Year 1 through Year 4 and by making A's books and records available to  an Internal Revenue Service examiner. A has met the standard described  in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for waiver of any applicable filing  deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Nonresident alien individual refuses to cooperate. Same  facts as in Example 1,   except that while A's U.S. tax advisor contacted the appropriate  examining personnel and filed the appropriate income tax returns for  Year 1 through Year 4, A refused all requests by the Internal Revenue  Service to provide supporting information (for example, books and  records) with respect to those returns. Because A did not cooperate in  determining A's U.S. tax liability for the taxable years for which an  income tax return was not timely filed, A is not granted a waiver as  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section of any applicable filing  deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. Nonresident alien individual fails to file a protective  return. Same facts as in Example 1, except that in Year 1 through Year  4, A also consulted a U.S. tax advisor, who advised A that it was  uncertain whether U.S. income tax returns were necessary for those years  and that A could protect A's right subsequently to claim the loss  carryforwards by filing protective returns under paragraph (b)(6) of  this section. A did not file U.S. income tax returns or protective  returns for those years. A did not present evidence that intervening  events beyond A's control prevented A from filing an income tax return,  and there were no other mitigating factors. A has not met the standard  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for waiver of any  applicable filing deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 4. Nonresident alien with effectively connected income. In  Year 1, A, a computer programmer, opened an office in the United States  to market and sell a software program that A had developed outside the  United States. A had minimal business or tax experience internationally,  and no such experience in the United States. Through A's personal  efforts, U.S. sales of the software produced income effectively  connected with a U.S. trade or business. A, however, did not file U.S.  income tax returns for Year 1 or Year 2. A was aware neither of A's  obligation to file a U.S. income tax return for those years, nor of A's  ability to file a protective return for those years. A had never filed a  U.S. income tax return before. In November of Year 3, A engaged U.S.  counsel in connection with licensing software to an unrelated U.S.  company. U.S. counsel reviewed A's U.S. activities and advised A that A  should have filed U.S. income tax returns for Year 1 and Year 2. A  immediately engaged a U.S. tax advisor who, at A's direction, promptly  contacted the appropriate examining personnel and cooperated with the  Internal Revenue Service in determining A's income tax liability, for  example, by preparing and filing the appropriate income tax returns for  Year 1 and Year 2 and by making A's books and records available to an  Internal Revenue Service examiner. A has met the standard described in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section for waiver of any applicable filing  deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 5. IRS discovers nonresident alien's failure to file. In  Year 1, A, a computer programmer, opened an office in the United States  to market and sell a software program that A had developed outside the  United States. Through A's personal efforts, U.S. sales of the software  produced income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business. A  had extensive experience conducting similar business activities in other  countries, including making the appropriate tax filings. A, however, was  aware neither of A's obligation to file a U.S. income tax return for  those years, nor of A's ability to file a protective return for those  years. A had never filed a U.S. income tax return before. Despite A's  extensive experience conducting similar business activities in other  countries, A made no effort to seek advice in connection with A's U.S.  tax obligations. A failed to file either U.S. income tax returns or  protective returns for Year 1 and Year 2. In November of Year 3, an  Internal Revenue Service examiner asked A for an explanation of A's  failure to file U.S. income tax returns. A immediately engaged a U.S.  tax advisor, and cooperated with the Internal Revenue Service in  determining A's income tax liability, for example, by preparing and  filing the appropriate income tax returns for Year 1 and Year 2 and by  making A's books and records available to the examiner. A did not  present evidence that intervening events beyond A's control prevented A  from filing a return, and there were no other mitigating factors. A has  not met the standard described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for  waiver of any applicable filing deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3">Example 6. Nonresident alien with prior filing history. A began a  U.S. trade or business in Year 1 as a sole proprietorship. A's tax  advisor filed the appropriate U.S. income tax returns for Year 1 through  Year 6, reporting income effectively connected with A's U.S. trade or  business. In Year 7, A replaced this tax advisor with a tax advisor  unfamiliar with U.S. tax law. A did not file a U.S. income tax return  for any year from Year 7 through Year 10, although A had effectively  connected income for those years. A was aware of A's ability to file a  protective return for those years. In Year 11, an Internal Revenue  Service examiner contacted A and asked for an explanation of A's failure  to file income tax returns after Year 6. A immediately engaged a U.S.  tax advisor and cooperated with the Internal Revenue Service in  determining A's income tax liability, for example, by preparing and  filing the appropriate income tax returns for Year 7 through Year 10 and  by making A's books and records available to the examiner. A did not  present evidence that intervening events beyond A's control prevented A  from filing a return, and   there were no other mitigating factors. A has not met the standard  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section for waiver of any  applicable filing deadlines in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Effective date. Paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section are  applicable to open years for which a request for a waiver is filed on or  after January 29, 2002.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Income tax treaties. A nonresident alien individual who has a  permanent establishment or fixed base, as defined in an income tax  treaty between the United States and the country of residence of the  nonresident alien individual, in the United States is subject to the  filing deadlines as set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Protective return. If a nonresident alien individual conducts  limited activities in the United States in a taxable year which the  nonresident alien individual determines does not give rise to gross  income which is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or  business within the United States as defined in sections 871(b) and 864  (b) and (c) and the regulations under those sections, the nonresident  alien individual may nonetheless file a return for that taxable year on  a timely basis under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and thereby  protect the right to receive the benefit of the deductions and credits  attributable to that gross income if it is later determined, after the  return was filed, that the original determination was incorrect. On that  timely filed return, the nonresident alien individual is not required to  report any gross income as effectively connected with a United States  trade or business or any deductions or credits but should attach a  statement indicating that the return is being filed for the reason set  forth in this paragraph (b)(4). If the nonresident alien individual  determines that part of the activities which he or she conducts in the  United States in a taxable year gives rise to gross income which is  effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business and part  does not, the nonresident alien individual must timely file a return for  that taxable year to report the gross income determined to be  effectively connected, or treated as effectively connected, with the  conduct of that trade or business within the United States and the  deductions and credits attributable to the gross income. In addition,  the nonresident alien individual should attach to that return the  statement described in this paragraph (b)(4) with regard to the other  activities. The nonresident alien individual may follow the same  procedure if the nonresident alien individual determines initially that  he or she has no United States tax liability under the provisions of an  applicable income tax treaty. In the event the nonresident alien  individual relies on the provisions of an income tax treaty to reduce or  eliminate the income subject to taxation, or to reduce the rate of tax  to which that income is subject, disclosure may be required pursuant to  section 6114.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Allowed deductions and credits--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except for  losses of property located within the United States, charitable  contributions and personal exemptions (see section 873(b)), deductions  are allowed to a nonresident alien individual only to the extent they  are connected with gross income which is effectively connected, or  treated as effectively connected, with the conduct of the nonresident  alien individual's trade or business in the United States. Other than  credits allowed by sections 31, 32, 33, 34, and 852(b)(3)(D)(ii), the  nonresident alien individual is entitled to credits only if they are  attributable to effectively connected income. See paragraph (a) of this  section for the requirement that a return be timely filed. Except as  provided by section 906, a nonresident alien individual shall not be  allowed the credit against the tax for taxes of foreign countries and  possessions of the United States allowed by section 901.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verification. At the request of the Internal Revenue Service, a  nonresident alien individual claiming deductions from gross income which  is effectively connected or treated as effectively connected, with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States and credits  attributable to that income must furnish at the place designated  pursuant to Sec. 301.7605-1(a) information sufficient to establish that  the nonresident alien individual is entitled to the deductions and  credits in the   amounts claimed. All information must be furnished in a form suitable to  permit verification of the claimed deductions and credits. The Internal  Revenue Service may require, as appropriate, that an English translation  be provided with any information in a foreign language. If a nonresident  alien individual fails to furnish sufficient information, the Internal  Revenue Service may in its discretion disallow any claimed deductions  and credits in full or in part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Return by Internal Revenue Service. If a nonresident alien  individual has various sources of income within the United States, so  that from any one source, or from all sources combined, the amount of  income shall call for the assessment of a tax greater than that withheld  at the source in the case of that individual, and a return of income has  not been filed in the manner prescribed by subtitle F, including the  filing deadlines set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the  Internal Revenue Service shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cause a return of income to be made,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include on the return the income described in Sec. 1.871-7 or  Sec. 1.871-8 of that individual from all sources concerning which it  has information, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(D)(ii))</em> and collected from one or more of the sources of  income within the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Alien resident of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. This section shall not  apply to a nonresident alien individual who is a bona fide resident of  Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands during the entire taxable year. See section 876 and  Sec. 1.876-1.  [T.D. 8322, 55 FR 50828, Dec. 11, 1990; 56 FR 1361, Jan. 14, 1991, as  amended by T.D. 8981, 67 FR 4174, Jan. 29, 2002; T.D. 9043, 68 FR 11313,  Mar. 10, 2003]</p>
