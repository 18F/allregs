                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart contains the major environmental policies of the  Farmers Home Administration (FmHA) or its successor agency under Public  Law 103-354. It also provides the procedures and guidelines for  preparing the environmental impact analyses required for a series of  Federal laws, regulations, and Executive orders within one environmental  document. The timing and use of this environmental document within the  FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 decision-making  process is also outlined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This subpart is intended to be consistent with the Council on  Environmental Ouality's (CEQ) Regulations for Implementing the  Procedural Provisions of the National Environmental   Policy Act (NEPA), 40 CFR parts 1500-1508. CEQ's regulations will not be  repeated in this subpart except when essential for clarification of  important procedural or substantive points. Otherwise, citations to  applicable sections of the regulations will be provided. The CEQ  regulations will be available at all FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law 103-354 offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart is designed to integrate the requirements of NEPA  with other planning and environmental review procedures required by law,  or by Agency practice, so that all such procedures run concurrently  rather than consecutively. The environmental document, which results  from the implementation of this subpart, provides on a project basis a  single reference point for the Agency's compliance and/or implementation  of the following requirements and policies:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The National Environmental Policy Act, 42 U.S.C. 4321;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Safe Drinking Water Act--Section 1424(e), 42 U.S.C. 300h;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Endangered Species Act, 16 U.S.C. 1531;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 16 U.S.C. 1271;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The National Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 470 (See  subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter for more specific implementation  procedures);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Archaeological and Historic Preservation Act, 16 U.S.C. 469 (See  subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter for more specific implementation  procedures);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Coastal Zone Management Act--Section 307(c) (1) and (2), 16  U.S.C. 1456;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Farmland Protection Policy Act, subtitle I, Pub. L. 97-98;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub. L. 97-348;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Executive Order 11593, Protection and Enhancement of the  Cultural Environment (See subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter for  more specific implementation procedures);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Executive Order 11514, Protection and Enhancement of  Environmental Quality;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Executive Order 11990, Protection of Wetlands;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Title 7, parts 1b and 1c, Code of Federal Regulations,  Department of Agriculture's National Environmental Policy Act; Final  Policies and Procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Title 7, part 3100, Code of Federal Regulations, Department of  Agriculture's Enhancement, Protection, and Management of the Cultural  Environment (See subpart F of part 1901 of this chapter for more  specific implementation procedures);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Title 7, part 658, Code of Federal Regulations, Department of  Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service, Farmland Protection Policy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Title 87, part 12, Code of Federal Regulations, Highly Erodible  Land and Wetland Conservation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Departmental Regulation 9500-3, Land Use Policy (See exhibit A  of this subpart);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Departmental Regulation 9500-4, Fish and Wildlife Policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The primary objectives of this subpart are for the Agency to  make better decisions by taking into account potential environmental  impacts of proposed projects and by working with FmHA or its successor  agency under Public Law 103-354 applicants, other Federal agencies,  Indian tribes, State and local governments, and interested citizens and  organizations in order to formulate actions that advance the program  goals in a manner that will protect, enhance, and restore environmental  quality. To accomplish these objectives, the identification of  potentially significant impacts on the human environment is mandated to  occur early in the Agency's planning and decisionmaking processes.  Important decision points are identified. The completion of the  environmental review process is coordinated with these decision points,  and this review must be completed prior to the Agency's first major  decision on whether or not to participate in the proposal. This early  availability of the results of the environmental review process is  intended to ensure that Agency decisions are based on an understanding  of their environmental consequence, as well as the consequences of  alternative courses of action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Reducing delays, duplication of effort, and superfluous analyses  are provided for in this subpart. FmHA or its successor agency under  Public Law   103-354 environmental documents are to be supported by accurate analyses  and will concentrate on the issues that are timely and relevant to the  action in question, rather than amassing needless detail. Such documents  and their preparation and review will be coordinated with other Federal  or State agencies jointly participating in proposed actions or related  actions, in order to avoid duplication of effort, and to achieve a  coordinated and timely response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Public involvement is desirable, and to facilitate public  involvement, environmental documents will be available to interested  citizens as early in the decisionmaking process as possible and before  decisions are made. Provisions are included for citizens or interested  parties to express their views and any concerns.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  officials responsible for the environmental review process are  identified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354  actions covered by this subpart include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial assistance to include grants, loans, and guarantees,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subdivision approvals,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The management, leasing and sale of inventory property, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other major federal actions such as proposals for legislation  and the issuance of regulations.</p>
