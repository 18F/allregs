(1) For taxable years ending after December 30, 1969, a taxpayer reporting gross income on the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting may elect to include insurance proceeds received as a result of the destruction of, or damage to, crops in gross income for the taxable year following the taxable year of the destruction or damage, if the taxpayer establishes that, under the taxpayer's normal business practice, the income from those crops would have been included in gross income for any taxable year following the taxable year of the destruction or damage. However, if the taxpayer receives the insurance proceeds in the taxable year following the taxable year of the destruction or damage, the taxpayer shall include the proceeds in gross income for the taxable year of receipt without having to make an election under section 451(d) and this section. For the purposes of this section only, federal payments received as a result of destruction or damage to crops caused by drought, flood, or any other natural disaster, or the inability to plant crops because of such a natural disaster, shall be treated as insurance proceeds received as a result of destruction or damage to crops.
