On offhand grinding machines, work rests shall be used to support the work. They shall be of rigid construction and designed to be adjustable to compensate for wheel wear. Work rests shall be kept adjusted closely to the wheel with a maximum opening of one-eighth inch to prevent the work from being jammed between the wheel and the rest, which may cause wheel breakage. The work rest shall be securely clamped after each adjustment. The adjustment shall not be made with the wheel in motion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Excluded machinery.

Exceptions are set forth in the remaining subdivisions of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Type 27 and Type 28 wheels, because of their shape and usage, require specially designed adaptors. The back flange shall extend beyond the central hub or raised portion and contact the wheel to counteract the side pressure on the wheel in use. The adaptor nut which is less than the minimum one-third diameter of wheel fits in the depressed side of wheel to prevent interference in side grinding and serves to drive the wheel by its clamping force against the depressed portion of the back flange. The variance in flange diameters, the adaptor nut being less than one-third wheel diameter, and the use of side pressure in wheel operation limits the use to reinforced organic bonded wheels. Mounts which are affixed to the wheel by the manufacturer shall not be reused. Type 27 and Type 28 wheels shall be used only with a safety guard located between wheel and operator during use.

(i) Tables O-4 and O-6 and Figures O-30 and O-32 show minimum dimensions for straight relieved and unrelieved flanges for use with wheels with small holes that fit directly on the machine spindle. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tables O-4 and O-6 and Figures O-30 and O-32 show minimum dimensions for straight relieved and unrelieved flanges for use with wheels with small holes that fit directly on the machine spindle. Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Table O-5, and Table O-7 and Figures O-31, O-33, O-34 show minimum dimensions for straight adaptor flanges for use with wheels having holes larger than the spindle.

Dimensions of such flanges shall never be less than indicated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Repairs and maintenance. All flanges shall be maintained in good condition. When the bearing surfaces become worn, warped, sprung, or damaged they should be trued or refaced. When refacing or truing, care shall be exercised to make sure that proper relief and rigidity is maintained as specified in paragraphs (c) (2) and (5) of this section and they shall be replaced when they do not conform to these subparagraphs and Table O-4, Figure O-30, Table O-5, Figure O-31, Table O-6, Figure O-32, and Table O-8, Figure O-35. Failure to observe these rules might cause excessive flange pressure around the hole of the wheel. This is especially true of wheel-sleeve or adaptor flanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Mounting-(1) Inspection. Immediately before mounting, all wheels shall be closely inspected and sounded by the user (ring test) to make sure they have not been damaged in transit, storage, or otherwise. The spindle speed of the machine shall be checked before mounting of the wheel to be certain that it does not exceed the maximum operating speed marked on the wheel. Wheels should be tapped gently with a light nonmetallic implement, such as the handle of a screwdriver for light wheels, or a wooden mallet for heavier wheels. If they sound cracked (dead), they shall not be used. This is known as the ``Ring Test''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Inspection.

This is known as the ``Ring Test''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Wheels must be dry and free from sawdust when applying the ring test, otherwise the sound will be deadened. It should also be noted that organic bonded wheels do not emit the same clear metallic ring as do vitrified and silicate wheels.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC27OC91.068</p><p class="depth0">Figure No. O-25      Figure No. O-26</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Tap'' wheels about 45 each side of the vertical centerline and about 1 or 2 inches from the periphery as indicated by the spots in Figure O-25 and Figure O-26. Then rotate the wheel 45 and repeat the test. A sound and undamaged wheel will give a clear metallic tone. If cracked, there will be a dead sound and not a clear ``ring.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Arbor size. Grinding wheels shall fit freely on the spindle and remain free under all grinding conditions. A controlled clearance between the wheel hole and the machine spindle (or wheel sleeves or adaptors) is essential to avoid excessive pressure from mounting and spindle expansion. To accomplish this, the machine spindle shall be made to nominal (standard) size plus zero minus .002 inch, and the wheel

hole shall be made suitably oversize to assure safety clearance under the conditions of operating heat and pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Surface condition. All contact surfaces of wheels, blotters and flanges shall be flat and free of foreign matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bushing. When a bushing is used in the wheel hole it shall not exceed the width of the wheel and shall not contact the flanges.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Blotters. When blotters or flange facings of compressible material are required, they shall cover entire contact area of wheel flanges. Blotters need not be used with the following types of wheels:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Mounted wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Abrasive discs (inserted nut, inserted washer, and projecting-stud type).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Plate mounted wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cylinders, cups, or segmental wheels that are mounted in chucks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Types 27 and 28 wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certain Type 1 and Type 27A cutting-off wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Certain internal wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Type 4 tapered wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Diamond wheels, except certain vitrified diamond wheels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Multiple wheel mounting. When more than one wheel is mounted between a single set of flanges, wheels may be cemented together or separated by specially designed spacers. Spacers shall be equal in diameter to the mounting flanges and have equal bearing surfaces. When mounting wheels which have not been cemented together, or ones which do not utilize separating spacers, care must be exercised to use wheels specially manufactured for that purpose.[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC27OC91.069</p><p class="depth0">Table O-1-Minimum Basic Thickness for Peripheral and Side Members for Safety Guards Used With Cutting-Off Wheels--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Cutting off wheel diameters</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Material used in construction of    Maximum thickness of                             6 to 11     Over 11 to    Over 20 to    Over 30 to    Over 48 to</p><p class="depth0">guard                    cutting off wheel     Speed not to exceed      inches       20 inches     30 inches     48 inches     72 inches</p><p class="depth0">---------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">A      B      A      B      A      B      A      B      A      B--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Structural steel (min. tensile       \1/2\ inch or less....  14,200 SFPM..........    \1/    \1/    \3/    \3/  \1/8\  \1/8\    \3/    \3/  \1/4\  \1/4\</p><p class="depth0">strength 60,000 p.s.i.).                                                             16\    16\    32\    32\                  16\    16\</p><p class="depth0">\1/2\ inch or less....  16,000 SFPM..........    \3/  \1/8\  \1/8\  \1/8\    \3/  \1/8\  \1/4\    \3/    \5/  \1/4\</p><p class="depth0">32\                         16\                  16\    16\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
