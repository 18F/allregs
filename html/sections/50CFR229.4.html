                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For a vessel owner or crew members to lawfully  incidentally   take marine mammals in the course of a commercial fishing operation in a  Category I or II fishery, the owner or authorized representative of a  fishing vessel or nonvessel fishing gear must have in possession a valid  Certificate of Authorization. The owner of a fishing vessel or nonvessel  fishing gear is responsible for obtaining a Certificate of  Authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The granting and administration of Authorization Certificates  under this part will be integrated and coordinated with existing fishery  license, registration, or permit systems and related programs wherever  possible. These programs may include, but are not limited to, state or  interjurisdictional fisheries programs. If the administration of  Authorization Certificates is integrated into a program, NMFS will  publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing the integrated  program and summarizing how an owner or authorized representative of a  fishing vessel or non-fishing gear may register under that program or  how registration will be achieved if no action is required on the part  of the affected fisher. NMFS will make additional efforts to contact  participants in the affected fishery via other appropriate means of  notification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Registration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel gear  fisheries, the owner of gear, who participates in a Category I or II  fishery is required to be registered for a Certificate of Authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Unless a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing  an integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for  nonvessel fishery, the owner of the gear must register for and receive  an Authorization Certificate. To register, owners must submit the  following information using the format specified by NMFS:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name, address, and phone number of owner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name, address, and phone number of operator, if different from  owner, unless the name of the operator is not known or has not been  established at the time the registration is submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For a vessel fishery, vessel name, length, home port; U.S.  Coast Guard documentation number or state registration number, and if  applicable; state commercial vessel license number and for a nonvessel  fishery, a description of the gear and state commercial license number,  if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A list of all Category I and II fisheries in which the fisher  may actively engage during the calendar year.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A certification signed and dated by the owner of an authorized  representative of the owner as follows: ``I hereby certify that I am the  owner of the vessel, that I have reviewed all information contained on  this document, and that it is true and complete to the best of my  knowledge.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A check or money order made payable to NMFS in the amount  specified in the notice of the final List of Fisheries must accompany  each registration submitted to NMFS. The amount of this fee will be  based on recovering the administrative costs incurred in granting an  authorization. The Assistant Administrator may waive the fee requirement  for good cause upon the recommendation of the Regional Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a notice is published in the Federal Register announcing an  integrated registration program, the owner of a vessel, or for nonvessel  fishery, the owner of the gear may register by following the directions  provided in that notice. If a person receives a registration to which he  or she is not entitled or if the registration contains incorrect,  inaccurate or incomplete information, the person shall notify NMFS  within 10 days following receipt. If a fisher participating in a  Category I or II fishery who expects to receive automatic registration  does not receive that registration within the time specified in the  notice announcing the integrated registration program, the person shall  notify NMFS as directed in the notice or may apply for registration by  submitting the information required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) through  (b)(1)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Address. Unless the granting and administration of  authorizations under this part 229 is integrated and coordinated with  existing fishery licenses, registrations, or related programs pursuant  to paragraph (a) of this section, requests for registration forms and  completed registration and renewal   forms should be sent to the NMFS Regional Offices as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alaska Region, NMFS, P.O. Box 21668, 709 West 9th Street,  Juneau, AK 99802; telephone: 907-586-7235;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Northwest Region, NMFS, 7600 Sand Point Way NE., Seattle, WA  98115-0070; telephone: 206-526-4353;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Southwest Region, NMFS, 501 West Ocean Blvd., Suite 4200, Long  Beach, CA 90802-4213; telephone: 562-980-4001;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Northeast Region, NMFS, 1 Blackburn Drive, Gloucester, MA 01930;  telephone: 978-281-9254; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Southeast Region, NMFS, 9721 Executive Center Drive North, St.  Petersburg, FL 33702; telephone: 727-570-5312.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Issuance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For integrated fisheries, an Authorization  Certificate or other proof of registration will be issued annually to  each fisher registered for that fishery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all other fisheries (i.e., non-integrated fisheries), NMFS  will issue an Authorization Certificate and, if necessary, a decal to an  owner or authorized representative who:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Submits a completed registration form and the required fee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has complied with the requirements of this section and  Sec. Sec. 229.6 and 229.7.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Has submitted updated registration or renewal registration  which includes a statement (yes/no) whether any marine mammals were  killed or injured during the current or previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a person receives a renewed Authorization Certificate or a  decal to which he or she is not entitled, the person shall notify NMFS  within 10 days following receipt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authorization Certificate and decal requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a decal  has been issued under the conditions specified in paragraph (e)(2) of  this section, the decal must be attached to the vessel on the port side  of the cabin or, in the absence of a cabin, on the forward port side of  the hull, and must be free of obstruction and in good condition. The  decal must be attached to the Authorization Certificate for nonvessel  fisheries.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Authorization Certificate, or a copy, must be on board the  vessel while it is operating in a Category I or II fishery, or, in the  case of nonvessel fisheries, the Authorization Certificate with decal  attached, or copy must be in the possession of the person in charge of  the fishing operation. The Authorization Certificate, or copy, must be  made available upon request to any state or Federal enforcement agent  authorized to enforce the Act, any designated agent of NMFS, or any  contractor providing observer services to NMFS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorization Certificates and decals are not transferable. In  the event of the sale or change in ownership of the vessel, the  Authorization Certificate is void and the new owner must register for an  Authorization Certificate and decal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An Authorization Certificate holder must notify the issuing  office in writing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the vessel or nonvessel fishing gear will engage in any  Category I or II fishery not listed on the initial registration form at  least 30 days prior to engaging in that fishery; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If there are any changes in the mailing address or vessel  ownership within 30 days of such change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Reporting. Any Authorization Certificate holders must comply  with the reporting requirements specified under Sec. 229.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of marine mammals. Any marine mammal incidentally  taken must be immediately returned to the sea with a minimum of further  injury, unless directed otherwise by NMFS personnel, a designated  contractor or an official observer, or authorized otherwise by a  scientific research permit that is in the possession of the operator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Monitoring. Authorization Certificate holders must comply with  the observer or other monitoring requirements specified under Sec.  229.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Deterrence. When necessary to deter a marine mammal from  damaging fishing gear, catch, or other private property, or from  endangering personal safety, vessel owners and crew members engaged in a  Category I or II fishery must comply with all deterrence provisions set  forth in the Act and all guidelines and prohibitions published  thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Self defense. When imminently necessary in self-defense or to  save the life of a person in immediate danger, a marine mammal may be  lethally taken if such taking is reported to NMFS in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 229.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Take reduction plans and emergency regulations. Authorization  Certificate holders must comply with any applicable take reduction plans  and emergency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Expiration. Authorization Certificates expire at the end of each  calendar year.  [60 FR 45100, Aug. 30, 1995, as amended at 62 FR 46, Jan. 2, 1997; 64 FR  9086, Feb. 24, 1999]</p>
