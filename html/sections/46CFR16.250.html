Where practicable, this belief should be based on the observation of the individual by two persons in supervisory positions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the marine employer requires testing of an individual under the provisions of this section, the individual must be informed of that fact and directed to provide a urine specimen as soon as practicable. This fact shall be entered in the vessel's official log book, if one is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If an individual refuses to provide a urine specimen when directed to do so by the employer under the provisions of this section, this fact shall be entered in the vessel's official log book, if one is required.
