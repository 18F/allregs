                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Federally-owned property. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title to federally-owned property  remains vested in the Federal Government. Recipients shall submit  annually an inventory listing of federally-owned property in their  custody to the DoD Component that made the award. Upon completion of the  award or when the property is no longer needed, the recipient shall  report the property to the DoD Component for further Federal agency  utilization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the DoD Component that made the award has no further need for  the property, it shall be declared excess and either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reported to the General Services Administration, in accordance  with the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (40  U.S.C. 483(b)(2)), as implemented by General Services Administration  regulations at 41 CFR 101-47.202; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Disposed of by alternative methods pursuant to other specific  statutory authority. For example, DoD Components are authorized by the  Federal Technology Transfer Act (15 U.S.C. 3710(i)), to donate research  equipment to educational and non-profit organizations for the conduct of  technical and scientific education and research activities--donations  under this Act shall be in accordance with the DoD implementation of  E.O. 12999 (3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 180), ``Educational Technology:  Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century,'' as  applicable. Appropriate instructions shall be issued to the recipient by  the DoD Component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exempt property. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When statutory authority exists, a DoD  Component may vest title to property acquired with Federal funds in the  recipient without further obligation to the Federal Government and under  conditions the DoD Component considers appropriate. For example, under  31 U.S.C. 6306, DoD Components may so vest title to tangible personal  property   under a grant or cooperative agreement for basic or applied research in  a nonprofit institution of higher education or a nonprofit organization  whose primary purpose is conducting scientific research. Such property  is ``exempt property.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As a matter of policy, DoD Components shall make maximum use of  the authority of 31 U.S.C. 6306 to vest title to exempt property in  institutions of higher education, without further obligation to the  Government, to enhance the university infrastructure for future  performance of defense research and related, science and engineering  education.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DoD Components may establish conditions, in regulation or in  award terms and conditions, for vesting title to exempt property. Should  a DoD Component not establish conditions, title to exempt property upon  acquisition shall vest in the recipient without further obligation to  the Federal Government.</p>
