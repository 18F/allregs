                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. (1) The color additive D&C; Red No. 27 is principally 2',4',5',7'-tetrabromo-4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein (CAS Reg. No. 13473-26-2). The color additive is manufactured by brominating 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein with elemental bromine. The 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein is manufactured by the acid condensation of resorcinol and tetrachlorophthalic acid or its anhydride. The 4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein is isolated and partially purified prior to bromination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive D&C; Red No. 27 is principally 2',4',5',7'-tetrabromo-4,5,6,7-tetrachlorofluorescein (CAS Reg.

D&C; Red No. 27 may be safely used for coloring drugs generally in amounts consistent with current good manufacturing practice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling. The label of the color additive and any mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring purposes shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification. All batches of D&C; Red No. 27 shall be certified in accordance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
