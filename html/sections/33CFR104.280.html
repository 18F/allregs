The vessel owner or operator must ensure that security measures relating to the delivery of vessel stores and bunkers are implemented to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Check vessel stores for package integrity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Prevent vessel stores from being accepted without inspection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deter tampering; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Prevent vessel stores and bunkers from being accepted unless ordered. For vessels that routinely use a facility, a vessel owner or operator may establish and implement standing arrangements between the vessel, its suppliers, and a facility regarding notification and the timing of deliveries and their documentation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Maritime Security (MARSEC) Level 1. At MARSEC Level 1, the vessel owner or operator must ensure the implementation of measures to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Check vessel stores before being accepted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Check that vessel stores and bunkers match the order prior to being brought on board or being bunkered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that vessel stores are controlled or immediately and securely stowed following delivery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> MARSEC Level 2. In addition to the security measures required for MARSEC Level 1 in this section, at MARSEC Level 2, the vessel owner or operator must also ensure the implementation of additional security measures, as specified for MARSEC Level 2 in the approved Vessel Security Plan (VSP).
