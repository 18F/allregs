                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> By August 18, 1997, all existing uses and occupancies must meet the applicable requirements of this subpart. If not, BLM will either issue you a notice of noncompliance or order any existing use or occupancy failing to meet the requirements of this subpart to suspend or cease under Sec. 3715.7-1. BLM will also order you to reclaim the land under 43 CFR part 3800, subpart 3802 or 3809 to BLM's satisfaction within a specified, reasonable time, unless otherwise expressly authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If you are occupying the public lands under the mining laws on August 15, 1996, you may continue your occupancy for one year after that date, without being subject to the procedures this subpart imposes, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You notify BLM by October 15, 1996 of the existence of the occupancy using a format specified by BLM; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> BLM has no pending trespass action against you concerning your occupancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The one-year grace period provided in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply if at any time BLM determines that your use or occupancy is not reasonably incident and the continued presence of the use or occupancy is a threat to health, safety or the environment. In this situation, BLM will order an immediate temporary suspension of activities under Sec. 3715.7-1(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If you have no existing occupancies, but are engaged in uses of the public lands under the mining law, you are subject to the standards in Sec. 3715.5. BLM will determine if your existing uses comply with those standards during normal inspection visits to the area and during BLM review of notices and plans of operations filed under 43 CFR part 3800.


Sec. 3715.4-1  What happens after I give BLM written notification of my existing occupancy?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> BLM will visit your site during the normal course of inspection to obtain the information described in Sec. 3715.3-2. After the visit, BLM will make a determination of concurrence or non-concurrence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> You must provide the information described in Sec. 3715.3-2 to BLM. You may provide it either in writing or verbally during a site visit by BLM field staff.


Sec. 3715.4-2  What if I do not notify BLM of my existing occupancy?</p><p class="depth0">If you do not provide the written notice required in Sec. 3715.4, you will be subject to the enforcement actions of Sec. 3715.7-1, the civil remedies of Sec. 3715.7-2, and the criminal penalties of Sec. 3715.8.


Sec. 3715.4-3  What if BLM does not concur in my existing use or occupancy?</p><p class="depth0">If BLM determines that all or any part of your existing use or occupancy is not reasonably incident:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> BLM may order a suspension or cessation of all or part of the use or occupancy under Sec. 3715.7-1;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> BLM may order the land to be reclaimed to its satisfaction and specify a reasonable time for completion of reclamation under 43 CFR part 3800; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> BLM may order you to apply within 30 days after the date of notice

from BLM for appropriate authorization under the regulations in 43 CFR Group 2900.


Sec. 3715.4-4  What if there is a dispute over the fee simple title to the lands on which my existing occupancy is located?</p><p class="depth0">BLM may defer a determination of concurrence or non-concurrence with your occupancy until the underlying fee simple title to the land has been finally determined by the Department of the Interior. During this time, your existing occupancy may continue, subject to Sec. 3715.5(a).</p>
