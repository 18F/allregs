                                Sec. 1003.207  Ineligible activities.

                            <p class="depth0">The general rule is that any activity that is not authorized under the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1003.201 through 1003.206 is ineligible to be assisted with ICDBG funds. This section identifies specific activities that are ineligible and provides guidance in determining the eligibility of other activities frequently associated with housing and community development.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Buildings or portions thereof used for the general conduct of government as defined at Sec. 1003.4 cannot be assisted with ICDBG funds. This does not include, however, the removal of architectural barriers under Sec. 1003.201(c) involving any such building. Also, where acquisition of real property includes an existing improvement which is to be used in the provision of a building for the general conduct of government, the portion of the acquisition cost attributable to the land is eligible, provided

such acquisition meets the primary objective described in Sec. 1003.208.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General government expenses. Except as otherwise specifically authorized in this subpart or under OMB Circular A-87, expenses required to carry out the regular responsibilities of the grantee are not eligible for assistance under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Political activities. ICDBG funds shall not be used to finance the use of facilities or equipment for political purposes or to engage in other partisan political activities, such as candidate forums, voter transportation, or voter registration. However, a facility originally assisted with ICDBG funds may be used on an incidental basis to hold political meetings, candidate forums, or voter registration campaigns, provided that all parties and organizations have access to the facility on an equal basis, and are assessed equal rent or use charges, if any.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The following activities may not be assisted with ICDBG funds unless authorized under provisions of Sec. 1003.203 or as otherwise specifically noted herein, or when carried out by a CBDO under the provisions of Sec. 1003.204.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purchase of equipment. The purchase of equipment with ICDBG funds is generally ineligible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Construction equipment. The purchase of construction equipment is ineligible, but compensation for the use of such equipment through leasing, depreciation, or use allowances pursuant to OMB Circular A-21, A-87 or A-122 as applicable for an otherwise eligible activity is an eligible use of ICDBG funds.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Furnishings and personal property. The purchase of equipment, fixtures, motor vehicles, furnishings, or other personal property not an integral structural fixture is generally ineligible. Exceptions to this general prohibition are set forth in Sec. 1003.201(o).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operating and maintenance expenses. The general rule is that any expense associated with repairing, operating or maintaining public facilities, improvements and services is ineligible. Specific exceptions to this general rule are operating and maintenance expenses associated with public service activities, interim assistance, and office space for program staff employed in carrying out the ICDBG program. For example, the use of ICDBG funds to pay the allocable costs of operating and maintaining a facility used in providing a public service would be eligible under Sec. 1003.201(e), even if no other costs of providing such a service are assisted with such funds. Examples of ineligible operating and maintenance expenses are:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Maintenance and repair of streets, parks, playgrounds, water and sewer facilities, neighborhood facilities, senior centers, centers for persons with a disability, parking and similar public facilities; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Payment of salaries for staff, utility costs and similar expenses necessary for the operation of public works and facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New housing construction. ICDBG funds may not be used for the construction of new permanent residential structures or for any program to subsidize or assist such new construction, except:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As provided under the last resort housing provisions set forth in 24 CFR part 42; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When carried out by a CBDO pursuant to Sec. 1003.204(a);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Income payments. The general rule is that ICDBG funds may not be used for income payments. For purposes of the ICDBG program, income payments means a series of subsistence-type grant payments made to an individual or family for items such as food, clothing, housing (rent or mortgage) or utilities, but excludes emergency payments made over a period of up to three months to the provider of such items or services on behalf of an individual or family.</p>
