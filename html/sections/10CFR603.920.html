                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination. A TIA must include the following conditions for termination:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An award may be terminated in whole or in part by the contracting officer, if a recipient materially fails to comply with the terms and conditions of the award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subject to a reasonable determination by either party that the project will not produce beneficial results commensurate with the expenditure of resources, that party may terminate in whole or in part the agreement by providing at least 30 days advance written notice to the other party, provided such notice is preceded by consultation between the parties. The two parties will negotiate the termination conditions, including the effective date and, in the case of partial termination, the portion to be terminated. If either party determines in the case of partial termination that the reduced or modified portion of the award will not accomplish the purpose for which the award was made, the award may be terminated in its entirety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of an expenditure based TIA, DOE's maximum liability is the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> DOE's share of allowable costs incurred up to the date of termination, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of DOE funds obligated to the TIA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unless otherwise negotiated, for terminations of a fixed-support based TIA, DOE shall pay the recipient a proportionate share of DOE's financial commitment to the project based on the percent of project completion as of the date of termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (3) and (4) of this section, if the award includes milestone payments, the Government has no obligation to pay the recipient beyond the last completed and paid milestone if the recipient decides to terminate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Enforcement. The standards of 10 CFR 600.352 (for enforcement) and the procedures in 10 CFR 600.22 (for disputes and appeals) apply.</p>
