This may be accomplished by adding the Type A article to a small quantity of feed, mixing thoroughly, then adding this mixture to the remaining feed and again mixing thoroughly. Dosage is 1 gram of poloxalene per 100 pounds of body weight daily and continued during exposure to bloat producing conditions. If bloating conditions are severe, the dose is doubled. Treatment should be started 2 to 3 days before exposure to bloat-producing conditions. Repeat dosage if animals are exposed to bloat-producing conditions more than 12 hours after the last treatment. Do not exceed the higher dosage levels in any 24-hour period.
