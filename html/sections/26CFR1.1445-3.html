                                Sec. 1.1445-3  Adjustments to amount required to be withheld pursuant
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> may be reduced or  eliminated pursuant to a withholding certificate issued by the Internal  Revenue Service in accordance with the rules of this section. A  withholding certificate may be issued by the Service in cases where  reduced withholding is appropriate (see paragraph (c) of this section),  where the transferor is exempt from U.S. tax (see paragraph (d) of this  section), or where an agreement for the payment of tax is entered into  with the Service (see paragraph (e) of this section). A withholding  certificate that is obtained prior to a transfer notifies the transferee  that no withholding is required. A withholding certificate that is  obtained after a transfer has been made may authorize a normal refund or  an early refund pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section. Either a  transferee or transferor may apply for a withholding certificate. The  Internal Revenue Service will act upon an application for a withholding  certificate not later than the 90th day after it is received. Solely for  this purpose (i.e., determining the day upon which the 90-day period  commences), an application is received by the Service on the date that  all information necessary for the Service to make a determination is  provided by the applicant. In no event, however, will a withholding  certificate be issued without the transferor's identifying number. (For  rules regarding whether an application for a withholding certificate has  been timely submitted, see Sec. 1.445-1(c)(2).) The Service may deny a  request for a withholding certificate where, after due notice, an  applicant fails to provide information necessary for the Service to make  a determination. The Service will act upon an application for an early  refund not later than the 90th day after it is received. An application  for an early refund must either (1) include a copy of a withholding  certificate issued by the Service with respect to the transaction or,  (2) be combined with an application for a withholding certificate. Where  an application for an early refund is combined with an application for a  withholding certificate, the Service will act upon both applications not  later than the 90th day after receipt. In the case of an application for  a certificate based on non-conforming secuirty under paragraph (e)(3)(v)  of this section, and in unusually complicated cases, the Service may be  unable to provide a final withholding certificate by the 90th day. In  such a case the Service will notify the applicant, by the 45th day after  receipt of the application, that additional processing time will be  necessary. The Service's notice may request additional information or  explanation concerning particular aspects of the application, and will  provide a target date for final action (contingent upon the  application's timely submission of any requested information). A  withholding certificate issued pursuant to the provisions of this  section serves to fulfill the requirements of section 1445(b)(4)  concerning qualifying statements, section 1445(c)(1) concerning the  transferor's maximum tax liability, or section 1445(c)(2) concerning the  Secretary's authority to prescribe reduced withholding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Applications for withholding certificates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An  application for a withholding certificate must be submitted to the  Director, Philadelphia Service Center, at the address provided in  Sec. 1.1445-1(g)(10). An application for a withholding certificate must  be signed by a responsible officer in the case of a corporation, by a  general partner in the case of a partnership, by a trustee, executor, or  equivalent fiduciary in the   case of a trust or estate, and in the case of an individual by the  individual himself. A duly authorized agent may sign the application but  the application must contain a valid power of attorney authorizing the  agent to sign the application on behalf of the applicant. The person  signing the application must verify under penalties of perjury that all  representations made in connection with the application are true,  correct, and complete to his knowledge and belief. No particular form is  required for an application, but the application must set forth the  information described in paragraphs (b), (2), (3), and (4), and to the  extent applicable, paragraph (b)(5) or (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Parties to the transaction. The application must set forth the  name, address, and identifying number of the person submitting the  application (specifying whether that person is the transferee or  transferor), and the name, address, and identifying number of other  parties to the transaction (specifying whether each such party is a  transferee or transferor). The Service will deny the application if  complete information, including the identifying numbers of all the  parties, is not provided. Thus, for example, the applicant should  determine if an identifying number exists for each party, and, if none  exists for a particular party, the applicant should notify the  particular party of the obligation to get an identifying number before  the application can be submitted to the Service. The address provided in  the case of an individual must be that individual's home address, and  the address provided in the case of an entity must be that entity's  office address. A mailing address may be provided in addition to, but  not in lieu of, a home address or office address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Real property interest to be transferred. The application must  set forth information concerning the U.S. real property interest with  respect to which the withholding certificate is sought, including the  type of interest, the contract price, and, in the case of an interest in  real property, its location and general description, or in the case of  an interest in a U.S. real property holding corporation, the class or  type and amount of the interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Basis for certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reduced withholding. If a withholding  certificate is sought on the basis of a claim that reduced withholding  in appropriate, the application must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A calculation of the maximum tax that may be imposed on the  disposition in accordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Such  calculation must be accompanied by a copy of the relevant contract and  depreciation schedules or other evidence that confirms the contract  price and adjusted basis of the property. If no depreciation schedules  are provided, the application must state the nature of the use of the  property and why depreciation was not allowable. Evidence that supports  any claimed adjustment to the maximum tax on the disposition must also  be provided;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A calculation of the transferor's unsatisfied withholding  liability, or evidence supporting the claim that no such liability  exists, in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> In the case of a request for a special reduction of withholding  pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a statement of law and  facts in support of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Exemption. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis  of the transferor's exemption from U.S. tax, the application must set  forth a brief statement of the law and facts that support the claimed  exemption. In this regard, see paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Agreement. If a withholding certificate is sought on the basis  of an agreement for the payment of tax, the application must include a  signed copy of the agreement proposed by the applicant and a copy of the  security instrument (if any) proposed by the applicant. In this regard,  see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rule for exclusions from income under section 121. A  withholding certificate may be sought on the basis of a section 121  exclusion as a reduction in the amount of tax due under paragraph  (c)(2)(v) of this section. The application must include information  establishing that the transferor, who is   a nonresident alien individual at the time of the sale (and is therefore  subject to sections 897 and 1445) is entitled to claim the benefits of  section 121. For example, a claim for reduced withholding as a result of  section 121 must include information that the transferor occupied the  U.S. real property interest as his or her personal residence for the  required period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Special rule for like-kind exchanges under Section 1031. A  withholding certificate may be requested with respect to a like-kind  exchange under section 1031 as a transaction subject to a nonrecognition  provision under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. The application  must include information substantiating the requirements of section  1031. The IRS may require additional information during the course of  the application process to determine that the requirements of section  1031 are satisfied. In the case of a deferred like-kind exchange, the  withholding agent is excused from reporting and paying the withholding  tax to the IRS within 20 days after the transfer only if an application  for a withholding certificate is submitted prior to or on the date of  transfer. See Sec. 1.1445-1(c)(2) for rules concerning delayed reporting  and payment where an application for a withholding certificate has been  submitted to the IRS prior to or on the date of transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment of amount required to be withheld--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  The Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding certificate that  excuses withholding or that permits the transferee to withhold an  adjusted amount reflecting the transferor's maximum tax liability. The  transferor's maximum tax liability is the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum amount which could be imposed as tax under section  871 or 882 upon the transferor's disposition of the subject real  property interest, as determined under paragraph (c)(2) of this section,  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability with respect  to the subject real property interest, as determined under paragraph  (c)(3) of this section.  In addition, the Internal Revenue Service may issue a withholding  certificate that permits the transferee to withhold a reduced amount if  the Service determines pursuant to paragraph (c)(4) of this section that  reduced withholding will not jeopardize the collection of tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maximum tax imposed on disposition. The first element of the  transferor's maximum tax liability is the maximum amount which the  transferor could be required to pay as tax upon the disposition of the  subject real property interest. In the case of an individual transferor  that amount will generally be the contract price of the property minus  its adjusted basis, multiplied by the maximum individual income tax rate  applicable to long term capital gain. In the case of a corporate  transferor, that amount will generally be the contract price of the  property minus its adjusted basis, multiplied by the maximum corporate  income tax rate applicable to long term capital gain. However, that  amount must be adjusted to take into account the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any reduction of tax to which the transferor is entitled under  the provisions of a U.S. income tax treaty;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The effect of any nonrecognition provision that is applicable  to the transaction;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any losses realized and recognized upon the previous  disposition of U.S. real property interests during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any amount that is required to be treated as ordinary income;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Any other factor that may increase or reduce the tax upon the  disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  The second element of the transferor's maximum tax liability is the  transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability. That liability is the  amount of any tax that the transferor was required to but did not  withhold and pay over under section 1445 upon the acquisition of the  subject U.S. real property interest or a predecessor interest. The  transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability is included in the  calculation of maximum tax liability so that such prior withholding  liability can be satisfied by the transferee's withholding upon the  current transfer. Alternatively, the transferor's unsatisfied  withholding liability may   be disregarded for purposes of calculating the maximum tax liability, if  either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such prior withholding liability is fully satisfied by a payment  that is made with the application submitted pursuant to this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An agreement is entered into for the payment of that liability  pursuant to the rules of paragraph (e) of this section.   Because section 1445 only requires withholding after December 31, 1984,  no transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability can exist unless the  transferor acquired the subject or predecessor real property interest  after that date. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a predecessor  interest is one that was exchanged for the subject U.S. real property  interest in a transaction in which the transferor was not required to  recognize the full amount of the gain or loss realized upon the  transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Evidence that no unsatisfied withholding liability exists. For  purposes of paragraph (b)(4)(i)(B) of this section (concerning  information that must be submitted with an application for a withholding  certificate), evidence that the transferor has no unsatisfied  withholding liability includes any one of the following documents:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Evidence that the transferor acquired the subject or predecessor  real property interest prior to January 1, 1985;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A copy of the Form 8288 that was filed by the transferor, and  proof of payment of the amount shown due thereon, with respect to the  transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property  interest;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A copy of a withholding certificate with respect to the  transferor's acquisition of the subject or predecessor real property  interest, plus a copy of Form 8288 and proof of payment with respect to  any withholding required under that certificate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A copy of the non-foreign certification furnished by the person  from whom the subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest was  acquired, executed at the time of that acquisition;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Evidence that the transferor purchased the subject or  predecessor real property for $300,000 or less, and a statement signed  by the transferor under penalties of perjury, that the transferor  purchased the property for use as a residence within the meaning of  Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Evidence that the person from whom the transferor acquired the  subject or predecessor U.S. real property interest fully paid any tax  imposed on that transaction pursuant to section 897.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A copy of a notice of nonrecognition treatment provided to the  transferor pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-2(d)(2) by person from whom the  transferor acquired the subject or predecessor U.S. real property  interest; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> A statement, signed by the transferor under penalties of  perjury, setting forth the facts and circumstances that supported the  transferor's conclusion that no withholding was required under section  1445(a) with respect to the transferor's acquisition of the subject or  predecessor real property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(i)(C)</em> of this section to submit a statement of law and  facts in support of the request. That statement must explain why the  transferor is unable to enter into an agreement for the payment of tax  pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Transferor's exemption from U.S. tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The  Internal Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that  excuses all withholding by a transferee if it is established that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor's gain from the disposition of the subject U.S.  real property interest will be exempt from U.S. tax, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor has no unsatisfied withholding liability.  For the available exemptions, see paragraph (d)(2) of this section. The  transferor's unsatisfied withholding liability shall be determined in  accordance with the provisions of paragraph (c)(3) of   this section. A transferor that is entitled to a reduction of (rather  than an exemption from) U.S. tax may obtain a withholding certificate to  that effect pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Available exemptions. A transferor's gain from the disposition  of a U.S. real property interest may be exempt from U.S. tax because  either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The transferor is an integral part or controlled entity of a  foreign government and the disposition of the subject property is not a  commercial activity, as determined pursuant to section 892 and the  regulations thereunder; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transferor is entitled to the benefits of an income tax  treaty that provides for such an exemption (subject to the limitations  imposed by section 1125(c) of Pub. L. 96-499, which, in general,  overrides such benefits as of January 1, 1985).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Agreement for the payment of tax--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Internal  Revenue Service will issue a withholding certificate that excuses  withholding or that permits a transferee to withhold a reduced amount,  if either the transferee or the transferor enters into an agreement for  the payment of tax pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e). An  agreement for the payment of tax is a contract between the Service and  any other person that consists of two necessary elements. Those elements  are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A contract between the Service and the other person, setting  forth in detail the rights and obligations of each; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A security instrument or other form of security acceptable to  the Director, Foreign Operations District.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contents of agreement--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An agreement for the  payment of tax must cover an amount described in subdivision (ii) or  (iii) of this paragraph (e)(2). The agreement may either provide  adequate security for the payment of the chosen amount in accordance  with paragraph (e)(3) of this section, or provide for the payment of  that amount through a combination of security and withholding of tax by  the transferee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tax that would otherwise be withheld. An agreement for the  payment of tax may cover the amount of tax that would otherwise be  required to be withheld pursuant to section 1445(a). In addition to the  amount computed pursuant to section 1445(a), the applicant must agree to  pay interest upon that amount, at the rate established under section  6621, with respect to the period between the date on which the tax  imposed by section 1445(a) would otherwise be due (i.e., the 20th day  after the date of transfer) and the date on which the transferor's  payment of tax with respect to the disposition will be due under the  agreement. The amount of interest agreed upon must be paid by the  applicant regardless of whether or not the Service is required to draw  upon any security provided pursuant to the agreement. The interest may  be paid either with the return or by the Service drawing upon the  security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Maximum tax liability. An agreement for the payment of tax may  cover the transferor's maximum tax liability, determined in accordance  with paragraph (c) of this section. The agreement must also provide for  the payment of an additional amount equal to 25 percent of the amount  determined under paragraph (c) of this section. This additional amount  secures the interest and penalties that would accrue between the date of  a failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the disposition,  and the date on which the Service collects upon that liability pursuant  to the agreement. Such additional amount will only be collected if the  Service finds it necessary to draw upon any security provided due to the  transferor's failure to file a return and pay tax with respect to the  relevant disposition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Major types of security--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The following are the  major types of security acceptable to the Service. Further details with  respect to the terms and conditions of each type may be specified by  Revenue Procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bond with surety or guarantor. The Service may accept as  security with respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is  executed with a satisfactory surety or guarantor. Only the following  persons may act as surety or guarantor for this purpose</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A surety company holding a certificate of authority from the  Secretary as an acceptable surety on Federal bonds, as listed in  Treasury Department Circular No. 570, published annually in the Federal  Register on the first working day of July;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A person that is engaged within or without the United States in  the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the  principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5), and that is subject to U.S. or foreign  local or national regulation of such business, if that person is  otherwise acceptable to the Service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A person that is engaged within or without the United States in  the conduct of an insurance business that is subject to U.S. or foreign  local or national regulation, if that person is otherwise acceptable to  the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Bond with collateral. The Service may accept as security with  respect to a transferor's tax liability a bond that is secured by  acceptable collateral. All collateral must be deposited with a  responsible financial institution acting as escrow agent, or, in the  Service's discretion, with the Service. Only the following types of  collateral are acceptable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Bonds, notes, or other public debt obligations of the United  States, in accordance with the rules of 31 CFR part 225; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A certified cashier's, or treasurer's check, drawn on an entity  acceptable to the Service that is engaged within or without the United  States in the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under  the principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or  foreign local or national regulation of such business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Letter of credit. The Service may accept as security with  respect to a transferor's tax liability an irrevocable letter of credit.  The Service may accept a letter of credit issued by an entity acceptable  to the Service that is engaged within or without the United States in  the conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business under the  principles of Sec. 1.864-4(c)(5) and that is subject to U.S. or foreign  local or national regulation of such business. However, the Director  will accept a letter of credit from an entity that is not engaged in  trade or business in the United States only if such letter may be drawn  on an advising bank within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Guarantees and other non-conforming security--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Guarantee. The  Service may in its discretion accept as security with respect to a  transferor's tax liability the applicant's guarantee that it will pay  such liability. The Service will in general accept such a guarantee only  from a corporation, foreign or domestic, any class of stock of which is  regularly traded on an established securities market on the date of the  transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Other forms of security. The Service may in unusual  circumstances and at its discretion accept any form of security that if  finds to be adequate. An application for a withholding certificate that  proposes a form of security that does not conform with any of the  preferred types set forth in paragraph (e)(3) (ii) through (iv) of this  section or any relevant Revenue Procedure must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A detailed statement of the facts and circumstances supporting  the use of the proposed form of security, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A memorandum of law concerning the validity and enforceability  of the proposed form of security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Terms of security instrument. Any security instrument that is  furnished pursuant to this section must provide that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of each deposit of estimated tax that will be  required with respect to the gain realized on the subject disposition  may be collected by levy upon the security as of the date following the  date on which each such deposit is due (unless such deposit is timely  made);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The entire amount of the liability may be collected by levy  upon the security at any time during the nine months following the date  on which the payment of tax with respect to the subject disposition is  due, subject to release of the security upon the full payment of the tax  and any interest and penalties due. If the transferor requests an  extension of time to file a return with respect to the disposition, then  the Director may require that the term of the security instrument be  extended until the date that is nine   months after the filing deadline as extended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(3)</em> and must be signed and  accompanied by a penalties of perjury statement in accordance with  Sec. 1.1445-3(b)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Extension of time for the Service to process requests for  withholding certificates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If an amending statement is  submitted, the time in which the Internal Revenue Service must act upon  the amended application shall be extended by 30 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial amendments. If an amending statement is submitted  and the Service finds that the statement substantially amends the facts  of the underlying application or substantially alters the terms of the  withholding certificate as requested in the initial application, the  time within which the Service must act upon the amended application  shall be extended by 60 days. The applicant shall be so notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Amending statement received after the requested withholding  certificate has been signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service  Center. If an amending statement is received after the withholding  certificate, drafted in response to the underlying application, has been  signed by the Director, Philadelphia Service Center or his delegate and  prior to the day such certificate is mailed to the applicant, the time  in which the Service must act upon the amended application shall be  extended by 90 days. The applicant will be so notified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Information required to be submitted. No particular form is  required for an amending statement but the statement must provide the  following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identification of applicant. The amending statement must set  forth the name, address and identifying number of the person submitting  the amending statement (specifying whether that person is the transferee  or transferor).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Date of underlying application. The amending statement must set  forth the date of the underlying application for a withholding  certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Real property interest to be (or that has been) transferred.  The amending statement must set forth a brief description of the real  property interest with respect to which the underlying application for a  withholding certificate was submitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amending information. The amending statement must fully set  forth the basis for the amendment including any modification of the  facts supporting the application for a withholding certificate and any  change sought in the terms of the withholding certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(10)</em>. No particular form is required for the  application, but the following information must be set forth in separate  paragraphs numbered to correspond with the number given below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and identifying number of the transferor seeking  the refund;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Amount required to be withheld pursuant to the withholding  certificate issued by Internal Revenue Service;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amount withheld by the transferee (attach a copy of Form 8288-A  stamped by IRS pursuant to Sec. 1.1445-1(c));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Amount to be refunded to the transferor. An application for an  early refund cannot be processed unless the   required copy of Form 8288-A (or substantial evidence of the amount  withheld in the case of a failure to receive Form 8288-A as provided in  Sec. 1.1445-1(f)(3)) is attached to the application. If an application  for a withholding certificate based upon the transferor's maximum tax  liability is submitted after the transfer takes place, then that  application may be combined with an application for an early refund. The  Service will act upon a claim for refund within the time limits set  forth in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Effective date for taxpayer identification numbers. The  requirement in paragraphs (b)(2), (f)(3)(i), and (g)(1) of this section  that taxpayer identification numbers be provided (in all cases) is  applicable for dispositions of U.S. real property interests occurring  after November 3, 2003.
