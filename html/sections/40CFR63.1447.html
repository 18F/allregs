                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As required by Sec. 63.6(e)(1)(i), you must always operate and maintain your affected source, including air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner consistent with good air pollution control practices for minimizing emissions at least to the levels required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> You must prepare and operate at all times according to a written operation and maintenance plan for each capture system and control device subject to standards in Sec. 63.1444 or Sec. 63.1446. The plan must address the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) through (3) of this section as applicable to the capture system or control device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preventative maintenance. You must perform preventative maintenance for each capture system and control device according to written procedures specified in your operation and maintenance plan. The procedures must include a preventative maintenance schedule that is consistent with the manufacturer's instructions for routine and long-term maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Capture system inspections. You must conduct monthly inspections of the equipment components of the capture system that can affect the performance of the system to collect the gases and fumes emitted from the affected source (e.g., hoods, exposed ductwork, dampers, fans) according to written procedures specified in your operation and maintenance plan. The inspection procedure must include the requirements in paragraphs (b)(2)(i) through (iii) of this section as applicable to the capture system or control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Observations of the physical appearance of the equipment to confirm the physical integrity of the equipment (e.g., verify by visual inspection no holes in ductwork or hoods, no flow constrictions caused by dents, or accumulated dust in ductwork).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Inspection, and if necessary testing, of equipment components to confirm that the component is operating as intended (e.g., verify by appropriate measures that flow or pressure sensors,

damper plates, automated damper switches and motors are operating according to manufacture or engineering design specifications).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the event that a defective or damaged component is detected during an inspection, you must initiate corrective action according to written procedures specified in your operation and maintenance plan to correct the defect or deficiency as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Copper converter department capture system operating limits. You must establish, according to the requirements in paragraph (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section, operating limits for the capture system that are representative and reliable indicators of the performance of capture system when it is used to collect the process off-gas vented from batch copper converters during blowing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Select operating limit parameters appropriate for the capture system design that are representative and reliable indicators of the performance of the capture system when it is used to collect the process off-gas vented from batch copper converters during blowing. At a minimum, you must use appropriate operating limit parameters that indicate the level of the ventilation draft and the damper position settings for the capture system when operating to collect the process off-gas from the batch copper converters during blowing. Appropriate operating limit parameters for ventilation draft include, but are not limited to, volumetric flow rate through each separately ducted hood, total volumetric flow rate at the inlet to control device to which the capture system is vented, fan motor amperage, or static pressure. Any parameter for damper position setting may be used that indicates the duct damper position relative to the fully open setting.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each operating limit parameter selected in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during batch copper converter blowing. If your blister copper production operations allow for more than one batch copper converter to be operating simultaneously in the blowing mode, designate the value or setting for the parameter at which the capture system operates during each possible batch copper converter blowing configuration that you may operate at your smelter (i.e., the operating limits with one converter blowing, with two converters blowing, with three converters blowing, as applicable to your smelter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Include documentation in the plan to support your selection of the operating limits established for the capture system. This documentation must include a description of the capture system design, a description of the capture system operation during blister copper production, a description of each selected operating limit parameter, a rationale for why you chose the parameter, a description of the method used to monitor the parameter according to the requirements in Sec. 63.1452(a), and the data used to set the value or setting for the parameter for each of your batch copper converter configurations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Baghouse leak detection corrective actions. In the event a bag leak detection system alarm is triggered, you must initiate corrective action according to written procedures specified in your operation and maintenance plan to determine the cause of the alarm within 1 hour of the alarm, initiate corrective action to correct the cause of the problem within 24 hours of the alarm, and complete the corrective action as soon as practicable. Corrective actions may include, but are not limited to, the activities listed in paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Inspecting the baghouse for air leaks, torn or broken bags or filter media, or any other condition that may cause an increase in emissions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sealing off defective bags or filter media.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Replacing defective bags or filter media or otherwise repairing the control device.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Sealing off a defective baghouse compartment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Cleaning the bag leak detection system probe, or otherwise repair the bag leak detection system.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Shutting down the process producing the particulate emissions.</p><p class="depth4">General Compliance Requirements</p>
