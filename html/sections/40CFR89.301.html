                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes the equipment required in order to perform exhaust emission tests on new nonroad compression-ignition engines subject to the provisions of subpart B of part 89.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust gases, either raw or dilute, are sampled while the test engine is operated using an 8-mode test cycle on an engine dynamometer. The exhaust gases receive specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant, exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode. Emission is reported as grams per kilowatt hour (g/kw-hr). See subpart E of this part for a complete description of the test procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General equipment and calibration requirements are given in Sec. 89.304 through 89.324. Sections 89.325 through 89.331 set forth general test specifications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Additional information about system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065. Examples for system design, calibration methodologies, and so forth, for dilute exhaust gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065.
