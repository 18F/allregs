One or more judges shall act as official counters and two or more clerks shall record the value of each vote and shall comprise a vote tallying team.

All ballots and mutilated ballots; registration lists of voters, both absentee and those appearing at the poll; all tally sheets; and all other election materials shall be placed in the ballot box which shall be locked. The supervisor shall then deliver the locked ballot box and keys to same to the Superintendent, Osage Agency, and the box shall be retained in a safe place until opened by order of the supervisor or election board in the event a contest is filed.

Absentee ballots shall be declared void when items other than the ballot are enclosed in the inner envelope, the voter fails to sign the statement appearing on the outer envelope, and for failure to seal the inner envelope or enclose the inner envelope in the outer envelope. Votes cast for individuals whose names are not printed on the official ballot shall not be counted.
