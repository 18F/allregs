                                Sec. 33.407  How long do MBE and WBE fair share objectives remain
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Once MBE and WBE fair share objectives have been negotiated, they  will remain in effect for three fiscal years unless there are  significant changes to the data supporting the fair share objectives.  The fact that a disparity study utilized in negotiating fair share  objectives has become more than ten years old during the three-year  period does not by itself constitute a significant change requiring  renegotiation.</p>
