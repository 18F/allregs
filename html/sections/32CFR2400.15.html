                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OSTP shall issue and maintain classification guides to  facilitate the proper and uniform derivative classification of  information. These guides shall be used to direct derivative  classification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The classification guides shall be approved, in writing, by the  Director or by officials having Top Secret original   classification authority. Such approval constitutes an original  classification decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each classification guide shall specify the information subject  to classification in sufficient detail to permit its ready and uniform  identification and categorization and shall set forth the classification  level and duration in each instance. Additionally, each classification  guide shall prescribe declassification instructions for each element of  information in terms of (1) a period of time, (2) the occurrence of an  event, or (3) a notation that the information shall not be automatically  declassified without the approval of OSTP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The classification guides shall be kept current and shall be  fully reviewed at least every two years. The Executive Director, OSTP  shall maintain a list of all OSTP classification guides in current use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Executive Director, OSTP shall receive and maintain the  record copy of all approved classification guides and changes thereto.  He will assist the originator in determining the required distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director may, for good cause, grant and revoke waivers of  the requirement to prepare classification guides for specified classes  of documents or information. The Director of the Information Security  Oversight Office shall be notified of any waivers. The Director's  decision to waive the requirement to issue classification guides for  specific classes of documents or information will be based, at a  minimum, on an evaluation of the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ability to segregate and describe the elements of  information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The practicality of producing or disseminating the guide because  of the nature of the information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The anticipated usage of the guide as a basis for derivative  classification; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The availability of alternative sources for derivatively  classifying the information in a uniform manner.</p>
