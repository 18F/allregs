                            <p class="depth0">Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as possible, the administrative law judge shall render his decision or recommended decision, as the case may be. All decisions shall become a part of the record and, if proposed findings and conclusions have been filed, shall show the administrative law judge's ruling upon each of such proposed findings and conclusions. Decisions shall consist of (a) a brief statement of the issues of fact involved in the proceeding; (b) the administrative law judge's findings and conclusions, as well as the reasons or basis therefor with record references, upon all the material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record (including, when appropriate, comment as to the credibility and demeanor of the witnesses); and (c) the administrative law judge's determination or recommended determination on the record. Where the administrative law judge determines that the imposition of a period of suspension of the permit is appropriate, his decision shall state the length of such period of suspension, to commence at such time as the appropriate TTB officer shall specify.
