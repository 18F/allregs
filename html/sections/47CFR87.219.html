The  original or a copy of the letter of agreement must be kept with each  licensees' station records. Within 90 days of the date upon which a new  unicom operator is licensed at an airport where more than one unicom is  authorized, and an automated unicom is being operated, an amended letter  of agreement   that includes the new licensee's signature must be signed or automated  unicom operations must cease.
