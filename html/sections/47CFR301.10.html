                            <p class="depth0">The Manual of Regulations and Procedures for Federal Radio Frequency Management (hereinafter referred to as the ``NTIA Manual'') issued by the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information, is incorporated by reference in Sec. 300.1 of this chapter and available online at http://www.ntia.doc.gov/osmhome/redbook/redbook.html. Annex O of the NTIA Manual, as revised, contains information, policies and procedures applicable to Federal agencies that implement the statutory provisions referenced in Sec. 301.1 of this subpart with regard to such agencies that operate authorized U.S. Government stations in Eligible Frequencies and that incur relocation costs or sharing costs because of planning for an auction or the reallocation of such frequencies from Federal use to exclusive non-Federal use or to shared use. The NTIA Manual applies only to Federal agencies and does not impact the rights or obligations of the public. Accordingly, this cross reference is for information purposes only.</p>
