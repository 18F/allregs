                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility for bidding. An applicant may submit a bid to become  a Part D plan sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bid submission--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Not later than the first Monday in  June, each potential Part D sponsor must submit bids and supplemental  information described in this section for each Part D plan it intends to  offer in the subsequent calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Substantial differences between bids. Potential Part D sponsors'  bid submissions must reflect differences in benefit packages or plan  costs that CMS determines to represent substantial differences relative  to a sponsor's other bid submissions. In order to be considered  ``substantially different,'' each bid must be significantly different  from the sponsor's other bids with respect to beneficiary out-of-pocket  costs or formulary structures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> CMS may decline to accept any or every bid submitted by a Part D  sponsor or potential Part D sponsor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Basic rule for bid. Each potential Part D sponsor must submit a  bid and supplemental information in a format to be specified by CMS for  each Part D plan it offers. Each bid must reflect a uniform benefit  package, including premium (except as provided for the late enrollment  penalty described in Sec. 423.286(d)(3)) and all applicable cost  sharing, for all individuals enrolled in the plan. Each bid must reflect  the applicant's estimate of its average monthly revenue requirements to  provide qualified prescription drug coverage (including any supplemental  coverage) for a Part D eligible individual with a national average risk  profile for the factors described in Sec. 423.329(b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Included costs. The bid includes costs (including administrative  costs and return on investment/profit) for which the plan is responsible  in providing basic and supplemental benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Excluded costs. The bid does not include costs associated with  payments by the enrollee for deductible, co-payments, coinsurance, and  liability above the plan allowance in the case of out-of-network claims,  payments projected to be made by CMS for reinsurance, or any other costs  for which the sponsor is not responsible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actuarial valuation. The bid must be prepared in accordance with  CMS actuarial guidelines based on generally accepted actuarial  principles. A qualified actuary must certify the plan's actuarial  valuation (which may be prepared by others under his or her direction or  review), and must be a member of the American Academy of Actuaries to be  deemed qualified. Applicants may use qualified outside actuaries to  prepare their bids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Specific requirements for bids. The bid and supplemental  information submission must include the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Coverage. A description of the coverage to be provided under the  plan, including any supplemental coverage and the deductible and other  cost sharing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actuarial value of bid components. The applicant must provide  the following information on bid components, as well as actuarial  certification that the values are calculated according to CMS guidelines  on actuarial valuation, including adjustment for the effect that  providing alternative prescription drug coverage (rather than defined  standard prescription drug coverage) has on drug utilization, if  applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actuarial value of the qualified prescription drug coverage  to be offered under each plan for a Part D eligible individual with a  national average risk profile for the factors described in  Sec. 423.329(b)(1) and the basis for the estimate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The portion of the bid attributable to basic prescription drug  coverage and the portion (if any) attributable to supplemental benefits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The assumptions regarding reinsurance amounts payable under  Sec. 423.329(c) used in calculating the bid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The assumptions regarding low-income cost-sharing payable under  Sec. 423.329(d) used in calculating the bid.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The amount of administrative costs and return on investment or  profit included in the bid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service area. A description of the service area of the plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Level of risk assumed. For a potential Part D sponsor, the level  of risk assumed in the bid specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Plan Average Risk Score. An estimate of the plan's average  prescription drug risk score (as established under Sec. 423.329(b)) for  all projected enrollees for purposes of risk adjusting any supplemental  premium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Additional information. Additional information CMS requests to  support bid amounts and facilitate negotiation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rule for PDP sponsors. Bids for all plans offered by a  potential PDP sponsor in a region, but not those of potential MA  organizations offering MA-PD plans, PACE organizations offering PACE  plans including qualified prescription drug coverage, and cost-based  HMOs or CMPs offering section 1876 cost plans including qualified  prescription drug coverage, may include a uniform modification of the  amount of risk assumed (based on a process to be specified) as described  in one or more of the following paragraphs. Any such modification  applies to all plans offered by the PDP sponsor in a PDP region.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Increase in Federal percentage assumed in initial risk corridor.  An equal percentage point increase in the percents applied for costs  between the first and second threshold limits under  Sec. 423.336(b)(2)(i) and (b)(2)(ii)(A) and Sec. 423.336 (b)(3)(i) and  (b)(3)(ii)(A). This provision does not affect the application of a  higher percentage for plans in 2006 or 2007 under  Sec. 423.336(b)(2)(iii).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)(B)</em> and  (b)(3)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decrease in size of risk corridors. A decrease in the size of  the risk corridors by means of reductions in the threshold risk  percentages specified in Sec. 423.336(a)(2)(ii)(A) and/or (a)(2)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Special rule for fallback prescription drug plans. Fallback  prescription drug plan bids are not subject to the rules in this  section. They must follow requirements specified in Sec. 423.863.  [70 FR 4525, Jan. 28, 2005, as amended at 75 FR 19818, Apr. 15, 2010; 76  FR 21573, Apr. 15, 2011]</p>
