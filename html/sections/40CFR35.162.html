                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allotments. Each fiscal year funds appropriated for Water  Pollution Control grants to State and interstate agencies will be  allotted to States and interstate agencies on the basis of the extent of  the pollution problems in the respective States. A portion of the funds  appropriated for States under the Water Pollution Control grant program  will be set aside for allotment to eligible interstate agencies. The  interstate allotment will be 2.6 percent of the funds available under  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> State allotment formula. The Water Pollution Control State grant  allotment formula establishes an allotment ratio for each State based on  six components selected to reflect the extent of the water pollution  problem in the respective States. The formula provides a funding floor  for each State with provisions for periodic adjustments for inflation  and a maximum funding level (150 percent of its previous fiscal year  allotment).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Components and component weights--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Components. The six  components used in the Water Pollution Control State grant allotment  formula are: Surface Water Area; Ground Water Use; Water Quality  Impairment; Point Sources; Nonpoint Sources; and Population of Urbanized  Area. The components for the formula are presented in Table 1 of this  section, with their associated elements, sub-elements, and supporting  data sources.   [GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Component weights. To account for the fact that not all of the  selected formula components contribute equally to the extent of the  pollution problem within the States, each formula component is weighted  individually. Final component weights will be phased-in by Fiscal Year  (FY) 2004, according to the schedule presented in Table 2 of this  section:</p><p class="depth4">Table 2--Component Weights in the Water Pollution Control State Grant</p><p class="depth4">Allotment Formula ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">FY 2000   FY2001-FY2003   FY2004+</p><p class="depth4">Component               (percent)    (percent)    (percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Surface Water Area.................         13          13           12 Ground Water Use...................         11          12           12 Water Quality Impairment...........         13          25           35 Point Sources......................         25          17           13 Nonpoint Sources...................         18          15           13 Population of Urbanized Area.......         20          18           15</p><p class="depth4">------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Total..........................        100         100          100 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funding floor. A funding floor is established for each State.  Each State's funding floor will be at least equal to its FY 2000  allotment in all future years unless the funds appropriated for States  under the Water Pollution Control grant program decrease from the FY  2000 amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Funding decrease. If the appropriation for Water Pollution  Control State grants decreases in future years, the funding floor will  be disregarded and all State allotments will be reduced by an equal  percentage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inflation adjustment. Funding floors for each State will be  adjusted for inflation when the funds appropriated for Water Pollution  Control State grants increase from the preceding fiscal year. These  adjustments will be made on the basis of the cumulative change in the  Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S. Department of Labor,  since the most recent year in which Water Pollution Control State grant  funding last increased. Inflation adjustments to State funding floors  will be capped at the lesser of the percentage change in appropriated  funds or the cumulative percentage change in the inflation rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cap on annual funding increases. The maximum allotment to any  State will be 150 percent of that State's allotment for the previous  fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Cap on component ratio. A component ratio is equal to each  State's share of the national total of a single component. The cap on  each of the six State formula components ratios is 10 percent. If a  State's calculated component ratio for a particular component exceeds  the 10 percent cap, the State will instead be assigned 10 percent for  that component. The component ratios for all other States will be  adjusted accordingly.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Update cycle. The data used in the State formula will be  periodically updated. The first update will impact allotments for FY  2001, and will consist of updating the data used to support the Water  Quality Impairment component of the formula. These data will be updated  using the currently available Clean Water Act section 305(b) reports.  After this initial update, the data used to support all six components  of the Water Pollution Control State grant allotment formula will be  updated in FY 2003 (for use in the determination of FY 2004 allotments).  Thereafter, all data will be updated every five years (e.g., in FY 2008  for FY 2009 allotments and in FY 2013 for FY 2014 allotments.) There  will be an annual adjustment to the funding floor for all States, based  on the appropriation for Water Pollution Control State grants and  changes in the CPI.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interstate allotment formula. EPA will set-aside 2.6 percent of  the funds appropriated for the Water Pollution Control State grant  program for interstate agencies. The interstate agency Water Pollution  Control grant allotment formula consists of two parts: a funding floor  with provisions for periodic adjustments for inflation, and a variable  allotment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Funding Floor. A funding floor is established for each  interstate agency. Each interstate's funding floor for FY 2005 will be  at least equal to its FY 2003 allotment. Beginning in FY 2006, the  interstate funding floor will ensure that unless there is a decrease in  the CWA section 106 state appropriation, each interstate will receive at  a minimum, the same level of funding received in the previous fiscal  year. The funding floor for each interstate agency will be adjusted for  inflation when the funds appropriated for states under the Water  Pollution Control State grant program increase from the preceding fiscal  year. These adjustments will be made on the basis of the cumulative  change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), published by the U.S.  Department of Labor, since the most recent year in which Water Pollution  Control State grant funding increased. Inflation adjustments to the  interstate   agency funding floor will be capped at the lesser of the percentage of  change in appropriated funds or the cumulative percentage change in the  inflation rate. If the appropriation for states under the Water  Pollution Control State grant program decreases in future years, the  funding floor will be disregarded and all interstate agency allotments  will be reduced by an equal percentage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Variable allotment. The variable allotment provides for funds to  be distributed to interstate agencies on the basis of the extent of the  pollution problems in the respective States. Funds not allotted under  the base allotment will be allotted to eligible interstate agencies  based on each interstate agency's share of their member States' Water  Pollution Control grant formula allotment ratios. Updates of the data  for the six components of the Water Pollution Control State grant  allocation formula will automatically result in corresponding updates to  the variable allotment portion of the interstate allotments. The  allotment ratios for those States involved in compacts with more than  one interstate agency will be allocated among such interstate agencies  based on the percentage of each State's territory that is situated  within the drainage basin or watershed area covered by each compact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Alternative allotment formula. Notwithstanding paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section, if the Administrator determines that a portion  of the funds appropriated under the Water Pollution Control grant  program should be allotted for specific water pollution control  elements, the Administrator may allot those funds to States and  interstate agencies in accordance with a formula determined by him after  consultation with the respective States and interstate agencies. The  Administrator will make this determination under this paragraph only if  EPA's appropriation process indicates that these funds should be used  for this purpose.
