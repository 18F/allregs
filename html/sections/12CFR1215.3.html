Confidential supervisory information is used in part 1215 to refer to the distinct category of information defined in Sec. 1215.3. FHFA used the word ``confidential''

within the label for this category of information simply to be consistent with the manner in which federal banking agencies refer to similar or identical types of information.</p><p class="depth0">Demand means a subpoena, or an order or other command of a court or other competent authority, for the production of records, information, or testimony that is issued in a legal proceeding.</p><p class="depth0">Employee means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Any current or former officer or employee of FHFA or of FHFA-OIG;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Any other individual hired through contractual agreement by or on behalf of FHFA who has performed or is performing services under such an agreement for FHFA; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Any individual who has served or is serving in any consulting or advisory capacity to FHFA, whether formal or informal.</p><p class="depth0">Federal Home Loan Bank means a bank established under the authority of 12 U.S.C. 1423(a).</p><p class="depth0">FHFA means the Federal Housing Finance Agency including the FHFA-OIG.</p><p class="depth0">FHFA Counsel means an attorney in FHFA's Office of General Counsel.</p><p class="depth0">General Counsel means FHFA's General Counsel or a person within FHFA's Office of General Counsel to whom the General Counsel has delegated responsibilities under this part.</p><p class="depth0">Legal proceeding means any matter before a court of law, administrative board or tribunal, commission, administrative law judge, hearing officer, or other body that conducts a legal or administrative proceeding. Legal proceeding includes all phases of litigation.</p><p class="depth0">Produce means provide, disclose, expose, or grant access to.</p><p class="depth0">Records or information means, regardless of the person or entity in possession:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> All documents and materials that are FHFA agency records under the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> All other documents and materials contained in FHFA files; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> All other information or materials acquired by an FHFA employee in the performance of his or her official duties or because of his or her official status, including confidential supervisory information.</p><p class="depth0">Regulated entity has the same meaning as set forth in 12 U.S.C. 4502(20).
