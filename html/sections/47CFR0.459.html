                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Procedures applicable to filings in non-electronic  proceedings. Any person submitting information or materials to the  Commission may submit therewith a request that such information not be  made routinely available for public inspection. (If the materials are  specifically listed in Sec. 0.457, such a request is unnecessary.) A  copy of the request shall be attached to and shall cover all of the  materials to which it applies and all copies of those materials. If  feasible, the materials to which the request applies shall be physically  separated from any materials to which the request does not apply; if  this is not feasible, the portion of the materials to which the request  applies shall be identified. In the latter circumstance, where  confidential treatment is sought only for a portion of a document, the  person submitting the document shall submit a redacted version for the  public file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Procedures applicable to filings in electronic proceedings. In  proceedings to which the electronic filing requirements set forth in  Sec. 1.49(f) of this chapter apply, a party seeking confidential  treatment of a portion of a filing must submit in electronic format  either a redacted version of the document or an affidavit that it is  impossible to submit a redacted document consistent with the filing  requirements of this section. Where a party demonstrates that even the  fact of a filing must remain confidential, and that this is consistent  with the requirements of this section, this affidavit may be filed in  paper format under seal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Comments and other materials may not be submitted by means of  the   Commission's Electronic Comment Filing System (ECFS) with a request for  confidential treatment under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Commission may use abbreviated means for indicating that the  submitter of a record seeks confidential treatment, such as a checkbox  enabling the submitter to indicate that the record is confidential.  However, upon receipt of a request for inspection of such records  pursuant to Sec. 0.461, the submitter will be notified of such request  pursuant to Sec. 0.461(d)(3) and will be requested to justify the  confidential treatment of the record, as set forth in paragraph (b) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 0.459(a)(3), each such request shall  contain a statement of the reasons for withholding the materials from  inspection (see Sec. 0.457) and of the facts upon which those records  are based, including:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the specific information for which  confidential treatment is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of the Commission proceeding in which the  information was submitted or a description of the circumstances giving  rise to the submission;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Explanation of the degree to which the information is commercial  or financial, or contains a trade secret or is privileged;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Explanation of the degree to which the information concerns a  service that is subject to competition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Explanation of how disclosure of the information could result in  substantial competitive harm;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identification of any measures taken by the submitting party to  prevent unauthorized disclosure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Identification of whether the information is available to the  public and the extent of any previous disclosure of the information to  third parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Justification of the period during which the submitting party  asserts that material should not be available for public disclosure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any other information that the party seeking confidential  treatment believes may be useful in assessing whether its request for  confidentiality should be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Casual requests (including simply stamping pages  ``confidential'') which do not comply with the requirements of  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section will not be considered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a response in opposition to a confidentiality request is  filed, the party requesting confidentiality may file a reply within ten  business days. All responses or replies filed under this paragraph must  be served on all parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requests which comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a)  and (b) of this section will be acted upon by the appropriate custodian  of records (see Sec. 0.461(d)(1)), who is directed to grant the request  if it demonstrates by a preponderance of the evidence that non- disclosure is consistent with the provisions of the Freedom of  Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552. If the request for confidentiality is  granted, the ruling will be placed in the public file in lieu of the  materials withheld from public inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission may defer acting on requests that materials or  information submitted to the Commission be withheld from public  inspection until a request for inspection has been made pursuant to  Sec. 0.460 or Sec. 0.461. The information will be accorded confidential  treatment, as provided for in Sec. 0.459(g) and Sec. 0.461, until the  Commission acts on the confidentiality request and all subsequent appeal  and stay proceedings have been exhausted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the materials are submitted voluntarily (i.e., absent any  requirement by statute, regulation, or the Commission), the person  submitting them may request the Commission to return the materials  without consideration if the request for confidentiality should be  denied. In that event, the materials will ordinarily be returned (e.g.,  an application will be returned if it cannot be considered on a  confidential basis). Only in the unusual instance where the public  interest so requires will the materials be made available for public  inspection. However, no materials submitted with a request for  confidentiality will be returned if a request for inspection has been  filed under Sec. 0.461. If submission of   the materials is required by the Commission and the request for  confidentiality is denied, the materials will be made available for  public inspection once the period for review of the denial has passed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If no request for confidentiality is submitted, the Commission  assumes no obligation to consider the need for non-disclosure but, in  the unusual instance, may determine on its own motion that the materials  should be withheld from public inspection. See Sec. 0.457(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> and Sec. 0.461, until the Commission acts on any timely  applications for review of an order denying a request for  confidentiality, and until a court acts on any timely motion for stay of  such an order denying confidential treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the request for confidentiality is granted, the status of the  materials is the same as that of materials listed in Sec. 0.457. Any  person wishing to inspect them may submit a request for inspection under  Sec. 0.461.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Third party owners of materials submitted to the Commission by  another party may participate in the proceeding resolving the  confidentiality of the materials.
