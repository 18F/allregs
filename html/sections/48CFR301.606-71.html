A Project Officer must successfully complete HHS University's Basic Contracting Officer's Technical Representative Course or equivalent and any OPDIV-specific course prerequisites. The Project Officer must provide a course completion certificate to the Contracting Officer with any AP or other acquisition request documentation submitted. See HHS' COTR Handbook for additional information on the basic training requirement for Project Officers and guidance on the training requirement for technical proposal evaluators in 315.305(a)(3)(ii).
