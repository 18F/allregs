The public meeting should be held after the  first joint (utility, State and local governments) exercise at a time  mutually agreed to by State and local authorities, licensee and FEMA and  NRC Regional officials. This meeting shall be noticed in the local  newspaper with the largest circulation in the area, or other such media  as the Regional Administrator may select, on at least two occasions, one  of which is at least two weeks before the meeting takes place and the  other is within a few days of the meeting date. Local radio and  television stations should be notified of the scheduled meeting at least  one week in advance. Representatives from NRC and other appropriate  Federal agencies should also be invited to participate in these  meetings. If, in the judgment of the FEMA Regional Administrator, the  public meeting or meetings reveal deficiencies in the State plan and/or  the joint exercise, the Regional Administrator shall inform the State of  the fact together with recommendations for improvement. No FEMA approval  of State and local plans and preparedness shall be made until a meeting  described in this paragraph shall have been held at or near the nuclear  power facility site for which the State is seeking approval.</p>
