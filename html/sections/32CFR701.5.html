                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Compliance with the FOIA. DON policy is to comply with the FOIA  as set forth in the Department of Defense's FOIA Directives 5400.7 and  5400.7-R, and this instruction in this part in both letter and spirit;  conduct its activities in an open manner consistent with the need for  security and adherence to other requirements of law and regulation; and  provide the public with the maximum amount of accurate and timely  information concerning its activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prompt action. DON activities shall act promptly on requests  when a member of the public complies with the procedures established in  the instruction in this part (i.e., files a ``perfected request'') and  the request is received by the official designated to respond. See Sec.  701.11 for minimum requirements of the FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Provide assistance. DON activities shall assist requesters in  understanding and complying with the procedures established by the  instruction in this part, ensuring that procedural matters do not  unnecessarily impede a requester from obtaining DON records promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant access. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DON activities shall grant access to agency  records when a member of the public complies with the provisions of the  instruction in this part and there is no FOIA exemption available to  withhold the requested information (see subpart D of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those instances where the requester has not cited FOIA, but  the records are determined to be releasable in their entirety, the  request shall be honored without requiring the requester to invoke FOIA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Create a record. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A record must exist and be in the  possession and control of the DON at the time of the request to be  considered subject to the instruction in this part and the FOIA.  Accordingly, DON activities need not process requests for records which  are not in existence at the time the request is received. In other  words, requesters may not have a ``standing FOIA request'' for release  of future records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is no obligation to create, compile, or obtain a record to  satisfy a FOIA request. However, this is not to be confused with  honoring form or format requests (see Sec. 701.8). A DON activity,  however, may compile a new record when so doing would result in a more  useful response to the requester, or be less burdensome to the agency  than providing existing records, and the requester does not object. Cost  of creating or compiling such a record may not be charged to the  requester unless the fee for creating the record is equal to or less  than the fee which would be charged for providing the existing record.  Fee assessments shall be in accordance with subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With respect to electronic data, the issue of whether records  are actually created or merely extracted from an existing database is  not always readily apparent. Consequently, when responding to FOIA  requests for electronic data where creation of a record, programming, or  particular format are questionable, DON activities should apply a  standard of reasonableness. In other words, if the capability exists to  respond to the request, and the effort would be a business as usual  approach, then the request should be processed. However, the request  need not be processed when the capability to respond does not exist  without a significant expenditure of resources, thus not being a normal  business as usual approach. As used in this sense, a significant  interference with the operation of the DON activity's automated  information system would not be a business as usual approach.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Disclosures--(1) Discretionary Disclosures. DON activities shall  make discretionary disclosures whenever disclosure would not foreseeably  harm an interest protected by a FOIA exemption. A discretionary  disclosure is normally not appropriate for records clearly exempt under  exemptions (b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, (b)(3), (b)(4), (b)(6), (b)(7)(C) and (b)(7)(F).  Exemptions (b)(2), (b)(5), and (b)(7)(A), (b)(7)(B), (b)(7)(D) and  (b)(7)(E) are discretionary in nature and DON activities are encouraged  to exercise discretion whenever possible. Exemptions (b)(4), (b)(6), and  (b)(7)(C) cannot be claimed when the requester is the ``submitter'' of  the information. While discretionary disclosures to FOIA requesters  constitute a waiver of the FOIA exemption that may otherwise apply, this  policy does not create any legally enforceable right.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Public domain. Non-exempt records released under FOIA to a  member of the public are considered to be in the public domain.  Accordingly, such records may also be made available in reading rooms,  in paper form, as well as electronically to facilitate public access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limited disclosures. Disclosure of records to a properly  constituted advisory committee, to Congress, or to other Federal  agencies does not waive a FOIA exemption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Unauthorized disclosures. Exempt records disclosed without  authorization by the appropriate DON official do not lose their exempt  status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Official versus personal disclosures. While authority may exist  to disclose records to individuals in their official capacity, the  provisions of the instruction in this part apply if the same individual  seeks the records in a private or personal capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Distributing information. DON activities are encouraged to  enhance access to information by distributing information on their own  initiative through the use of electronic information systems, such as  the Government Information Locator Service (GILS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Honor form or format requests. DON activities shall provide the  record in any form or format requested by the requester, if the record  is readily reproducible in that form or format. DON activities shall  make reasonable efforts to maintain their records in forms or formats  that are reproducible. In responding to requests for records, DON  activities shall make reasonable efforts to search for records in  electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly  interfere with the operation of the DON activities' automated  information system. Such determinations shall be made on a case-by-case  basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Authenticate documents. Records provided under the instruction  in this part shall be authenticated with an appropriate seal, whenever  necessary, to fulfill an official Government or other legal function.  This service, however, is in addition to that required under the FOIA  and is not included in the FOIA fee schedule. DON activities may charge  for the service at a rate of $5.20 for each authentication.</p>
