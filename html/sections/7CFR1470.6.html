To apply for CSP, a producer must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be the operator of an agricultural operation in the Farm Service Agency (FSA) farm records management system. Potential applicants who are not in the FSA farm records management system must establish records with FSA. Applicants whose records are not current in the FSA farm records management system must update those records prior to the close of the evaluation period to be considered eligible. NRCS may grant exceptions to the ``operator of record'' requirement for producers, tenants, landlords, sharecroppers, and owners in the FSA farm records management system that can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of NRCS, they will operate and have effective control of the land, that they share in the risk of producing a crop and are entitled to share in the crop available for marketing from the farm (or would have shared had the crop been produced), and that they are part of the daily management, administration, and performance of the operation and share in the risk;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have effective control of the land unless an exception is made by the Chief in the case of land administered by the BIA, Indian lands, or other instances in which the Chief determines that there is sufficient assurance of control;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be in compliance with the highly erodible land and wetland conservation provisions found at 7 CFR part 12;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Be in compliance with Adjusted Gross Income provisions found at 7 CFR part 1400;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Supply information, as required by NRCS, to determine eligibility for the program, including but not limited to, information related to eligibility requirements and ranking factors; conservation activity and production system records; information to verify the applicant's status as an historically underserved producer or a veteran

L. 109-282, as amended), and 2 CFR parts 25 and 170; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide a list of all members of the legal entity or joint operation, as applicable, and embedded entities along with members' tax identification numbers and percentage interest in the legal entity or joint operation. Where applicable; American Indians, Alaska Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification number for each individual eligible for payments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible land.
