The test procedure for the head is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Seat and orient the dummy on a seating surface having a back support as specified in Sec. 572.78(c), and adjust the joints of the limbs at any setting (between 1g and 2g) which just supports the limbs' weight when the limbs are extended horizontally and forward.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Adjust the test probe so that its longitudinal center line is--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the forehead at the point of orthogonal intersection of the head midsagittal plane and the transverse plane which is perpendicular to the Z axis of the head as shown in Figure 40;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Located 2.7 0.1 inches below the top of the head measured along the Z axis, and;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Coincides within 2 degrees with the line made by the intersection of the horizontal and midsagittal planes passing through this point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Impact the head with the test probe so that at the moment of contact the probe's longitudinal center line falls within 2 degrees of a horizontal line in the dummy's midsagittal plane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Guide the test probe during impact so that there is no significant lateral, vertical, or rotational movement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allow at least 60 minutes between successive head tests.</p>
