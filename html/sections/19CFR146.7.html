                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Alteration of an activated area. An operator shall make written  application to the port director for approval of an alteration of an  activated area, including an alteration resulting from a zone boundary  modification. The application must be accompanied by the supporting  document requirements specified in Sec. 146.6, as applicable. The port  director may review the security, suitability, and fitness of the area,  and shall reply to the applicant as provided for in Sec. 146.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deactivation or reactivation. A grantee, or an operator with the  concurrence of a grantee, shall make written application to the port  director for deactivation of a zone site, indicating by layout or  blueprint the exact site to be deactivated. The port director shall not  approve the application unless all merchandise in the site in zone  status (other than domestic status) has been removed at the risk and  expense of the operator. The port director may require an accounting of  all merchandise in a zone as a condition of approving the deactivation.  A zone may be reactivated using the above procedure if a sufficient bond  is on file under Sec. 146.6(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Suspension of activated site. When approval of an activated  status has been suspended through the procedure in subpart G, the port  director may require all goods in that area in zone status (other than  domestic status) to be transferred to another zone, a bonded warehouse,  or other location where they may lawfully be stored, if the port  director considers that transfer advisable to protect the revenue or  administer any Federal law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New bond. The port director may require an operator to furnish,  on 10 days notice, a new Foreign Trade Zone Operator's Bond on Customs  Form 301. If the operator fails to furnish the new bond, no more  merchandise will be received in the zone in zone status. Merchandise in  zone status (other than domestic status) will be removed at the risk and  expense of the operator. A new bond may be required if (1) the activated  zone area is substantially altered; (2) the character of merchandise  admitted to the zone or operations performed in the zone are  substantially changed; (3) the existing bond lacks good and sufficient  surety; or (4) for any other reason that substantially affects the  liability of the operator under the bond. Although a new bond may not be  required, the operator shall obtain the consent of the surety to any  material alteration in the boundaries of the zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> New operator. A grantee of an activated zone site shall make  written application to the port director for approval of a new operator,  submitting with the application a certification by the new operator that  the inventory control and recordkeeping system meets the requirements of  subpart B, and a copy of the system procedures manual if different from  the previous operator's manual. The port director may order an inquiry  into the qualifications, character, and experience of the operator and  its principal officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The bond in Sec. 146.6 shall be submitted by the operator  before the operating agreement may become effective in respect to  merchandise in zone status. The port director shall promptly notify the  grantee, in writing, of the approval or disapproval of the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> List of officers, employees, and other persons. The port  director may make a written demand upon the operator to submit, within  30 days after the date of the demand, a written list of the names,  addresses, social security numbers, and dates and places of birth of  officers and persons having a direct or indirect financial interest in  the operator, and of persons employed in the carriage, receipt or  delivery of merchandise in zone status, whether employed by the zone  operator or a zone user. If a list was previously furnished, the port  director may make a written demand for the same information in respect  to new persons employed in the carriage, receipt, or delivery of zone  status merchandise within 10 days after such employment. The list need   not include employees of common or contract carriers transporting goods  to or from the zone.
