                            <p class="depth0">Many of the container and marking requirements set forth in this  subpart are based on the intended use of the spirits, that is, whether  they are for ``industrial'' or ``nonindustrial'' use. For purposes of  this subpart, the terms ``industrial'' use and ``nonindustrial'' use  refer to the uses specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Industrial use. The word ``industrial'' when used with reference  to the use of spirits has the same meaning as in Sec. Sec. 1.60 and  1.62 of this chapter. Those uses are as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Free of tax by, and for the use of, the United States or any  governmental agency thereof, any State, any political subdivision of a  State, or the District of Columbia, for nonbeverage purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Free of tax for nonbeverage purposes and not for resale or use  in the manufacture of any product for sale--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For the use of any educational organization described in 26  U.S.C. 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) which is exempt from income tax under 26 U.S.C.  501(a), or for the use of any scientific university or college of  learning;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For any laboratory for use exclusively in scientific research;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For use at any hospital, blood bank, or sanitarium (including  use in making analysis or test at such hospital, blood bank, or  sanitarium), or at any pathological laboratory exclusively engaged in  making analyses, or tests, for hospitals or sanitariums; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For the use of any clinic operated for charity and not for  profit (including use in compounding of bona fide medicines for  treatment outside of such clinics of patients thereof);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Free of tax, after denaturation of such spirits in the manner  prescribed by law for--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Use in the manufacture of ether, chloroform, or other definite  chemical substance where such distilled spirits are changed into some  other chemical substance and do not appear in the finished product; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any other use in the arts and industries (except for uses  prohibited by 26 U.S.C. 5273 (b) or (d)) and for fuel, light, and power;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The use of distilled spirits for experimental purposes and in  the manufacture of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Medicinal, pharmaceutical, or antiseptic products, including  prescriptions compounded by retail druggists;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Toilet preparations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Flavoring extracts, syrups, or food products; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Scientific, chemical, mechanical, or industrial products,  provided such products are unfit for beverage use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonindustrial use. The word ``nonindustrial'' when used with  reference to the use of spirits refers to any use not listed as an  ``industrial'' use in paragraph (a) of this section. Nonindustrial uses  include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For beverage purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the manufacture, rectification, or blending of alcoholic  beverages; or in the preparation of food or drink by a hotel,  restaurant, tavern, or similar establishment; or as a medicine; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Distilled spirits in containers with a capacity of 1 wine gallon  or less, other than anhydrous alcohol and alcohol that may be withdrawn  from bond free of tax.  (26 U.S.C. 5206, 5301)</p><p class="depth3">Requirements for Containers</p>
