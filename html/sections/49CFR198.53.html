                                Sec. 198.53  When and how will PHMSA evaluate State damage prevention
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">PHMSA conducts annual program evaluations and certification reviews  of State pipeline safety programs. PHMSA will also conduct annual  reviews of State excavation damage prevention law enforcement programs.  PHMSA will use the criteria described in Sec. 198.55 as the basis for  the enforcement program reviews, utilizing information obtained from any  State agency or office with a role in the State's excavation damage  prevention law enforcement program. If PHMSA finds a State's enforcement  program inadequate, PHMSA may take immediate enforcement against  excavators in that State. The State will have five years from the date  of the finding to make program improvements that meet PHMSA's criteria  for minimum adequacy. A State that fails to establish an adequate  enforcement program in accordance with Sec. 198.55 within five years of  the finding of inadequacy may be subject to reduced grant funding  established under 49 U.S.C. 60107. PHMSA will determine the amount of  the reduction using the same process it uses to distribute the grant  funding; PHMSA will factor the findings from the annual review of the  excavation damage prevention enforcement program into the 49 U.S.C.  60107 grant funding distribution to State pipeline safety programs. The  amount of the reduction in 49 U.S.C. 60107 grant funding will not exceed  four percent (4%) of prior year funding (not cumulative). If a State  fails to implement an adequate enforcement program within five years of  a finding of inadequacy, the Governor of that State may petition the  Administrator of PHMSA, in writing, for a temporary waiver of the  penalty, provided the petition includes a clear plan of action and  timeline for achieving program adequacy.</p>
