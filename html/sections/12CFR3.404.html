                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice. When the OCC determines that minimum capital ratios above those set forth in subpart B of this part or other legal authority are necessary or appropriate for a particular national bank or Federal savings association, the OCC will notify the national bank or Federal savings association in writing of the proposed minimum capital ratios and the date by which they should be reached (if applicable) and will provide an explanation of why the ratios proposed are considered necessary or appropriate for the national bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Response. (1) The national bank or Federal savings association may respond to any or all of the items in the notice. The response should include any matters which the national bank or Federal savings association would have the OCC consider in deciding whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association, what those capital ratios should be, and, if applicable, when they should be achieved. The response must be in writing and delivered to the designated OCC official within 30 days after the date on which the national bank or Federal savings association received the notice. The OCC may shorten the time period when, in the opinion of the OCC, the condition of the national bank or Federal savings association so requires, provided that the national bank or Federal savings association is informed promptly of the new time period, or with the consent of the national bank or Federal savings association. In its discretion, the OCC may extend the time period for good cause.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The national bank or Federal savings association may respond to any or all of the items in the notice.

After the close of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response period, the OCC will decide, based on a review of the national bank's or Federal savings association's response and other information concerning the national bank or Federal savings association, whether individual minimum capital ratios should be established for the national bank or Federal savings association and, if so, the ratios and the date the requirements will become effective. The national bank or Federal savings association will be notified of the decision in writing. The notice will include an explanation of the decision, except for a decision not to establish individual minimum capital requirements for the national bank or Federal savings association.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Submission of plan. The decision may require the national bank or Federal savings association to develop and submit to the OCC, within a time period specified, an acceptable plan to reach the minimum capital ratios established for the national bank or Federal savings association by the date required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Change in circumstances. If, after the OCC's decision in paragraph (c) of this section, there is a change in the

circumstances affecting the national bank's or Federal savings association's capital adequacy or its ability to reach the required minimum capital ratios by the specified date, the national bank or Federal savings association may propose to the OCC, or the OCC may propose to the national bank or Federal savings association, a change in the minimum capital ratios for the national bank or Federal savings association, the date when the minimums must be achieved, or the national bank's or Federal savings association's plan (if applicable). The OCC may decline to consider proposals that are not based on a significant change in circumstances or are repetitive or frivolous. Pending a decision on reconsideration, the OCC's original decision and any plan required under that decision shall continue in full force and effect.</p>
