The communication to the Commissioner need not be in any particular form but shall contain the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the individual and the person, firm, or association the individual represents, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The nature of the individual's interest in the matter, if any;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the merchandise, which it is alleged affects the economic interest of the United States adversely, including subheadings of the HTSUS, if known;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The country of acquisition and the ports and dates of entry of the merchandise, if known; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A statement and supporting evidence as to the manner in which the individual believes the economic interest of the United States is being adversely affected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Inquiry to be conducted. Upon receipt of a communication containing the information required by paragraph (b) of this section, an inquiry will be conducted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Negative determination. If the inquiry results in a finding that no reasonable cause exists to believe that the application of the flat rate of duty provisions to a particular article of merchandise is adversely affecting the economic interest of the United States, the inquirer shall be advised in writing of the finding and the matter shall be closed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Publication of tentative finding. If the inquiry results in a finding by the Secretary of the Treasury that reasonable cause exists to believe that the application of the flat rate of duty provisions to a particular article of merchandise is affecting the economic interest of the United States adversely, a notice of the finding will be published in the Federal Register and Customs Bulletin, along with a statement of intent to exclude the articles from application of the flat rate of duty provisions. Interested persons will be given an opportunity to submit written comments on the notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Final determination. Based upon the comments received and the results of any additional inquiry as may be necessary, if it is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury that application of the flat rate of duty provisions adversely affects the economic interest of the United States, a Treasury Decision will be published in the Federal Register and Customs Bulletin announcing that the merchandise will be excluded from application of the flat

rate of duty provisions. Excluded articles of merchandise shall be listed in Sec. 148.106.
