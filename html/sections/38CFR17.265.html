                            <p class="depth0">Payments of grant funds are made to grantees through a letter-of- credit, an advance by Treasury check, or a reimbursement by Treasury  check, as appropriate. A letter-of-credit is an instrument certified by  an authorized official of the Department of Veterans   Affairs which authorizes the grantee to draw funds when needed from the  Treasury, through a Federal Reserve bank and the grantee's commercial  bank and shall be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs where all  the following conditions exist:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When there is or will be a continuing relationship between the  grantee and the Department of Veterans Affairs for at least a 12-month  period and the total amount of advance payments expected to be received  within that period is $250,000, or more;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the grantee has established or demonstrated the willingness  and ability to maintain procedures that will minimize the time elapsing  between the transfer of funds and their disbursement by the grantee; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of  this section. This method may be used on any construction agreement, or  if the major portion of the program is accomplished through private  market financing or Federal loans, and the Federal assistance  constitutes a minor portion of the program. When the reimbursement  method is used, the Department of Veterans Affairs shall make payment  within 30 days after receipt of the billing, unless billing is improper.  Unless otherwise required by law, payments shall not be withheld for  proper charges at any time during the grant period unless a grantee has  failed to comply with the program objectives, award conditions, or  Federal reporting requirements; or the grantee is indebted.
