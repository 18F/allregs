portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public pursuant to Sec. 9.104, or which respect to any information which is proposed to be withheld under Sec. 9.105(c). A single vote may be taken with respect to a series of meetings, a portion or portions of which are proposed to be closed to the public, or with respect to any information concerning such series of meetings, so long as each meeting in such series involves the same particular matters and is scheduled to be held no more than thirty days after the initial meeting in such series. The vote of each Commissioner participating in such vote shall be recorded and no proxies shall be allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Within one day of any vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section, Sec. 9.106(a), or Sec. 9.108(c), the Secretary shall make publicly available at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, a written copy of such vote reflecting the vote of each member on the question. If a portion of a meeting is to be closed to the public, the Secretary shall, within one day of the vote taken pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section or Sec. 9.106(a), make publicly available at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov, a full written explanation of its action closing the portion together with a list of all persons expected to attend the meeting and their affiliation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The notices and lists required by paragraph (b) of this section to be made public may be withheld from the public to the extent that the Commission determines that such information itself would be protected against disclosure by Sec. 9.104(a). Any such determination shall be made independently of the Commission's determination pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section to close a meeting, but in accordance with the procedure of that subsection. Any such determination, including a written explanation for the action and the specific provision or provisions of Sec. 9.104(a) relied upon, must be made publicly available to the extent permitted by the circumstances.
