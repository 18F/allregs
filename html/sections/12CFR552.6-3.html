                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Certificates for shares. Certificates representing shares of  capital stock of the association shall be in such form as shall be  determined by the board of directors and approved by the OTS. The  certificates shall be signed by the chief executive officer or by any  other officer of the association authorized by the board of directors,  attested by the secretary or an assistant secretary, and sealed with the  corporate seal or a facsimile thereof. The signatures of such officers  upon a certificate may be facsimiles if the certificate is manually  signed on behalf of a transfer agent or a registrar other than the  association itself or one of its employees. Each certificate for shares  of capital stock shall be consecutively numbered or otherwise  identified. The name and address of the person to whom the shares are  issued, with the number of shares and date of issue, shall be entered on  the stock transfer books of the association. All certificates  surrendered to the association for transfer shall be cancelled and no  new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like  number of shares shall have been surrendered and cancelled, except that  in the case of a lost or destroyed certificate a new certificate may be  issued upon such terms and indemnity to the association as the board of  directors may prescribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer of shares. Transfer of shares of capital stock of the  association shall be made only on its stock transfer books. Authority  for such transfer shall be given only by the holder of record or by a  legal representative, who shall furnish proper evidence of such  authority, or by an attorney authorized by a duly executed power of  attorney and filed with the association. The transfer shall be made only  on surrender for cancellation of the certificate for the shares. The  person in whose name shares of capital stock stand on the books of the  association shall be deemed by the association to be the owner for all  purposes.
