This must address all necessary  adjustments, including those required to address differences in fuel  quality or ambient temperatures. For example, equivalent emissions  performance can be measured relative to optimal engine performance that  could be achieved in the absence of emission standards (i.e., the  calibration that result in the lowest fuel consumption and/or maximum  firing pressure). In this example, adjustments that achieved the same  percent reduction in NOX emissions from the optimal  calibration would be considered to be equivalent. Alternatively, if the  engine uses injection timing retard and EGR to reduce emissions, then  retarding timing the same number of degrees (relative to optimal engine  performance) and using the same rate of EGR at the different conditions  would be considered to be equivalent.
