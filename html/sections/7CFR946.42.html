At the end of a fiscal period, funds in excess of the year's expenses shall be placed in an operating reserve not to exceed approximately two fiscal periods' operational expenses or such lower limits as the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may establish. Funds in such reserve shall be available for use by the committee for expenses authorized pursuant to Sec. 946.40. Funds in excess of those placed in the operating reserve shall be refunded to handlers. Each handler's share of such excess shall be the amount of assessments he paid in excess of his pro rata share of the actual expenses of the committee and the addition, if any, to the operating reserve.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accounting of funds upon termination of order. Any money collected as assessments pursuant to this subpart and remaining unexpended in the possession of the committee after termination of this part shall be distributed in such manner as the Secretary may direct: Provided, That to the extent practical, such funds shall be returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.
