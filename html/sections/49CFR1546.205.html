Each foreign air carrier operating a program under Sec.  1546.101(a), (b), or (e) must use the procedures in its security program to control cargo that it accepts for transport on an aircraft in a manner that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Prevents the carriage of any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substance or item onboard the aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prevents access by unauthorized persons other than an authorized foreign air carrier employee or agent, or persons authorized by the airport operator or host government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Screening and inspection of cargo in the United States. For cargo to be loaded in the United States, each foreign air carrier operating a program under Sec.  1546.101(1)(a), (b), (e), or (f) must ensure that cargo is screened and inspected for any unauthorized person, and any unauthorized explosive, incendiary, and other destructive substances or items as provided in the foreign air carrier's security program and Sec.  1546.207, and as provided in Sec.  1546.213 for operations under Sec.  1546.101(a) or (b), before loading it on its aircraft in the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Acceptance of cargo only from specified persons.

(i) Not later than February 3, 2009, each foreign air carrier must ensure that at least 50 percent of its cargo is screened prior to transport on a passenger aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Not later than August 3, 2010, each foreign air carrier must ensure that 100 percent of its cargo is screened prior to transport on a passenger aircraft.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Methods of screening. For the purposes of this paragraph (g), the foreign air carrier must ensure that cargo is screened using a physical examination or non-intrusive method of assessing whether cargo poses a threat to transportation security, as provided in its security program. Such methods may include TSA-approved x-ray systems, explosives detection systems, explosives trace detection, explosives detection canine teams certified by TSA, a physical search together with manifest verification, or other method approved by TSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Limitation on who may conduct screening. Screening must be conducted by the foreign air carrier, by another aircraft operator or foreign air carrier operating under a security program under this chapter with a comparable cargo security program, by a certified cargo screening facility in accordance with 49 CFR part 1549, or by TSA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The foreign air carrier must verify that the chain of custody measures for the screened cargo are intact prior to loading such cargo on aircraft, or must ensure that the cargo is re-screened in accordance with this chapter.
