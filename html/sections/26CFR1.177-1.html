                                Sec. 1.177-1  Election to amortize trademark and trade name expenditures.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 177 provides that a taxpayer may elect  to treat any trademark or trade name expenditure (defined in section  177(b) and paragraph (b) of this section) paid or incurred during a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1955, as a deferred expense.  Any expenditure so treated shall be allowed as a deduction ratably over  the number of continuous months (not less than 60) selected by the  taxpayer, beginning with the first month of the taxable year in which  the expenditure is paid or incurred. The term paid or incurred, as used  in section 177 and this section, is to be construed according to the  method of accounting used by the taxpayer in computing taxable income.  See section 7701(a)(25). An election under section 177 is irrevocable  insofar as it applies to a particular trademark or trade name  expenditure, but separate elections may be made with respect to other  trademark or trade name expenditures. See subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph. See also paragraph (c) of this section for time and manner of  making election.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of continuous months selected by the taxpayer may be  equal to or greater, but not less than 60, but in any event the  deduction must begin with the first month of the taxable year in which  the expenditure is paid or incurred. The number of months selected by  the taxpayer at the time he makes the election may not be subsequently  changed but shall be adhered to in computing taxable income for the  taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable  years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 177 permits an election by the taxpayer for each  separate trademark or trade name expenditure. Thus, a taxpayer who has  several trademark or trade name expenditures in a taxable year may elect  under section 177 with respect to some of such expenditures and not  elect with respect to the other expenditures. Also, a taxpayer may  choose different amortization periods for different trademark or trade  name expenditures with respect to which he has made the election under  section 177.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All trademark and trade name expenditures are properly  chargeable to capital account for purposes of section 1016(a)(1),  relating to adjustments to basis of property, whether or not they are to  be amortized under section 177. However, the trademark and trade name  expenditures with respect to which the taxpayer has made an election  under section 177 must be kept in a separate account in the taxpayer's  books and records. See paragraph (c) of this section. See also section  1016(a)(16)   and paragraph (m) of Sec. 1.1016-5 for adjustments to basis of property  for amounts allowed as deductions under section 177 and this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Trademark and trade name expenditures defined. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term  trademark and trade name expenditures, as used in section 177 and this  section, means any expenditure which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is directly connected with the acquisition, protection,  expansion, registration (Federal, State, or foreign), or defense of a  trademark or trade name;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is chargeable to capital account; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is not part of the consideration or purchase price paid for a  trademark, trade name, or a business (including goodwill) already in  existence.  An expenditure which fails to meet one or more of these tests is not a  trademark or trade name expenditure for purposes of section 177 and this  section.  Amounts paid in connection with the acquisition of an existing trademark  or trade name may not be amortized under section 177 even though such  amounts may be paid to protect or expand a previously owned trademark or  trade name through purchase of a competitive trademark. Similarly, the  provisions of section 177 and this section are not applicable to  expenditures paid or incurred for an agreement to discontinue the use of  a trademark or trade name (if the effect of the agreement is the  purchase of a trademark or trade name) nor to expenditures paid or  incurred in acquiring franchises or rights to the use of a trademark or  trade name. Generally, section 177 will apply to expenditures such as  legal fees and other costs in connection with the acquisition of a  certificate of registration of a trademark from the United States or  other government, artists' fees and similar expenses connected with the  design of a distinctive mark for a product or service, litigation  expenses connected with infringement proceedings, and costs in  connection with the preparation and filing of an application for renewal  of registration and continued use of a trademark.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Expenditures for a trademark or trade name which has a  determinable useful life and which would otherwise be depreciable under  section 167 must be deferred and amortized under section 177 if an  election under section 177 is made with respect to such expenditures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The following examples illustrate the application of section  177:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. X Corporation engages an artist to design a distinctive  trademark for its product. At the same time it retains an attorney to  prepare the papers necessary for registration of this trademark with the  Federal Government. The fees of both the artist and the attorney may be  amortized under section 177 over a period of not less than 60 continuous  months.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. Y Corporation wishes to expand the market served by its  product. It acquires a competing firm in a neighboring State. The  contract of sale provides for a purchase price of $250,000 of which  $225,000 shall constitute payment for physical assets and $25,000 for  the trademark and goodwill. No part of the purchase price may be  amortized under section 177.</p><p class="depth3">Example 3. M Corporation brings suit against N Corporation for  infringement of M's trademark. The costs of this litigation may be  amortized under section 177.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time and manner of making election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer who elects to  defer and amortize any trademark or trade name expenditure paid or  incurred during a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1955, shall,  within the time prescribed by law (including extensions thereof) for  filing his income tax return for that year, attach to his income tax  return a statement signifying his election under section 177 and setting  forth the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the taxpayer, and the taxable year involved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An identification of the character and amount of each  expenditure to which the election applies and the number of continuous  months (not less than 60) during which the expenditures are to be  ratably deducted; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A declaration by the taxpayer that he will make an accounting  segregation on his books and records of the trademark and trade name  expenditures for which the election has been made, sufficient to permit  an identification of the character and amount of each such expenditure  and the amortization period selected for each expenditure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply  to income tax returns and statements required to   be filed after May 4, 1960. Elections properly made in accordance with  the provisions of Treasury Decision 6209, approved October 26, 1956 (21  FR 8319, C.B. 1956-2, 1370), continue in effect.</p>
