                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>, certain  factors must be taken into account, as prescribed by section 864(c)(2)  and paragraph (c) of this section, in order to determine whether the  income, gain, or loss is effectively connected for the taxable year with  the conduct of a trade or business in the United States by that person.  All other income, gain, or loss of such person for the taxable year from  sources within the United States shall be treated as effectively  connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States by that person, as prescribed by section 864(c)(3)  and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Income other than fixed or determinable income and capital  gains. All income, gain, or loss for the taxable year derived by a  nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation engaged in a trade  or business in the United States from sources within the United States  which does not consist of income, gain, or loss described in section  871(a)(1) or 881(a), or of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of  capital assets, shall, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, be  treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct  of a trade or business in the United States. This income, gain, or loss  shall be treated as effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States, whether or not the  income, gain, or loss is derived from the trade or business being  carried on in the United States during the taxable year. The application  of this paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as  the taxable year, is engaged in the business of manufacturing machine  tools in a foreign country. It establishes a branch office in the United  States during 1968 which solicits orders from customers in the United  States for the machine tools manufactured by that corporation. All  negotiations with respect to such sales are carried on in the United  States. By reason of its activity in the United States M is engaged in  business in the United States during 1968. The income or loss from  sources within the United States from such sales during 1968 is treated  as effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a business in  the United States by M. Occasionally, during 1968 the customers in the  United States write directly to the home office of M, and the home  office makes sales directly to such customers without routing the  transactions through its branch office in the United States. The income  or loss from sources within the United States for 1968 from these  occasional direct sales by the home office is also treated as  effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a business in  the United States by M.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1 except that during  1967 M was also engaged in the business of purchasing and selling office  machines and that it used the installment method of accounting for the  sales made in this separate business. During 1967 M was engaged in  business in the United States by reason of the sales activities it  carried on in the United States for the purpose of selling therein a  number of the office machines which it had purchased. Although M  discontinued this business activity in the United States in December of  1967, it received in 1968 some installment payments on the sales which  it had made in the United States during 1967. The income of M for 1968  from sources within the United States which is attributable to such  installment payments is effectively connected for 1968 with the conduct  of a business in the United States, even though such income is not  connected with the business carried on in the United States during 1968  through its sales office located in the United States for the  solicitation of orders for the machine tools it manufactures.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Foreign corporation S, which uses the calendar year as  the taxable year, is engaged in the business of purchasing and selling  electronic equipment. The home office of such corporation is also  engaged in the business of purchasing and selling vintage wines. During  1968, S establishes a branch office in the United States to sell  electronic equipment to customers, some of whom are located in the  United States and the balance, in foreign countries. This branch office  is not equipped to sell, and does not participate in sales of, wine  purchased by the home office. Negotiations for the sales of the  electronic equipment take place in the United States. By reason of the  activity of its branch office in the United States, S is engaged in  business in the United States during 1968. As a result of advertisements  which the home office of S places in periodicals   sold in the United States, customers in the United States frequently  place orders for the purchase of wines with the home office in the  foreign country, and the home office makes sales of wine in 1968  directly to such customers without routing the transactions through its  branch office in the United States. The income or loss from sources  within the United States for 1968 from sales of electronic equipment by  the branch office, together with the income or loss from sources within  the United States for that year from sales of wine by the home office,  is treated as effectively connected for that year with the conduct of a  business in the United States by S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Fixed or determinable income and capital gains--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Principal  factors to be taken into account--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In determining for  purposes of paragraph (a) of this section whether any income for the  taxable year from sources within the United States which is described in  section 871(a)(1) or 881(a), relating to fixed or determinable annual or  periodical gains, profits, and income and certain other gains, or  whether gain or loss from sources within the United States for the  taxable year from the sale or exchange of capital assets, is effectively  connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business  in the United States, the principal tests to be applied are (a) the  asset-use test, that is, whether the income, gain, or loss is derived  from assets used in, or held for use in, the conduct of the trade or  business in the United States, and (b) the business-activities test,  that is, whether the activities of the trade or business conducted in  the United States were a material factor in the realization of the  income, gain, or loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Special rule relating to interest on certain deposits. For  purposes of determining under section 861(a)(1)(A) (relating to interest  on deposits with banks, savings and loan associations, and insurance  companies paid or credited before January 1, 1976) whether the interest  described therein is effectively connected for the taxable year with the  conduct of a trade or business in the United States, such interest shall  be treated as income from sources within the United States for purposes  of applying this paragraph and Sec. 1.864-5. If by reason of the  application of this paragraph such interest is determined to be income  which is not effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct  of a trade or business in the United States, it shall then be treated as  interest from sources without the United States which is not subject to  the application of Sec. 1.864-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Application of the asset-use test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes  of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the asset-use test ordinarily  shall apply in making a determination with respect to income, gain, or  loss of a passive type where the trade or business activities as such do  not give rise directly to the realization of the income, gain, or loss.  However, even in the case of such income, gain, or loss, any activities  of the trade or business which materially contribute to the realization  of such income, gain, or loss shall also be taken into account as a  factor in determining whether the income, gain, or loss is effectively  connected with the conduct of a trade or business in the United States.  The asset-use test is of primary significance where, for example,  interest income is derived from sources within the United States by a  nonresident alien individual or foreign corporation that is engaged in  the business of manufacturing or selling goods in the United States. See  also subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for rules applicable to  taxpayers conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cases where applicable. Ordinarily, an asset shall be treated  as used in, or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business in  the United States if the asset is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Held for the principal purpose of promoting the present conduct  of the trade or business in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acquired and held in the ordinary course of the trade or  business conducted in the United States, as, for example, in the case of  an account or note receivable arising from that trade or business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(2)(iv)</em>  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(b)</em> of this section, stock of a corporation  (whether domestic or foreign) shall not be treated as an asset used in,  or held for use in, the conduct of a trade or business in the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Stock held by foreign insurance companies. This paragraph  (c)(2)(iii) shall not apply to stock of a corporation (whether domestic  or foreign) held by a foreign insurance company unless the foreign  insurance company owns 10 percent or more of the total voting power or  value of all classes of stock of such corporation. For purposes of this  section, section 318(a) shall be applied in determining ownership,  except that in applying section 318(a)(2)(C), the phrase ``10 percent''  is used instead of the phrase ``50 percent.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Direct relationship between holding of asset and trade or  business--(a) In general. In determining whether an asset is held in a  direct relationship to the trade or business conducted in the United  States, principal consideration shall be given to whether the asset is  needed in that trade or buisness. An asset shall be considered needed in  a trade or business, for this purpose, only if the asset is held to meet  the present needs of that trade or business and not its anticipated  future needs. An asset shall be considered as needed in the trade or  business conducted in the United States if, for example, the asset is  held to meet the operating expenses of that trade or business.  Conversely, an asset shall be considered as not needed in the trade or  business conducted in the United States if, for example, the asset is  held for the purpose of providing for (1) future diversification into a  new trade or business, (2) expansion of trade or business activities  conducted outside of the United States, (3) future plant replacement, or  (4) future business contingencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Presumption of direct relationship. Generally, an asset will be  treated as held in a direct relationship to the trade or business if (1)  the asset was acquired with funds generated by that trade or business,  (2) the income from the asset is retained or reinvested in that trade or  business, and (3) personnel who are present in the United States and  actively involved in the conduct of that trade or business exercise  significant management and control over the investment of such asset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Illustration. The application of paragraph (iv) may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. M, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as  the taxable year, is engaged in industrial manufacturing in a foreign  country. M maintains a branch in the United States which acts as  importer and distributor of the merchandise it manufactures abroad; by  reason of these branch activities. M is engaged in business in the  United States during 1968. The branch in the United States is required  to hold a large current cash balance for business purposes, but the  amount of the cash balance so required varies because of the fluctuating  seasonal nature of the branch's business. During 1968 at a time when  large cash balances are not required the branch invests the surplus  amount in U.S. Treasury bills. Since these Treasury bills are held to  meet the present needs of the business conducted in the United States  they are held in a direct relationship to that business, and the  interest for 1968 on these bills is effectively connected for that year  with the conduct of the business in the United States by M.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Foreign corporation M, which uses the calendar year as  the taxable year, has a branch office in the United States where it  sells to customers located in the United States various products which  are manufactured by that corporation in a foreign country. By reason of  this activity M is engaged in business in the United States during 1997.  The U.S. branch establishes in 1997 a fund to which are periodically  credited various amounts which are derived from the business carried on  at such branch. The amounts in this fund are invested in various  securities issued by domestic corporations by the managing officers of  the U.S. branch, who have the responsibility for maintaining proper  investment diversification and investment of the fund. During 1997, the  branch office derives from sources within the United States interest on  these securities, and gains and losses resulting from the sale or  exchange of such securities. Since the securities were acquired with  amounts generated by the business conducted in the United States, the  interest is retained in that business, and the portfolio is managed by  personnel actively involved in the conduct of that business, the  securities are presumed under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(b) of this section to  be held in a direct relationship to that business. However, M is able to  rebut this presumption by demonstrating that the fund was established to  carry out a program of future expansion and not to meet the present  needs of the business conducted in the United States. Consequently, the  income,   gains, and losses from the securities for 1997 are not effectively  connected for that year with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States by M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Application of the business-activities test--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For  purposes of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the business-activities  test shall ordinarily apply in making a determination with respect to  income, gain, or loss which, even though generally of the passive type,  arises directly from the active conduct of the taxpayer's trade or  business in the United States. The business-activities test is of  primary significance, for example, where (a) dividends or interest are  derived by a dealer in stocks or securities, (b) gain or loss is derived  from the sale or exchange of capital assets in the active conduct of a  trade or business by an investment company, (c) royalties are derived in  the active conduct of a business consisting of the licensing of patents  or similar intangible property, or (d) service fees are derived in the  active conduct of a servicing business. In applying the business- activities test, activities relating to the management of investment  portfolios shall not be treated as activities of the trade or business  conducted in the United States unless the maintenance of the investments  constitutes the principal activity of that trade or business. See also  subparagraph (5) of this paragraph for rules applicable to taxpayers  conducting a banking, financing, or similar business in the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation S is a foreign investment company  organized for the purpose of investing in stocks and securities. S is  not a personal holding company or a corporation which would be a  personal holding company but for section 542(c)(7) or 543(b)(1)(C). Its  investment portfolios consist of common stocks issued by both foreign  and domestic corporations and a substantial amount of high grade bonds.  The business activity of S consists of the management of its portfolios  for the purpose of investing, reinvesting, or trading in stocks and  securities. During the taxable year 1968, S has its principal office in  the United States within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of Sec.  1.864-2 and, by reason of its trading in the United States in stocks and  securities, is engaged in business in the United States. The dividends  and interest derived by S during 1968 from sources within the United  States, and the gains and losses from sources within the United States  for such year from the sale of stocks and securities from its investment  portfolios, are effectively connected for 1968 with the conduct of the  business in the United States by that corporation, since its activities  in connection with the management of its investment portfolios are  activities of that business and such activities are a material factor in  the realization of such income, gains, and losses.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. N, a foreign corporation which uses the calendar year as  the taxable year, has a branch in the United States which acts as an  importer and distributor of merchandise; by reason of the activities of  that branch, N is engaged in business in the United States during 1968.  N also carries on a business in which it licenses patents to unrelated  persons in the United States for use in the United States. The  businesses of the licensees in which these patents are used have no  direct relationship to the business carried on in N's branch in the  United States, although the merchandise marketed by the branch is  similar in type to that manufactured under the patents. The negotiations  and other activities leading up to the consummation of these licenses  are conducted by employees of N who are not connected with the U.S.  branch of that corporation, and the U.S. branch does not otherwise  participate in arranging for the licenses. Royalties received by N  during 1968 from these licenses are not effectively connected for that  year with the conduct of its business in the United States because the  activities of that business are not a material factor in the realization  of such income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Method of accounting as a factor. In applying the asset-use test  or the business-activities test described in subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, due regard shall be given to whether or not the asset, or the  income, gain, or loss, is accounted for through the trade or business  conducted in the United States, that is, whether or not the asset, or  the income, gain, or loss, is carried on books of account separately  kept for that trade or business, but this accounting test shall not by  itself be controlling. In applying this subparagraph, consideration  shall be given to whether the accounting treatment of an item reflects  the consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles  in a particular trade or business in accordance with accepted conditions  or practices in that trade or   business and whether there is a consistent accounting treatment of that  item from year to year by the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules relating to banking, financing, or similar  business activity--(i) Definition of banking, financing, or similar  business. A nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation shall  be considered for purposes of this section and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec.  1.864-5 to be engaged in the active conduct of a banking, financing, or  similar business in the United States if at some time during the taxable  year the taxpayer is engaged in business in the United States and the  activities of such business consist of any one or more of the following  activities carried on, in whole or in part, in the United States in  transactions with persons situated within or without the United States:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Receiving deposits of funds from the public,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Making personal, mortgage, industrial, or other loans to the  public,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Purchasing, selling, discounting, or negotiating for the public  on a regular basis, notes, drafts, checks, bills of exchange,  acceptances, or other evidences of indebtedness,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Issuing letters of credit to the public and negotiating drafts  drawn thereunder,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Providing trust services for the public, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Financing foreign exchange transactions for the public.  Although the fact that the taxpayer is subjected to the banking and  credit laws of a foreign country shall be taken into account in  determining whether he is engaged in the active conduct of a banking,  financing, or similar business, the character of the business actually  carried on during the taxable year in the United States shall determine  whether the taxpayer is actively conducting a banking, financing, or  similar business in the United States. A foreign corporation which acts  merely as a financing vehicle for borrowing funds for its parent  corporation or any other person who would be a related person within the  meaning of section 954(d)(3) if such foreign corporation were a  controlled foreign corporation shall not be considered to be engaged in  the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective connection of income from stocks or securities with  active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business.  Notwithstanding the rules in subparagraphs (2) and (3) of this paragraph  with respect to the asset-use test and the business-activities test, any  dividends or interest from stocks or securities, or any gain or loss  from the sale or exchange of stocks or securities which are capital  assets, which is from sources within the United States and derived by a  nonresident alien individual or a foreign corporation in the active  conduct during the taxable year of a banking, financing, or similar  business in the United States shall be treated as effectively connected  for such year with the conduct of that business only if the stocks or  securities giving rise to such income, gain, or loss are attributable to  the U.S. office through which such business is carried on and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Were acquired--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As a result of, or in the course of making loans to the public,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the course of distributing such stocks or securities to the  public, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of being used to satisfy the reserve  requirements, or other requirements similar to reserve requirements,  established by a duly constituted banking authority in the United  States, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Consist of securities (as defined in subdivision (v) of this  subparagraph) which are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payable on demand or at a fixed maturity date not exceeding 1  year from the date of acquisition,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issued by the United States, or any agency or instrumentality  thereof, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of  this subdivision (ii) which shall be treated as effectively connected  for the taxable year with the active conduct of a banking, financing, or  similar business in the United States shall be an amount (but not in  excess of the entire interest   for the taxable year from sources within the United States from such  securities) determined by multiplying the entire interest for the  taxable year from sources within the United States from such securities  by a fraction the numerator of which is 10 percent and the denominator  of which is the same percentage, determined on the basis of a monthly  average for the taxable year, as the book value of the total of such  securities held by the U.S. office through which such business is  carried on bears to the book value of the total assets of such office.  The amount of gain or loss, if any, for the taxable year from the sale  or exchange of such securities which shall be treated as effectively  connected for the taxable year with the active conduct of a banking,  financing, or similar business in the United States shall be an amount  (but not in excess of the entire gain or loss for the taxable year from  sources within the United States from the sale or exchange of such  securities) determined by multiplying the entire gain or loss for the  taxable year from sources within the United States from the sale or  exchange of such securities by the fraction described in the immediately  preceding sentence. The percentage of the denominator of the limiting  fraction for such purposes shall be the percentage obtained by  separately adding the book value of such securities and such total  assets held at the close of each month in the taxable year, dividing  each such sum by 12, and then dividing the amount of securities so  obtained by the amount of assets so obtained. This subdivision does not  apply to dividends from stock owned by a foreign corporation in a  domestic corporation of which more than 50 percent of the total combined  voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote is owned by such  foreign corporation and which is engaged in the active conduct of a  banking business in the United States. The application of this  subdivision may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Foreign corporation M, created under the laws of foreign  country Y, has in the United States a branch, B, which during the  taxable year is engaged in the active conduct of the banking business in  the United States within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph. During the taxable year M derives from sources within the  United States through the activities carried on through B, $7,500,000  interest from securities described in subdivision (b)(3) of this  subdivision (ii) and $7,500,000 gain from the sale or exchange of such  securities. The monthly average, determined as of the last day of each  month in the taxable year, of such securities held by B divided by the  monthly average, as so determined, of the total assets held by B equals  15 percent. Under this subdivision, the amount of interest income from  such securities that shall be treated as effectively connected for the  taxable year with the active conduct by M of a banking business in the  United States is $5 million ($7,500,000 interest x 10% / 15%), and the  amount of gain from the sale or exchange of such securities that shall  be treated as effectively connected for such year with the active  conduct of such business is $5 million ($7,500,000 gain x 10% / 15%).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Stocks or securities attributable to U.S. office--(a) In  general. For purposes of paragraph (c)(5)(ii) of this section, a stock  or security shall be deemed to be attributable to a U.S. office only if  such office actively and materially participated in soliciting,  negotiating, or performing other activities required to arrange the  acquisition of the stock or security. The U.S. office need not have been  the only active participant in arranging the acquisition of the stock or  security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. A stock or security shall not be deemed to be  attributable to a U.S. office merely because such office conducts one or  more of the following activities:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Collects or accounts for the dividends, interest, gain, or loss  from such stock or security,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exercises general supervision over the activities of the persons  directly responsible for carrying on the activities described in  paragraph (c)(5)(iii)(a) of this section,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Performs merely clerical functions incident to the acquisition  of such stock or security,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exercises final approval over the execution of the acquisition  of such stock or security, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Holds such stock or security in the United States or records  such stock or security on its books or records as having been acquired  by such office or for its account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(5)(iii)</em> as it appeared in the Code of Federal  Regulations revised as of April 1, 1983, shall apply to income received  or accured under a loan made by the taxpayer on or before May 18, 1984,  or pursuant to a written binding commitment entered into on or before  May 18, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Acquisitions in course of making loans to the public. For  purposes of subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A stock or security shall be considered to have been acquired in  the course of making a loan to the public where, for example, such stock  or security was acquired as additional consideration for the making of  the loan,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A stock or security shall be considered to have been acquired as  a result of making a loan to the public if, for example, such stock or  security was acquired by foreclosure upon a bona fide default of the  loan and is held as an ordinary and necessary incident to the active  conduct of the banking, financing, or similar business in the United  States, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A stock or security acquired on a stock exchange or organized  over-the-counter market shall be considered not to have been acquired as  a result of, or in the course of, making loans to the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Security defined. For purposes of this subparagraph, a security  is any bill, note, bond, debenture, or other evidence of indebtedness,  or any evidence of an interest in, or right to subscribe to or purchase,  any of the foregoing items.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Limitations on application of subparagraph--(a) Other business  activity. This subparagraph provides rules for determining when certain  income from stocks or securities is effectively connected with the  active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar business in the  United States. Any dividends, interest, gain, or loss from sources  within the United States which by reason of the application of  subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph is not effectively connected with  the active conduct by a nonresident alien individual or a foreign  corporation of a banking, financing, or similar business in the United  States may be effectively connected for the taxable year, under  subparagraph (2) or (3) of this paragraph with the conduct by such  taxpayer of another trade or business in the United States, such as, for  example, the business of selling or manufacturing goods or merchandise  or of trading in stocks or securities for the taxpayer's own account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Illustrations. The application of this subparagraph may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Foreign corporation F, which is created under the laws of  foreign country X and engaged in the active conduct of the banking  business in country X and a number of other foreign countries, has in  the United States a branch, B, which during the taxable year is engaged  in the active conduct of the banking business in the United States  within the meaning of subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.
