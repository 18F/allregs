A widow(er)  annuity based on having a ``child in care'' ends as shown in this  paragraph if he or she is not eligible for a widow(er) annuity based on  age as explained in part 216 of this chapter. However, see also  paragraph (d) of this section. If the widow(er) is eligible for a  widow(er) annuity based on age, when he or she is no longer entitled on  the basis of having a ``child in care,'' his or her annuity is changed  to a widow(er) annuity based on age.
