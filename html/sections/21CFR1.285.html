                                Sec. 1.285  What happens to food that is imported or offered for   under subpart H of this part?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consequences. If an article of food from a foreign facility that  is not registered as required under section 415 of the act (21 U.S.C.  350d) and subpart H of this part is imported or offered for import into  the United States, the food is subject to being held under section  801(l) of the act (21 U.S.C. 381(l)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hold. Unless CBP concurrence is obtained for export and the  article is immediately exported from the port of arrival, if an article  of food has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act, it  must be held within the port of entry for the article unless directed by  CBP or FDA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Status and movement of held food. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An article of food that  has been placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act shall be  considered general order merchandise as described in section 490 of the  Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1490).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Food under hold under section 801(l) of the act must be moved  under appropriate custodial bond unless immediately exported under CBP  supervision. If the food is to be held at the port, FDA must be notified  of the location where the food is held at the port before the food is  moved there. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside the  port, FDA must be notified of the location of the secure facility before  the food is moved there. The food subject to hold shall not be entered  and shall not be delivered to any importer, owner, or ultimate  consignee. If the food is to be held at a secure facility outside a  port, the food must be taken directly to that secure facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Segregation of held foods. If an article of food that has been  placed under   hold under section 801(l) of the act is part of a shipment that contains  articles that have not been placed under hold, the food under hold may  be segregated from the rest of the shipment. This segregation must take  place where the article is held. FDA or CBP may supervise segregation.  If FDA or CBP determine that supervision is necessary, segregation must  not take place without supervision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Costs. Neither FDA nor CBP will be liable for transportation,  storage, or other expenses resulting from any hold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Export after hold. An article of food that has been placed under  hold under section 801(l) of the act may be exported with CBP  concurrence and under CBP supervision unless it is seized or  administratively detained by FDA or CBP under other authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> No registration or request for review. If an article of food is  placed under hold under section 801(l) of the act and no registration  number or request for FDA review is submitted in accordance with  paragraph (j) of this section or export has not occurred in accordance  with paragraph (f) of this section, the food shall be dealt with as set  forth in CBP regulations relating to general order merchandise, except  that, unless otherwise agreed to by CBP and FDA, the article may only be  sold for export or destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual. If an  article of food carried by or otherwise accompanying an individual  arriving in the United States is not for personal use and is placed  under hold under section 801(l) of the act because it is from a foreign  facility that is not registered as required under section 415 of the act  and subpart H of this part, the individual may arrange to have the food  held at the port or exported. If such arrangements cannot be made, the  article of food may be destroyed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Post-hold submissions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To resolve a hold, if an article of  food is held under paragraph (b) of this section because it is from a  foreign facility that is not registered, the facility must be registered  and a registration number must be obtained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDA Prior Notice Center must be notified of the applicable  registration number in writing. The notification must provide the name  and contact information for the person submitting the information. The  notification may be delivered to FDA by fax or e-mail. The contact  information for these delivery methods is listed at http://www.fda.gov-- see Prior Notice. The notification should include the applicable CBP  entry identifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If FDA determines that the article is no longer subject to hold,  it will notify the person who provided the registration information and  CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under section 801(l) of  the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> FDA review after hold. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an article of food has been placed  under hold under section 801(l) of the act, a request may be submitted  asking FDA to review whether the facility associated with the article is  subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act. A request for  review may not be submitted to obtain a registration number.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A request may be submitted only by the carrier, submitter,  importer, owner, or ultimate consignee of the article. A request must  identify which one the requestor is.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request must be submitted in writing to FDA and delivered by  fax or e-mail. The location for receipt of a request is listed at http:/ /www.fda.gov--see Prior Notice. A request must include all factual and  legal information necessary for FDA to conduct its review. Only one  request for review may be submitted for each article under hold.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The request must be submitted within 5-calendar days of the  hold. FDA will review and respond within 5-calendar days of receiving  the request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If FDA determines that the article is not from a facility  subject to the requirements of section 415 of the act, it will notify  the requestor and CBP that the food is no longer subject to hold under  section 801(l) of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> International mail. If an article of food that arrives by  international mail is from a foreign facility that is not registered as  required under section 415 of the act and subpart H of this part, the  parcel will be held by CBP for 72 hours for FDA inspection and  disposition. If the article is placed under hold under section 801(l) of  the act and there   is a return address, the parcel may be returned to sender marked ``No  Registration--No Admission Permitted.'' If the article is under hold and  there is no return address or FDA determines that the article of food in  the parcel appears to present a hazard, FDA may dispose of or destroy  the parcel at its expense. If FDA does not respond within 72 hours of  the CBP hold, CBP may return the parcel to the sender marked ``No  Registration--No Admission Permitted'' or, if there is no return  address, destroy the parcel, at FDA expense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> of the act, entry may be made in accordance with  law and regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Relationship to other admissibility provisions. A determination  that an article of food is no longer subject to hold under section  801(l) of the act is different than, and may come before, determinations  of admissibility under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws. A  determination that an article of food is no longer under hold under  section 801(l) of the act does not mean that it will be granted  admission under other provisions of the act or other U.S. laws.</p>
