                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public reading room. Amtrak maintains a public reading room at its headquarters at 60 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E. in Washington, D.C. The public reading room contains records required under the FOIA to be regularly available for public inspection and copying. A current subject-matter index shall be

maintained of records in the public reading room that are available for inspection and copying. The index shall be updated at least quarterly with respect to newly included records. A copy of the index shall be provided upon request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Electronic reading room. Amtrak will make available electronically reading room records created by the Corporation on or after November 1, 1996 on its World Wide Web site which can be accessed at http://www.Amtrak.com. An index of the Corporation's reading room records will also be made available at the web site. The index will indicate reading room records that are available electronically.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frequently requested information. The FOIA requires that copies of records, regardless of form or format, released pursuant to a FOIA request under 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(3) that have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records be made publicly available. Such records created by the Corporation after November 1, 1996 will be made available electronically while records created prior to this date will be made available for inspection and copying in Amtrak's public reading room.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amtrak shall decide on a case-by-case basis whether records fall into the category of ``frequently requested FOIA records'' based on the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Previous experience with similar records;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The nature and type of information contained in the records;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The identity and number of requesters and whether there is widespread media or commercial interest in the records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provision in this paragraph is intended for situations where public access in a timely manner is important. It is not intended to apply where there may be a limited number of requests over a short period of time from a few requesters. Amtrak may remove the records from this category when it is determined that access is no longer necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guide for making requests. A guide on how to use the FOIA for requesting records from Amtrak shall be made available to the public upon request. Amtrak's major information systems will be described in the guide.</p>
