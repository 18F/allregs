                                Sec.  1033.1  Applicability.

                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part 1033 apply for all new locomotives and  all locomotives containing a new locomotive engine, except as provided  in Sec.  1033.5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Standards begin to apply each time a locomotive or locomotive  engine is originally manufactured or otherwise becomes new (defined in  Sec.  1033.901). The requirements of this part continue to apply as  specified after locomotives cease to be new.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards apply to the locomotive. However, in certain cases,  the manufacturer/remanufacturer is allowed to test a locomotive engine  instead of a complete locomotive, such as for certification. Also, you  are not required to complete assembly of a locomotive to obtain a  certificate of conformity for it, provided you meet the definition of  ``manufacturer'' or ``remanufacturer'' (as applicable) in Sec.   1033.901. For example, an engine manufacturer may obtain a certificate  for locomotives which it does not manufacture, if the locomotives use  its engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standards apply based on the year in which the locomotive was  originally manufactured. The date of original manufacture is generally  the date on which assembly is completed for the first time. For example,  all locomotives originally manufactured in calendar years 2002, 2003,  and 2004 are subject to the Tier 1 emission standards for their entire  service lives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following provisions apply when there are multiple persons  meeting the definition of manufacturer or remanufacturer in Sec.   1033.901:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each person meeting the definition of manufacturer must comply  with the requirements of this part that apply to manufacturers; and each  person meeting the definition of remanufacturer must comply with the  requirements of this part that apply to remanufacturers. However, if one  person complies with a specific requirement for a given locomotive, then  all manufacturers/remanufacturers are deemed to have complied with that  specific requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> We will apply the requirements of subparts C, D, and E of this  part to the manufacturer/remanufacturer that obtains the certificate of  conformity for the locomotive. Other manufacturers and remanufacturers  are required to comply with the requirements of subparts C, D, and E of  this part only when notified by us. In our notification, we will specify  a reasonable time period in which you need to comply with the  requirements identified in the notice. See Sec.  1033.601 for the  applicability of 40 CFR part 1068 to these other manufacturers and  remanufacturers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For example, we may require a railroad that installs certified  kits but does not hold the certificate to perform production line  auditing of the locomotives that it remanufactures. However, if we did,  we would allow the railroad a reasonable amount of time to develop the  ability to perform such auditing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The provisions of this part apply as specified for locomotives  manufactured or remanufactured on or after July 7, 2008. See Sec.   1033.102 to determine whether the standards of this part or the  standards of 40 CFR part 92 apply for model years 2008 through 2012. For  example, for a locomotive that was originally manufactured in 2007 and  remanufactured on April 10, 2014, the provisions of this part begin to  apply on April 10, 2014.</p>
