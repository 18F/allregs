                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a))</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a  person's information year is the fiscal year of the person. A filer is  not required to change its fiscal year or the plan year of a plan, to  report financial information for any accounting period other than an  existing fiscal year, or to report actuarial information for any plan  year other than an existing plan year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c).)</em></p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rule in  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Example 1. Companies A and B are the only members of the same  controlled group, and both are contributing sponsors to nonexempt plans.  Company A has a July 1 fiscal year, and Company B has an October 1  fiscal year. The information year is the calendar year. Company A's  financial information with respect to its fiscal year ending June 30,  2009, and Company B's financial information with respect to its fiscal  year ending September 30, 2009, must be submitted to the PBGC following  the end of the 2009 calendar year information year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that  Company B is not a contributing sponsor of a plan and would be an exempt  entity using the calendar year as the information year. Because Company  B is an exempt entity based on a calendar year information year, it is  excluded when determining the information year. Thus, the information  year is the July 1 fiscal year. Note that Company B is an exempt entity  even if it would not be exempt based on the July information year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2 except that  Company B would not be an exempt entity using the calendar year  information year but would be exempt based on an information year that  is the July 1 fiscal year. Since Company B is not exempt based on a  calendar year information year, it may not be excluded when determining  the information year. Therefore, the information year is the calendar  year and Company B is not an exempt entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for certain plan years. If a plan maintained by  the members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group has two plan  years that end in the information year or has no plan year that ends in  the information year, the last plan year ending on or immediately before  the end of information year is deemed to be the plan year ending within  the information year.
