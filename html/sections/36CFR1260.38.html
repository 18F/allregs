                                Sec. 1260.38  How does the NDC ensure the quality of declassification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">An interagency team of experienced declassification reviewers,  established by NDC, conducts a sampling of reviewed records according to  a sampling regime approved by a separate interagency program management  team. The interagency team will verify that each series of agency  reviewed records complies with the requirements of the Special  Historical Records Review Plan (Supplement) dated March 3, 2000 (DOE- NARA Plan), pursuant to the requirements of Public Law 105-261 (112  Stat. 2259) and Public Law No. 106-65 (113 Stat. 938). Record series  that cannot be verified to have been reviewed in accordance with the  DOE-NARA Plan will not proceed through the NDC verification process  until verification is received by the NDC. The DOE will participate on  the interagency team to conduct the quality control reviews required by  the DOE-NARA Plan in accordance with priorities established by the NDC.</p>
