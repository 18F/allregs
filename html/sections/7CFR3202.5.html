                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Manufacturers and vendors seeking USDA approval to use the certification mark for an eligible biobased product must submit a USDA-approved application for each biobased product. A standardized application form and instructions are available on the USDA BioPreferred Program Web site (http://www.biopreferred.gov). The contents of an acceptable application are as specified in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General content. The applicant must provide contact information and product information including all brand names or other identifying information, biobased content and testing documentation, intended uses, and, if applicable, the corresponding product category classification for Federal preferred procurement. The applicant must attach to the application documentation demonstrating that the reported biobased content was tested by a third-party testing entity that is ISO 9001 conformant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Certifications. The applicant must certify in the application that the product for which use of the certification mark is sought is a biobased product as defined in Sec. 3202.2 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Commitments. The applicant must sign a statement in the application that commits the applicant to submitting to USDA the information specified in paragraph (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section, which USDA will post to the USDA BioPreferred Program Web site, and to providing USDA with up-to-date information for posting on this Web site.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Application fee. Effective (date to be added after authority to collect fee is granted), applicants must submit an application fee of $500 with each completed application for certification. Instructions for submitting the application fee are available on the USDA BioPreferred Program Web site (http://www.biopreferred.gov), along with the application form and instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Evaluation of applications. (1) USDA will evaluate each application to determine if it contains the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section. If USDA determines that the application is not complete, USDA will return the application to the applicant with an explanation of its deficiencies. Once the deficiencies have been addressed, the applicant may resubmit the application, along with a cover letter explaining the changes made, for re-evaluation by USDA. USDA will evaluate resubmitted applications separately from first-time applications, and those with the earliest original application submittal date will be given first priority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> USDA will evaluate each application to determine if it contains the information specified in paragraph (a) of this section.

Applicants who receive a notice of denial of certification may appeal using the procedures specified in Sec. 3202.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice of certification. After notification that its application has been conditionally approved, the applicant must provide to USDA (for posting by USDA on the USDA BioPreferred Program Web site) the information specified in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section. Once USDA confirms that the information is received and complete, USDA will issue a notice of certification to the applicant.

mark is revised by USDA, manufacturers and vendors may continue to label their previously certified product only if it meets the new minimum biobased content level. In those cases where the biobased content of a certified product fails to meet the new minimum biobased content level, USDA will notify the manufacturer or vendor that their certification is no longer valid. Such manufacturers and vendors must increase the biobased content of their product to a level at or above the new minimum biobased content level and must re-apply for certification within 60 days if they wish to continue to use the certification mark. Manufacturers and vendors who have re-applied for certification may continue using the existing certification mark until they receive notification from USDA on the results of their re-application for certification.
