Consistent with guidance  issued by OFAC on February 14, 2008, a person whose property and  interests in property are blocked pursuant to an Executive Order or  regulations administered by OFAC is considered to have an interest in  all property and interests in property of an entity in which it owns,  directly or indirectly, a 50% or greater interest. The property and  interests in property of such an entity are blocked, regardless of  whether the entity itself is listed in the annex to an Executive order  or otherwise designated pursuant to such order.

The ERC will be chaired by  the Department of Commerce and will make all decisions to add an entry  to the Entity List by majority vote and all decisions to remove or  modify an entry by unanimous vote.</p><p class="depth0">When determining to add an entity to the Entity List or to modify an  existing entry, the ERC will also specify the section or sections of the  EAR that provide the basis for that determination. In addition, if the  section or sections that form the basis for an addition or modification  do not specify the license requirements, the license application review  policy or the availability of license exceptions, the ERC will specify  the license requirements, the license application review policy and  which license exceptions (if any) will be available for shipments to  that entity.</p><p class="depth0">Any agency that participates in the ERC may make a proposal for an  addition to, modification of or removal of an entry from the Entity List  by submitting that proposal to the chairman.</p><p class="depth0">The ERC will vote on each proposal no later than 30 days after the  chairman first circulates it to all member agencies unless the ERC  unanimously agrees to postpone the vote. If a member agency is not  satisfied with the outcome of the vote of the ERC that agency may  escalate the matter to the Advisory Committee on Export Policy (ACEP). A  member agency that is not satisfied with the decision of the ACEP may  escalate the matter to the Export Administration Review Board (EARB). An  agency that is not satisfied with the decision of the EARB may escalate  the matter to the President.</p><p class="depth0">The composition of the ACEP and EARB as well as the procedures and  time frames shall be the same as those specified in Executive Order  12981 as amended by Executive Orders 13020, 13026 and 13117 for license  applications. If at any stage, a decision by majority vote is not  obtained by the prescribed deadline the matter shall be raised to the  next level.</p><p class="depth0">A final decision by the ERC (or the ACEP or EARB or the President,  as may be applicable in a particular case) to make an addition to,  modification of, or removal of an entry from the Entity List shall  operate as clearance by all member agencies to publish the addition,  modification or removal as an amendment to the Entity List even if, in  the case of a decision by the ERC to add an entry or any decision by the  ACEP or EARB, such decision is not unanimous. Such amendments will not  be further reviewed through the regular Export Administration  Regulations interagency review process.</p><p class="depth0">A proposal by the ERC to make any change to the EAR other than an  addition to, modification of, or removal of an entry from the Entity  List shall operate as a recommendation and shall not be treated as  interagency clearance of an EAR amendment. The chairman of the ERC will  be responsible for circulating to all member agencies proposals  submitted to him by any member agency. The chairman will be responsible  for serving as secretary to the ACEP and EARB for all review of ERC  matters. The chairman will communicate all final decisions that require  Entity List amendments or individual ``is informed'' letters, to the  Bureau of Industry and Security which shall be responsible for drafting  the necessary changes to the Entity List. If the ERC decides in a  particular case that a party should be informed individually instead of  by EAR amendment the chairman will be responsible for preparing the ``is  informed'' letter for the signature of the Deputy Assistant Secretary  for Export Administration.</p><p class="depth0">A listed entity may present a request to remove or modify its Entity  List entry along with supporting information to the chairman at Room  3886, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue,  NW., Washington, DC 20230. The chairman shall refer all such requests  and supporting information to all member agencies. The member agencies  will review and vote on all such requests. The time frames, procedures  and right of escalation by a member agency that is dissatisfied with the  results that apply to proposals made by a member agency shall apply to  these requests. The decision of the ERC (or the ACEP or EARB or the  President, as may be applicable in a particular case) shall be the final  agency decision on the request and shall not be appealable under part  756 of the EAR. The chairman will prepare the response to the party who  made the request. The response will state the decision on the request  and the fact that the response is the final agency decision on the  request. The response will be signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary  for Export Administration.</p><p class="depth0">The End-User Review Committee will conduct a review of the entire  Entity List at least once per year for the purpose of determining  whether any listed entities should be removed or modified. The review  will include analysis of whether the criteria for listing the entity are  still applicable and research to determine whether the name(s) and  address(es) of each entity are accurate and complete and whether any  affiliates of each listed entity should be added or removed.
