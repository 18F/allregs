                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the Regional Supervisor determines that unitization of  operations within a proposed unit area is necessary to prevent waste,  conserve natural resources of the OCS, or protect correlative rights,  including Federal royalty interests, the Regional Supervisor may require  unitization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>; a proposed unit  operating agreement; a proposed initial plan of operation; supporting  geological, geophysical, and engineering data; and any other information  that may be necessary to show that unitization meets the criteria of  Sec.  250.1300. The proposed unit agreement must include a counterpart  executed by each lessee seeking compulsory unitization. Lessees who seek  compulsory unitization must simultaneously serve on the nonconsenting  lessees copies of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposed unit agreement with executed counterparts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposed unit operating agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposed initial plan of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the Regional Supervisor initiates compulsory unitization,  BSEE will serve all lessees of the proposed unit area with a proposed  unitization plan and a statement of reasons for the proposed  unitization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Regional Supervisor will not require unitization until BSEE  provides all lessees of the proposed unit area written notice and an  opportunity for a hearing. If you want BSEE to hold a hearing, you must  request it within 30 days after you receive written notice from the  Regional Supervisor or after you are served with a request for  compulsory unitization from another lessee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> BSEE will not hold a hearing under this paragraph until at least  30 days after BSEE provides written notice of the hearing date to all  parties owning interests that would be made subject to the unit  agreement. The Regional Supervisor must give all lessees of the proposed  unit area an opportunity to submit views orally and in writing and to  question both those seeking and those opposing compulsory unitization.  Adjudicatory procedures are not required. The Regional Supervisor will  make a decision based upon a record of the hearing, including any  written information made a part of the record. The Regional Supervisor  will arrange for a court reporter to make a verbatim transcript. The  party seeking compulsory unitization must pay for the court reporter and  pay for and provide to the Regional Supervisor within 10 days after the  hearing three copies of the verbatim transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Regional Supervisor will issue an order that requires or  rejects compulsory unitization. That order must include a statement of  reasons for the action taken and identify those parts of the record  which form the basis of the decision. Any adversely affected party may  appeal the final order of the Regional Supervisor under 30 CFR part 290.</p>
