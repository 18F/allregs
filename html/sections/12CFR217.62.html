                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A Board-regulated institution described in Sec. 217.61 must  provide timely public disclosures each calendar quarter of the  information in the applicable tables in Sec. 217.63. If a significant  change occurs, such that the most recent reported amounts are no longer  reflective of the Board-regulated institution's capital adequacy and  risk profile, then a brief discussion of this change and its likely  impact must be disclosed as soon as practicable thereafter. Qualitative  disclosures that typically do not change each quarter (for example, a  general summary of the Board-regulated institution's risk management  objectives and policies, reporting system, and definitions) may be  disclosed annually after the end of the fourth calendar quarter,  provided that any significant changes are disclosed in the interim. The  Board-regulated institution's management may provide all of the  disclosures required by Sec. Sec. 217.61 through 217.63 in one place on  the Board-regulated institution's public Web site or may provide the  disclosures in more than one public financial report or other regulatory  reports, provided that the Board-regulated institution publicly provides  a summary table specifically indicating the location(s) of all such  disclosures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Board-regulated institution described in Sec. 217.61 must  have a formal disclosure policy approved by the board of directors that  addresses its approach for determining the disclosures it makes. The  policy must address the associated internal controls and disclosure  controls and procedures. The board of directors and senior management  are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal  control structure over financial reporting, including the disclosures  required by this subpart, and must ensure that appropriate review of the  disclosures takes place. One or more senior officers of the Board- regulated institution must attest that the disclosures meet the  requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If a Board-regulated institution described in Sec. 217.61  concludes that specific commercial or financial information that it  would otherwise be required to disclose under this section would be  exempt from disclosure by the Board under the Freedom of Information Act  (5 U.S.C. 552), then the Board-regulated institution is not required to  disclose that specific information pursuant to this section, but must  disclose more general information about the subject matter of the  requirement, together with the fact that, and the reason why, the  specific items of information have not been disclosed.</p>
