                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A prevailing applicant may receive an award for fees and  expenses in connection with a proceeding, or in a discrete substantive  portion of the proceedings, unless the position of the Secretary was  substantially justified. The position of the Secretary includes, in  addition to the position taken by the Secretary in the adversary  adjudication, the action or failure to act by the Secretary upon which  the adversary adjudication is based. The burden   of persuasion that an award should not be made to an eligible prevailing  applicant because the Secretary's position was substantially justified  is on the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An award shall be reduced or denied if the applicant has unduly  or unreasonably protracted the proceeding. An award shall be denied if  special circumstances make an award unjust.  [46 FR 48080, Sept. 30, 1981, as amended at 52 FR 5456, Feb. 23, 1987]</p>
