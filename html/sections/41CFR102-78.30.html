Specifically, consulting parties include the State Historic Preservation Officer; the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer; Indian tribes and Native Hawaiian organizations; representatives of local governments; applicants for Federal assistance, permits, licenses, and other approvals; other individuals and organizations

with a demonstrated interest in the undertaking; and the Advisory Council (if it elects to participate in the consultation).</p>
