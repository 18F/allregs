                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment of securities. A paying agent is required to redeem  eligible securities during its regular business hours for any presenter,  whether or not a customer, who can establish his or her identity as the  owner or co-owner named on the securities, in accordance with the  provisions of this part, and the appendix to this part, and the Treasury  Identification Guide for Cashing United States Savings Bonds. An agent  is encouraged, but is not required, to redeem eligible securities during  its regular business hours for a surviving beneficiary, a legal  representative designated in the registration of securities presented,  or a legal representative of the last deceased registrant's estate who  can provide acceptable evidence (see Sec. 321.7 (d) or (f)) and  establish identity in accordance with this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Restrictions. A paying agent shall not advance money, make loans  on, or discount the redemption value of securities, nor in any manner  assist others to do so. An agent shall not pay a presenter the current  value of a security and then defer presentation to the Treasury for the  purpose of obtaining for its own profit an increased value.
