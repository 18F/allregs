                                Sec. 1.801-7  Variable annuities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) Section 801(g)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> provides that for purposes of  part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, an annuity contract  includes a contract which provides for the payment of a variable annuity  computed on the basis of recognized mortality tables and the investment  experience of the company issuing such a contract. A variable annuity  differs from the ordinary or fixed dollar annuity in that the annuity  benefits payable under a variable annuity contract vary with the  insurance company's investment experience with respect to such contracts  while the annuity benefits paid under a fixed dollar annuity contract  are guaranteed irrespective of the company's actual investment earnings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The reserves held with respect to the annuity contracts  described in section 801(g)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph  shall qualify as life insurance reserves within the meaning of section  801(b)(1) and paragraph (a) of   Sec. 1.801-4 provided such reserves are required by law (as defined in  paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.801-5) and are set aside to mature or  liquidate, either by payment or reinsurance, future unaccrued claims  arising from such contracts involving, at the time with respect to which  the reserve is computed, life, health, or accident contingencies.  Accordingly, a company issuing variable annuity contracts shall qualify  as a life insurance company for Federal income tax purposes if it  satisfies the requirements of section 801(a) (relating to the definition  of a life insurance company) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.801-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> (relating to certain changes in  reserves) or section 810 (d)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> (relating to adjustment for change in  computing reserves).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Current earnings rate. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The current earnings rate for any  taxable year with respect to the annuity contracts described in section  801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be the current  earnings rate determined under section 805(b)(2) and paragraph (a)(2) of  Sec. 1.805-5 with respect to such contracts, reduced by the percentage  obtained by dividing (a) the amount of the actuarial margin charge on  all such variable annuity contracts issued by the taxpayer, by (b) the  mean of the reserves for such contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of section 801(g)(3) and subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph, the term actuarial margin charge means any amount retained  by the company from gross investment income pursuant to the terms of the  variable annuity contract in excess of any portion of the investment  expenses which is attributable to such contract and which is deductible  under section 804(c) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.804-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Increases and decreases in reserves. (i) Section 801(g)(4)  provides that for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b) (relating to  adjustments for increases or decreases in certain reserves), the sum of  the items described in section 810(c) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.810-2  taken into account as of the close of the taxable year shall be  adjusted:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> of this  section by reason of realized or unrealized appreciation in the value of  the assets held in relation thereto, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> By adding thereto the sum of any amounts subtracted from time to  time (for the taxable year) from such reserves by reason of realized or  unrealized depreciation in the value of such assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The application of section 801(g)(4) and subdivision (i) of  this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Company M, a life insurance company issuing only variable  annuity contracts of the type described in section 801(g)(1) and  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, increased its life insurance reserves  held with respect to such contracts during the taxable year 1959 by  $275,000. Of the total increase in the reserves, $100,000 was  attributable to premium receipts, $50,000 to dividends and interest,  $100,000 to unrealized appreciation in the value of the assets held in  relation to such reserves, and $25,000 to realized capital gains on the  sale of such assets. As of the close of the taxable year 1959, the  reserves held by company M with respect to all variable annuity  contracts amounted to $1,275,000. However, under section 801(g)(4) and  subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, this amount must be reduced by the  $100,000 unrealized asset value appreciation and the $25,000 of realized  capital gains. Accordingly, for purposes of section 810 (a) and (b), the  amount of these reserves which is to be taken into account as of the  close of the taxable year 1959 under section 810(c) is $1,150,000  ($1,275,000 less $125,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Companies issuing variable annuities and other contracts. (1) In  the case of a life insurance company which issues both annuity contracts  described in section 801(g)(1) and paragraph (a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this section and  other contracts, the policy and other contract liability requirements  (as defined in section 805(a) and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.805-4) of  such a company for any taxable year shall be considered to be the sum  of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The policy and other contract liability requirements computed  with respect to the items which relate to such variable annuity  contracts, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The policy and other contract liability requirements computed  by excluding the items taken into account under subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved for regulations to be issued under section  801(g)(5)(B).]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> of this section shall not  apply with respect to any taxable year beginning after December 31,  1962.  [T.D. 6610, 27 FR 8717, Aug. 31, 1962]</p>
