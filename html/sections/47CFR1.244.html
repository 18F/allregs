The presiding judge shall suspend the procedural dates in the case and forward the request to the Chief Administrative Law Judge for action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, in the discretion of the Chief Administrative Law Judge, it appears that the appointment of a settlement judge will facilitate the settlement of the case, the Chief Judge will appoint a ``neutral'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 581 and 583(a) to act as the settlement judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The parties may request the appointment of a settlement judge of their own choosing so long as that person is a ``neutral'' as defined in 5 U.S.C. 581.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The appointment of a settlement judge in a particular case is subject to the approval of all the applicants in the proceeding. See 5 U.S.C. 583(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission's Administrative Law Judges are eligible to act as settlement judges, except that an Administrative Law Judge will not be appointed as a settlement judge in any case in which the Administrative Law Judge also acts as the presiding officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other members of the Commission's staff who qualify as neutrals may be appointed as settlement judges, except that staff members whose duties include drafting, review, and/or recommendations in adjudicatory matters pending before the Commission shall not be appointed as settlement judges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The settlement judge shall have the authority to require applicants to submit their written direct cases for review. The settlement judge may also meet with the applicants and/or their counsel, individually and/or at joint conferences, to discuss their cases and the cases of their competitors. All such meetings will be off-the-record, and the settlement judge may express an opinion as to the relative comparative standing of the applicants and recommend possible means to resolve the proceeding by settlement.
