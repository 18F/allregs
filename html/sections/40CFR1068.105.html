                            <p class="depth0">This section describes general provisions that apply to equipment  manufacturers for sources subject to engine-based standards. See the  standard-setting part for any requirements that apply for certain  applications. See Sec.  1068.101 for penalties associated with  violations under this section and for other prohibitions related to your  equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> by knowingly  installing engines that were stockpiled by engine suppliers in violation  of Sec.  1068.103(f). Note that this allowance does not apply for  equipment subject to equipment-based standards. See 40 CFR 1060.601 for  similar provisions that apply for equipment subject to evaporative  emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installing engines or certified components. The provisions in  Sec.  1068.101(a)(1) generally prohibit you from introducing into U.S.  commerce any new equipment that includes engines not covered by a  certificate of conformity. In addition, you must follow the engine  manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions. For example,  you may need to constrain where you place an exhaust aftertreatment  device or integrate into your equipment models a device for sending  visual or audible signals to the operator. Similarly, you must follow  the emission-related installation instructions from the manufacturer of  a component that has been certified for controlling evaporative  emissions under 40 CFR part 1060. Not meeting the manufacturer's  emission-related installation instructions is a violation of one or more  of the prohibitions of Sec.  1068.101. See Sec.  1068.261 for special  provisions that apply when the engine manufacturer delegates final  assembly of emission controls to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attaching a duplicate label. If you obscure the engine's label,  you must do four things to avoid violating Sec.  1068.101(a)(1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Send a request for duplicate labels in writing on your company's  letterhead to the engine manufacturer. Include the following information  in your request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the type of equipment and the specific engine and  equipment models needing duplicate labels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the family (from the original engine label).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State the reason that you need a duplicate label for each  equipment model.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identify the number of duplicate labels you will need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permanently attach the duplicate label to your equipment by  securing it to a part needed for normal operation and not normally  requiring replacement. Make sure an average person can easily read it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Destroy any unused duplicate labels if you find that you will  not need them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Keep the following records for at least eight years after the  end of the model year identified on the engine label:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Keep a copy of your written request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Keep drawings or descriptions that show how you apply the  duplicate labels to your equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain a count of those duplicate labels you use and those  you destroy.
