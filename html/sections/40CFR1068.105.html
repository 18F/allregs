                            <p class="depth0">This section describes general provisions that apply to equipment manufacturers for sources subject to engine-based standards. See the standard-setting part for any requirements that apply for certain applications. See Sec.  1068.101 for penalties associated with violations under this section and for other prohibitions related to your equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transitioning to new engine-based standards. If new engine-based emission standards apply in a given model year, your equipment in that calendar year must have engines that are certified to the new standards, except that you may continue to use up normal inventories of earlier engines that were built before the date of the new or changed

standards. For purposes of this paragraph (a), normal inventory applies for engines you possess and engines from your engine supplier's inventory. (Note: this paragraph (a) does not apply in the case of new remanufacturing standards.) For example, if your normal inventory practice is to keep on hand a one-month supply of engines based on your upcoming production schedules, and a new tier of standards starts to apply for the 2015 model year, you may order engines consistent with your normal inventory requirements late in the engine manufacturer's 2014 model year and install those engines in your equipment, regardless of the date of installation. Also, if your model year starts before the end of the calendar year preceding new standards, you may use engines from the previous model year for those units you produce before January 1 of the year that new standards apply. If emission standards for the engine do not change in a given model year, you may continue to install engines from the previous model year without restriction (or any earlier model year for which the same standards apply). You may not circumvent the provisions of Sec.  1068.101(a)(1) by stockpiling engines that were built before new or changed standards take effect. Similarly, you may not circumvent the provisions of Sec.  1068.101(a)(1) by knowingly installing engines that were stockpiled by engine suppliers in violation of Sec.  1068.103(f). Note that this allowance does not apply for equipment subject to equipment-based standards. See 40 CFR 1060.601 for similar provisions that apply for equipment subject to evaporative emission standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installing engines or certified components. The provisions in Sec.  1068.101(a)(1) generally prohibit you from introducing into U.S. commerce any new equipment that includes engines not covered by a certificate of conformity. In addition, you must follow the engine manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions. For example, you may need to constrain where you place an exhaust aftertreatment device or integrate into your equipment models a device for sending visual or audible signals to the operator. Similarly, you must follow the emission-related installation instructions from the manufacturer of a component that has been certified for controlling evaporative emissions under 40 CFR part 1060. Not meeting the manufacturer's emission-related installation instructions is a violation of one or more of the prohibitions of Sec.  1068.101. See Sec.  1068.261 for special provisions that apply when the engine manufacturer delegates final assembly of emission controls to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attaching a duplicate label. If you obscure the engine's label, you must do four things to avoid violating Sec.  1068.101(a)(1):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Send a request for duplicate labels in writing on your company's letterhead to the engine manufacturer. Include the following information in your request:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the type of equipment and the specific engine and equipment models needing duplicate labels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Identify the family (from the original engine label).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> State the reason that you need a duplicate label for each equipment model.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Identify the number of duplicate labels you will need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Permanently attach the duplicate label to your equipment by securing it to a part needed for normal operation and not normally requiring replacement. Make sure an average person can easily read it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Destroy any unused duplicate labels if you find that you will not need them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Keep the following records for at least eight years after the end of the model year identified on the engine label:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Keep a copy of your written request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Keep drawings or descriptions that show how you apply the duplicate labels to your equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Maintain a count of those duplicate labels you use and those you destroy.
