                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you qualify for the economic hardship provisions specified in  40 CFR 1068.245, we may approve a period of delayed compliance for up to  one model year total.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> are intended to address  problems that could occur near the date on which more stringent emission  standards become effective, such as the transition from the Tier 2  standards to the Tier 3 standards for line-haul locomotives on January  1, 2012.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In appropriate extreme and unusual circumstances that are  clearly outside the control of the manufacturer and could not have been  avoided by the exercise of prudence, diligence, and due care, we may  permit you, for a brief period, to introduce into commerce locomotives  which do not comply with the applicable emission standards if all of the  following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You cannot reasonably manufacture the locomotives in such a  manner that they would be able to comply with the applicable standards.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacture of the locomotives was substantially completed  prior to the applicability date of the standards from which you seek the  relief. For example, you may not request relief for a locomotive that  has been ordered, but for which you will not begin the assembly process  prior to the applicability date of the standards. On the other hand, we  would generally   consider completion of the underframe weldment to be a substantial part  of the manufacturing process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacture of the locomotives was previously scheduled to be  completed at such a point in time that locomotives would have been  included in the previous model year, such that they would have been  subject to less stringent standards, and that such schedule was feasible  under normal conditions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You demonstrate that the locomotives comply with the less  stringent standards that applied to the previous model year's production  described in paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section, as prescribed by  subpart C of this part (i.e., that the locomotives are identical to  locomotives certified in the previous model year).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> You exercised prudent planning, were not able to avoid the  violation, and have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the extent of  the nonconformity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> We approve your request before you introduce the locomotives  into commerce.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must notify us as soon as you become aware of the extreme or  unusual circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include locomotives for which we grant relief under this  section in the engine family for which they were originally intended to  be included.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the locomotives are to be included in an engine family  that was certified to an FEL above the applicable standard, you must  reserve credits to cover the locomotives covered by this allowance and  include the required information for these locomotives in the end-of- year report required by subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In granting relief under this section, we may also set other  conditions as appropriate, such as requiring payment of fees to negate  an economic gain that such relief would otherwise provide.</p>
