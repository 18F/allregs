                            <p class="depth0">An administrative employee is an employee whose primary duty is the  performance of office or non-manual work directly related to the  management or general business operations, as distinguished from  production functions, of the employer or the employer's customers and  whose primary duty includes the exercise of discretion and independent  judgment with respect to matters of significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general, the exercise of discretion and independent judgment  involves the comparison and the evaluation of possible courses of  conduct, and acting or making a decision after the various possibilities  have been considered. The term ``matters of significance'' refers to the  level of importance or consequence of the work performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The phrase discretion and independent judgment must be applied  in light of all the facts involved in the particular employment  situation in which the question arises. Factors to consider when  determining whether an employee exercises discretion and independent  judgment with respect to matters of significance include, but are not  limited to, whether the employee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has authority to formulate, affect, interpret, or implement  management policies or operating practices;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carries out major assignments in conducting the operations of  the organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performs work that affects the organization's operations to a  substantial degree, even if the employee's assignments are related to  operation of a particular segment of the organization;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has authority to commit the employer in matters that have  significant financial impact;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has authority to waive or deviate from established policies and  procedures without prior approval;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Has authority to negotiate and bind the organization on  significant matters;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provides consultation or expert advice to management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Is involved in planning long- or short-term organizational  objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Investigates and resolves matters of significance on behalf of  management; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Represents the organization in handling complaints, arbitrating  disputes, or resolving grievances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The exercise of discretion and independent judgment implies that  the employee has authority to make an independent choice, free from  immediate direction or supervision. However, an employee can exercise  discretion and independent judgment even if the employee's decisions or  recommendations are reviewed at a higher level. Thus, the term  discretion and independent judgment does not require that decisions made  by an employee have a finality that goes with unlimited authority and a  complete absence of review. The decisions made as a result of the  exercise of discretion and independent judgment may consist of  recommendations for action rather than the actual taking of action. The  fact that an employee's decision may be subject to review and that upon  occasion the decisions are revised or reversed after review does not  mean that the employee is not exercising discretion and independent  judgment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An organization's workload may make it necessary to employ a  number of employees to perform the same or similar work. The fact that  many employees perform identical work or work of the same relative  importance does not mean that the work of each such employee does not  involve the exercise of discretion and independent judgment with respect  to matters of significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The exercise of discretion and independent judgment must be more  than the use of skill in applying well-established techniques,  procedures, or specific standards described in manuals or other sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The use of manuals, guidelines, or other established procedures  containing or relating to highly technical, scientific, legal,  financial, or other similarly complex matters that can be understood or  interpreted only by those with advanced or specialized knowledge or  skills does not preclude exemption. Such manuals and procedures provide  guidance in addressing difficult or novel circumstances and thus use of  such reference material would not affect an employee's exemption status.  However, employees who simply apply well-established techniques or  procedures described in manuals or other sources within closely  prescribed limits to determine the correct response to an inquiry or set  of circumstances will be nonexempt.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An employee does not exercise discretion and independent  judgment with respect to matters of significance merely because the  employer will experience financial losses if the employee fails to  perform the job properly. For example, a messenger who is entrusted with  carrying large sums of money does not exercise discretion and  independent judgment with respect to matters of significance even though  serious consequences may flow from the employee's neglect. Similarly, an  employee who operates very expensive equipment does not exercise  discretion and independent judgment with respect to matters of  significance merely because improper performance of the employee's  duties may cause serious financial loss to the employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employees in certain occupations typically assist and support  line managers and assume facets of the overall management function.  Neither the location of the work nor the number of employees performing  the same or similar work turns such work into a production function. For  example, independent agencies or agency components often provide  centralized human resources, information systems, procurement and  acquisition, or financial management services as support services to  other agencies or agency components. However, this does not change the  inherent administrative nature of   the work performed to line or production work. Similarly, employees who  develop, interpret, and oversee agency or Governmentwide policy are  performing management support functions. Some of these activities may be  performed by employees who would otherwise qualify under another  exemption. Depending upon the purpose of the work and the organizational  context, work in certain occupations may be either exempt or nonexempt.  For example, criminal investigators who perform work directly related to  the internal management of the agency and typically would be expected to  provide recommendations of great significance based on the analysis of  investigative findings would likely be considered as performing a staff  function. In contrast, the performance of investigative and inspectional  work to confirm whether specific regulatory requirements have been met  for an investigative/inspectional component of any agency would likely  be considered as performing a line rather than a staff function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to  complete major projects (such as acquisitions; negotiating real estate  transactions or collective bargaining agreements; designing and  implementing productivity improvements; oversight, compliance, or  program reviews; investigations) generally meets the duties requirements  for the administrative exemption, even if the employee does not have  direct supervisory responsibility over the other employees on the team.  An example is a lead auditor who oversees an audit team in an auditing  agency and who is assigned responsibility for leading a major audit  requiring the use of substantial agency resources. This auditor is  responsible for proposing the parameters of the audit and developing a  plan of action and milestones to accomplish the audit. Included in the  plan are the methodologies to be used, the staff and other resources  required to conduct the audit, proposed staff member assignments, etc.  When conducting the audit, the lead auditor makes on-site decisions and/ or proposes major changes to managers on matters of significance in  accomplishing the audit, including deviations from established policies  and practices of the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> An executive assistant or administrative assistant to a high  level manager or senior executive generally meets the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without  specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated  authority regarding matters of significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Human resources employees who formulate, interpret or implement  human resources management policies generally meet the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption. In addition, when  interviewing and screening functions are performed by the human  resources employee who makes the hiring decision or makes  recommendations for hiring from a pool of qualified applicants, such  duties constitute exempt work, even though routine, because this work is  directly and closely related to the employee's exempt functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Management analysts who study the operations of an organization  and propose changes in the organization, program analysts who study  program operations and propose changes to the program, and other  management advisors generally meet the duties requirements for the  administrative exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Acquisition employees with authority to bind the organization to  significant purchases generally meet the duties requirements for the  administrative exemption even if they must consult with higher  management officials when making a commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption. Inspectors normally  perform specialized work along standardized lines involving well- established techniques and procedures which may have been catalogued and  described in manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely on  techniques and skills acquired by special training or experience. They  have some leeway in the performance of their work but only within  closely prescribed limits.</p>
