                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The percentage of the obligation for which Applicant seeks a  guarantee is a matter of negotiation between the Lender and the  Applicant, subject to the Administrator's approval. The maximum  percentage of the total obligation that the Administrator will guarantee  is 80 percent. The amount of guarantee allowed will depend on the total  credit quality of the transaction and the level of risk believed to be  assumed by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A guarantee under this part constitutes an obligation supported  by the full faith and credit of the United States and is incontestable  except for fraud or misrepresentation of which a Lender or Holder has  actual knowledge at the time it becomes such Lender or Holder or which a  Lender or Holder participates in or condones. In addition, the guarantee  will be unenforceable by the Lender or the Holder to the   extent any loss is occasioned by the violation of usury laws, negligent  servicing, or failure to obtain the required security regardless of the  time at which the Administrator acquires knowledge thereof. Any losses  occasioned will be unenforceable to the extent that loan funds are used  for purposes other than those specifically approved by FRA in its  guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator may guarantee an Applicant's obligation to any  Lender provided such Lender can establish to the satisfaction of the  Administrator that it has the legal authority and sufficient expertise  and financial strength to operate a successful lending program. Loan  guarantees will only be approved for Lenders with adequate experience  and expertise to make, secure, service, and collect the loans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Lender may sell all of the guaranteed portion of the loan on  the secondary market, provided the loan is not in default, or retain the  entire loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When a guaranteed portion of a loan is sold to a Holder, the  Holder shall succeed to all rights of the Lender under the loan  guarantee to the extent of the portion purchased. The Lender will remain  bound to all obligations under the loan guarantee and the provisions of  this part. In the event of material fraud, negligence or  misrepresentation by the Lender or the Lender's participation in or  condoning of such material fraud, negligence or misrepresentation, the  Lender will be liable for payments made by the Agency to any Holder.</p>
