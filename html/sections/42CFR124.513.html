                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Effect of certification. The Secretary may certify a facility  which meets the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section  as a ``public facility''. A facility which is so certified is not  required to comply with this subpart except as otherwise herein  provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Criteria for qualification. A public facility may qualify for  certification under this section if all of the following criteria are  met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is a facility which is owned and operated by a unit of State  or local government or a quasi-public corporation as defined at 42 CFR  124.2(m).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It provides health services without charge or at a substantially  reduced rate to persons who are determined by the facility to qualify  therefor under a program of discounted health services. A ``program of  discounted health services'' must provide for financial and other  objective eligibility criteria and procedures, including notice prior to  nonemergency service, that assure effective opportunity for all persons  to apply for and obtain a determination of eligibility for such  services, including a determination prior to service where requested;  provided that, such criteria and procedures are not required where the  facility makes all services available to all persons at no or nominal  charge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It received, for the three most recent fiscal years, at least  10 percent of its total operating revenue (net patient revenue plus  other operating revenue, exclusive of any amounts received, or if not  received, claimed, as reimbursement under titles XVIII and XIX of the  Social Security Act) from State and local tax appropriations or other  State and local government revenues, or from a quasi-public corporation  as defined at 42 CFR 124.2(m), to cover operating deficits attributable  to the provision of discounted services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If provided, in each of the three most recent fiscal years,  uncompensated services under this subpart or under programs described by  the documentation provided under Sec.  124.513(c)(2) in an amount not  less than twice the annual compliance level computed under Sec.   124.503(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for certification. To be certified under this  section, a facility must submit to the Secretary, in addition to other  materials that the Secretary may from time to time require, copies of  the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Audited financial statements or official State or local  government documents (such as annual reports or budget documents), for  the three most recent fiscal years, sufficient to show that the facility  meets the criteria in paragraph (b)(3)(i) or (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A complete description of its program(s) of discounted health  services, including charging and collection policies of the facility,  and eligibility criteria and notice and determination procedures used  under its program(s) of discounted services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Period of effectiveness. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A certification by the Secretary  under this section remains in effect until withdrawn. The Secretary may  disallow credit under this subpart when the Secretary determines that  there has been a material change in any factor upon which certification  was based or substantial noncompliance with this subpart. The Secretary  may withdraw certification where the change or noncompliance has not  been adequately remedied or otherwise continues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Deficits--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Title VI-assisted facilities with assessed  deficits. Where a facility assisted under title VI of the Act has been  assessed as having a deficit under Sec.  124.503(b) that has not been  made up prior to certification under this section, the facility may make  up that deficit by either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Demonstrating to the Secretary's satisfaction, that it met the  requirements of paragraph (b) of this section for each year in which a  deficit was assessed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Providing an additional period of service under this section on  the basis of one (or portion of a) year of certification for each year  (or portion of a year) of deficit assessed. The period of obligation  applicable to the facility under Sec.  124.501(b) shall be extended  until the deficit is made up in accordance with the preceding sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Title VI-assisted facilities which have not been assessed.  Where any period of compliance under this subpart of a facility assisted  under title VI of the Act has not been assessed, the facility will be  presumed to have no allowable credit for such period. The facility may  either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Make up such deficit in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of  this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Submit an independent certified audit, conducted in accordance  with procedures specified by the Secretary, of the facility's records  maintained pursuant to Sec.  124.510. If the audit establishes to the  Secretary's satisfaction that no, or a lesser, deficit exists for the  period in question, the facility will receive credit for the period so  justified. Any deficit which the Secretary determines still remains must  be made up in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Title XVI-assisted facilities. (A) A facility assisted under  title XVI of the Act which has an assessed deficit which was not made up  prior to certification under this section shall make up that deficit in  accordance with paragraph (d)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> of this section. If it cannot  make the showing required by that paragraph, it shall make up the  deficit when its certification under this section is withdrawn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A facility assisted under title XVI of the Act whose compliance  with this subpart has not been completely assessed will be presumed to  have no allowable credit for the unassessed period. The facility may  make up the deficit by--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Following the procedure of subparagraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(iii)(A)</em> of this  section.
