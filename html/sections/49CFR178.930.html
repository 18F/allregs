                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The provisions in this section apply to fiberboard Large  Packagings intended to contain solids. Rigid fiberboard Large Packaging  types are designated:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 50G fiberboard</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Construction requirements for fiberboard Large Packagings. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Fiberboard Large Packagings must be constructed of strong, solid or  double-faced corrugated fiberboard (single or multiwall) that is  appropriate to the capacity of the Large Packagings and to their  intended use. Water resistance of the outer surface must be such that  the increase in mass, as determined in a test carried out over a period  of 30 minutes by the Cobb method of determining water absorption, is not  greater than 155 grams per square meter (0.0316 pounds per square  foot)--see ISO 535 (E) (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).  Fiberboard must have proper bending qualities. Fiberboard must be cut,  creased without cutting through any thickness of fiberboard, and slotted  so as to permit assembly without cracking, surface breaks or undue  bending. The fluting or corrugated fiberboard must be firmly glued to  the facings.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The walls, including top and bottom, must have a minimum  puncture resistance of 15 Joules (11 foot-pounds of energy) measured  according to ISO 3036 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturers' joints in the outer packaging of Large  Packagings must be made with an appropriate overlap and be taped, glued,  stitched with metal staples or fastened by other means at least equally  effective. Where joints are made by gluing or taping, a water resistant  adhesive must be used. Metal staples must pass completely through all  pieces to be fastened and be formed or protected so that any inner liner  cannot be abraded or punctured by them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Integral and detachable pallets. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any integral pallet base  forming part of a Large Packaging or any detachable pallet must be  suitable for mechanical handling with the Large Packaging filled to its  maximum permissible gross mass.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The pallet or integral base must be designed to avoid  protrusions causing damage to the fiberboard Large Packagings in  handling.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The body must be secured to any detached pallet to ensure  stability in handling and transport. Where a detachable pallet is used,  its top surface must be free from protrusions that might damage the  Large Packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Strengthening devices, such as timber supports to increase  stacking performance may be used but must be external to the liner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The load-bearing surfaces of Large Packagings intended for  stacking must be designed to distribute the load in a stable manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fiberboard Large Packagings may not have a volumetric capacity  greater than 3,000 L (793 gallons) and not less than 450 L (119  gallons).
