                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. A nonresident alien individual is required to make a  payment of estimated tax if that individual's gross income meets the  requirements of section 6654 and Sec. 1.6654-1. In making the  determination under section 6654 as to whether the amount of the gross  income of a nonresident alien individual is such as to require making a  payment of estimated income tax, only the filing status relating to a  single individual (other than a head of household) or to a married  individual not entitled to file a joint return shall apply, unless an  election is in effect 1 for the taxable year under section 6013(g) or  (h) and the regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of gross income. To determine the gross income of  a nonresident alien individual who is not, or does not expect to be, a  bona fide resident of Puerto Rico or a possession to which section 931  applies during the entire taxable year, see section 872 and Sec. Sec.  1.872-1 and 1.872-2. To determine the gross income of a nonresident  alien individual who is, or expects to be, a bona fide resident of  Puerto Rico or a possession to which section 931 applies during the  entire taxable year, see section 876 and the regulations. For rules for  determining whether an individual is a bona fide resident of a United  States possession (including Puerto Rico), see section 937 and the  regulations.
