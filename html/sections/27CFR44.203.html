Such copies of the notice of removal should be filed with the  related   shipper's export declaration, Commerce Form 7525-V.

After the vessel or aircraft on which the shipment  has been laden clears or departs from the port of lading the customs  authority shall execute the certificate of exportation on both copies of  the notice of removal, retain one copy for his records, and deliver or  transmit the other copy to the manufacturer or export warehouse  proprietor making the shipment for filing with the appropriate TTB  officer.
