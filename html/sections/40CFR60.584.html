                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a solvent recovery emission control device shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring system which continuously measures and records the VOC concentration of the exhaust vent stream from the control device and shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The continuous monitoring system shall be installed in a location that is representative of the VOC concentration in the exhaust vent, at least two equivalent stack diameters from

the exhaust point, and protected from interferences due to wind, weather, or other processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and record the average exhaust vent VOC concentration in parts per million by volume. After the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and, in addition to the record made by the continuous monitoring device, record the average exhaust vent VOC concentration for each 3-hour clock period of printing operation when the average concentration is greater than 50 ppm and more than 20 percent greater than the average concentration value demonstrated during the most recent performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a thermal incineration emission control device shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain a monitoring device that continuously measures and records the temperature of the control device exhaust gases and shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The continuous monitoring device shall be calibrated annually and have an accuracy of 0.75 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in degrees Celsius, or 2.5 [deg]C, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and record the average temperature of the control device exhaust gases. After the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and record, in addition to the record made by the continuous monitoring device, the average temperature for each 3-hour clock period of printing operation when the average temperature of the exhaust gases is more than 28 [deg]C (50 [deg]F) below the average temperature demonstrated during the most recent performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility controlled by a catalytic incineration emission control device shall install, calibrate, operate, and maintain monitoring devices that continuously measure and record the gas temperatures both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed and shall comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each continuous monitoring device shall be calibrated annually and have an accuracy of 0.75 percent of the temperature being measured, expressed in degrees Celsius, or 2.5 [deg]C, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and record the average gas temperature both upstream and downstream of the catalyst bed. After the performance test, the owner or operator shall determine and record, in addition to the record made by the continuous monitoring device, the average temperatures for each 3-hour clock period of printing operation when the average temperature of the gas stream before the catalyst bed is more than 28 [deg]C below the average temperature demonstrated during the most recent performance test or the average temperature difference across the catalyst bed is less than 80 percent of the average temperature difference of the device during the most recent performance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall record time periods of operation when an emission control device is not in use.
