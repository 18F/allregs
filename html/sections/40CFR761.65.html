                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to the storage for disposal of PCBs at concentrations of 50 ppm or greater and PCB Items with PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em> Storage limitations. Any PCB waste shall be disposed of as required by subpart D of this part within 1-year from the date it was determined to be PCB waste and the decision was made to dispose of it. This date is the date of removal from service for disposal and the point at which the 1-year time frame for disposal begins. PCB/radioactive waste removed from service for disposal is exempt from the 1-year time limit provided that the provisions at paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section are followed and the waste is managed in accordance with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations for the management of radioactive material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Storage limitations. Any PCB waste shall be disposed of as required by subpart D of this part within 1-year from the date it was determined to be PCB waste and the decision was made to dispose of it. This date is the date of removal from service for disposal and the point at which the 1-year time frame for disposal begins. PCB/radioactive waste removed from service for disposal is exempt from the 1-year time limit provided that the provisions at paragraphs (a)(2)(ii) and (a)(2)(iii) of this section are followed and the waste is managed in accordance with all other applicable Federal, State, and local laws and regulations for the management of radioactive material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> One-year extension. Any person storing PCB waste that is subject to the 1-year time limit for storage and disposal in paragraph (a)(1) of this section may provide written notification to the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCB waste is stored that their continuing attempts to dispose of or secure disposal for their waste within the 1-year time limit have been unsuccessful. Upon receipt of the notice by the EPA Regional Administrator, the time for disposal is automatically extended for 1 additional year (2 years total) if the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The notification is received by the EPA Regional Administrator at least

30 days before the initial 1-year time limit expires and the notice identifies the storer, the types, volumes, and locations of the waste and the reasons for failure to meet the initial 1-year time limit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A written record documenting all continuing attempts to secure disposal is maintained until the waste is disposed of.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The written record required by paragraph (a)(2)(ii) of this section is available for inspection or submission if requested by EPA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Continuing attempts to secure disposal were initiated within 270 days after the time the waste was first subject to the 1-year time limit requirement, as specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Failure to initiate and continue attempts to secure disposal throughout the total time the waste is in storage shall automatically disqualify the notifier from receiving an automatic extension under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional extensions. Upon written request, the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the wastes are stored or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, may grant additional extensions beyond the 1-year extension authorized in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. At the time of the request, the requestor must supply specific justification for the additional extension and indicate what measures the requestor is taking to secure disposal of the waste or indicate why disposal could not be conducted during the period of the prior extension. The EPA Regional Administrator or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters may require, as a condition to granting any extension under this section, specific actions including, but not limited to, marking, inspection, recordkeeping, or financial assurance to ensure that the waste does not pose an unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Storage at an approved facility. Increased time for storage may be granted as a condition of any TSCA PCB storage or disposal approval, by the EPA Regional Administrator for the Region in which the PCBs or PCB Items are to be stored or disposed of, or by the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if EPA determines that there is a demonstrated need or justification for additional time, that the owner or operator of the facility is pursuing relevant treatment or disposal options, and that no unreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment will result from the increased storage time. In making this determination, EPA will consider such factors as absence of any approved treatment technology and insufficient time to complete the treatment or destruction process. EPA may require as a condition of the approval that the owner or operator submit periodic progress reports.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2), (c)(1), (c)(7), (c)(9), and (c)(10) of this section, after July 1, 1978, owners or operators of any facilities used for the storage of PCBs and PCB Items designated for disposal shall comply with the following storage unit requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The facilities shall meet the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Adequate roof and walls to prevent rain water from reaching the stored PCBs and PCB Items;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An adequate floor that has continuous curbing with a minimum 6 inch high curb.

This includes activities such as ground-water monitoring, run-on and run-off control, and facility security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> A schedule for closure of each area of the facility where PCB waste is stored or handled, including the total time required to close each area of PCB waste storage or handling, and the time required for any intervening closure activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> An estimate of the expected year of closure of the PCB waste storage areas, if a trust fund is opted for as the financial mechanism.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A written closure plan determined to be acceptable by EPA under this section shall become a condition of any approval granted under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A separate and new closure plan need not be submitted in cases where a facility is currently covered by a TSCA approval or a RCRA permit, upon a showing to the satisfaction of the Regional Administrator (or the appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if the commercial storage area is ancillary to a disposal facility for which an official at EPA Headquarters has approval authority) that the existing closure plan is substantially equivalent to closure plans required under paragraphs (d) through (g) of this section, and that the plan adequately accounts for PCB waste inventories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The commercial storer of PCB waste shall submit a written request to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan) for a modification to its storage approval to amend its closure plan, whenever:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Changes in ownership, operating plans, or facility design affect the existing closure plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There is a change in the expected date of closure, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In conducting closure activities, unexpected events require a modification of the approved closure plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Regional Administrator or the Director, appropriate official at EPA Headquarters, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan, may modify the existing closure plan under the conditions described in paragraph (e)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Commercial storers of PCB waste shall comply with the following closure schedule:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The commercial storer shall notify in writing the Regional Administrator or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan, at least 60

days prior to the date on which final closure of its PCB storage facility is expected to begin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date when a commercial storer of PCB waste ``expects to begin closure'' shall be no later than 30 days after the date on which the storage facility received its final quantities of PCB waste. For good cause shown, EPA may extend the date for commencement of closure for an additional 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Within 90 days after receiving the final quantity of PCB waste for storage, a commercial storer of PCB waste shall remove all PCB waste in storage at the facility from the facility in accordance with the approved closure plan. For good cause shown, EPA may approve a reasonable extension to the period for removal of the PCB waste.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A commercial storer of PCB waste shall complete closure activities in accordance with the approved closure plan and within 180 days after receiving the final quantity of PCB waste for storage at the facility. For good cause shown, EPA may approve a reasonable extension to the closure period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> During the closure period, all contaminated system component equipment, structures, and soils shall be disposed of in accordance with the disposal requirements of subpart D of this part, or, if applicable, decontaminated in accordance with the levels specified in the PCB Spills Cleanup Policy at subpart G of this part. When PCB waste is removed from the storage facility during closure, the owner or operator becomes a generator of PCB waste subject to the generator requirements of subpart J of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Within 60 days of completion of closure of each facility for the storage of PCB waste, the commercial storer of PCB waste shall submit to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if an official at EPA Headquarters approved the closure plan), by registered mail, a certification that the PCB storage facility has been closed in accordance with the approved closure plan. The certification shall be signed by the owner or operator and by an independent registered professional engineer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Closure cost estimate. (1) A commercial storer of PCB wastes shall have a detailed estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with its approved closure plan. The closure cost estimate shall be in writing, be certified by the person preparing it (using the certification defined in Sec. 761.3) and comply with all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A commercial storer of PCB wastes shall have a detailed estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of closing the facility in accordance with its approved closure plan. The closure cost estimate shall be in writing, be certified by the person preparing it (using the certification defined in Sec. 761.3) and comply with all of the following criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The closure cost estimate shall equal the cost of final closure at the point in the PCB storage facility's active life when the extent and manner of PCB storage operations would make closure the most expensive, as indicated by the facility's closure plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The closure cost estimate shall be based on the costs to the owner or operator of hiring a third party to close the facility, and the third party shall not be either a corporate parent or subsidiary of the owner or operator, or member in joint ownership of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The owner or operator shall include in the estimate the current market costs for off-site commercial disposal of the facility's maximum estimated inventory of PCB wastes, except that on-site disposal costs may be used if on-site disposal capacity will exist at the facility at all times over the life of the PCB storage facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The closure cost estimate may not incorporate any salvage value that may be realized with the sale of wastes, facility structures or equipment, land, or other assets associated with the facility at the time of closure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> During the active life of the PCB storage facility, the commercial storer of PCB waste shall adjust annually for inflation the closure cost estimate within 60 days prior to the anniversary date of the establishment of the financial instruments used to demonstrate financial responsibility for closure, except that owners or operators who use the financial test or corporate guarantee shall adjust their closure cost estimates for inflation within 30 days after the close of the storer's fiscal year. The adjustment may be made by recalculating the maximum costs of closure in current dollars, or by using an inflation factor derived from the most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product published by

the U.S. Department of Commerce in its Survey of Current Business. The Implicit Price Deflator for Gross National Product is included in a monthly publication titled Economic Indicators, which is available from the Superintendent of Documents, Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. The inflation factor used in the latter method is the result of dividing the latest published annual Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year. The adjustment to the closure cost estimate is then made by multiplying the most recent closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Where EPA approves a modification to the facility's closure plan, and that modification increases the cost of closure, the owner or operator shall revise the closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after the modification is approved. Any such revision shall also be adjusted for inflation in accordance with paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The owner or operator of the facility shall keep at the facility during its operating life the most recent closure cost estimate, including any adjustments resulting from inflation or from modifications to the closure plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Financial assurance for closure. A commercial storer of PCB waste shall establish financial assurance for closure of each PCB storage facility that he owns or operates. In establishing financial assurance for closure, the commercial storer of PCB waste may choose from the following financial assurance mechanisms or any combination of mechanisms:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The ``closure trust fund,'' as specified in Sec. 264.143(a) of this chapter, except for paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 264.143. For purposes of this paragraph, the following provisions also apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments into the trust fund shall be made annually by the owner or operator over the remaining operating life of the facility as estimated in the closure plan, or over 3 years, whichever period is shorter. This period of time is hereafter referred to as the ``pay-in period.'' For an existing facility, the first payment must be made within 30 calendar days after EPA has notified the facility of its conditional approval. Interim approval to operate is canceled and the application is denied if EPA does not receive verification that the payment was made in that 30-day period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For a new facility, the first payment into the closure trust fund shall be made before EPA grants final approval of the application and before the facility may accept the initial shipment of PCB waste for commercial storage. A receipt from the trustee shall be submitted by the owner or operator to the Regional Administrator (or the Director, Office of Resource Conservation and Recovery, if the commercial storage area is ancillary to a disposal facility approved by an official at EPA Headquarters) before this initial delivery of PCB waste. The first payment shall be at least equal to the current closure cost estimate, divided by the number of years in the pay-in period, except as provided in paragraph (g)(7) of this section for multiple mechanisms. Subsequent payments shall be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment. The amount of each subsequent payment shall be determined by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an owner or operator of a facility existing on the effective date of this paragraph establishes a trust fund to meet the financial assurance requirements of this paragraph, and the value of the trust fund is less than the current closure cost estimate when a final approval is granted for the facility, the amount of the current closure cost estimate still to be paid into the trust fund shall be paid in over the pay-in period as defined in paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section. Payments shall continue to be made no later than 30 days after each anniversary date of the first payment made into the trust fund. The amount of each payment shall be determined by subtracting the current value of the trust fund from the current closure cost estimate, and dividing this difference by the number of years remaining in the pay-in period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The submission of a trust agreement with the wording specified in Sec. 264.151(a)(1) of this chapter, including

any reference to hazardous waste management facilities, shall be deemed to be in compliance with the requirement to submit a trust agreement under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The ``surety bond guaranteeing payment into a closure trust fund,'' as specified in Sec. 264.143(b) of this chapter, including the use of the surety bond instrument specified at Sec. 264.151(b) of this chapter and the standby trust specified at Sec. 264.143(b)(3) of this chapter.
