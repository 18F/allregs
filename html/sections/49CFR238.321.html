                            <p class="depth0">When a passenger car is out of service for 30 or more consecutive  days or is out of service when it is due for any test or inspection  required by Sec. 238.307 or Sec. 238.309 an out of use notation showing  the number of out of service days shall be made in the records required  under Secs. 238.307(e) and 238.309(f). If the passenger car is out of  service for one or more periods of at least 30 consecutive days, the  interval prescribed for any test or inspection required by Secs. 238.307  and 238.309 may be extended by the number of days in each period the  passenger car is out of service since the last test or inspection in  question. A movement made in accordance with Sec. 229.9 of this chapter  or Sec. 238.17 is not considered service for the purposes of determining  the out-of-service credit.  [71 FR 61862, Oct. 19, 2006]</p>
