                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Carcasses, parts of carcasses, and other products condemned at  official establishments having facilities for tanking shall, except as  provided in paragraph (c) of this section or elsewhere in this part, be  disposed of by tanking as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lower opening of the tank shall first be sealed securely by  a Program employee, except when permanently connected with a blow line;  then the condemned products shall be placed in the tank in his presence,  after which the upper opening shall also be sealed securely by such  employee, who shall then see that the contents of the tank are subjected  to sufficient heating for sufficient time to effectively destroy the  contents for human food purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The use of equipment such as crushers or hashers for pretanking  preparation of condemned products in the inedible products department  has been found to give inedible character and appearance to the  material. Accordingly, if condemned products are so crushed or hashed,  conveying systems, rendering tanks, and other equipment used in the  further handling of crushed or hashed material need not be locked or  sealed during the tanking operations. If the rendering tanks or other  equipment contain condemned material not so crushed or hashed, the  equipment shall be sealed as prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. If the crushed or hashed material is not rendered in the  establishment where produced, it shall be denatured as provided for in  Sec. 314.3 before leaving such establishment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The seals of tanks shall be broken only by a Program employee  and only after the contents of the tanks have been treated as provided  in paragraph (a) of this section. The rendered fat derived from  condemned material shall be held until a Program employee shall have had  an opportunity to determine whether it conforms with the requirements of  this section. Samples shall be taken by Program employees as often as is  necessary to determine whether the rendered fat is effectually  denatured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Carcasses of animals condemned under Sec. 309.3 of this  subchapter may be disposed of as provided in Sec. 314.3, in lieu of  tanking, with the approval of the inspector.</p>
