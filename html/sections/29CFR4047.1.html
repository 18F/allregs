                            <p class="depth0">Section 4047 of ERISA gives the PBGC broad authority to take any  necessary actions in furtherance of a plan restoration order issued  pursuant to section 4047. This part (along with Treasury regulation 26  CFR 1.412(c)(1)-3) describes certain legal obligations that arise  incidental to a plan restoration under section 4047. This part also  establishes procedures with respect to these obligations that are  intended to facilitate the orderly transition of a restored plan from  terminated (or terminating) status to ongoing status, and to help ensure  that the restored plan will continue to be ongoing consistent with the  best interests of the plan's participants and beneficiaries and the  single-employer insurance program. This part applies to terminated and  terminating single-employer plans (except for plans terminated and  terminating under ERISA section 4041(b)) with respect to which the PBGC  has issued or is issuing a plan restoration order pursuant to ERISA  section 4047.</p>
