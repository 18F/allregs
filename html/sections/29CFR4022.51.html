                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(19)</em> of ERISA,  determined as of the plan's termination date. A plan's amount of  unfunded nonguaranteed benefits is multiplied by the applicable recovery  ratio to determine the aggregate amount to be allocated with respect to  participants of the plan under section 4022(c)(1) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Benefits included in unfunded nonguaranteed benefits. For  purposes of computing benefits under section 4022(c) of ERISA in a PPA  2006 bankruptcy termination, unfunded nonguaranteed benefits are  benefits under a plan as of the plan's termination date that are neither  guaranteed by PBGC (taking into account section 4022(g) of ERISA) nor  funded by the plan's assets (taking into account section 4044(e) of  ERISA).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of ERISA is  determined as follows. The numerator is based on PBGC's recoveries under  section 4062, 4063, or 4064, valued as of the plan's (or plans')  termination date (or dates). The denominator of the recovery ratio is  based on the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities, as defined in  section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, as of the plan's (or plans') termination  date (or dates).
