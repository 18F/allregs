                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As the relative location of shipyards, design offices, and Coast  Guard offices vary throughout the country, no specific routing will be  required in the submittal of plans. In general, one of the following  procedures would apply, but in a particular case, if a more expeditious  procedure can be used, there will be no objection to its adoption.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The plans may be submitted to the Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection, in the district in which the vessel is to be built. This  procedure will be most expeditious in the case of those offices where  personnel and facilities are available for examination and approval of  plans locally.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The plans may be submitted by visitors directly to the  Commanding Officer, Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard, 4200 Wilson  Boulevard Suite 400, Arlington, VA 22203, or transmitted by mail to:  Commanding Officer (MSC), Attn: Marine Safety Center, U.S. Coast Guard  Stop 7410, 4200 Wilson Boulevard Suite 400, Arlington, VA 20598-7410, in  a written or electronic format. Information for submitting the VSP  electronically can be found at http://www.uscg.mil/HQ/MSC. In this case,  the plans will be returned directly to the submitter, with a copy of the  action being forwarded to the interested Officer in Charge, Marine  Inspection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of classed vessels, upon specific request by the  submitter, the American Bureau of Shipping will arrange to forward the  necessary plans to the Coast Guard indicating its action thereon. In  this case, the plans will be returned as noted in paragraph (a)(2) of  this section.
