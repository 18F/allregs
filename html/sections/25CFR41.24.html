                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Navajo Community College is entitled to annual grants for operation and maintenance of the College in amounts based upon the number of Full-Time Equivalent Indian students in attendance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Annually, in the manner and within the deadline established by the Director of Education, the Navajo Community College shall submit an application in the form of a statement of its FTE enrollment (total and Indian) for the next academic year. The statement shall include a description of the College's curriculum, which may be in the form of a College catalog or like publication, and a proposed budget showing total expected operating expenses of educational programs and expected revenue from all sources for the academic year for which the information applies. The statement shall be certified by the chief executive officer of the College and shall certify that a copy of that statement has been submitted to the Navajo Tribe.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual budget request for the College shall be sparately identified in the Bureau of Indian Affairs Budget Justifications. Funds appropriated for grants under this subpart shall not be commingled with other funds appropriations historically expended by the Bureau of Indian Affairs for programs and projects normally provided on the Navajo Reservation for Navajo beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within thirty (30) days of submission of the statement required under paragraph (b) of this section, the Director of Education shall make a grant award to the College in an amount determined under paragraph (e) of this section. The grant award shall be evidenced by a grant agreement signed by

the Director of Education, incorporating the grant application and including the provisions required by Sec. 41.27 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The College shall be eligible to receive a grant for the fiscal year beginning October 1, 1979, and for each succeeding year, in an amount equal to $4,000 multiplied by the number of FTE Indian students in attendance at the College during each academic term divided by the number of academic terms in the academic year, except that no such grant shall exceed the annual operating expenses of the education programs provided by the College. The mathematical formula for calculating the base grant is BG (Base Grant)=[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC14NO91.121

where FTE is the Indian FTE for each of the academic terms during the academic year calculated in conformity with Sec. 41.22(g) of this subpart and N is the number of academic terms in the academic year. The amount and payment of such grants shall be subject to the availability of annual appropriations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Director of Education shall authorize payments to the College in advance installments by letter of credit or Treasury check in an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the grant amount available for allotment to the College for such academic year under paragraph (e) of this section on or before October 1st of such academic year (except 1979-80) or the first day on which appropriations for the fiscal year beginning on such date are available for obligation by BIA, whichever occurs later, based on the number of FTE Indian students calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of the final academic term of the preceding year. On or before January 1st (or such other date that is the first day of the fifth month) of such academic year, payment shall be made in the form of such advance installments to the College in an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the grant amount available for allotment to the College for such academic year under paragraph (e) of this section, calculated on the basis of registrations as in effect at the conclusion of the sixth week of the academic year, less the amount previously advanced for such academic year. On or before July 1st (or such other date that is the first day of the eleventh month) of such academic year, the balance of the grant amount to which the College is entitled under paragraph (e) of this section shall be paid to the College. In the event that additional sums are appropriated for the benefit of the College, these sums shall be included in the final payment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Overpayments of grants under this subpart may be recovered in the manner provided by Sec. 41.8(g) of subpart A.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payments to the Navajo Community College under this subpart shall not disqualify the College from applying for or receiving grants or contracts under any other Federal programs for which it may qualify.</p>
