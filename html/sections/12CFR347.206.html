                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Domestic retail deposit activity. To initiate or conduct domestic retail deposit activity requiring deposit insurance protection in any state after December 19, 1991, a foreign bank must establish one or more insured U.S. bank subsidiaries for that purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to any bank organized under the laws of any territory of the United States, Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands the deposits of which are insured by the FDIC pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Grandfathered insured branches. Domestic retail accounts with balances of less than an amount equal to the SMDIA that require deposit insurance protection may be accepted or maintained in an insured branch of a foreign bank only if such branch was an insured branch on December 19, 1991</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Change in ownership of grandfathered insured branch. The grandfathered status of an insured branch may not be transferred, except in certain merger and acquisition transactions that the FDIC determines are not designed, or motivated by the desire, to avoid compliance with section 6(d)(1) of the International Banking Act (12 U.S.C. 3104(d)(1)).
