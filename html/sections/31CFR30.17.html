                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The requirements under this part with respect to sections 111(b), 111(c), 111(d) and 111(f) are effective upon June 15, 2009. The guidance under this part with respect to those sections supersedes any previous guidance applicable to a TARP recipient to the extent that guidance is inconsistent with those requirements, but supersedes that guidance only as of June 15, 2009. To the extent previous contractual provisions are not inconsistent with ARRA or the guidance under this part, those contractual provisions remain in effect and continue to apply in accordance with their terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bonus payment limitation. The bonus payment limitation provision under Sec. 30.10 (Q-10) of this part does not apply to bonus payments paid or accrued by TARP recipients or their employees before June 15, 2009. Certain bonus payments may relate to a service period beginning before and ending after June 15, 2009. In these circumstances, the employee will not be treated as having accrued the bonus payment on or after June 15, 2009 if the bonus payment is at least reduced to reflect the portion of the service period that occurs after June 15, 2009. If the employee is an SEO or most highly compensated employee at the time the net bonus payment after such reduction would otherwise be paid, the amount still may not be paid until such time as bonus payments to that employee are permitted.</p>
