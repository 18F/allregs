                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A launch operator must perform a ground safety analysis for  launch vehicle hardware, ground hardware including launch site and  ground support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations  at a launch site in the United States. The requirements of this section  apply to the performance of the ground safety analysis and to the ground  safety analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA  as required by Sec. 417.402(d). This analysis must identify each  potential hazard, each associated cause, and each hazard control that a  launch operator must establish and maintain to keep each identified  hazard from affecting the public. A launch operator must incorporate the  launch site operator's systems and operations involved in ensuring  public safety into the ground safety analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technical personnel who are knowledgeable of launch vehicle  systems, launch processing, ground systems, operations, and their  associated hazards must prepare the ground safety analysis. These  individuals must be qualified to perform the ground safety analysis  through training, education, and experience.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A launch operator must ensure personnel performing a ground  safety analysis or preparing a ground safety analysis report will have  the cooperation of the entire launch operator's organization. A launch  operator must maintain supporting documentation and it must be available  upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A launch operator must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Begin a ground safety analysis by identifying the systems and  operations to be analyzed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Define the extent of each system and operation being assessed to  ensure there is no miscommunication as to what the hazards are, and who,  in a launch operator's organization or other organization supporting the  launch, controls those hazards; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure that the ground safety analysis accounts for each launch  vehicle system and operation involved in   launch processing and post-launch operations, even if only to show that  no hazard exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A ground safety analysis need not account for potential hazards  of a component if a launch operator demonstrates that no hazard to the  public exists at the system level. A ground safety analysis need not  account for an operation's individual task or subtask level if a launch  operator demonstrates that no hazard to the public exists at the  operation level. A launch operator must provide verifiable controls for  hazards that are confined within the boundaries of a launch operator's  facility to ensure the public will not have access to the associated  hazard area while the hazard exists.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A launch operator must identify each potential hazard, including  non-credible hazards. The probability of occurrence is not relevant with  respect to identifying a hazard. Where an assertion is made that no  hazard exists for a particular system or operation, the ground safety  analysis must provide the rationale. A launch operator must identify the  following hazards of each launch vehicle system, launch site and ground  support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> System hazards, including explosives and other ordnance, solid  and liquid propellants, toxic and radioactive materials, asphyxiants,  cryogens, and high pressure. System hazards generally exist even when no  operation is occurring; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Operation hazards derived from an unsafe condition created by a  system, operating environment, or an unsafe act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A launch operator must categorize identified system and  operation hazards as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public hazard. A hazard that extends beyond the launch location  under the control of a launch operator. Public hazards include the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Blast overpressure and fragmentation resulting from an  explosion;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fire and deflagration, including hazardous materials such as  radioactive material, beryllium, carbon fibers, and propellants. A  launch operator must assume that in the event of a fire, hazardous smoke  from systems containing hazardous materials will reach the public;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sudden release of a hazardous material into the air, water, or  ground; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inadvertent ignition of a propulsive launch vehicle payload,  stage, or motor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Launch location hazard. A hazard that stays within the confines  of the location under the control of a launch operator but extends  beyond individuals doing the work. The confines may be bounded by a wall  or a fence line of a facility or launch complex, or by a fenced or  unfenced boundary of an entire industrial complex or multi-user launch  site. A launch location hazard may affect the public depending on public  access controls. Launch location hazards that may affect the public  include the hazards listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section  and additional hazards in potentially unsafe locations accessible to the  public such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Unguarded electrical circuits or machinery;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Oxygen deficient environments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Falling objects;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Potential falls into unguarded pits or from unguarded elevated  work platforms; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Sources of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation such as x-rays,  radio transmitters, and lasers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employee hazard. A hazard to individuals performing a launch  operator's work, but not to other people in the area. A launch operator  must comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local employee  safety regulations. A launch operator's ground safety analysis must  identify employee hazards and demonstrate that there are no associated  public safety issues.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-credible hazard. A hazard for which possible adverse effects  on people or property would be negligible and where the possibility of  adverse effects on people or property is remote. A launch operator's  ground safety analysis must identify non-credible hazards and  demonstrate that the hazard is non-credible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A ground safety analysis must identify each hazard cause for  each public hazard and launch location hazard. The ground safety  analysis must   account for conditions, acts, or chain of events that can result in a  hazard. The ground safety analysis must account for the possible failure  of any control or monitoring circuitry within hardware systems that can  cause a hazard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> A ground safety analysis must identify the hazard controls to be  established by a launch operator for each hazard cause identified in  paragraph (h) of this section. A launch operator's hazard controls  include the use of engineering controls for the containment of hazards  within defined areas and the control of public access to those areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A launch operator must verify all information in a ground safety  analysis, including design margins, fault tolerance and successful  completion of tests. A launch operator must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Trace any identified hardware to an engineering drawing or other  document that describes hardware configuration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Trace any test or analysis used in developing the ground safety  analysis to a report or memorandum that describes how the test or  analysis was performed;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensure the accuracy of the test or analysis and the associated  results;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Trace any procedural hazard control identified to a written  procedure, and approved by the person designated under Sec.  417.103(b)(2) or the person's designee, with the paragraph or step  number of the procedure specified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify a verifiable hazard control for each hazard; if a  hazard control is not verifiable, a launch operator may include it as an  informational note on the hazard analysis form;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> For each hazard control, reference a released drawing, report,  procedure or other document that verifies the existence of the hazard  control; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Maintain records, as required by Sec. 417.15, of the  documentation that verifies the information in the ground safety  analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A launch operator must ensure the continuing accuracy of its  ground safety analysis. The analysis of systems and operations must not  end upon submission of a ground safety analysis report to the FAA during  the license application process. A launch operator must analyze each new  or modified system or operation for potential hazards that can affect  the public. A launch operator must ensure that each existing system and  operation is subject to continual scrutiny and that the information in a  ground safety analysis report is kept current.</p>
