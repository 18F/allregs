The Superintendent will consider the following points when reviewing a request for a solo climb: The weather prediction for the estimated duration of the climb, and the likelihood of new snowfall, sleet, fog , or hail along the route, the feasibility of climbing the chosen route because of normal inherent hazards,

current route conditions, adequacy of equipment and clothing, and qualifying experience necessary for the route contemplated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Backcountry Camping--(1) Backcountry camping permits required.
