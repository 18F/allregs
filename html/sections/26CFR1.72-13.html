                                Sec. 1.72-13  Special rule for employee contributions recoverable
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amounts received as an annuity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 72(d) provides a  special rule for the treatment of amounts received as an annuity by an  employee (or by the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee) under a  contract to which section 72 applies. This special rule is applicable  only in the event that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least part of the consideration paid for the contract is  contributed by the employer, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under such  contract by the employee (or by his beneficiary or beneficiaries if the  employee died before any amount was received as an annuity under the  contract) within the 3-year period beginning on the date (whether or not  before January 1, 1954) on which an amount is first received as an  annuity equals or exceeds the total consideration contributed (or deemed  contributed under section 72(f) and Sec. 1.72-8) by the employee as of  such date as reduced by all amounts previously received and excludable  from the gross   income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law.  In such an event, section 72(d) provides that all amounts received as an  annuity under the contract during a taxable year to which the Code  applies shall be excluded from gross income until the total of the  amounts excluded under that section plus all amounts excluded under  prior income tax laws equals or exceeds the consideration contributed  (or deemed contributed) by the employee. The excess, if any, and all  amounts received by any recipient thereafter (whether or not received as  an annuity), shall be fully included in gross income. See paragraph (b)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under the  contract within three years from the date on which an amount is first  received as an annuity thereunder will not equal or exceed the  consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee in  accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.72-8, computed as of such  date, the special rule of section 72(d) shall not apply to amounts  received as an annuity under the contract and the general rules of  section 72 shall apply thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of Sec. 1.72-2 for rules for  determining what constitutes ``the contract'' in the case of  distributions from an employees' trust or plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If subparagraphs (1) and (3) of this paragraph apply to amounts  received as an annuity under a contract, the rule prescribed in  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply to all amounts so  received thereunder regardless of the fact that they may be payable (i)  to more than one beneficiary, (ii) for the same or different intervals,  (iii) in different sums, or (iv) for a different period certain, life,  or lives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of section 72(d), contributions which are made with  respect to a self-employed individual and which are allowed as a  deduction under section 404(a) are not considered contributions by the  employee, but such contributions are considered contributions by the  employer. A contribution which is deemed paid in a prior taxable year  under the provisions of section 404(a)(6) shall be considered made with  respect to a self-employed individual if the individual on whose behalf  the contribution is made was self-employed for the taxable year in which  the contribution is deemed paid, whether or not such individual is self- employed at the time the contribution is actually paid. Contributions  with respect to a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee used  to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for  such owner-employee shall not be treated as consideration for the  contract contributed by the employee in computing the employee  contributions for purposes of section 72(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of Sec. 1.72-11. All  other amounts not received as an annuity shall be included in the gross  income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of section  72(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (c), (d), or (f), whichever is applicable, of  Sec. 1.72-11. See section 72(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amounts received after the exhaustion of employee contributions.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts received under a contract to which the rule of paragraph (a)  of this section applies (whether or not such amounts are received as an  annuity) shall be included in the gross income of   the recipient if such amounts are received after the date on which the  aggregate of all amounts excluded from gross income by the recipients  under section 72(d) and prior income tax laws equalled or exceeded the  consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies to amounts  received by an employee (or his beneficiary or beneficiaries) under a  joint and survivor annuity contract, payments made to a prior annuitant  may entirely exhaust the amounts excludable from gross income. In such  case, amounts paid to the surviving annuitant (or annuitants) shall be  included in gross income by such recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> to the contract, trust, or plan as a  whole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inapplicability of section 72(d) and this section. Section 72(d)  and this section do not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts received as proceeds of a life insurance contract to  which section 101(a) applies, nor to</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts paid to a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor  annuity contract to which paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.72-5 applies, nor  to</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts paid to an annuitant under Chapter 73 of title 10 of the  United States Code with respect to which section 72(o) and Sec. 1.122-1  apply.  See also paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.72-14.
