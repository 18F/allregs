                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Amounts received as an annuity. (1) Section 72(d) provides a special rule for the treatment of amounts received as an annuity by an employee (or by the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee) under a contract to which section 72 applies. This special rule is applicable only in the event that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 72(d) provides a special rule for the treatment of amounts received as an annuity by an employee (or by the beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee) under a contract to which section 72 applies. This special rule is applicable only in the event that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At least part of the consideration paid for the contract is contributed by the employer, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under such contract by the employee (or by his beneficiary or beneficiaries if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity under the contract) within the 3-year period beginning on the date (whether or not before January 1, 1954) on which an amount is first received as an annuity equals or exceeds the total consideration contributed (or deemed contributed under section 72(f) and Sec. 1.72-8) by the employee as of such date as reduced by all amounts previously received and excludable from the gross

income of the recipient under the applicable income tax law.
In such an event, section 72(d) provides that all amounts received as an annuity under the contract during a taxable year to which the Code applies shall be excluded from gross income until the total of the amounts excluded under that section plus all amounts excluded under prior income tax laws equals or exceeds the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee. The excess, if any, and all amounts received by any recipient thereafter (whether or not received as an annuity), shall be fully included in gross income. See paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the aggregate amount receivable as an annuity under the contract within three years from the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity thereunder will not equal or exceed the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.72-8, computed as of such date, the special rule of section 72(d) shall not apply to amounts received as an annuity under the contract and the general rules of section 72 shall apply thereto.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The aggregate of the amounts receivable as an annuity within the prescribed 3-year period shall be the total of all annuity payments anticipatable by an employee (or a beneficiary or beneficiaries of an employee, if the employee died before any amount was received as an annuity) under the contract as a whole as defined in paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.72-2. See paragraph (a)(3) of Sec. 1.72-2 for rules for determining what constitutes ``the contract'' in the case of distributions from an employees' trust or plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If subparagraphs (1) and (3) of this paragraph apply to amounts received as an annuity under a contract, the rule prescribed in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph shall apply to all amounts so received thereunder regardless of the fact that they may be payable (i) to more than one beneficiary, (ii) for the same or different intervals, (iii) in different sums, or (iv) for a different period certain, life, or lives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of section 72(d), contributions which are made with respect to a self-employed individual and which are allowed as a deduction under section 404(a) are not considered contributions by the employee, but such contributions are considered contributions by the employer. A contribution which is deemed paid in a prior taxable year under the provisions of section 404(a)(6) shall be considered made with respect to a self-employed individual if the individual on whose behalf the contribution is made was self-employed for the taxable year in which the contribution is deemed paid, whether or not such individual is self-employed at the time the contribution is actually paid. Contributions with respect to a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee used to purchase life, accident, health, or other insurance protection for such owner-employee shall not be treated as consideration for the contract contributed by the employee in computing the employee contributions for purposes of section 72(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Amounts not received as an annuity. If the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies to a contract and, after the date on which an annuity payment is first received, amounts are received other than as an annuity under such contract in a taxable year to which the Code applies, they shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.72-11. Thus, if such amounts are received as a dividend or a similar distribution after the date on which an amount is first received as an annuity under the contract, they shall be included in the gross income of the recipient (in accordance with section 72(e)(1)(A) and paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 1.72-11. All other amounts not received as an annuity shall be included in the gross income of the recipient in accordance with the provisions of section 72(e)(1)(B) and paragraph (c), (d), or (f), whichever is applicable, of Sec. 1.72-11. See section 72(e)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amounts received after the exhaustion of employee contributions. (1) Amounts received under a contract to which the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies (whether or not such amounts are received as an annuity) shall be included in the gross income of

the recipient if such amounts are received after the date on which the aggregate of all amounts excluded from gross income by the recipients under section 72(d) and prior income tax laws equalled or exceeded the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts received under a contract to which the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies (whether or not such amounts are received as an annuity) shall be included in the gross income of

the recipient if such amounts are received after the date on which the aggregate of all amounts excluded from gross income by the recipients under section 72(d) and prior income tax laws equalled or exceeded the consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the rule of paragraph (a) of this section applies to amounts received by an employee (or his beneficiary or beneficiaries) under a joint and survivor annuity contract, payments made to a prior annuitant may entirely exhaust the amounts excludable from gross income. In such case, amounts paid to the surviving annuitant (or annuitants) shall be included in gross income by such recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of section 72(d) to a contract, trust, or plan providing for payments in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.72-2. For the purpose of applying section 72(d) and this section, any amount received in the nature of a periodic payment under a contract, trust, or plan which provides for the payment of amounts in a manner described in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of Sec. 1.72-2 shall be considered an amount received as an annuity notwithstanding the provisions of any other section of the regulations under section 72. The special exclusion rule of section 72(d) and paragraph (a) of this section shall apply to all amounts so received if the first amount received, when multiplied by the number of periodic payments to be made within the three years beginning on the date of its receipt, results in an amount in excess of the aggregate premiums or other consideration contributed (or deemed contributed) by the employee as of that date. If more than one series of periodic payments is to be paid under the same contract, trust, or plan, all payments anticipatable, whether because fixed in amount or determinable in the manner described in the preceding sentence, shall be aggravated for the purpose of determining the applicability of section 72 (d) to the contract, trust, or plan as a whole.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Inapplicability of section 72(d) and this section. Section 72(d) and this section do not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Amounts received as proceeds of a life insurance contract to which section 101(a) applies, nor to</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Amounts paid to a surviving annuitant under a joint and survivor annuity contract to which paragraph (b)(3) of Sec. 1.72-5 applies, nor to</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amounts paid to an annuitant under Chapter 73 of title 10 of the United States Code with respect to which section 72(o) and Sec. 1.122-1 apply.
