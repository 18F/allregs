                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Description. A letter of availability (sometimes inappropriately called a letter of intent) is a letter to a supplier that primarily seeks to reserve a place on the supplier's production or delivery schedule for long lead-time items. A letter of availability usually indicates products or services being considered for procurement. A supplier should not construe a letter of availability as a commitment. Prospective contractors sometimes solicit letters of availability or the letters may originate from Government personnel. A letter of availability differs from a letter contract, which is specifically authorized in FAR 16.603.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Policy. (1) For the following reasons, contracting officers may not use letters of availability unless the DSPE specifically authorizes them to do so:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the following reasons, contracting officers may not use letters of availability unless the DSPE specifically authorizes them to do so:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Letters of availability often cause potential contractors to initiate costly preparations in anticipation of contract award.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Procurements announced in such letters do not always materialize. The result may be costly to the Government, the prospective contractor, or both. If the author of the letter of availability is an authorized contracting officer of VA, the Government may be bound by the action, even though the action is contrary to sound procurement practices and/or fiscal regulations. If the author of the letter of availability lacks procurement authority, the prospective contractor may incur substantial expenditures that may not be recovered from the Government. In this instance, the prospective contractor may seek to hold the unauthorized author personally liable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The issuance of a letter of availability may violate the ``Anti-Deficiency Act'' (31 U.S.C. 1341).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contractors need access to procurement information as soon as possible to make timely preparations. Therefore, procurement personnel should act as efficiently and expeditiously as possible on all procurement actions.</p>
