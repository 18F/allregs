                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Whenever a civil penalty is sought for a violation of  this part, the charged party is entitled to receive a formal complaint  specifying the charges and, at his or her request, to contest the  charges in a hearing before an administrative law judge. Any such  hearing shall be conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 556 and 557.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicable law for delegated function. If, pursuant to 13 U.S.C.  306, the Secretary delegates functions addressed in this part to another  agency, the provisions of law of that agency relating to penalty  assessment, remission or mitigation of such penalties, collection of  such penalties, and limitations of action and compromise of claims shall  apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commencement of civil actions. If any person fails to pay a  civil penalty imposed under this subpart, the Secretary may request the  Attorney General to commence a civil action in an appropriate district  court of the United States to recover the amount imposed (plus interest  at currently prevailing rates from the date of the final order). No such  action may be commenced more than five years after the date the order  imposing the civil penalty becomes final. In such action, the validity,  amount, and appropriateness of such penalty shall not be subject to  review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Remission and mitigation. Any penalties imposed under Sec.  30.71(b)(1) and (b)(2) may be remitted or mitigated, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The penalties were incurred without willful negligence or fraud;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other circumstances exist that justify a remission or  mitigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deposit of payments in General Fund of the Treasury. Any amount  paid in satisfaction of a civil penalty imposed under this subpart shall  be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and credited as  miscellaneous receipts, other than a payment to remit a forfeiture which  shall be deposited into the Treasury Forfeiture fund.</p>
