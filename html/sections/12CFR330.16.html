                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Separate insurance coverage. From December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012, a depositor's funds in a ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' (as defined in Sec. 330.1(s)) are fully insured, irrespective of the SMDIA. Such insurance coverage shall be separate from the coverage provided for other accounts maintained at the same insured depository institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Certain swept funds. Notwithstanding its normal rules and procedures regarding sweep accounts under 12 CFR 360.8, the FDIC will treat funds swept from a noninterest-bearing transaction account to a noninterest-bearing savings deposit account as being in a noninterest-bearing transaction account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Disclosure and notice requirements. (1) By no later than February 28, 2011, each depository institution that offers noninterest-bearing transaction accounts must post prominently the following notice in the lobby of its main office, in each domestic branch and, if it offers Internet deposit services, on its Web site:</p><p class="depth0">NOTICE OF CHANGES IN TEMPORARY FDIC INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR TRANSACTION</p><p class="depth0">ACCOUNTS</p><p class="depth0">All funds in a ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' are insured in full by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation from December 31, 2010, through December 31, 2012. This temporary unlimited coverage is in addition to, and separate from, the coverage of at least $250,000 available to depositors under the FDIC's general deposit insurance rules.</p><p class="depth0">The term ``noninterest-bearing transaction account'' includes a traditional checking account or demand deposit account on which the insured depository institution pays no interest. It also includes Interest on Lawyers Trust Accounts (``IOLTAs''). It does not include other accounts, such as traditional checking or demand deposit accounts that may earn interest, NOW accounts, and money-market deposit accounts.</p><p class="depth0">For more information about temporary FDIC insurance coverage of transaction accounts, visit www.fdic.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Institutions participating in the FDIC's Transaction Account Guarantee Program on December 31, 2010, must provide a notice by mail to depositors with negotiable order of withdrawal accounts that are protected in full as of that date under the Transaction Account Guarantee Program that, as of January 1, 2011, such accounts no longer will be eligible for unlimited protection. This notice must be provided to such depositors no later than December 31, 2010.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If an institution uses sweep arrangements, modifies the terms of an account, or takes other actions that result in funds no longer being eligible for full coverage under this section, the institution must notify affected customers and clearly advise them, in writing, that such actions will affect their deposit insurance coverage.
