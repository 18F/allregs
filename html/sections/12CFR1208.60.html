                            <p class="depth0">These administrative wage garnishment procedures are issued in  compliance with 31 U.S.C. 3720D and 31 CFR 285.11(f). This subpart E  provides procedures for FHFA to collect money from a debtor's disposable  pay by means of administrative wage garnishment. The receipt of payments  pursuant to this subpart E does not preclude FHFA from pursuing other  debt collection remedies, including the offset of Federal payments. FHFA  may pursue such debt collection remedies separately or in conjunction  with administrative wage garnishment. This subpart E does not apply to  the collection of delinquent debts from the wages of Federal employees  from their Federal employment. Federal pay is subject to the Federal  salary offset procedures set forth in 5 U.S.C. 5514 and other applicable  laws.</p>
