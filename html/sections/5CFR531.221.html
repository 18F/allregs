                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An agency may apply the maximum payable rate rule  as described in this section to determine an employee's payable rate of  basic pay under the GS pay system at a rate higher than the otherwise  applicable rate upon reemployment, transfer, reassignment, promotion,  demotion, change in type of appointment, termination of a critical  position pay authority under 5 CFR part 535, movement from a non-GS pay  system, or termination of grade or pay retention under 5 CFR part 536.  (Note: Special rules for GM employees are provided in Sec. 531.247.) A  payable rate set under this section must take effect on the effective  date of the action involved. This section may not be used to set an  employee's rate of basic pay retroactively unless a retroactive action  is required to comply with a nondiscretionary agency policy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At its discretion, an agency may set an employee's rate(s) of  basic pay at the maximum rate identified under this section or at a  lower rate. However, the employee's rate may not be lower than the rate  to which he or she is entitled under any other applicable pay-setting  rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In applying this section, an agency must use applicable annual  rates of   pay or, if a rate under a non-GS system is an hourly rate, convert the  hourly rate to an annual rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In applying this section, an agency must treat a critical  position pay rate under 5 CFR part 535 as if it were a rate under a non- GS pay system, as described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> In applying this section, an agency must treat an adjusted GS  rate that includes market pay under 38 U.S.C. 7431(c) as if it were a  rate under a non-GS pay system, as described in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When highest previous rate is based on a GS rate or LEO special  base rate. When an employee's highest previous rate (as determined under  Sec. 531.222) is based on a GS rate or an LEO special base rate paid  under the GS pay system, an agency must determine the maximum payable  rate of basic pay that may be paid to the employee as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compare the employee's highest previous rate with the GS rates  for the grade in which pay is currently being set. For this comparison,  use the schedule of GS rates in effect at the time the highest previous  rate was earned. In applying this paragraph to an employee who was a law  enforcement officer receiving an LEO special base rate when the highest  previous rate was earned, compare the highest previous rate to the  applicable LEO special base rates in lieu of GS rates if the grade in  which pay is currently being set is one of the grades from GS-3 through  GS-10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify the lowest step in the grade at which the GS rate (or  LEO special base rate, if applicable) was equal to or greater than the  employee's highest previous rate. If the employee's highest previous  rate was greater than the maximum GS rate (or LEO special base rate, if  applicable) for the grade, identify the step 10 rate (i.e., maximum rate  of the grade).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the rate on the currently applicable range of GS rates  or LEO special base rates for the employee's current position of record  and grade that corresponds to the step identified in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section. This rate is the maximum payable GS rate or LEO special  base rate the agency may pay the employee under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After setting the employee's GS or LEO special base rate within  the rate range for the grade (not to exceed the maximum payable rate  identified in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), the agency must  determine the employee's payable rate of basic pay based on the  employee's GS or LEO special base rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section. The agency must  apply the maximum payable rate rule as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the employee is assigned to an official worksite within the  geographic boundaries of a formerly applicable special rate schedule,  compare the former special rate to the rates of basic pay in the highest  applicable rate range for the employee's current position of record and  current official worksite. Identify the lowest step rate in that range  that equals or exceeds the former special rate (or the maximum step  rate, if the former special rate exceeds the range maximum). That step  rate is the employee's maximum payable rate of basic pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the employee is assigned to an official worksite outside  the geographic boundaries of the formerly applicable special rate  schedule, determine the maximum payable rate as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Convert the former special rate to a corresponding rate (same  step) in the current highest applicable rate range for the new official  worksite based on the employee's position of record immediately before  the reassignment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the rate resulting from the geographic conversion under  paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section is a special rate, that converted  special rate is deemed to be the employee's former special rate and  highest previous rate in applying paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section.  If the resulting rate is not a special rate, this paragraph (c) may not  be used to determine the employee's maximum payable rate. Instead,  paragraph (b) of this section must be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Compare the employee's highest previous rate (i.e., the former  special rate after the geographic conversion) with the rates on the  current highest applicable rate range for the new official worksite  based on the employee's position of record after the reassignment.  Identify the lowest step rate in that range that equals or exceeds the  highest previous rate (or the maximum step rate, if the highest previous  rate exceeds the range maximum). That step rate is the employee's  maximum payable rate of basic pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After setting the employee's rate of basic pay in the highest  applicable rate range (not to exceed the maximum payable rate), the  agency must determine any underlying rate of basic pay to which the  employee is entitled based on the employee's step rate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When highest previous rate is based on a rate under a non-GS pay  system. When an employee's highest previous rate (as provided in Sec.  531.222) is based on a rate of basic pay in a non-GS pay system, the  agency must determine the maximum payable rate of basic pay that may be  paid to the employee in his or her current GS position of record as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Compare the highest previous rate to the highest applicable rate  range in effect at the time and place where the highest previous rate  was earned. The highest applicable rate range is determined as if the  employee held the current GS position of record (including grade in  which pay is being set) at that time and place. Identify the lowest step  rate in that range that was equal to or higher than the highest previous  rate (or the maximum step rate if the highest previous rate exceeded the  range maximum).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Convert the step rate identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this  section to a corresponding rate (same step) in the current highest  applicable rate range for the employee's current GS position of record  and official worksite. That step rate is the employee's maximum payable  rate of basic pay.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After setting the employee's rate of basic pay in the current  highest applicable rate range (not to exceed the maximum payable rate),  the agency must determine any underlying rate of basic pay to which the  employee is entitled at the determined step rate.
