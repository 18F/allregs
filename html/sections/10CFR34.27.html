                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The replacement of any sealed source fastened to or contained in  a radiographic exposure device and leak   testing of any sealed source must be performed by persons authorized to  do so by the NRC or an Agreement State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The opening, repair, or modification of any sealed source must  be performed by persons specifically authorized to do so by the  Commission or an Agreement State.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Testing and recordkeeping requirements. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each licensee who  uses a sealed source shall have the source tested for leakage at  intervals not to exceed 6 months. The leak testing of the source must be  performed using a method approved by the Commission or by an Agreement  State. The wipe sample should be taken from the nearest accessible point  to the sealed source where contamination might accumulate. The wipe  sample must be analyzed for radioactive contamination. The analysis must  be capable of detecting the presence of 185 Bq (0.005 microcurie) of  radioactive material on the test sample and must be performed by a  person specifically authorized by the Commission or an Agreement State  to perform the analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee shall maintain records of the leak tests in  accordance with Sec. 34.67.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unless a sealed source is accompanied by a certificate from the  transferor that shows that it has been leak tested within 6 months  before the transfer, it may not be used by the licensee until tested for  leakage. Sealed sources that are in storage and not in use do not  require leak testing, but must be tested before use or transfer to  another person if the interval of storage exceeds 6 months.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, and to describe  the equipment involved, the test results, and the corrective action  taken. A copy of the report must be sent to the Administrator of the  appropriate Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Regional Office listed in  appendix D of 10 CFR part 20 of this chapter ``Standards for Protection  Against Radiation.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each exposure device using depleted uranium (DU) shielding and  an ``S'' tube configuration must be tested for DU contamination at  intervals not to exceed 12 months. The analysis must be capable of  detecting the presence of 185 Bq (0.005 microcuries) of radioactive  material on the test sample and must be performed by a person  specifically authorized by the Commission or an Agreement State to  perform the analysis. Should such testing reveal the presence of 185 Bq  (0.005 microcuries) or more of removable DU contamination, the exposure  device must be removed from use until an evaluation of the wear on the  S-tube has been made. Should the evaluation reveal that the S-tube is  worn through, the device may not be used again. DU shielded devices do  not have to be tested for DU contamination while in storage and not in  use. Before using or transferring such a device however, the device must  be tested for DU contamination if the interval of storage exceeded 12  months. A record of the DU leak-test must be made in accordance with  Sec. 34.67. Licensees will have until June 27, 1998, to comply with the  DU leak-testing requirements of this paragraph.
