                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> It is presumed that a bidder or offeror who has submitted the  required Buy America certificate is complying with the Buy America  provision. A false certification is a criminal act in violation of 18  U.S.C. 1001.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any party may petition FTA to investigate the compliance of a  successful bidder or offeror with the bidder's or offeror's  certification. That party (``the petitioner'') must include in the  petition a statement of the grounds of the petition and any supporting  documentation. If FTA determines that the information presented in the  petition indicates that the presumption in paragraph (a) of this section  has been overcome, FTA will initiate an investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In appropriate circumstances, FTA may determine on its own to  initiate an investigation without receiving a petition from a third  party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When FTA determines under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section  to conduct an investigation, it requests that the grantee require the  successful bidder or offeror to document its compliance with its Buy  America certificate. The successful bidder or offeror has the burden of  proof to establish that it is in compliance. Documentation of compliance  is based on the specific circumstances of each investigation, and FTA  will specify the documentation required in each case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The grantee shall reply to the request under paragraph (d) of  this section within 15 working days of the request. The investigated  party may correspond directly with FTA during the course of  investigation, if it informs the grantee that it intends to do so, and  if the grantee agrees to such action in writing. The grantee must inform  FTA, in writing, that the investigated party will respond directly to  FTA. An investigated party may provide confidential or proprietary  information (see paragraph (l) of this section) directly to FTA while  providing other information required to be submitted as part of the  investigation through the grantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any additional information requested or required by FTA must be  submitted within 5 working days after the receipt of such request unless  specifically exempted by FTA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The grantee's reply (or that of the bidder or offeror) will be  transmitted to the petitioner. The petitioner may submit comments on the  reply to FTA within 10 working days after receipt of the reply. The  grantee and the low bidder or offeror will be furnished with a copy of  the petitioner's comments, and their comments must be received by FTA  within 5 working days after receipt of the petitioner's comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The failure of a party to comply with the time limits stated in  this section may result in resolution of the investigation without  consideration of untimely filed comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> During the course of an investigation, with appropriate  notification to affected parties, FTA may conduct site visits of  manufacturing facilities and final assembly locations as it considers  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> FTA will, upon request, make available to any interested party  information bearing on the substance of the investigation which has been  submitted by the petitioner, interested parties or grantees, except to  the extent that withholding of information is permitted or required by  law or regulation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If a party submitting information considers that the information  submitted contains proprietary material which should be withheld, a  statement advising FTA of this fact may be included, and the alleged  proprietary information must be identified wherever it appears. Any  comments on the information provided shall be submitted within a maximum  of ten days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> For purposes of paragraph (j) of this section, confidential or  proprietary material is any material or data whose disclosure could  reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm to the  party claiming that the material is confidential or proprietary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> When a petition for investigation has been filed before award,  the grantee will not make an award before the resolution of the  investigation, unless the grantee determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The items to be procured are urgently required;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Delivery of performance will be unduly delayed by failure to  make the award promptly; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Failure to make prompt award will otherwise cause undue harm to  the grantee or the Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> In the event that the grantee determines that the award is to be  made during the pendency of an investigation, the grantee will notify  FTA before to making such award. FTA reserves the right not to  participate in the funding of any contract awarded during the pendency  of an investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Initial decisions by FTA will be in written form.  Reconsideration of an initial decision of FTA may be requested by any  party involved in an investigation. FTA will only reconsider a decision  only if the party requesting reconsideration submits new matters of fact  or points of law that were not known or available to the party during  the investigation. A request for reconsideration of a decision of FTA  shall be filed not later than ten (10) working days after the initial  written decision. A request for reconsideration will be subject to the  procedures in this section consistent with the need for prompt  resolution of the matter.
