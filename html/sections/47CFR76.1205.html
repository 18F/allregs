                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Technical information concerning interface parameters that are needed to permit navigation devices to operate with multichannel video programming systems shall be provided by the system operator upon request in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A multichannel video programming provider that is subject to the requirements of Sec.  76.1204(a)(1) must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Provide the means to allow subscribers to self-install the CableCARD in a CableCARD-reliant device purchased at retail and inform a subscriber of this option when the subscriber requests a CableCARD. This requirement shall be effective August 1, 2011, if the MVPD allows its subscribers to self-install any cable modems or operator-leased set-top boxes and November 1, 2011 if the MVPD does not allow its subscribers to self-install any cable modems or operator-leased set-top boxes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This requirement shall not apply to cases in which neither the manufacturer nor the vendor of the CableCARD-reliant device furnishes to purchasers appropriate instructions for self-installation of a CableCARD, and a manned toll-free telephone number to answer consumer questions regarding CableCARD installation but only for so long as such instructions are not furnished and the call center is not offered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effective August 1, 2011, provide multi-stream CableCARDs to subscribers, unless the subscriber requests a single-stream CableCARD;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> With respect to professional installations, ensure that the technician arrives with no fewer than the number of CableCARDS requested by the customer and ensure that all CableCARDs delivered to customers are in good working condition and compatible with the customer's device;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective August 1, 2011, provide, through the use of a commonly used interface and published specifications for communication, CableCARD-reliant, firmware-upgradable navigation devices the ability to tune simultaneously as many switched-digital channels as the greatest number of streams supported by any set-top box provided

by the cable operator, or four simultaneous channels, whichever is greater;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Separately disclose to consumers in a conspicuous manner with written information provided to customers in accordance with Sec.  76.1602, with written or oral information at consumer request, and on Web sites or billing inserts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any assessed fees for the rental of single and additional CableCARDs and the rental of operator-supplied navigation devices; and,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If such provider includes equipment in the price of a bundled offer of one or more services, the fees reasonably allocable to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rental of single and additional CableCARDs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The rental of operator-supplied navigation devices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CableCARD rental fees shall be priced uniformly throughout a cable system by such provider without regard to the intended use in operator-supplied or consumer-owned equipment. No service fee shall be imposed on a subscriber for support of a subscriber-provided device that is not assessed on subscriber use of an operator-provided device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For any bundled offer combining service and an operator-supplied navigation device into a single fee, including any bundled offer providing a discount for the purchase of multiple services, such provider shall make such offer available without discrimination to any customer that owns a navigation device, and, to the extent the customer uses such navigation device in lieu of the operator-supplied equipment included in that bundled offer, shall further offer such customer a discount from such offer equal to an amount not less than the monthly rental fee reasonably allocable to the lease of the operator-supplied navigation device included with that offer. For purposes of this section, in determining what is ``reasonably allocable,'' the Commission will consider in its evaluation whether the allocation is consistent with one or more of the following factors:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An allocation determination approved by a local, state, or Federal government entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The monthly lease fee as stated on the cable system rate card for the navigation device when offered by the cable operator separately from a bundled offer; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The actual cost of the navigation device amortized over a period of no more than 60 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A cable operator shall not provide misleading information regarding the ability of navigation devices to access switched digital channels.
