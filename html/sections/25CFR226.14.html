                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Oil leases, gas leases, and combination oil and gas leases. Unless the lessee completes and places in production a well producing and selling oil and/or gas in paying quantities on the land embraced within the lease within 12 months from the date of approval of the lease, or as otherwise provided in the lease terms, or 12 months from the date the Superintendent consents to drilling on any restricted homestead selection, the lease will terminate unless rental at the rate of not less than $3 per acre for an oil or gas lease, or not less than $6 per acre for a combination oil and gas lease, is paid at the beginning of the first year of the lease.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The lease may also be held for the remainder of its primary term without drilling upon payment of the specified rental annually in advance, commencing with the second lease year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lease will terminate as of the due date of the rental unless such rental is received by the Superintendent on or before said date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The completion of a well producing in paying quantities will, for so long as such production continues, relieve the lessee from any further payment of rental, except that, should such production cease during the primary term the lease may be continued only during the remaining primary term of the lease by payment of advance rental which will be due on the next anniversary date of the lease. Rental must be paid on the basis of a full year and no refund will be made of advance rental paid in compliance with the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Superintendent may, with the consent of and under terms approved by the Osage Minerals Council, grant an extension of the primary term of a lease on which actual drilling of a well has commenced within the term thereof, or for the purpose of enabling the lessee to obtain a market for his/her oil and/or gas production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Irrespective of whether the lessee has drilled or paid rental, the Superintendent in his/her discretion may order further development of any leased acreage or a specific horizon in any lease term if, in his/her opinion, a prudent lessee would conduct further development. A prudent lessee will diligently develop the minerals underlying the leasehold. The Osage Minerals Council has the right to request a determination of whether there is diligent development by the Superintendent as to any lease and may submit any materials or analysis to support its request. Upon receipt of a request, the Superintendent will evaluate the request and may require additional information be submitted by the lessee and the Osage Minerals Council before making a final determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the lessee refuses to comply with an order by the Superintendent to diligently develop its leasehold as a result of a determination under paragraph (c) of this section, the refusal will be considered a violation of the lease terms and said lease will be terminated as to the acreage or horizon the further development of which was ordered, after any appeal of an order. The Superintendent will promptly notify the lessee of such termination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except for a lease during its primary term for which rental payment has been paid, a lease that does not produce in paying quantities for 120 consecutive calendar days is thereby terminated by operation of law, effective immediately. The Superintendent will notify the lessee of such termination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Superintendent has the authority before termination to approve in writing a temporary suspension of operations tolling the 120-day period for a specified number of days, due to force majeure, other hardship, or other extenuating circumstance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any request for a temporary suspension of operations must be made in writing to the Superintendent at least 20 calendar days prior to the expiration of the 120-day period in which the lease has not produced in paying quantities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Superintendent, for good cause, may extend in writing the time of any temporary suspension of operations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Superintendent must provide a copy of any decision under this paragraph (e) to the Osage Minerals Council at the same time it is delivered to the lessee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Whenever the Osage Minerals Council identifies any lease that has terminated or may be subject to termination for any reason, the Osage Minerals Council has the right to request in writing appropriate action by the Superintendent, including but not limited to the issuance of a notice of termination to the lessee, and may submit any materials or analysis in support of its request. Upon receipt of such a request, within 90 calendar days the Superintendent must either take the requested action or issue a written decision responsive to the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Superintendent may impose restrictions as to time of drilling and rate of production from any well or wells when the Superintendent judges these restrictions to be necessary or proper for the protection of the natural resources of the leased land and the interests of the Osage mineral estate. The Superintendent may consider, among other things, Federal and Oklahoma laws regulating either drilling or production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a lessee holds both an oil lease and a gas lease covering the same acreage, such lessee is subject to the provisions of this section as to both the oil lease and the gas lease.</p>
