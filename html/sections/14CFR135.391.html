                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Without regard to paragraph (a) of this section, if the Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of engine failure, to clear all obstructions within five miles on each side of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following for the route, route segement, or area concerned:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The location and kinds of navigation aids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency and amount of turbulence normally encountered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Terrain features.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Air traffic problems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any other operational factors that affect the operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The critical engine is inoperative;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable position;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.</p>
