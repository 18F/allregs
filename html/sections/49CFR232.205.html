Furthermore, these multiple solid blocks of cars shall be  added to a train in the same relative order (no reclassification) as  when removed from the previous train, except for the removal of  defective equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Class I brake test of a train shall consist of the following  tasks and requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Brake pipe leakage shall not exceed 5 psi per minute or air flow  shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Leakage Test. The brake pipe leakage test shall be conducted as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Charge the air brake system to the pressure at which the train  will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train shall be  within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be operated, but  not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or end-of-train  device at the rear end of train;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Upon receiving the signal to apply brakes for test, make a 20- psi brake pipe service reduction;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If the locomotive used to perform the leakage test is equipped  with a means for maintaining brake pipe pressure at a constant level  during a 20-psi brake pipe service reduction, this feature shall be cut  out during the leakage test; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> With the brake valve lapped and the pressure maintaining feature  cut out (if so equipped) and after waiting 45-60 seconds, note the brake  pipe leakage as indicated by the brake-pipe gauge in the locomotive,  which shall not exceed 5 psi per minute.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air Flow Method Test. When a locomotive is equipped with a 26-L  brake valve or equivalent pressure maintaining locomotive brake valve, a  railroad may use the Air Flow Method Test as an alternate to the brake  pipe leakage test. The Air Flow Method (AFM) Test shall be performed as  follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Charge the air brake system to the pressure at which the train  will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train shall be  within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be operated, but  not less than 75 psi, as indicated by an accurate gauge or end-of-train  device at the rear end of train; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Measure air flow as indicated by a calibrated AFM indicator,  which shall not exceed 60 cubic feet per minute (CFM).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The AFM indicator shall be calibrated for accuracy at periodic  intervals not to exceed 92 days. The AFM indicator calibration test  orifices shall be calibrated at temperatures of not less than 20 degrees  Fahrenheit. AFM indicators shall be accurate to within [3 standard cubic  feet per minute (CFM).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The inspector(s) shall take a position on each side of each car  sometime during the inspection process so as to be able to examine and  observe the functioning of all moving parts of the brake system on each  car in order to make the determinations and inspections required by this  section. A ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release as provided for  in paragraph (b)(8) of this section shall not constitute an inspection  of that side of the train for purposes of this requirement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The train brake system shall be charged to the pressure at which  the train will be operated, and the pressure at the rear of the train  shall be within 15 psi of the pressure at which the train will be  operated, but not less than 75 psi, angle cocks and cutout cocks shall  be properly positioned, air hoses shall be properly coupled and shall  not kink, bind, or foul or be in any other condition that restricts air  flow. An examination must be made for leaks and necessary repairs made  to reduce leakage to the required minimum. Retaining valves and  retaining valve pipes shall be inspected and known to be in proper  condition for service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The brakes on each car shall apply in response to a 20-psi brake  pipe service reduction and shall remain applied until a release of the  air brakes has been initiated by the controlling locomotive or yard test  device. The brakes shall not be applied or released until the proper  signal is given. A car found with brakes that fail to apply or remain  applied may be retested and remain in the train if the retest is  conducted at an air pressure that is within 15 psi of the air pressure  at which the train will be operated. The retest may be conducted from  either the controlling locomotive, the head-end of the consist, or with  a suitable test device, as described in Sec. 232.217(a), positioned at  one end of the car(s) being retested, and the brakes shall remain  applied until a release is initiated after a period which is no less  than three minutes. If the retest is performed at the car(s) being  retested with a suitable device, the compressed air in the car(s) shall  be depleted prior to disconnecting the hoses between the car(s) to  perform the retest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For cars equipped with 8\1/2\-inch or 10-inch diameter brake  cylinders, piston travel shall be within 6 to 9 inches. If piston travel  is found to be less than 6 inches or more than 9 inches, it must   be adjusted to nominally 7\1/2\ inches. For cars not equipped with 8\1/ 2\-inch or 10-inch diameter brake cylinders, piston travel shall be  within the piston travel stenciled or marked on the car or badge plate.  Minimum brake cylinder piston travel of truck-mounted brake cylinders  must be sufficient to provide proper brake shoe clearance when the  brakes are released. Piston travel must be inspected on each freight car  while the brakes are applied;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Brake rigging shall be properly secured and shall not bind or  foul or otherwise adversely affect the operation of the brake system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All parts of the brake equipment shall be properly secured. On  cars where the bottom rod passes through the truck bolster or is secured  with cotter keys equipped with a locking device to prevent their  accidental removal, bottom rod safety supports are not required; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> When the release is initiated by the controlling locomotive or  yard test device, the brakes on each freight car shall be inspected to  verify that it did release; this may be performed by a ``roll-by''  inspection. If a ``roll-by'' inspection of the brake release is  performed, train speed shall not exceed 10 MPH and the qualified person  performing the ``roll-by'' inspection shall communicate the results of  the inspection to the operator of the train. The operator of the train  shall note successful completion of the release portion of the  inspection on the record required in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where a railroad's collective bargaining agreement provides that  a carman is to perform the inspections and tests required by this  section, a carman alone will be considered a qualified person. In these  circumstances, the railroad shall ensure that the carman is properly  trained and designated as a qualified person or qualified mechanical  inspector pursuant to the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A railroad shall notify the locomotive engineer that the Class I  brake test was satisfactorily performed and provide the information  required in this paragraph to the locomotive engineer or place the  information in the cab of the controlling locomotive following the test.  The information required by this paragraph may be provided to the  locomotive engineer by any means determined appropriate by the railroad;  however, a written or electronic record of the information shall be  retained in the cab of the controlling locomotive until the train  reaches its destination. The written or electronic record shall contain  the date, time, number of freight cars inspected, and identify the  qualified person(s) performing the test and the location where the Class  I brake test was performed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Before adjusting piston travel or working on brake rigging,  cutout cock in brake pipe branch must be closed and air reservoirs must  be voided of all compressed air. When cutout cocks are provided in brake  cylinder pipes, these cutout cocks only may be closed and air reservoirs  need not be voided of all compressed air.
