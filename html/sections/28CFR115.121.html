most recent edition of the U.S. Department of Justice's Office on Violence Against Women publication, ``A National Protocol for Sexual Assault Medical Forensic Examinations, Adults/Adolescents,'' or similarly comprehensive and authoritative protocols developed after 2011. As part of the training required in Sec. 115.131, employees and volunteers who may have contact with lockup detainees shall receive basic training regarding how to detect and respond to victims of sexual abuse.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The agency shall offer all victims of sexual abuse access to forensic medical examinations whether on-site or at an outside facility, without financial cost, where evidentiarily or medically appropriate. Such examinations shall be performed by Sexual Assault Forensic Examiners (SAFEs) or Sexual Assault Nurse Examiners (SANEs) where possible. If SAFEs or SANEs cannot be made available, the examination can be performed by other qualified medical practitioners. The agency shall document its efforts to provide SAFEs or SANEs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the detainee is transported for a forensic examination to an outside hospital that offers victim advocacy services, the detainee shall be permitted to use such services to the extent available, consistent with security needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To the extent the agency itself is not responsible for investigating allegations of sexual abuse, the agency shall request that the investigating agency follow the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The requirements in paragraphs (a) through (e) of this section shall also apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any State entity outside of the agency that is responsible for investigating allegations of sexual abuse in lockups; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any Department of Justice component that is responsible for investigating allegations of sexual abuse in lockups.</p>
