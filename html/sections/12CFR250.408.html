                                Sec. 250.408  Short-term negotiable notes of banks not securities under
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Board of Governors has been asked whether short-term unsecured negotiable notes of the kinds issued by some of the large banks in this country as a means of obtaining funds are ``other similar securities'' within the meaning of section 32, Banking Act of 1933 (12 U.S.C. 78) and this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 32 forbids certain interlocking relationships between banks which are members of the Federal Reserve System and individuals or organizations ``primarily engaged in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, or distribution, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate participation, of stocks, bonds, or other similar securities * * *.'' Therefore, if such notes are securities similar to stocks or bonds, any dealing therein would be an activity covered in section 32 and would have to be taken into consideration in determining whether the individual or organization involved was ``primarily engaged'' in such activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Board has concluded that such short-term notes of the kind described above are not ``other similar securities'' within the meaning of section 32 and this part.
