                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Pre-award disclosure and resolution of OCIs. If a certificate  under Sec. 1706.6 indicates, or the Board otherwise learns, that actual  or potential OCIs could be, or would appear to be, created by contract  award to a particular offeror, the Board shall afford the affected  offeror an opportunity to provide in writing all relevant facts bearing  on the certificate. If the Board thereafter determines that an actual or  potential OCI exists, one of the following actions shall ultimately be  taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disqualify the offeror;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include in the contract appropriate terms and conditions which  avoid the conflict, in which case no waiver is required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Make a finding that it is in the best interests of the  Government to seek award of the contract under the waiver provisions of  Sec. 1706.8, and, where reasonably possible, include contract terms and  conditions or take other measures which mitigate such conflicts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Post-award disclosure and resolution of OCIs. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, after  contract award, the contractor discovers actual or potential OCIs with  respect to the contract, it shall make an immediate and full disclosure  in writing to the contracting officer. This statement shall include a  description of the action that the contractor has taken or proposes to  avoid or mitigate such conflicts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a disclosure under this section indicates, or the Board  otherwise learns, that actual or potential OCIs exist, the Board may  afford the contractor an opportunity to provide all relevant facts  bearing upon the problem. If at any time the Board determines that an  actual or potential OCI exists, one of the following actions shall  ultimately be taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Terminate the contract, or, in the case of a task order  contract, terminate the particular task;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Insist on appropriate contract terms and conditions which avoid  the OCIs, in which case no waiver is required; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make a finding that it is in the best interests of the  Government to permit the contractor to continue to perform the contract  (or task) under the waiver provisions of Sec. 1706.8, and, where  reasonably possible, insist on appropriate contract terms and conditions  or take other measures which mitigate the OCIs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Task order contracts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Because a task order contract  generally entails a broad scope of work, apparent successful offerors  shall be required to identify in their certificates filed in accordance  with Sec. 1706.6 any actual or potential OCIs that come within the full  scope of the contract. The Board may decline to award a task order  contract to an offeror based upon such information or it may decline to  approve performance of a particular task by the contractor if an actual  or potential OCI is subsequently identified with respect to that  particular task. The Board may also take the other actions identified in  Sec. 1706.7(a) to avoid or mitigate such conflicts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contractors performing task order contracts for the Board shall  disclose to the contracting officer any new work for others they propose  to undertake that may present an actual or potential OCI with regard to  the performance of any work under the full scope of the Board contract.  Such disclosure shall be made at least 15 days prior to the submission  of a bid or proposal for the new work. The disclosure shall include the  statement of work and any other information necessary to describe fully  the proposed work and contemplated relationship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Board has issued a task order or a letter request for  proposal under the contract with a contractor who has disclosed to the  contracting officer that it proposes to undertake new work for persons  other than the Board as described in Sec. 1706.7(c)(2), for services in  the same technical area and/or at the same defense nuclear facility that  is the subject of the proposed new work (including overlap based upon  generic work performed for others by the contractor), the Board   shall inform the contractor that entering into a contract for the new  work may result in termination by the Board of the task order contract,  if the Board determines that such work would give rise to an OCI and the  Board does not grant a waiver.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Decisions on OCIs. The contracting officer shall make  recommendations to the General manager regarding disqualification or  actions to be taken by the Board to avoid or mitigate any actual or  potential OCI.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The General Manager shall have the authority to approve, modify,  or disapprove such recommendations regarding avoidance of an actual or  potential OCI. If an offeror or contractor disagrees with the actions  approved by the General Manager and requests review of the action, the  Chairman shall make the decision on the actions to be taken by the  Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any recommended action respecting the best interests of the  Government and mitigation measures to be taken with respect to an actual  or potential OCI must be approved by the Chairman in conjunction with  the decision to grant a waiver pursuant to Sec. 1706.8, and any  recommended action to terminate a contract or a particular task on  account of an actual or potential OCI must be approved by the Chairman.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decisions on OCIs by the General Manager or the Chairman shall  be made with the advice of the Office of the General Counsel.
