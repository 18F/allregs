                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The exemptions established in this subpart shall apply to all Food and Drug Administration records, except as provided in subpart E of this part. Accordingly, a record that is ordinarily available for public disclosure in accordance with the provisions in subpart F of this part or of another regulation cross-referenced in Sec. 20.100(c) is not available for such disclosure to the extent that it falls within an exemption contained in this subpart, except as provided by the limitations on exemptions specified in subpart E of this part. For example, correspondence that is ordinarily disclosable under Sec. 20.103

is not disclosable to the extent that it contains trade secrets exempt from disclosure under Sec. 20.61 and is not subject to discretionary release under Sec. 20.82.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where application of one or more exemptions results in a record being disclosable in part and nondisclosable in part, the rule established in Sec. 20.22 shall apply.</p>
