The loan guarantees will be issued as provided herein pursuant to the Loan Guarantee Agreement, dated April 14, 2014, between the United States of America and Ukraine (the ``Loan Guarantee Agreement'').

The loan guarantees shall ensure the Borrower's repayment of 100% of principal and interest due under such borrowings. The full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged for the full payment and performance of such guarantee obligations.</p>
