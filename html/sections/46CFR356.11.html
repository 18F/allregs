                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An impermissible transfer of control will be deemed to exist  where a Non-Citizen, whether by agreement, contract, influence, or any  other means whatsoever:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has the right to direct the business of the entity which owns  the Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to ``direct the business of the  entity'' does not include the right to simply participate in the  direction of the business activities of an entity which owns a Fishing  Industry Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Has the right in the ordinary course of business to limit the  actions of or replace the chief executive officer, a majority of the  board of directors, any general partner or any person serving in a  management capacity of the entity which owns the Fishing Industry  Vessel. Standard rights of minority shareholders to restrict the actions  of the entity are permitted provided they are unrelated to day-to-day  business activities. These rights include provisions to require the  consent of the minority shareholder to sell all or substantially all of  the assets, to enter into a different business, to contract with the  majority investors or their affiliates or to guarantee the obligations  of majority investors or their affiliates;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Has the right to direct the transfer, operation, or manning of a  Fishing Industry Vessel. The right to ``direct the transfer, operation,  or manning'' of such vessels does not include the right to simply  participate in the direction of the transfer, operation, and manning of  such vessels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Has the right to restrict unduly the day-to-day business  activities and   management policies of the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel  through loan covenants other than those approved for use by the  Citizenship Approval Officer or other means;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Has the right to derive, through a minority shareholder and in  favor of a Non-Citizen, a significantly disproportionate amount of the  economic benefit from the ownership and operation of the Fishing  Industry Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Has the right to control the management of or to be a  controlling factor in the entity owning a Fishing Industry Vessel ;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Has the right to cause the sale of a Fishing Industry Vessel  other than:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By an entity that is eligible to hold a Preferred Mortgage on  the vessel pursuant to Sec. 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan and  mortgage covenants on behalf of a beneficiary that qualifies as a  Commercial Lender, a Lender Syndicate or an entity eligible to hold a  Preferred Mortgage under Sec. 356.19(a)(2) through (a)(5);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> By an approved Mortgage Trustee that is exercising loan or  mortgage covenants for a beneficiary that is not qualified to hold a  Preferred Mortgage, provided that the loan or mortgage covenants have  been approved by the Citizenship Approval Officer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Where it is necessary in order to allow a Non-Citizen to  dissolve its interest in the entity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Absorbs all of the costs and normal business risks associated  with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Has the responsibility for the procurement of insurance on the  Fishing Industry Vessel, or assumes any liability in excess of insurance  coverage; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Has the ability through any other means whatsoever to control  the entity that owns a Fishing Industry Vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the actions in paragraph (a) of this section that  are considered absolute indicia of control, we will consider other  factors which, in combination with other elements of Non-Citizen  involvement, may be deemed impermissible control. The following factors  may be considered indicia of control:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a Non-Citizen minority stockholder takes the leading role in  establishing an entity that will own a Fishing Industry Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a Non-Citizen has the right to preclude the owner of a  Fishing Industry Vessel from engaging in other business activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a Non-Citizen and owner use the same law firm, accounting  firm, etc.;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a Non-Citizen and owner share the same office space, phones,  administrative support, etc.;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If a Non-Citizen absorbs considerable costs and normal business  risks associated with ownership and operation of the Fishing Industry  Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a Non-Citizen provides the start up capital for the owner or  bareboat charterer on less than an arm's-length basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If a Non-Citizen time charterer has the general right to inspect  the books and records of the owner, bareboat charterer, or time  charterer of a Fish Processing Vessel or Fish Tender Vessel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the owner or bareboat charterer uses the same insurance  agent, law firm, accounting firm, or broker of any Non-Citizen with whom  the owner or a bareboat charterer has entered into a mortgage, long-term  or exclusive sales or marketing agreement, unsecured loan agreement, or  management agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> If a Non-Citizen has the right to control, whether through sale,  lease or other method, the fishing quota, fishing rights or processing  rights allocated to a vessel or vessel-owning entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In most cases, any single factor listed in paragraph (b) of this  section will not be sufficient to deem an entity a Non-Citizen. However,  a combination of several factors listed in paragraph (b) of this section  may increase our concern as to whether the entity complies with the U.S.  Citizen ownership and control provisions of the AFA and any single  factor listed in paragraph (b) of this section may be the basis for a  request from us for further information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If we have a concern regarding a Non-Citizen, we will notify the  entity of the concern and work with the entity toward a satisfactory  resolution,   provided there is no verifiable evidence of fraud. Resolution of any  control issues may result in a request by us for additional information  to clarify the intent of the provision or to amend or delete the  provision in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Information that is specifically required to be submitted for  our consideration is set out in Sec. 356.13. However, in determining  whether an entity has control over a Fishing Industry Vessel, we may  review any contract or agreement that may, by any means whatsoever,  result in a transfer of control to a Non-Citizen.
