Each disclosure made with the  patient's written consent must be accompanied by the following written  statement:</p><p class="depth0">This information has been disclosed to you from records protected by  Federal confidentiality rules (42 CFR part 2). The Federal rules  prohibit you from making any further disclosure of this information  unless further disclosure is expressly permitted by the written consent  of the person to whom it pertains or as otherwise permitted by 42 CFR  part 2. A general authorization for the release of medical or other  information is NOT sufficient for this purpose. The Federal rules  restrict any use of the information to criminally investigate or  prosecute any alcohol or drug abuse patient.  [52 FR 21809, June 9, 1987; 52 FR 41997, Nov. 2, 1987]</p>
