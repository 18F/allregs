                            <p class="depth0">AES is a voluntary program that allows all exporters required to  report commodity export information (see, 15 CFR 30.16) to submit such  information electronically, rather than on paper, and sea carriers to  report required outbound vessel information electronically (see,  Sec. Sec. 4.63, 4.75, and 4.76 of this chapter). Eligibility and  application procedures are found at subpart E of part 30 of the Census  Regulations (15 CFR part 30, subpart E), denominated Electronic Filing  Requirements--Exporters. These Census Regulations (15 CFR part 30,  subpart E) provide that exporters may choose to submit export  information through AES by any one of three electronic filing options  available. Only Option 4, the complete post-departure submission of  export information, requires prior approval by participating agencies  before it can be used by AES participants.</p>
