                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the term base year  means--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Federal fiscal year (FFY) 1987 (that is, October 1, 1986 through  September 30, 1987); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a State which did not report expenditures on the  basis of age categories during FFY 1987, the base year means FFY 1989  (that is, October 1, 1988 through September 30, 1989).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total amount expended by the State for medical  assistance with respect to NF, home and community-based services under  the waiver, home health services, personal care services, private duty  nursing services, and services furnished under a waiver under subpart G  of this part to individuals age 65 or older furnished as an alternative  to care in an SNF or ICF (NF effective October 1, 1990), may not exceed  the APEL calculated in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In applying for a waiver under this subpart, the agency must  clearly identify the base year it intends to use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State may make a preliminary calculation of the expenditure  limit at the time of the waiver approval; however, CMS makes final  calculations of the aggregate limit after base data have been verified  and accepted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All base year and waiver year data are subject to final cost  settlement within 2 years from the end of the base or waiver year  involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formula for calculating APEL. Except as provided in paragraph  (d) of this section, the formula for calculating the APEL follows:  APEL = P x (1 + Y) + V x (1 + Z), where  P = The aggregate amount of the State's medical assistance under title</p><p class="depth2">XIX for SNF and ICF (NF effective October 1, 1990) services</p><p class="depth2">furnished to individuals who have reached age 65, defined as</p><p class="depth2">the total medical assistance payments (Federal and State)</p><p class="depth2">reported on line 6 of form CMS 64 (as adjusted) for SNF</p><p class="depth2">services, ICF-other services, and mental health facility</p><p class="depth2">services for the base year, multiplied by the ratio of</p><p class="depth2">expenditures for SNF and ICF-other services for the aged to</p><p class="depth2">total expenditures for these services as reported on form CMS</p><p class="depth2">2082 for the base year. Q = The market basket index for SNF and ICF (NF effective October 1,</p><p class="depth2">1990) services for the waiver year involved, defined as the</p><p class="depth2">total SNF Input Price Index used in the Medicare program,</p><p class="depth2">identified as the third quarter data available from CMS's</p><p class="depth2">Office of National Cost Estimates in August preceding the</p><p class="depth2">start of the fiscal year. R = The SNF Input Price Index for the base year. S = The number of residents in the State in the waiver year involved who</p><p class="depth2">have reached age 65, defined as the number of aged Medicare</p><p class="depth2">beneficiaries in the State, equal to the Mid-Period Enrollment</p><p class="depth2">in HI or SMI in that State on July 1 preceding the start of</p><p class="depth2">the fiscal year. T = The number of aged Medicare beneficiaries in the State who are</p><p class="depth2">enrolled in either the HI or SMI programs in the base year, as</p><p class="depth2">defined in S, above. U = The number of years beginning after the base year and ending on the</p><p class="depth2">last day of the waiver year involved. V = The aggregate amount of the State's medical assistance under title</p><p class="depth2">XIX in the base year for home and community-based services for</p><p class="depth2">individuals who have reached age 65, defined as the total</p><p class="depth2">medical assistance payments (Federal and State) reported on</p><p class="depth2">line 6 of form CMS 64 (as adjusted) for home health, personal</p><p class="depth2">care, and home and community-based services waivers, which</p><p class="depth2">provide services as an alternative to care in a SNF or ICF (NF</p><p class="depth2">effective October 1, 1990), increased by an estimate</p><p class="depth2">(acceptable to CMS) of expenditures for private duty nursing</p><p class="depth2">services, multiplied by the ratio of expenditures for home</p><p class="depth2">health services for the aged to total expenditures for home</p><p class="depth2">health services, as reported on form CMS 2082, for the base</p><p class="depth2">year. W = The market basket index for home and community-based services for</p><p class="depth2">the waiver year involved, defined as the Home Agency Input</p><p class="depth2">Price Index, used in the Medicare program identified as the</p><p class="depth2">third quarter data available from CMS's Office of National</p><p class="depth2">Cost Estimates in August preceding the start of the fiscal</p><p class="depth2">year. X = The Home Health Agency Input Price Index for the base year. Y = The greater of--</p><p class="depth2">(U x .07), or (Q/R)-1 + (S/T)-1 + (U x .02). Z = The greater of--</p><p class="depth2">(U x .07), or (W/X)-1 + (S/T)-1 + + (U x .02).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Amendment of the APEL. The State may request amendment of its  APEL to reflect an increase in the aggregate amount of medical  assistance for NF services and for services included in the calculation  of the APEL as required by paragraph (c) of this section when the  increase is directly attributable to legislation enacted on or after  December 22, 1987, which amends title XIX of the Act. Costs attributable  to laws enacted before December 22, 1987 will not be considered. Because  the APEL for each year of the waiver is computed separately from the  APEL for any other waiver year, a separate amendment must be submitted  for each year in which the State chooses to raise its APEL.  Documentation specific to the waiver year involved must be submitted to  CMS.</p>
