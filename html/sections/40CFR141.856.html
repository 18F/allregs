If any trigger has been exceeded, systems must complete assessments as required by Sec.  141.859.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Seasonal systems.

Subpart H systems of this part (including consecutive systems) must monitor monthly. Systems may not reduce monitoring.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unfiltered subpart H systems. A subpart H system of this part that does not practice filtration in compliance with subparts H, P, T, and W must collect at least one total coliform sample near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the source water, measured as specified in Sec.  141.74(b)(2), exceeds 1 NTU. When one or more turbidity measurements in any day exceed 1 NTU, the system must collect this coliform sample within 24 hours of the first exceedance, unless the State determines that the system, for logistical reasons outside the system's control, cannot have the sample analyzed within 30 hours of collection and identifies an alternative sample collection schedule. Sample results from this coliform monitoring must be included in determining whether the coliform treatment technique trigger in Sec.  141.859 has been exceeded.</p>
