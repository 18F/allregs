Each application for a permit must set forth or attach the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant's broker license number and date of issuance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The address where the applicant's office will be located within the district and the telephone number of that office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A copy of a document which reserves the applicant's business name with the state or local government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The name of the individual broker who will exercise responsible supervision and control over the customs business transacted in the district;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A list of all other districts for which the applicant has a permit to transact customs business;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The place where the applicant's brokerage records will be retained and the name of the applicant's designated recordkeeping contact (see Sec.

Each application for a district permit under paragraph (b) of this section must be accompanied by the $100 and $138 fees specified in Sec. Sec. 111.96(b) and (c).

The applicant for a district permit must have a place of business at the port where the application is filed, or must have made firm arrangements satisfactory to the port director to establish a place of business, and must exercise responsible supervision and control over that place of business once the permit is granted.

individual broker to exercise responsible supervision and control over the customs business conducted in the district.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception to district rule. If the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of CBP that he regularly employs at least one individual broker in a larger geographical area in which the district is located and that adequate procedures exist for that individual broker to exercise responsible supervision and control over the customs business conducted in the district, CBP may waive the requirement for an individual broker in that district. A request for a waiver under this paragraph, supported by information on the volume and type of customs business conducted, or planned to be conducted, and supported by evidence demonstrating that the applicant is able to exercise responsible supervision and control through the individual broker employed in the larger geographical area, must be sent to the port director in the district in which the waiver is sought. The port director will review the request for a waiver and make recommendations which will be sent to the Office of International Trade, CBP Headquarters, for review and decision.
