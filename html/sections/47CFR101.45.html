                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Commission will consider applications to be mutually  exclusive if their conflicts are such that the grant of one application  would effectively preclude by reason of harmful electrical interference,  or other practical reason, the grant of one or more of the other  applications. The Commission will presume ``harmful electrical  interference'' exists when the levels of Sec. 101.105 are exceeded, or  when there is a material impairment to service rendered to the public  despite full cooperation in good faith by all applicants or parties to  achieve reasonable technical adjustments which would avoid electrical  conflict.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A common carrier application, except in the Local Multipoint  Distribution Service and in the 24 GHz Service, will be entitled to  comparative consideration with one or more conflicting applications only  if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application is mutually exclusive with the other  application; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The application is received by the Commission in a condition  acceptable for filing by whichever ``cut-off'' date is earlier:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sixty (60) days after the date of the public notice listing the  first of the conflicting applications as accepted for filing; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> One (1) business day preceding the day on which the Commission  takes final action on the previously filed application (should the  Commission act upon such application in the interval between thirty (30)  and sixty (60) days after the date of its public notice).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Whenever three or more applications are mutually exclusive, but  not uniformly so, the earliest filed application established the date  prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, regardless of whether or  not subsequently filed applications are directly mutually exclusive with  the first filed application. (For example, applications A, B, and C are  filed in that order. A and B are directly mutually exclusive, B and C  are directly mutually exclusive. In order to be considered comparatively  with B, C must be filed within the ``cut-off'' period established by A  even though C is not directly mutually exclusive with A.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Private operational fixed point-to-point microwave applications  for authorization under this part will be entitled to comparative  consideration with one or more conflicting applications in accordance  with the provisions of Sec. 1.227(b)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An application otherwise mutually exclusive with one or more  previously filed applications, but filed after the appropriate date  prescribed in paragraphs (b) or (d) of this section, will be returned  without prejudice and will be eligible for refiling only after final  action is taken by the Commission with respect to the previously filed  application (or applications).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For purposes of this section, any application (whether mutually  exclusive or not) will be considered to be a newly filed application if  it is amended by a major amendment (as defined by Sec. 1.929 of this  chapter), except under any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The application has been designated for comparative hearing, or  for comparative evaluation (pursuant to Sec. 101.51 of this part), and  the Commission or the presiding officer accepts the amendment pursuant  to Sec. 1.927 of this chapter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amendment resolves frequency conflicts with authorized  stations or other pending applications which would otherwise require  resolution by hearing or by comparative evaluation pursuant to Sec.  101.51 provided that the amendment does not create new or additional  frequency conflicts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control  found by the Commission to be in the public interest, and for which a  requested exemption from the ``cut-off'' requirements of this section is  granted;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The amendment reflects only a change in ownership or control  which results from an agreement under Sec. 1.935 of this chapter  whereby two or more applicants entitled to comparative consideration of  their applications join in one (or more) of the existing applications  and request dismissal of their other application (or applications) to  avoid the delay and cost of comparative consideration;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amendment corrects typographical, transcription, or similar  clerical errors which are clearly demonstrated to be mistakes by  reference to other parts of the application, and whose discovery does  not create new or increased frequency conflicts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The amendment does not create new or increased frequency  conflicts, and is demonstrably necessitated by events which the  applicant could not have reasonably foreseen at the time of filing, such  as, for example:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The loss of a transmitter or receiver site by condemnation,  natural causes, or loss of lease or option;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Obstruction of a proposed transmission path caused by the  erection of a new building or other structure; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The discontinuance or substantial technological obsolescence  of specified equipment, whenever the application has been pending before  the Commission for two or more years from the date of its filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Applicants for the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands shall select a  frequency   pair. Applicants for these bands may select an unpaired frequency only  upon a showing that spectrum efficiency will not be impaired and that  unpaired spectrum is not available in other bands. During the initial  filing window, frequency coordination is not required, except that an  application for a frequency in the 942-944 MHz band must be coordinated  to ensure that it does not affect an existing broadcast auxiliary  service licensee. After the initial filing window, an applicant must  submit evidence that frequency coordination has been performed with all  licensees affected by the application. All frequency coordination must  be performed in accordance with Sec. 101.103. In the event of mutually  exclusive applications occurring during the initial filing window for  the 932.5-935/941.5-944 MHz bands, applicants shall be given the  opportunity to resolve these situations by applying for an alternative  frequency pair, if one is available. To the extent that there are no  other available frequencies or to the extent that mutually exclusive  applications remain after this process is concluded, lotteries shall be  conducted for each frequency pair among all remaining mutually exclusive  applications, assuming appropriate coordination with existing broadcast  auxiliary stations can be concluded, where necessary. In the event of  mutually exclusive applications being received for these bands on the  same day after the initial filing window has closed and a subsequent  filing window opened, lotteries shall be conducted for each frequency  pair among all mutually exclusive applications.
