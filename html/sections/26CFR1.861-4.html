                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Compensation for labor or personal services performed wholly  within the United States. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally, compensation for labor or  personal services, including fees, commissions, fringe benefits, and  similar items, performed wholly within the United States is gross income  from sources within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The labor or services are performed by a nonresident alien  individual temporarily present in the United States for a period or  periods not exceeding a total of 90 days during his taxable year,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The compensation for such labor or services does not exceed in  the aggregate a gross amount of $3,000, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The compensation is for labor or services performed as an  employee of, or under any form of contract with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A nonresident alien individual, foreign partnership, or foreign  corporation, not engaged in trade or business within the United States,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States,  a domestic partnership, or a domestic corporation, if such labor or  services are performed for an office or place of business maintained in  a foreign country or in a possession of the United States by such  individual, partnership, or corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> As a general rule, the term ``day'', as used in subparagraph  (1)(i) of this paragraph, means a calendar day during any portion of  which the nonresident alien individual is physically present in the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Solely for purposes of applying this paragraph, the nonresident  alien   individual, foreign partnership, or foreign corporation for which the  nonresident alien individual is performing personal services in the  United States shall not be considered to be engaged in trade or business  in the United States by reason of the performance of such services by  such individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> of Sec.  1.274-5. If advances or reimbursements exceed such expenses, the amount  of the excess shall be included as compensation for personal services  for purposes of such subparagraph. Pensions and retirement pay  attributable to labor or personal services performed in the United  States are not to be taken into account for purposes of subparagraph  (1)(ii) of this paragraph. (5) For definition of the term ``United  States'', when used in a geographical sense, see sections 638 and  7701(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Compensation for labor or personal services performed partly  within and partly without the United States--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Compensation for labor  or personal services performed by persons other than individuals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. In the case of compensation for labor or personal services  performed partly within and partly without the United States by a person  other than an individual, the part of that compensation that is  attributable to the labor or personal services performed within the  United States, and that is therefore included in gross income as income  from sources within the United States, is determined on the basis that  most correctly reflects the proper source of the income under the facts  and circumstances of the particular case. In many cases, the facts and  circumstances will be such that an apportionment on the time basis, as  defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The application of paragraph (b)(1)(i) is illustrated  by the following example.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Corp X, a domestic corporation, receives compensation of  $150,000 under a contract for services to be performed concurrently in  the United States and in several foreign countries by numerous Corp X  employees. Each Corp X employee performing services under this contract  performs his or her services exclusively in one jurisdiction. Although  the number of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing  services under the contract within the United States equals the number  of employees (and hours spent by employees) performing services under  the contract without the United States, the compensation paid to  employees performing services under the contract within the United  States is higher because of the more sophisticated nature of the  services performed by the employees within the United States.  Accordingly, the payroll cost for employees performing services under  the contract within the United States is $20,000 out of a total contract  payroll cost of $30,000. Under these facts and circumstances, a  determination based upon relative payroll costs would be the basis that  most correctly reflects the proper source of the income received under  the contract. Thus, of the $150,000 of compensation included in Corp X's  gross income, $100,000 ($150,000 x $20,000/$30,000) is attributable to  the labor or personal services performed within the United States and  $50,000 ($150,000 x $10,000/$30,000) is attributable to the labor or  personal services performed without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compensation for labor or personal services performed by an  individual--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)  of this section, in the case of compensation for labor or personal  services performed partly within and partly without the United States by  an individual, the part of such compensation that is attributable to the  labor or personal services performed within the United States, and that  is therefore included in gross income as income from sources within the  United States, is determined on the basis that most correctly reflects  the proper source of that income under the facts and circumstances of  the particular case. In many cases, the facts and circumstances will be  such that an apportionment on a time basis, as defined in   paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section, will be acceptable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employee compensation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in  paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) or (C) of this section, in the case of  compensation for labor or personal services performed partly within and  partly without the United States by an individual as an employee, the  part of such compensation that is attributable to the labor or personal  services performed within the United States, and that is therefore  included in gross income as income from sources within the United  States, is determined on a time basis, as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(E) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Certain fringe benefits sourced on a geographical basis. Except  as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C) of this section, items of  compensation of an individual as an employee for labor or personal  services performed partly within and partly without the United States  that are described in paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(D)(1) through (6) of this  section are sourced on a geographical basis in accordance with those  paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exceptions and special rules--(1) Alternative basis--(i)  Individual as an employee generally. An individual may determine the  source of his or her compensation as an employee for labor or personal  services performed partly within and partly without the United States  under an alternative basis if the individual establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner that, under the facts and circumstances  of the particular case, the alternative basis more properly determines  the source of the compensation than a basis described in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (B), whichever is applicable, of this section. An  individual that uses an alternative basis must retain in his or her  records documentation setting forth why the alternative basis more  properly determines the source of the compensation. In addition, the  individual must provide the information related to the alternative basis  required by applicable Federal tax forms and accompanying instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em> or (B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(ii)(C)(1)(ii)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Artists and athletes. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em>, the term principal place of work has the same meaning  that it has for purposes of section 217 and Sec. 1.217-2(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, a housing fringe benefit includes payments to or on  behalf of an individual (and the individual's family if the family  resides with the individual) only for rent, utilities (other than  telephone charges), real and personal property insurance, occupancy  taxes not deductible under section 164 or 216(a), nonrefundable fees  paid for securing a leasehold, rental of furniture and accessories,  household repairs, residential parking, and the fair rental value of  housing provided in kind by the individual's employer. A housing fringe  benefit does not include payments for expenses or items set forth in  Sec. 1.911-4(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em>, an education fringe benefit includes payments only for  qualified tuition and expenses of the type described in section  530(b)(4)(A)(i) (regardless of whether incurred in connection with  enrollment or attendance at a school) and expenditures for room and  board and uniforms as described in section 530(b)(4)(A)(ii) with respect  to education at an elementary or secondary educational institution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, an individual's local  transportation fringe benefit is the amount that the individual receives  as compensation for local transportation of the individual or the  individual's spouse or dependents at the location of the individual's  principal place of work. The amount treated as a local transportation  fringe benefit is limited to the actual expenses incurred for local  transportation and the fair rental value of any vehicle provided by the  employer and used predominantly by the individual or the individual's  spouse or dependents for local transportation. For this purpose, actual  expenses incurred for local transportation do not include the cost  (including interest) of the purchase by the individual, or on behalf of  the individual, of an automobile or other vehicle.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Tax reimbursement fringe benefit. The source of compensation in  the form of a foreign tax reimbursement fringe benefit is determined  based on the location of the jurisdiction that imposed the tax for which  the individual is reimbursed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em>, a hazardous or  hardship duty zone is any place in a foreign country which is either  designated by the Secretary of State as a place where living conditions  are extraordinarily difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive  physical hardships exist, and for which a post differential of 15  percent or more would be provided under section 5925(b) of title 5 of  the U.S. Code to any officer or employee of the U.S. Government present  at that place, or where a civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or  wartime conditions threatens physical harm or imminent danger to the  health and well-being of the individual. Compensation provided an  employee during the period that the employee performs   labor or personal services in a hazardous or hardship duty zone may be  treated as a hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only if the  employer provides the hazardous or hardship duty pay fringe benefit only  to employees performing labor or personal services in a hazardous or  hardship duty zone. The amount of compensation treated as a hazardous or  hardship duty pay fringe benefit may not exceed the maximum amount that  the U.S. government would allow its officers or employees present at  that location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em>, sufficient evidence  generally requires an agreement, between the employer and the employee,  or a written statement of company policy, which is reduced to writing  before the move and which is entered into or established to induce the  employee or employees to move to another country. Such written statement  or agreement must state that the employer will reimburse the employee  for moving expenses that the employee incurs to return to the employee's  former principal place of work regardless of whether he or she continues  to work for the employer after returning to that location. The writing  may contain certain conditions upon which the right to reimbursement is  determined as long as those conditions set forth standards that are  definitely ascertainable and can only be fulfilled prior to, or through  completion of, the employee's return move to the employee's former  principal place of work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Time basis. The amount of compensation for labor or personal  services performed within the United States determined on a time basis  is the amount that bears the same relation to the individual's total  compensation as the number of days of performance of the labor or  personal services by the individual within the United States bears to  his or her total number of days of performance of labor or personal  services. A unit of time less than a day may be appropriate for purposes  of this calculation. The time period for which the compensation for  labor or personal services is made is presumed to be the calendar year  in which the labor or personal services are performed, unless the  taxpayer establishes to the satisfaction of the Commissioner, or the  Commissioner determines, that another distinct, separate, and continuous  period of time is more appropriate. For example, a transfer during a  year from a position in the United States to a foreign posting that  lasted through the end of that year would generally establish two  separate time periods within that taxable year. The first of these time  periods would be the portion of the year preceding the start of the  foreign posting, and the second of these time periods would be the  portion of the year following the start of the foreign posting. However,  in the case of a foreign posting that requires short-term returns to the  United States to perform services for the employer, such short-term  returns would not be sufficient to establish distinct, separate, and  continuous time periods within the foreign posting time period but would  be relevant to the allocation of compensation relating to the overall  time period. In each case, the source of the compensation on a time  basis is based upon the number of days (or unit of time less than a day,  if appropriate) in that separate time period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em>, multi-year compensation means compensation that is  included in the income of an individual in one taxable year but that is  attributable to a period that includes two or more taxable years. The  determination   of the period to which such compensation is attributable, for purposes  of determining its source, is based upon the facts and circumstances of  the particular case. For example, an amount of compensation that  specifically relates to a period of time that includes several calendar  years is attributable to the entirety of that multi-year period. The  amount of such compensation that is treated as from sources within the  United States is the amount that bears the same relationship to the  total multi-year compensation as the number of days (or unit of time  less than a day, if appropriate) that labor or personal services were  performed within the United States in connection with the project bears  to the total number of days (or unit of time less than a day, if  appropriate) that labor or personal services were performed in  connection with the project. In the case of stock options, the facts and  circumstances generally will be such that the applicable period to which  the compensation is attributable is the period between the grant of an  option and the date on which all employment-related conditions for its  exercise have been satisfied (the vesting of the option).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this paragraph (b)(2)(ii):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. B, a nonresident alien individual, was employed by Corp  M, a domestic corporation, from March 1 to December 25 of the taxable  year, a total of 300 days, for which B received compensation in the  amount of $80,000. Under B's employment contract with Corp M, B was  subject to call at all times by Corp M and was in a payment status on a  7-day week basis. Pursuant to that contract, B performed services (or  was available to perform services) within the United States for 180 days  and performed services (or was available to perform services) without  the United States for 120 days. None of B's $80,000 compensation was for  fringe benefits as identified in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this  section. B determined the amount of compensation that is attributable to  his labor or personal services performed within the United States on a  time basis under paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) and (E) of this section. B did  not assert, pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(C)(1)(i) of this section,  that, under the particular facts and circumstances, an alternative basis  more properly determines the source of that compensation than the time  basis. Therefore, B must include in income from sources within the  United States $48,000 ($80,000 x 180/300) of his compensation from  Corporation M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Same facts as in Example 1 except that Corp M had a  company-wide arrangement with its employees, including B, that they  would receive an education fringe benefit, as described in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(D)(2) of this section, while working in the United States.  During the taxable year, B incurred education expenses for his dependent  daughter that qualified for the education fringe benefit in the amount  of $10,000, for which B received a reimbursement from Corp M. B did not  maintain adequate records or sufficient evidence of this fringe benefit  as required by paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D) of this section. When B filed his  Federal income tax return for the taxable year, B did not apply  paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(2) of this section to treat the  compensation in the form of the education fringe benefit as income from  sources within the United States, the location of his principal place of  work during the 300-day period. Rather, B combined the $10,000  reimbursement with his base compensation of $80,000 and applied the time  basis of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) of this section to determine the source  of his gross income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(D)</em> of this section, and that an alternative  geographic source basis, under the facts and circumstances of this  particular case, is a more reasonable manner to determine the source of  the compensation than the time basis used by B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, a United States citizen, is employed by Corp N, a  domestic corporation. A's principal place of work is in the United  States. A earns an annual salary of $100,000. During the first quarter  of the calendar year (which is also A's taxable year), A performed  services entirely within the United States. At the beginning of the  second quarter of the calendar year, A was transferred to Country X for  the remainder of the year and received, in addition to her annual  salary, $30,000 in fringe benefits that are attributable to her new  principal place of work in Country X. Corp N paid these fringe benefits  separately from A's annual salary. Corp N supplied A with a statement  detailing that $25,000 of the   fringe benefit was paid for housing, as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(D)(1) of this section, and $5,000 of the fringe benefit was  paid for local transportation, as defined in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3)  of this section. None of the local transportation fringe benefit is  excluded from the employee's gross income as a qualified transportation  fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5). Under A's employment contract, A  was required to work on a 5-day week basis, Monday through Friday.  During the last three quarters of the year, A performed services 30 days  in the United States and 150 days in Country X and other foreign  countries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> and (D)(1) and (3)  of this section, A sourced the $25,000 received for the housing fringe  benefit and the $5,000 received for the local transportation fringe  benefit based on the location of her principal place of work, Country X.  Accordingly, A included the $30,000 in fringe benefits in her gross  income as income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Same facts as in Example 3. Of the 150 days during which  A performed services in Country X and in other foreign countries (during  the final three quarters of A's taxable year), she performed 30 days of  those services in Country Y. Country Y is a country designated by the  Secretary of State as a place where living conditions are extremely  difficult, notably unhealthy, or where excessive physical hardships  exist and for which a post differential of 15 percent or more would be  provided under section 5925(b) of title 5 of the U.S. Code to any  officer or employee of the U.S. government present at that place. Corp N  has a policy of paying its employees a $65 premium per day for each day  worked in countries so designated. The $65 premium per day does not  exceed the maximum amount that the U. S. government would pay its  officers or employees stationed in Country Y. Because A performed  services in Country Y for 30 days, she earned additional compensation of  $1,950. The $1,950 is considered a hazardous duty or hardship pay fringe  benefit and is sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(5) of this  section based on the location of the hazardous or hardship duty zone,  Country Y. Accordingly, A included the amount of the hazardous duty or  hardship pay fringe benefit ($1,950) in her gross income as income from  sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During 2006 and 2007, Corp P, a domestic corporation,  employed four United States citizens, E, F, G, and H to work in its  manufacturing plant in Country V. As part of his or her compensation  package, each employee arranged for local transportation unrelated to  Corp P's business needs. None of the local transportation fringe benefit  is excluded from the employee's gross income as a qualified  transportation fringe benefit under section 132(a)(5) and (f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(B)</em> and (D)(3) of this section based on E's principal place of  work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be  included in E's gross income as income from sources without the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under the terms of the compensation package that F negotiated  with Corp P, Corp P let F use an automobile owned by Corp P. However,  Corp P did not agree to reimburse   F for any expenses incurred by F in maintaining and operating the  automobile. Provided that the local transportation fringe benefit meets  the requirements of paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, F's  compensation with respect to the fair rental value of the automobile is  sourced under paragraphs (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(3) of this section based  on F's principal place of work in Country V. Thus, the local  transportation fringe benefit will be included in F's gross income as  income from sources without the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under the terms of the compensation package that G negotiated  with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse G for the purchase price of an  automobile that G purchased in Country V. Corp P did not agree to  reimburse G for any expenses incurred by G in maintaining and operating  the automobile. Because the cost to purchase an automobile is not a  local transportation fringe benefit as defined in paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, the source of the compensation to G  will be determined pursuant to paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(A) or (C) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under the terms of the compensation package that H negotiated  with Corp P, Corp P agreed to reimburse H for the expenses that H  incurred in maintaining and operating an automobile, including gas and  parking, which H purchased in Country V. Provided that the local  transportation fringe benefit meets the requirements of paragraph  (b)(2)(ii)(D)(3) of this section, H's compensation with respect to the  reimbursement for the expenses H incurred is sourced under paragraphs  (b)(2)(ii)(B) and (D)(3) of this section based on H's principal place of  work in Country V. Thus, the local transportation fringe benefit will be  included in H's gross income as income from sources without the United  States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2006, Company Q compensates employee J  with a grant of options to which section 421 does not apply that do not  have a readily ascertainable fair market value when granted. The stock  options permit J to purchase 100 shares of Company Q stock for $5 per  share. The stock options do not become exercisable unless and until J  performs services for Company Q (or a related company) for 5 years. J  works for Company Q for the 5 years required by the stock option grant.  In years 2006-08, J performs all of his services for Company Q within  the United States. In 2009, J performs \1/2\ of his services for Company  Q within the United States and \1/2\ of his services for Company Q  without the United States. In year 2010, J performs his services  entirely without the United States. On December 31, 2012, J exercises  the options when the stock is worth $10 per share. J recognizes $500 in  taxable compensation (($10-$5) x 100) in 2012.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(A)</em>, since J performs 3\1/2\  years of services for Company Q within the United States and 1\1/2\  years of services for Company Q without the United States during the 5- year period, \7/10\ of the $500 of compensation (or $350) recognized in  2012 is income from sources within the United States and the remaining  \3/10\ of the compensation (or $150) is income from sources without the  United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Coastwise travel. Except as to income excluded by paragraph (a)  of this section, wages received for services rendered inside the  territorial limits of the United States and wages of an alien seaman  earned on a coastwise vessel are to be regarded as from sources within  the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. This section applies with respect to taxable  years beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules  applicable to taxable years beginning before January 1, 1967, see 26 CFR  1.861-4 (Revised as of January 1, 1972). Paragraph (b) and the first  sentence of paragraph (a)(1) of this section apply to taxable years  beginning on or after July 14, 2005.
