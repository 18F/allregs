                            <p class="depth0">All terms used in this subpart not defined below are given the  meaning in the Act and in subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth0">Acid gas means a gas stream of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and  carbon dioxide (CO2) that has been separated from sour  natural gas by a sweetening unit.</p><p class="depth0">Natural gas means a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbon and  nonhydrocarbon gases found in geologic formations beneath the earth's  surface.   The principal hydrocarbon constituent is methane.</p><p class="depth0">Onshore means all facilities except those that are located in the  territorial seas or on the outercontinental shelf.</p><p class="depth0">Reduced sulfur compounds means H2S, carbonyl sulfide  (COS), and carbon disulfide (CS2).</p><p class="depth0">Sulfur production rate means the rate of liquid sulfur accumulation  from the sulfur recovery unit.</p><p class="depth0">Sulfur recovery unit means a process device that recovers element  sulfur from acid gas.</p><p class="depth0">Sweetening unit means a process device that separates the  H2S and CO2 contents from the sour natural gas  stream.</p><p class="depth0">Total SO2 equivalents means the sum of volumetric or mass  concentrations of the sulfur compounds obtained by adding the quantity  existing as SO2 to the quantity of SO2 that would  be obtained if all reduced sulfur compounds were converted to  SO2 (ppmv or kg/dscm (lb/dscf)).  EThe sulfur emission rate expressed as elemental sulfur, kilograms per</p><p class="depth0">hour (kg/hr) [pounds per hour (lb/hr)], rounded to one decimal</p><p class="depth0">place. RThe sulfur emission reduction efficiency achieved in percent, carried</p><p class="depth0">to one decimal place. SThe sulfur production rate, kilograms per hour (kg/hr) [pounds per hour</p><p class="depth0"><em>(lb/hr)</em>], rounded to one decimal place. XThe sulfur feed rate from the sweetening unit (i.e., the H2S</p><p class="depth0">in the acid gas), expressed as sulfur, Mg/D(LT/D), rounded to</p><p class="depth0">one decimal place. YThe sulfur content of the acid gas from the sweetening unit, expressed</p><p class="depth0">as mole percent H2S (dry basis) rounded to one</p><p class="depth0">decimal place. ZThe minimum required sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission reduction</p><p class="depth0">efficiency, expressed as percent carried to one decimal place.</p><p class="depth0">Zi refers to the reduction efficiency required at</p><p class="depth0">the initial performance test. Zc refers to the</p><p class="depth0">reduction efficiency required on a continuous basis after</p><p class="depth0">compliance with Zi has been demonstrated.
