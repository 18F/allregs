                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement. All projects supported with Federal funds under  this part must be documented in the Current Research Information System  (CRIS).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial Documentation in the CRIS Database. Information  collected in the ``Work Unit Description'' (Form AD-416) and ``Work Unit  Classification'' (Form AD-417) is required upon project initiation for  all new awards in CRIS (i.e., prior to award).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Annual CRIS Reports. Unless stated differently in the award  terms and conditions, an annual ``Accomplishments Report'' (Form AD-421)  is due 90 calendar days after the award's anniversary date (i.e., one  year following the month and day on which the project period begins and  each year thereafter up until a final report is required). An annual  report covers a one-year period. In addition to the Form AD-421, the  following information, when applicable, must be submitted to the  programmatic contact person identified in block 14 of the Award Face  Sheet (Form NIFA-2009): a comparison of actual accomplishments with the  goals established for the reporting period (where the output of the  project can be expressed readily in numbers, a computation of the cost  per unit of output should be considered if the information is considered  useful); the reasons for slippage if established goals were not met; and  additional pertinent information including, when appropriate, analysis  and explanation of cost overruns or unexpectedly high unit costs. The  annual report of ``Funding and Staff Support'' (Form AD-419) is due  February 1 of the year subsequent to the Federal fiscal year being  reported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> CRIS Final Report. The CRIS final report, ``Accomplishments  Report'' (Form AD-421), covers the entire period of performance of the  award. The report should encompass progress made during the entire  timeframe of the project instead of covering accomplishments made only  during the final reporting segment of the project. In addition to  providing the information required under paragraph (c) of this section,  the final report must include the following when applicable: a  disclosure of any inventions not previously reported that were conceived  or first actually reduced to practice during the performance of the work  under the award; a written statement on whether or not the awardee  elects (or plans to elect) to obtain patent(s) on any such invention;  and an identification of equipment purchased with any Federal funds  under the award and any subsequent use of such equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CRIS Web Site Via Internet. The CRIS database is available to  the public on the worldwide web. CRIS project information is available  via the Internet CRIS Web site at http://cris.nifa.usda.gov. To submit  forms electronically, the CRIS forms Web site can be accessed through  the CRIS Web site or accessed directly at http://cwf.uvm.edu/cris.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional reporting requirements. Awardees may be required to  submit other technical reports or submit the CRIS reports more  frequently than annually. Additional requirements for a specific Federal  assistance program are described in the applicable subpart after subpart  E and are identified in the RFA. The Award Face Sheet (Form NIFA-2009)  also will specify these additional reporting requirements as a special  provision to the award terms and conditions.</p>
