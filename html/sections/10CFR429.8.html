                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of carrying out parts 429, 430, and 431, the General  Counsel (or delegee), may sign and issue subpoenas for the attendance  and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant books,  records, papers, and other documents, and administer oaths. Witnesses  summoned under the provisions of this section shall be paid the same  fees and mileage as are paid to witnesses in the courts of the United  States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpoena served,  upon any persons subject to parts 429, 430, or 431, the General Counsel  (or delegee) may seek an order from the District Court of the United  States for any District in which such person is found or resides or  transacts business requiring such person to appear and give testimony,  or to appear and produce documents. Failure to obey such order is  punishable by such court as contempt thereof.</p>
