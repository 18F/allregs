Where it is  industry policy to guarantee components for the life of the equipment  (e.g., crystals in transmitters and receivers in radio communications  systems) or to require that highly technical equipment be returned to  the factory (at the contractor's or the Government's expense) for  replacement of defective materials or parts, then the clause will be  revised to be compatible with such policy.</p>
