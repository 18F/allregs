                                Sec. 325.10  Modifying or revoking a certificate.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Action subject to modification or revocation. The Secretary shall revoke a certificate, in whole or in part, or modify it, as the Secretary or the Attorney General considers necessary, if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The export conduct of a person or entity protected by the certificate no

longer complies with the requirements set forth in Sec. 325.4(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A person or entity protected by the certificate fails to comply with a request for information under paragraph (b) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The certificate holder fails to file a complete annual report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Request for information. If the Secretary or the Attorney General has reason to believe that the export trade, export trade activities, or methods of operation of a person or entity protected by a certificate no longer comply with the requirements set forth in Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall request any information that he or the Attorney General considers to be necessary to resolve the matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Proceedings for the revocation or modification of a certificate--(1) Notification letter. If, after reviewing the relevant information in their possession, it appears to the Secretary or the Attorney General that a certificate should be revoked or modified for any of the reasons set forth in paragraph (a) above, the Secretary shall so notify the certificate holder in writing. The notification shall be sent by registered or certified mail to the address specified in the certificate. The notification shall include a detailed statement of the facts, conduct, or circumstances which may warrant the revocation or modification of the certificate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Answer. The certificate holder shall respond to the notification letter within thirty days after receiving it, unless the Secretary, in his discretion, grants a thirty day extension for good cause shown. The certificate holder shall respond specifically to the statement included with the notification letter and state in detail why the facts, conduct or circumstances described in the notification letter are not true, or if they are true, why they do not warrant the revoking or modifying of the certificate. If the certificate holder does not respond within the specified period, it will be considered an admission of the statements contained in the notification letter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Resolution of factual disputes. Where material facts are in dispute, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall, upon request, meet informally with the certificate holder. The Secretary or the Attorney General may require the certificate holder to provide any documents or information that are necessary to support its contentions. After reviewing the statements of the certificate holder and the documents or information that the certificate holder has submitted, and upon considering other relevant documents or information in his possession, the Secretary shall make proposed findings of the factual matters in dispute. The Attorney General is not bound by the proposed findings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Final determination. The Secretary and the Attorney General shall review the notification letter and the certificate holder's answer to it, the proposed factual findings made under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, and any other relevant documents or information in their possession. If, after review, the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that the export conduct of a person or entity protected by the certificate no longer complies with the standards set forth in Sec. 325.4(b), the Secretary shall revoke or modify the certificate as appropriate. If the Secretary or the Attorney General determines that the certificate holder has failed to comply with the request for information under paragraph (b) of this section, or has failed to file a complete annual report, and that the failure to comply or file should result in revocation of modification, the Secretary shall revoke or modify the certificate as appropriate. The determination will be final and will be issued to the certificate holder in writing. The notice to the certificate holder shall include a statement of the circumstances underlying and the reasons in support of the determination. If the Secretary determines to revoke or modify the certificate, the decision shall specify the effective date of the revocation or modification; this date must be at least thirty days but not more than ninety days after the Secretary notifies the certificate holder of his determination. The Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of a revocation or modification or a decision not to revoke or modify.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Investigative information. In proceedings under this section, the Attorney General shall make available to

the Secretary any information that has been obtained in response to Civil Investigative Demands issued under section 304(b)(3) of the Act. Unless prohibited by law, the Attorney General and the Secretary shall also make available to each other any other information which each is relying upon under these proceedings.</p>
