in contact with liquid eggs or exposed edible products shall be cleaned to eliminate organic matter and inorganic residues. This may be accomplished by any sanitary means but it is preferable (unless high pressure cleaning is used) to flush soiled equipment with clean cool water, dismantle it when possible, wash by brushing with warm water containing a detergent and followed by rinsing with water.
