Recurring income means income which is  received or anticipated in equal amounts and at regular intervals (e.g.,  weekly, monthly, quarterly, etc.), and which will continue throughout an  entire 12-month annualization period. The amount of recurring income for  pension purposes will be the amount received or anticipated during a 12- month annualization period. Recurring income which terminates prior to  being counted for at least one full 12-month annualization period will  be treated as nonrecurring income for computation purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Irregular income. Irregular income means income which is  received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period, but  which is received in unequal amounts or at irregular intervals. The  amount of irregular income for pension purposes will be the amount  received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period following  initial receipt of such income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonrecurring income. Nonrecurring income means income received  or anticipated on a one-time basis during a 12-month annualization  period (e.g., an inheritance). Pension computations of income will  include nonrecurring income for a full 12-month annualization period  following receipt of the income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Salary. Salary means the gross amount of a person's earnings or  wages before any deductions are made for such things as taxes,  insurance, retirement plans, social security, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Business, farm or professional income. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This includes gross  income from a business, farm or profession as reduced by the necessary  operating expenses such as cost of goods sold, or expenditures for rent,  taxes, and upkeep, or costs of repairs or replacements. The value of an  increase in stock inventory of a business is not considered income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Depreciation is not a deductible expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A loss sustained in operating a business, profession, farm, or  from investments, may not be deducted from income derived from any other  source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Income from property. Income from real or personal property is  countable as income of the property's owner. The terms of a recorded  deed or other evidence of title shall constitute evidence of ownership.  This includes property acquired through purchase, gift, devise, or  descent. If property is owned jointly, income of the various owners  shall be determined in proportion to shares of ownership of the  property. The owner's shares of income held in partnership shall be  determined on the basis of the facts found.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installments. Income shall be determined by the total amount  received or anticipated during a 12-month annualization period.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deferred determinations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When an individual is unable to  predict with certainty the amount of countable annual income, the annual  rate of improved pension shall be reduced by the greatest amount of  anticipated countable income until the end of the 12-month annualization  period, when total income received during that period will be determined  and adjustments in pension payable made accordingly.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a claimed dependent is shown to have income which exceeds  the additional amount of benefits payable based on the claimed  dependency, but evidence requirements of Sec.  3.204, Sec.  3.205, Sec.   3.209, or Sec.  3.210 have not been met, the maximum annual rate of  improved pension shall be determined without consideration of the  claimed dependency. This amount shall be reduced by an amount which  includes the income of the unestablished dependent. Adjustments in  computation of the maximum annual rate of improved pension shall occur  following receipt of evidence necessary to establish the dependency.
