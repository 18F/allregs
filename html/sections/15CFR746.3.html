                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to United Nations Security Council (UNSC) Resolutions 1483 and 1546 and other relevant resolutions, the United Nations maintains an embargo on the sale or supply to Iraq of arms and related materiel and their means of production, except items required by the Government of Iraq to serve the purposes of Resolution 1546. UNSC Resolutions 707 and 687 require that Iraq eliminate its nuclear weapons program and restrict its nuclear activities to the use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes. Such resolutions further mandate that Iraq eliminate its chemical and biological weapons programs as well as its ballistic missile program. In support of the applicable UNSC resolutions, certain Iraq specific license requirements and licensing policies are detailed in this section. In addition, this section details restrictions on transfers of items subject to the EAR within Iraq. Exporters should be aware that other provisions of the EAR, including parts 742 and 744, will continue to apply with respect to exports and reexports to Iraq and transfers within Iraq.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> License requirements. (1) A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for NS, MT, NP, CW, CB, RS, CC, EI, SI, or SL reasons. See part 742 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for NS, MT, NP, CW, CB, RS, CC, EI, SI, or SL reasons. See part 742 of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item controlled on the Commerce Control List for UN reasons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items on the Commerce Control List controlled for RS reasons under the following ECCNs: 0B999, 0D999, 1B999, 1C992, 1C995, 1C997, 1C999 and 6A992.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A license is required for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of any item subject to the EAR if, at the time of the export, reexport or transfer, you know, have reason to know, or are informed by BIS that the item will be, or is intended to be, used for a ``military end-use'' or by a ``military end-user'', as defined in this section. This license requirement does

not apply to exports, reexports or transfers of items for the official use by personnel and agencies of the U.S. Government or exports, reexports or transfers to the Government of Iraq. See Sec. 740.11(b)(3) of the EAR for the definition of ``agency of the U.S. Government.'' BIS may inform an exporter, reexporter, or other person, either individually by specific notice or through amendment to the EAR, that a license is required for export, reexport or transfer of items subject to the EAR to specified end-users, because BIS has determined that there is an unacceptable risk of diversion to the uses or users described in this paragraph. Specific notice is to be given only by, or at the direction of, the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. When such notice is provided orally, it will be followed by a written notice within two working days signed by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Export Administration. The absence of any such notification does not excuse the exporter, reexporter or other person from compliance with the license requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Military end-use. In this section, the phrase ``military end-use'' means incorporation into a military item described on the U.S. Munitions List (USML) (22 CFR part 121, International Traffic in Arms Regulations) or the Wassenaar Arrangement Munitions List (WAML) (as set out on the Wassenaar Arrangement website at http://www.wassenaar.org); or use, development, or deployment of military items described on the USML or the WAML.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Military end-user. In this section, the term ``military end-user'' means any ``person'' whose actions or functions are intended to support ``military end-uses'' as defined in paragraph (a)(4)(i) of this section and who is not recognized as a legitimate military organization by the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Definitions. For purposes of exports or reexports to Iraq or transfers within Iraq, ``ballistic missile'' is defined as any missile capable of a range greater than 150 kilometers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Licensing policy. (1) License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section for Iraqi civil nuclear or military nuclear activity, except for use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes, will be subject to a policy of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(1), (a)(2), or (a)(3) of this section for Iraqi civil nuclear or military nuclear activity, except for use of isotopes for medical, industrial or agricultural purposes, will be subject to a policy of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of machine tools controlled for national security (NS) or nuclear nonproliferation (NP) reasons, as well as for any items controlled for crime control (CC) or United Nations (UN) reasons (including items classified under ECCN 0A986) or ECCNs that end in the number ``018'' or items classified under ``600 series'' ECCNs, that would make a material contribution to the production, research, design, development, support, maintenance or manufacture of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missiles or arms and related materiel will be subject to a general policy of denial. Exports of ``600 series'' items to the Government of Iraq will be reviewed under the policies set forth for such items in Sec. Sec. 742.4(b) and 742.6(b) of the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(3) of this section will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis to determine if they would contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure. Applications determined not to contribute to the building of Iraqi civil infrastructure will be subject to a general policy of denial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> License applications for the export or reexport to Iraq or transfer within Iraq of items listed in paragraph (a)(4) of this section will be subject to a policy of denial.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License exceptions. You may export or reexport without a license if your transaction meets all the requirements of any of the following License Exceptions: CIV, APP, TMP, RPL, GOV, GFT, TSU, BAG, AVS, or ENC. For specific requirements of each of these License Exceptions, refer to part 740 of the EAR. Notwithstanding the above, this paragraph may not be applied to exports or reexports that require a license under paragraph (a)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Related State Department controls. The Department of State, Directorate of Defense Trade Controls, maintains

controls on arms and military equipment to Iraq under the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (22 CFR parts 120 through 130).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Transition for licenses issued by the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control. Prior to July 30, 2004, the Department of the Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) exercised primary licensing jurisdiction for transactions with Iraq, as provided in 31 CFR part 575. This section establishes a validity period for licenses issued by OFAC for exports or reexports to Iraq.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Validity period. Licenses issued by OFAC for the export or reexport of items that require a license to Iraq under the Export Administration Regulations (EAR) shall continue to be valid under the EAR. For those licenses with specified expiration dates, such dates will continue to apply. Licenses without specified expiration dates will be valid through July 30, 2005. The recordkeeping requirements applicable to exports and reexports of items pursuant to licenses issued by OFAC are described in paragraph (e)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">Note to paragraph (e)(1): Persons that have been authorized by OFAC to export or reexport items that are subject to the export control jurisdiction of other agencies must consult with OFAC and the other relevant agencies with regard to the expiration date of the authorization granted by OFAC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reexports or transfers. Items subject to a license requirement under the EAR for export or reexport to Iraq as of July 30, 2004, that were previously exported or reexported to Iraq under a specific license granted by OFAC:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> May not be transferred within Iraq to a new end-user without a license from BIS,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> May be reexported to the United States without a license,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> May be reexported to third countries subject to the license requirements for the destination, end-use or end-user set forth elsewhere in the EAR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Recordkeeping requirement. Persons in receipt of a specific license granted by OFAC described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section must maintain a record of those items exported or reexported to Iraq pursuant to such specific license and record when the items are consumed or destroyed in the normal course of their use in Iraq, reexported to a third country not requiring further authorization from BIS, or returned to the United States. This requirement applies only to items subject to a license requirement under the EAR for export to Iraq as of July 30, 2004. These records must be maintained in accordance with recordkeeping requirements set forth in part 762 of the EAR and must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Date of export or reexport and related details (including means of transport);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Description of items (including ECCN) and value of items in U.S. Dollars;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Description of proposed end-use and locations in Iraq where items are intended to be used;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Parties other than specific OFAC licensee who may be given temporary access to the items; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Date of consumption or destruction, if the items are consumed or destroyed in the normal course of their use in Iraq, or the date of reexport to a third country not requiring further authorization from BIS, or return to the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> License Requirements for certain transfers within Iraq of items subject to the EAR--(1) Licensed items.
