                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The regulations in this section (in combination with any other provisions of 22 CFR part 62, as applicable) govern participation in Summer Work Travel programs conducted by Department of State-designated sponsors pursuant to the authority granted the Department of State under Public Law 105-277.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this program is to provide foreign college and university students with opportunities to interact with U.S. citizens, experience U.S. culture while sharing their own cultures with Americans they meet, travel in the United States, and work in jobs that require minimal training and are seasonal or temporary in order to earn funds to help defray a portion of their expenses. Employment is of a seasonal nature when the required service is tied to a certain time of the year by an event or pattern and requires labor levels above and beyond existing worker levels. Employment is of a temporary nature when an employer's need for the duties to be performed is a one-time occurrence, a peak load need, or an intermittent need. It is the nature of employers' needs, not the nature of the duties that is controlling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duration of participation. Summer Work Travel participants are authorized to participate in the Exchange Visitor Program for up to four months during the long break between academic years as determined by the Department of State. Extensions of program participation are not permitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Participant screening and selection. In addition to satisfying the requirements set forth at Sec. 62.10(a), sponsors are solely responsible for adequately screening and making the final selection. The screening process requires that sponsors (or vetted foreign entities acting on their behalf) at a minimum must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct and document interviews with potential participants either in-person or by video-conference;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Verify proficiency in conversational English and reading comprehension through either recognized language tests administered by academic institutions or English language schools or through the required documented interviews;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Select applicants who demonstrate their intention to participate in the cultural aspects of the Summer Work Travel Program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Confirm that at the time of application, applicants (including final year students) are enrolled full-time and pursuing studies at accredited post-secondary, classroom-based, academic institutions physically located outside of the United States and have successfully completed at least one semester, or equivalent, of post-secondary academic study.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Participant orientation. In addition to satisfying the requirements set forth at Sec. 62.10(b) and (c), sponsors must provide program participants, prior to participants' departures from their home countries, the following information and/or documentation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A copy of the Department of State's Summer Work Travel Participant Letter;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the Department of State's Summer Work Travel Program Brochure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Department of State's toll-free help line telephone number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The sponsor's 24/7 immediate contact telephone number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Information advising participants of their obligations to notify their sponsors within ten days after they arrive in the United States and within ten days after they initially secure or change residences;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Information advising participants that they may not begin working at initial, replacement, or additional jobs until their sponsors have verified the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetted their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For participants with jobs secured prior to departing from selected home countries, documentation explaining the terms and conditions of such jobs and providing information about available housing and transportation to and from work;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Information explaining the cultural component of the Summer Work Travel Program, including guidance on how to best experience U.S. culture and/or descriptions of cultural opportunities arranged by the sponsor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Information explaining that sponsors will terminate the programs of participants who fail to comply with enumerated program regulations (i.e., reporting their arrivals, reporting changes of residence, not starting work at unverified jobs, responding to sponsor monthly outreach/monitoring efforts).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Cultural exchange. (1) Sponsors must ensure that all participants have opportunities to work alongside U.S. citizens and interact regularly with U.S. citizens to experience U.S. culture during the workday portion of their Summer Work Travel programs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sponsors must ensure that all participants have opportunities to work alongside U.S. citizens and interact regularly with U.S. citizens to experience U.S. culture during the workday portion of their Summer Work Travel programs; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sponsors must ensure that all participants have opportunities to engage in cultural activities or events outside of work by planning, initializing, and carrying out events or other activities that provide participants' exposure to U.S. culture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Participant placement. (1) Sponsors and third parties acting on their behalf may not pay or otherwise provide any incentive to employers to accept program participants for job placements with such employers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sponsors and third parties acting on their behalf may not pay or otherwise provide any incentive to employers to accept program participants for job placements with such employers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sponsors must confirm initial, replacement, and additional jobs placements of all Summer Work Travel Program participants before participants may start work by verifying, at a minimum, the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetting their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section. Once participants have arrived in the United States and identified initial, replacement, or additional jobs, sponsors must vet such jobs within 72 hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sponsors must not pose obstacles to job changes, but must offer reasonable assistance to participants wishing to change jobs regardless of whether their jobs were secured by the sponsors (direct-placed) or by the participants (self-placed).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Sponsors may place participants only in jobs that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Are seasonal or temporary as defined in paragraph (b) of this section;

whether such arrangements deduct such costs from participants' wages; and the market value of housing and/or transportation in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act regulations set forth at 29 CFR part 531, if they are considered part of the compensation packages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> For participants who are nationals of non-Visa Waiver Program countries and participants who are nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries with job placements screened in advance by the sponsors (direct placement) or jobs found by the participants (self-placement), prior to issuing Form DS-2019, sponsors must vet the potential employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section, confirm the terms and conditions of the job offers, and input complete and correct data into the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) pursuant to the requirements set forth in Sec. 62.70(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Sponsors of applicants who are nationals of Visa Waiver Program countries and who have not secured jobs prior to departing from their home countries must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that such participants receive pre-departure information that explains how to seek employment and secure lodging in the United States, and clearly identifies the criteria for appropriate jobs set forth at paragraph (g) of this section and the categories of employment and positions that are on the program exclusion list set forth at paragraph (h) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Ensure that such participants have sufficient financial resources to support themselves during their searches for employment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assist participants who have not found suitable employment within one week of commencing their job searches;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Instruct participants of their obligation to notify their sponsors when they obtain job offers (and that they cannot start such jobs until the sponsors vet them); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Promptly (i.e., within 72 hours) confirm the initial jobs of such participants, at a minimum, by verifying the terms and conditions of such employment and fully vetting their host employers as set forth at paragraph (n) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Program exclusions.
