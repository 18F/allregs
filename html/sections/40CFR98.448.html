                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Contents of MRV plan. You must develop and submit to the  Administrator a proposed MRV plan for monitoring, reporting, and  verification of geologic sequestration at your facility. Your proposed  MRV plan must contain the following components:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Delineation of the maximum monitoring area and the active  monitoring areas. The first period for your active monitoring area will  begin from the date determined in your MRV plan through the date at  which the plan calls for the first expansion of the monitoring area. The  length of each monitoring period can be any time interval chosen by you  that is greater than 1 year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of potential surface leakage pathways for  CO2 in the maximum monitoring area and the likelihood,  magnitude, and timing, of surface leakage of CO2 through  these pathways.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A strategy for detecting and quantifying any surface leakage of  CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A strategy for establishing the expected baselines for  monitoring CO2 surface leakage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A summary of the considerations you intend to use to calculate  site-specific variables for the mass balance equation. This includes,  but is not limited to, considerations for calculating CO2  emissions from equipment leaks and vented emissions of CO2  between the injection flow meter and injection well and/or the  production flow meter and production well, and considerations for  calculating CO2 in produced fluids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> If a well is permitted under the Underground Injection Control  program, for each injection well, report the well identification number  used for the Underground Injection Control permit and the Underground  Injection Control permit class. If the well is not yet permitted, and  you have applied for an Underground Injection Control permit, report the  well identification numbers in the permit application. If an offshore  well is not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, for each injection  well, report any well identification number and any identification  number used for the legal instrument authorizing geologic sequestration.  If you are submitting your Underground Injection Control permit  application as part of your proposed MRV plan, you must notify EPA when  the permit has been approved. If you are an offshore facility not  subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, and are submitting your  application for the legal instrument authorizing geologic sequestration  as part of your proposed MRV plan, you must notify EPA when the legal  instrument authorizing geologic sequestration has been approved.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Proposed date to begin collecting data for calculating total  amount sequestered according to equation RR-11 or RR-12 of this subpart.  This date must be after expected baselines as required by paragraph  (a)(4) of this section are established and the leakage detection and  quantification strategy as required by paragraph (a)(3) of this section  is implemented in the initial AMA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Timing. You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA according to  the following schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA by June 30, 2011 if  you were issued a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing  the injection of CO2 into the subsurface on or before  December 31, 2010. You will be allowed to request one extension of up to  an additional 180 days in which to submit your proposed MRV plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA within 180 days of  receiving a final Underground Injection Control permit authorizing the  injection of CO2 into the subsurface. If your facility is an  offshore facility not subject to the Safe Drinking Water Act, you must  submit a proposed MRV plan to EPA   within 180 days of receiving authorization to begin geologic  sequestration of CO2. You will be allowed to request one  extension of the submittal date of up to an additional 180 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are injecting a CO2 stream in subsurface  geologic formations to enhance the recovery of oil or natural gas and  you are not permitted as Class VI under the Underground Injection  Control program, you may opt to submit an MRV plan at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If EPA determines that your proposed MRV plan is incomplete, you  must submit an updated MRV plan within 45 days of EPA notification,  unless otherwise specified by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Final MRV plan. The Administrator will issue a final MRV plan  within a reasonable period of time. The Administrator's final MRV plan  is subject to the provisions of part 78 of this chapter. Once the MRV  plan is final and no longer subject to administrative appeal under part  78 of this chapter, you must implement the plan starting on the day  after the day on which the plan becomes final and is no longer subject  to such appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)(4)</em> of this section applies.  You must include the reason(s) for the revisions in your submittal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A material change was made to monitoring and/or operational  parameters that was not anticipated in the original MRV plan. Examples  of material changes include but are not limited to: Large changes in the  volume of CO2 injected; the construction of new injection  wells not identified in the MRV plan; failures of the monitoring system  including monitoring system sensitivity, performance, location, or  baseline; changes to surface land use that affects baseline or  operational conditions; observed plume location that differs  significantly from the predicted plume area used for developing the MRV  plan; a change in the maximum monitoring area or active monitoring area;  or a change in monitoring technology that would result in coverage or  detection capability different from the MRV plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A change in the permit class of your Underground Injection  Control permit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you are notified by EPA of substantive errors in your MRV  plan or monitoring report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You choose to revise your MRV plan for any other reason in any  reporting year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Revised MRV plan. The requirements of paragraph (c) of this  section apply to any submission of a revised MRV plan. You must continue  reporting under your currently approved plan while awaiting approval of  a revised MRV plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Format. Each proposed MRV plan or revision and each annual  report must be submitted electronically in a format specified by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Certificate of representation. You must submit a certificate of  representation according to the provisions in Sec. 98.4 at least 60  days before submission of your MRV plan, your research and development  exemption request, your MRV plan submission extension request, or your  initial annual report under this part, whichever is earlier.
