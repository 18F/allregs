The supervisor of grading  will investigate the matter and, if he deems advisable, will report it  to the owner or his agent. The supervisor of grading shall take  appropriate action to correct errors found in the determination or  identification of class, grade or other quality or compliance of  products if the products are still owned by the person who owned them  when, and are still located at the establishment where, the incorrect  service was rendered and if such service was rendered by a grader under  the jurisdiction of such supervisor, and the supervisor of grading shall  take adequate measures to prevent the recurrence of such errors.</p>
