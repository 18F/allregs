The State submittal contained an interim milestone to supply more accurate emission reduction data demonstrating equivalence no later than one year after the

publication date of the Federal Register notice approving the State's committal SIP revision. California is required to submit the final SIP revision by May 15, 1994. The State held a public meeting on this committal SIP on March 17, 1992. The California SIP revisions are met automatically when the SIP revision concerns a regulation previously adopted by the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]
