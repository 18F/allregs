If address validation is desired or necessary, the Department may obtain information from the IRS pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 6103(m)(2)(4) or (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Given the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence that all or part of the debt is not past-due or not legally enforceable, considered any evidence presented by the debtor, and determined that the debt is past-due and legally enforceable; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Provided the debtor with an opportunity to make a written agreement to repay the debt; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The debt is at least $25.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Referral.
