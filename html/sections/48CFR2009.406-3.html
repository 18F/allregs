                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Investigation and referral. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When a contracting officer  becomes aware of possible irregularities or any information which may be  sufficient cause for   debarment, the contracting officer must first submit a complete  statement of facts (including a copy of any criminal indictments, if  applicable) and a recommendation for action to the Head of the  Contracting Activity. If the contracting officer's statement of facts  indicates misconduct on the part of the contractor in regard to an NRC  contract, the Head of the Contracting Activity will refer the matter of  misconduct to the Inspector General to determine if an investigation is  required prior to referring the case to the debarring official.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To the extent the Head of the Contracting Activity believes that  sufficient grounds for debarment exist, independent of any pending  investigation by the Inspector General, the Head of the Contracting  Activity shall immediately forward the case, without reference to any  pending investigation, and a recommendation for action to the Senior  Procurement Executive for review. In such circumstances, the Head of the  Contracting Activity will take no additional action in regard to a  specific matter of misconduct referred to the Inspector General prior to  consulting with the Inspector General.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Decision-making process. If, after reviewing the recommendations  and consulting with the Office of the General Counsel and, if  appropriate, the Office of the Inspector General, the debarring official  determines debarment is justified, the debarring official shall initiate  the proposed debarment in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c) and notify the  Head of the Contracting Activity of the action taken. If the contractor  fails to submit a timely written response within 30 days after receipt  of the notice in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(c)(4), the debarring  official may notify the contractor in accordance with FAR 9.406-3(d)  that the contractor is debarred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fact-finding proceedings. For actions listed under FAR 9.406- 3(b)(2), the contractor shall be given the opportunity to appear at an  informal hearing. The hearing should be held at a location and time that  is convenient to the parties concerned and no later than 30 days after  the contractor received the notice, if at all possible. The contractor  and any specifically named affiliates may be represented by counsel or  any duly authorized representative. Witnesses may be called by either  party. The proceedings must be conducted expeditiously and in such a  manner that each party will have an opportunity to present all  information considered pertinent to the proposed debarment.</p>
