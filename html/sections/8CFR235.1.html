A citizen of Canada or a permanent resident of Canada who is a national of a country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of this chapter may, if in possession of a valid, unexpired, Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit(Form I-68) or evidence of enrollment in any other Service Alternative Inspections program (e.g., the Immigration and Naturalization Service Passenger Accelerated Service System (INSPASS) or the Port Passenger Accelerated Service System (PORTPASS)), enter the United States by means of a pleasure craft along the northern border of the United States from time-to-time without further inspection. No persons other than those described in this paragraph may participate in this program. Permanent residents of Canada who are nationals of a designated Visa Waiver Program country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of this chapter must be in possession of a valid, unexpired passport issued by his or her country of nationality, and an unexpired multiple entry Form I-94W, Nonimmigrant Visa Waiver Arrival/Departure Form, or an unexpired passport, valid unexpired United States visa and I-94 Arrival/Departure Form. When an entry to the United States is made by a person who is a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada who is a national of a designated Visa Waiver Program country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of this chapter, entry may be made under this program only for a purpose as described in section 101(a)(15)(B)(ii) of the Act as a visitor for pleasure. Persons seeking to enter the United States for any other purpose must do so at a port-of-entry staffed by immigration inspectors. Persons aboard a vessel which has

crossed the international boundary between the United States and Canada and who do not intend to land in the United States, other than at a staffed port-of-entry, are not required to be in possession of Form I-68, Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit, or evidence of enrollment in an Alternative Inspections program merely because they have crossed the international boundary. However, the Service retains the right to conduct inspections or examinations of all persons applying for admission or readmission to or seeking transit through the United States in accordance with the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Application. An eligible applicant may apply for a Canadian Border Boat Landing Permit by completing the Form I-68 in triplicate. Application forms will be made readily available through the Internet, from a Service office, or by mail. A family may apply on a single application. For the purposes of this paragraph, a family is defined as a husband, wife, unmarried children under the age of 21, and the parents of either husband or wife, who reside at the same address. In order for the I-68 application to be considered complete, it must be accompanied by the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For each person included on the application, evidence of citizenship, and, if not a citizen of the Untied States or Canada, evidence of legal permanent resident status in either the United States or Canada. Evidence of residency must be submitted by all applicants. It is not required that all persons on the application be of the same nationality; however, they must all be individually eligible to participate in this program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If multiple members of a family, as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, are included on a single application, evidence of the familial relationship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A fee as prescribed in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A copy of any previously approved Form I-68.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A permanent resident of Canada who is a national of a Visa Waiver Program may apply for admission simultaneously with the Form I-68 application and thereby obtain a Form I-94 or I-94W.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Submission of Form I-68. Except as indicated in this paragraph, Form I-68 shall be properly completed and submitted in person, along with the documentary evidence and the required fee as specified in Sec. 103.7(b)(1) of this chapter, to a United States immigration officer at a Canadian border Port-of-Entry located within the district having jurisdiction over the applicant's residence or intended place of landing. Persons previously granted Form I-68 approval may apply by mail to the issuing Service office for renewal if a copy of the previous Form I-68 is included in the application. At the discretion of the district director concerned, any applicant for renewal of Form I-68 may be required to appear for an interview in person if the applicant does not appear to be clearly eligible for renewal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Denial of Form I-68. If the applicant has committed a violation of any immigration or customs regulation or, in the case of an alien, is inadmissible to the United States, approval of the Form I-68 shall be denied. However, if, in the exercise of discretion, the district director waives under section 212(d)(3) of the Act all applicable grounds of inadmissibility, the I-68 application may be approved for such non-citizens. If the Form I-68 application is denied, the applicant shall be given written notice of and the reasons for the denial by letter from the district director. There is no appeal from the denial of the Form I-68 application, but the denial is without prejudice to a subsequent application for this program or any other Service benefit, except that the applicant may not submit a subsequent Form I-68 application for 90 days after the date of the last denial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Validity. Form I-68 shall be valid for 1 year from the date of issuance, or until revoked or violated by the Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Conditions for participation in the I-68 program. Upon being inspected and positively identified by an immigration officer and found admissible and eligible for participation in the I-68 program, a participant must agree to abide by the following conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Form I-68 may be used only when entering the United States by means of a vessel exclusively used for pleasure,

Participants over the age of 15 years and who are not in possession of an INSPASS or PORTPASS enrollment card must also be in possession of a photographic identification document issued by a governmental agency. Participants who are permanent residents of Canada who are nationals of a Visa Waiver Program country listed in Sec. 217.2(a) of this chapter must also be in possession of proper documentation as described in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Participants may not import merchandise or transport controlled or restricted items while entering the United States under this program. The entry of any merchandise or goods must be in accordance with the laws and regulations of all Federal Inspection Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Participants must agree to random checks or inspections that may be conducted by the Service, at any time and at any location, to ensure compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Participants must abide by all Federal, state, and local laws regarding the importation of alcohol or agricultural products or the importation or possession of controlled substances as defined in section 101 of the Controlled Substance Act (21 U.S.C. 802).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Participants acknowledge that all devices, decals, cards, or other Federal Government supplied identification or technology used to identify or inspect persons or vessels seeking entry via this program remain the property of the United States Government at all times, and must be surrendered upon request by a Border Patrol Agent or any other officer of a Federal Inspection Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The captain, charterer, master, or owner (if aboard) of each vessel bringing persons into the United States is responsible for determining that all persons aboard the vessel are in possession of a valid, unexpired Form I-68 or other evidence of participation in a Service Alternative Inspections program (INSPASS or PORTPASS) prior to entry into the territorial waters of the United States. If any person on board is not in possession of such evidence, the captain, charterer, master, or owner must transport such person to a staffed United States Port-of-Entry for an in-person immigration inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Revocation. The district director, the chief patrol agent, or their designated representatives may revoke the designation of any participant who violates any condition of this program, as contained in paragraph (e)(5) of this section, or who has violated any immigration law or regulation, or a law or regulation of the United States Customs Service or other Federal Inspection Service, has abandoned his or her residence in the United States or Canada, is inadmissible to the United States, or who is otherwise determined by an immigration officer to be ineligible for continued participation in this program. Such persons may be subject to other applicable sanctions, such as criminal and/or administrative prosecution or deportation, as well as possible seizure of goods and/or vessels. If permission to participate is revoked, a written request to the district director for restoration of permission to participate may be made. The district director will notify the person of his or her decision and the reasons therefore in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Compliance checking. Participation in this program does not relieve the holder from responsibility to comply with all other aspects of United States Immigration, Customs, or other Federal inspection service laws or regulations. To prevent abuse, the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service retains the right to conduct inspections or examinations of all persons applying for admission or readmission to or seeking transit through

the United States in accordance with the Immigration and Nationality Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Form I-94, Arrival-Departure Record. (1) Unless otherwise exempted, each arriving nonimmigrant who is admitted to the United States will be issued a Form I-94 as evidence of the terms of admission. For land border admission, a Form I-94 will be issued only upon payment of a fee, and will be considered issued for multiple entries unless specifically annotated for a limited number of entries.
