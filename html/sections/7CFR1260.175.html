Any remaining amount due,  which shall include any unpaid charges previously made pursuant to this  section, shall be increased at the same rate on the corresponding day of  each month thereafter until paid. For the purposes of this section, any  assessment that was determined at a date later than prescribed by this  subpart because of a person's failure to submit a report to the Board  when due shall be considered to have been payable by the date it would  have been due if the report had been filed when due. The timeliness of a  payment to the Board shall be based on the applicable postmark date or  the date actually received by the qualified State beef council or Board,  whichever is earlier.</p>
