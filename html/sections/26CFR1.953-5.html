                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. A controlled foreign corporation is not excluded from the application of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.953-1 because such corporation, if it were a domestic corporation, would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies. Thus, if a controlled foreign corporation reinsures or issues insurance or annuity contracts in connection with United States risks, as defined in Sec. 1.953-2 or Sec. 1.953-3, and satisfies the 5-percent minimum premium requirement prescribed in paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.953-1, such corporation may derive income from the insurance of United States risks even though the primary and predominant business activity of such corporation during the taxable year is not the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Income from insurance of United States risks by noninsurance company. For purposes of paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.953-1, the taxable income derived from the reinsuring or the issuing of any insurance or annuity contract in connection with United States risks by a controlled foreign corporation which, if it were a domestic corporation, would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies shall be determined under Sec. 1.953-4, subject to, and to the extent not inconsistent with, the special rules prescribed in paragraph (c) or (d) of this section, whichever applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules in determining taxable income--(1) In general. The rules prescribed in this paragraph apply in order to exclude from the determination under Sec. 1.953-4 of the taxable income described in paragraph (b) of this section those items of the controlled foreign corporation's gross income and deductions which are not attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The rules prescribed in this paragraph apply in order to exclude from the determination under Sec. 1.953-4 of the taxable income described in paragraph (b) of this section those items of the controlled foreign corporation's gross income and deductions which are not attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Life insurance taxable income--(i) Amount of investment yield taken into account. For purposes of determining the taxable income of a controlled foreign corporation which would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies if it were a domestic corporation but would be taxable as an insurance company to which part I of such subchapter applies if it were a domestic insurance company engaged in the business of only reinsuring or issuing the insurance or annuity contracts which have been reinsured or issued by such corporation, the investment yield under section 804(c), the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss, and all items of income taken into account

under section 809(c)(3) shall be taken into account, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 1.953-4, in an amount which bears the same ratio to each of such amounts of investment yield, excess gain, and income items, as the case may be, as the numerator determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph bears to the denominator determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amount of investment yield taken into account. For purposes of determining the taxable income of a controlled foreign corporation which would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies if it were a domestic corporation but would be taxable as an insurance company to which part I of such subchapter applies if it were a domestic insurance company engaged in the business of only reinsuring or issuing the insurance or annuity contracts which have been reinsured or issued by such corporation, the investment yield under section 804(c), the amount (if any) by which the net long-term capital gain exceeds the net short-term capital loss, and all items of income taken into account

under section 809(c)(3) shall be taken into account, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 1.953-4, in an amount which bears the same ratio to each of such amounts of investment yield, excess gain, and income items, as the case may be, as the numerator determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph bears to the denominator determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Numerator. The numerator used for purposes of the apportionment under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The mean of each of the items described in section 810(c) at the beginning and end of the taxable year, determined in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.953-4 for purposes of determining taxable income of a controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.953-4,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The mean of other liabilities at the beginning and end of the taxable year which are attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The mean of the earnings and profits accumulated by the controlled foreign corporation at the beginning and end of the taxable year (determined without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year) which are attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Denominator. The denominator used for purposes of the apportionment under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the mean of the value of the total assets held by the controlled foreign corporation at the beginning and end of the taxable year, determined by taking assets into account at their actual value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be (a) face value in the case of bills receivable, accounts receivable, notes receivable, and open accounts held by a controlled foreign corporation using the cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting and (b) adjusted basis in the case of all other assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Mutual and other insurance taxable income--(i) Amount of insurance income taken into account. For purposes of determining the taxable income of a controlled foreign corporation which, if it were a domestic corporation, would not be taxable as an insurance company to which subchapter L of the Code applies but which if it were a domestic insurance company engaged in the business of only reinsuring or issuing the insurance or annuity contracts which have been reinsured or issued by such corporation, would be taxable as a mutual insurance company to which part II of subchapter L of the Code applies, or would be taxable as a mutual marine insurance or other insurance company to which part III of subchapter L of the Code applies, the sum of the items of gross income referred to in section 832(b)(1) (except the gross amount earned during the taxable year from underwriting income described in section 832(b)(1)(A)) reduced by the deductions allowable under section 832(c) which are related to such items of gross income shall be taken into account, subject to the provisions of paragraphs (e) and (f) of Sec. 1.953-4, in an amount which bears the same proportion to the sum of such items of gross income reduced by such deductions as the numerator determined under subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph bears to the denominator determined under subdivision (iii) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amount of insurance income taken into account.

The numerator used for purposes of the apportionment under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The mean of the controlled foreign corporation's unearned premiums at the beginning and end of the taxable year, determined under section 832(b)(4)(B) and in accordance with the rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.953-4 for purposes of determining taxable income of a controlled foreign corporation under paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.953-4,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The mean of such corporation's unpaid losses at the beginning and end of the taxable year, determined under section 832(b)(5)(B),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The mean of the items described in section 810(c)(4) at the beginning and end of the taxable year, to the extent allowable to such corporation under section 832(c)(11),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The mean of other liabilities at the beginning and end of the taxable

year which are attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The mean of the earnings and profits accumulated by such corporation at the beginning and end of the taxable year (determined without diminution by reason of any distributions made during the taxable year) which are attributable to the reinsuring and issuing of insurance and annuity contracts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Denominator. The denominator used for purposes of the apportionment under subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall be the mean of the value of the total assets held by the controlled foreign corporation at the beginning and end of the taxable year, determined in the manner prescribed in subparagraph (2)(iii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Separate accounting. The special rules prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section shall not apply if the district director determines that the controlled foreign corporation, in good faith and unaffected by considerations of tax liability, regularly employs in its books of account a detailed segregation of receipts, expenditures, assets, liabilities, and net worth which clearly reflects the income derived from the reinsuring or issuing of insurance or annuity contracts. The district director, in making such determination, shall give effect to any foreign law, satisfactory evidence of which is presented by the United States shareholder to the district director, which requires a reasonable segregation of the insurance assets of the controlled foreign corporation.
