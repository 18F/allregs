                            <p class="depth0">With respect to any proceeding it is improper for any interested  person to attempt to sway the judgment of the reviewing authority by  undertaking to bring pressure or influence to bear upon the reviewing  authority or any officer having a responsibility for a decision in the  proceeding, or decisional staff. It is improper that such interested  persons or any members of the Department of Veterans Affairs's staff or  the presiding officer give statements to communications media, by paid  advertisement or otherwise, designed to influence the judgment of any  officer having a responsibility for a decision in the proceeding, or  decisional staff. It is improper for any person to solicit  communications to any such officer, or decisional staff, other than  proper communications by parties or amici curiae.
