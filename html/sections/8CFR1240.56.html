                            <p class="depth0">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, an alien who is deportable because of a conviction on or after November 18, 1988, for an aggravated felony as defined in section 101(a)(43) of

the Act, shall not be eligible for voluntary departure as prescribed in 8 CFR part 1240 and section 244 of the Act. Pursuant to subpart F of this part and section 244 of the Act, an immigration judge may authorize the suspension of an alien's deportation; or, if the alien establishes that he or she is willing and has the immediate means with which to depart promptly from the United States, an immigration judge may authorize the alien to depart voluntarily from the United States in lieu of deportation within such time as may be specified by the immigration judge when first authorizing voluntary departure, and under such conditions as the district director shall direct. An application for suspension of deportation shall be made on Form EOIR-40.</p>
