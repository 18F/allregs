                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A sales history for each grower shall be computed by the committee in the following manner:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For growers with acreage with 6 or more years of sales history, the sales history shall be computed using an average of the highest four of the most recent six years of sales.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted or replanted 2 years prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For growers with 5 years of sales history from acreage planted or replanted 1 year prior to the first harvest on that acreage, the sales history is computed by averaging the highest 4 of the 5 years and in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For a grower with 4 years or less of sales history, the sales history shall be computed by dividing the total sales from that acreage by 4 and in a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation shall be adjusted as provided in paragraph (a)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For growers with acreage having no sales history, or for the first harvest of replanted acres, the sales history will be the average first year yields (depending on whether first harvested 1 or 2 years after planting or replanting) as established by the committee and multiplied by the number of acres.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In a year prior to a year of a producer allotment volume regulation, in addition to the sales history computed in accordance with paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of this section, additional sales history shall be assigned to growers using the formula x = (a-b)c. The letter ``x'' constitutes the additional number of barrels to be added to the grower's sales history. The value ``a'' is the expected yield for the forthcoming year harvested acreage as established by the committee. The value ``b'' is the total sales from that acreage as established by the committee divided by four. The value ``c'' is the number of acres planted or replanted in the specified year. For acreage with five years of sales history: a = the expected yield for the forthcoming sixth year harvested acreage (as established by the committee); b = an average of the most recent 4 years of expected yields (as established by the committee); and c = the number of acres with 5 years of sales history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A new sales history shall be calculated for each grower after each crop year, using the formulas established in paragraph (a) of this section, or such other formula(s) as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The committee, with the approval of the Secretary, may adopt regulations to change the number and identity of years to be used in computing sales histories, including the number of years to be used in computing the average. The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Sales histories, starting with the crop year following adoption of this part, shall be calculated separately for fresh and processed cranberries. The amount of fresh fruit sales history may be calculated based on either the delivered weight of the barrels paid for by the handler (excluding trash and unusable fruit) or on the weight of the fruit paid for by the handler after cleaning and sorting for the retail market. Handlers using the former calculation shall allocate delivered fresh fruit subsequently used for processing to growers' processing sales. Fresh fruit sales history, in whole or in part, may be added to process fruit sales history with the approval of the committee in the event that the grower's fruit does not qualify as fresh fruit at delivery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The committee may recommend rules and regulations, with the approval of the Secretary, to adjust a grower's sales history to compensate for catastrophic events that impact the grower's crop.

929.49  Marketable quantity, allotment percentage, and annual allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Marketable quantity and allotment percentage. If the Secretary finds, from the recommendation of the committee or from other available information, that limiting the quantity of cranberries purchased from or handled on behalf of growers during a crop year would tend to effectuate the declared policy of the Act, the Secretary shall determine and establish a marketable quantity for that crop year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The marketable quantity shall be apportioned among growers by applying the allotment percentage to each grower's sales history, established pursuant to Sec. 929.48. Such allotment percentage shall be established by the Secretary and shall equal the marketable quantity divided by the total of all growers' sales histories including the estimated total sales history for new growers. Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, no handler shall purchase or handle on behalf of any grower cranberries not within such grower's annual allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In any crop year in which the production of cranberries is estimated by the committee to be equal to or less than its recommended marketable quantity, the committee may recommend that the Secretary increase or suspend the allotment percentage applicable to that year. In the event it is found that market demand is greater than the marketable quantity previously set, the committee may recommend that the Secretary increase such quantity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Issuance of annual allotments. The committee shall require all growers to qualify for such allotment by filing with the committee a form wherein growers include the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of acreage which will be harvested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A copy of any lease agreement covering cranberry acreage;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The name of the handler(s) to whom their annual allotment will be delivered;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Such other information as may be necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, the committee shall issue to each grower an annual allotment determined by applying the allotment percentage established pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section to the grower's sales history.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> On or before such date as determined by the committee, with the approval of the Secretary, in which an allotment percentage is established by the Secretary, the committee shall notify each handler of the annual allotment that can be handled for each grower whose total crop will be delivered to that handler. In cases where a grower delivers a crop to more than one handler, the grower must specify how the annual allotment will be apportioned among the handlers. If a grower does not specify how their annual allotment is to be apportioned among the handlers, the Committee will apportion such annual allotment equally among those handlers they are delivering their crop to.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Growers who do not produce cranberries equal to their computed annual allotment shall transfer their unused allotment to such growers' handlers unless it is transferred to another grower in accordance with Sec. 929.50(b) or if it is not assigned in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. The handler shall equitably allocate the unused annual allotment to growers with excess cranberries who deliver to such handler. Unused annual allotment remaining after all such transfers have occurred shall be reported and transferred to the committee by such date as established by the committee with the approval of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Handlers who receive cranberries more than the sum of their growers' annual allotments have ``excess cranberries,'' pursuant to Sec. 929.59, and shall so notify the committee. Handlers who have remaining unused allotment pursuant to paragraph (g) of this section are ``deficient'' and shall so notify the

committee. The committee shall allocate unused allotment to all handlers having excess cranberries, proportional to each handler's total allotment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Growers who decide not to grow a crop, during any crop year in which a volume regulation is in effect, may choose not to assign their allotment to a handler.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> The committee may establish, with the approval of the Secretary, rules and regulations necessary for the implementation and operation of this section.
