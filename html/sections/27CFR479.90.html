                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A firearm may be transferred without payment of the transfer tax  to or from any State, possession of the United States, any political  subdivision thereof, or any official police organization of such a  governmental entity engaged in criminal investigations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The exemption provided in paragraph (a) of this section shall be  obtained by the transferor of the firearm filing with the Director an  application, Form 5 (Firearms), Application for Tax-exempt Transfer and  Registration of Firearm, in duplicate, executed under the penalties of  perjury. The application shall (1) show the name and address of the  transferor and of the transferee, (2) identify the Federal firearms  license and special (occupational) tax stamp, if any, of the transferor  and of the transferee, (3) show the name and address of the manufacturer  and the importer of the firearm, if known, (4) show the type, model,  overall length (if applicable), length of barrel, caliber, gauge or  size, serial number, and other marks of identification of the firearm,  and (5) contain a statement by the transferor that the transferor is  entitled to the exemption because either the transferor or the  transferee is a governmental entity coming within the purview of  paragraph (a) of this section. In the case of a transfer of a firearm by  a governmental entity to a transferee who is a natural person not  qualified as a manufacturer, importer,   or dealer under this part, the transferee shall be further identified in  the manner prescribed in Sec. 479.85. If the Director approves an  application, Form 5 (Firearms), the original Form 5 (Firearms) shall be  returned to the transferor with the approval noted thereon. Approval of  an application, Form 5 (Firearms), by the Director shall effectuate the  registration of that firearm to the transferee. Upon receipt of the  approved Form 5 (Firearms), the transferor shall deliver same with the  firearm to the transferee. The transferor shall not transfer the firearm  to the transferee until the application, Form 5 (Firearms), has been  approved by the Director and the original thereof has been returned to  the transferor. If the Director disapproves the application, Form 5  (Firearms), the original Form 5 (Firearms) shall be returned to the  transferor with the reasons for the disapproval stated thereon. An  application by a governmental entity to transfer a firearm shall be  denied if the transfer, receipt, or possession of a firearm would place  the transferee in violation of law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The transferor shall be responsible for establishing the exempt  status of the transferee before making a transfer under the provisions  of this section. Therefore, before engaging in transfer negotiations  with the transferee, the transferor should satisfy himself of the  claimed exempt status of the transferee and the bona fides of the  transaction. If not fully satisfied, the transferor should communicate  with the Director, report all circumstances regarding the proposed  transfer, and await the Director's advice before making application for  transfer. An unapproved transfer or a transfer to an unauthorized person  may subject the transferor to civil and criminal liabilities. (See 26  U.S.C. 5852, 5861, and 5871.)  [36 FR 14256, Aug. 3, 1971.
