                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All leases must be classified as either capital or operating  leases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The service company must record a capital lease as an asset in  account 101.1, Property under capital leases (Sec. 367.1011) and an  obligation in account 227, Obligations under capital leases--Non-current  (Sec. 367.2270), or account 243,   Obligations under capital leases--Current (Sec. 367.2430), at an amount  equal to the present value at the beginning of the lease term of minimum  lease payments during the lease term, excluding that portion of the  payments representing executory costs such as insurance, maintenance,  and taxes to be paid by the lessor, together with any related profit.  However, if the determined amount exceeds the fair value of the leased  property at the inception of the lease, the amount recorded as the asset  and obligation must be the fair value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The service company, as a lessee, must recognize an asset  retirement obligation (See General Instructions in Sec. 367.22) arising  from the property under a capital lease unless the obligation is  recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease. The service  company must record the asset retirement cost by debiting account 101.1,  Property under capital leases (Sec. 367.1011), and crediting the  liability for the asset retirement obligation in account 230, Asset  retirement obligations (Sec. 367.2300). Asset retirement costs recorded  in account 101.1 (Sec. 367.1011) must be amortized by charging rent  expense (see Operating Expense Instructions in Sec. 367.82) or account  421, Miscellaneous income or loss (Sec. 367.4210), as appropriate, and  crediting a separate subaccount of the account in which the asset  retirement costs are recorded. Charges for the periodic accretion of the  liability in account 230, Asset retirement obligations (Sec. 367.2300),  must be recorded by a charge to account 411.10, Accretion expense (Sec.  367.4118), for service company property, and account 421, Miscellaneous  income or loss (Sec. 367.4210), for non-service company property and a  credit to account 230, Asset retirement obligations (Sec. 367.2300).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Rental payments on all leases must be charged to rent expense,  fuel expense, construction work in progress, or other appropriate  accounts as they become payable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For a capital lease, for each period during the lease term, the  amounts recorded for the asset and obligation must be reduced by an  amount equal to the portion of each lease payment that would have been  allocated to the reduction of the obligation, if the payment had been  treated as a payment on an installment obligation (liability) and  allocated between interest expense and a reduction of the obligation so  as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining  balance.</p>
