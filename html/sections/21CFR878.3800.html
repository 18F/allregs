                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. An external aesthetic restoration prosthesis is a device intended to be used to construct an external artificial body structure, such as an ear, breast, or nose. Usually the device is made of silicone rubber and it may be fastened to the body with an external prosthesis adhesive. The device is not intended to be implanted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class I (general controls). The device is exempt from the premarket notification procedures in subpart E of part 807 of this chapter, subject to the limitations in Sec. 878.9. If the device is intended for use without an external prosthesis adhesive to fasten it to the body, the device is exempt from the current good manufacturing practice requirements of the quality system regulation in part 820 of this chapter, with the exception of Sec. 820.180, with respect to general requirements concerning records, and Sec. 820.198, with respect to complaint files.
