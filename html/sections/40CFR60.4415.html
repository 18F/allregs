                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must conduct an initial performance test, as required in Sec. 60.8. Subsequent SO2 performance tests shall be conducted on an annual basis (no more than 14 calendar months following the previous performance test). There are three methodologies that you may use to conduct the performance tests.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you choose to periodically determine the sulfur content of the fuel combusted in the turbine, a representative fuel sample would be collected following ASTM D5287 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17) for natural gas or ASTM D4177 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17) for oil. Alternatively, for oil, you may follow the procedures for manual pipeline sampling in section 14 of ASTM D4057 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). The fuel analyses of this section may be performed either by you, a service contractor retained by you, the fuel vendor, or any other qualified agency. Analyze the samples for the total sulfur content of the fuel using:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For liquid fuels, ASTM D129, or alternatively D1266, D1552, D2622, D4294, or D5453 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For gaseous fuels, ASTM D1072, or alternatively D3246, D4084, D4468, D4810, D6228, D6667, or Gas Processors Association Standard 2377 (all of which are incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measure the SO2 concentration (in parts per million (ppm)), using EPA Methods 6, 6C, 8, or 20 in appendix A of this part. In addition, the American

Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) standard, ASME PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10, ``Flue and Exhaust Gas Analyses,'' manual methods for sulfur dioxide (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17) can be used instead of EPA Methods 6 or 20. For units complying with the output based standard, concurrently measure the stack gas flow rate, using EPA Methods 1 and 2 in appendix A of this part, and measure and record the electrical and thermal output from the unit. Then use the following equation to calculate the SO2 emission rate:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY06.005

In addition, you may use the manual methods for sulfur dioxide ASME PTC 19-10-1981-Part 10 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 60.17). Concurrently measure the heat input to the unit, using a fuel flowmeter (or flowmeters), and measure the electrical and thermal output of the unit. Use EPA Method 19 in appendix A of this part to calculate the SO2 emission rate in lb/MMBtu. Then, use Equations 1 and, if necessary, 2 and 3 in Sec. 60.4350(f) to calculate the SO2 emission rate in lb/MWh.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Definitions</p>
