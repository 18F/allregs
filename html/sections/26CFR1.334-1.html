                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 334 sets forth rules prescribing the basis of property received in a distribution in partial or complete liquidation of a corporation. The general rule of section 334 is set forth in section 334(a) to the effect that if property is received in a distribution in partial or complete liquidation and if gain or loss is recognized on the receipt of such property, then the basis of the property in the hands of the distributee shall be the fair market value of such property at the time of the distribution. Such general rule has no application to a liquidation to which section 332 or section 333 applies. See section 334 (b) and (c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transferor's basis. Unless section 334(b)(2) and subsection (c) of this section apply, property received by a parent corporation in a complete liquidation to which section 332 is applicable shall, under section 334(b)(1), have the same basis in the hands of the parent as its adjusted basis in the hands of the subsidiary. The rule stated above is applicable even though the subsidiary was indebted to the parent on the date the plan of liquidation was adopted and part of such property was received in

satisfaction of such indebtedness in a transfer to which section 332(c) is applicable. See Sec. 1.460-4(k)(3)(iv)(B)(2) for rules relating to adjustments to the basis of certain contracts accounted for using a long-term contract method of accounting that are acquired in certain liquidations described in section 332.
