                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of shortage. The determination of whether an  unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits exists must be made by  comparing the spirits recorded as being on hand to either the results of  the physical inventory required by Sec. 19.372 or the results of any  other complete physical inventory taken by the proprietor. When the  recorded quantity is greater than the quantity determined by physical  inventory, the difference is an unexplained shortage. The proprietor  must adjust its records to reflect the results of the physical  inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment of tax on shortage. A proprietor must pay the tax on any  unexplained shortage of bottled distilled spirits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Immediately on a prepayment return on form TTB F 5000.24, Excise  Tax Return; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On a deferred payment return on TTB F 5000.24 for the period  during which the shortage was determined.
