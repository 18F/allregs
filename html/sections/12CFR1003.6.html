Use Code 3 if the  applicant turns down the counteroffer or does not respond.</p><p class="depth0">c. Use Code 2 when the application is approved but the applicant (or  the loan broker or correspondent) fails to respond to your notification  of approval or your commitment letter within the specified time. Do not  use this Code for a preapproval request.</p><p class="depth0">d. Use Code 4 only when the application is expressly withdrawn by  the applicant before a credit decision is made. Do not use Code 4 if a  request for preapproval is withdrawn; preapproval requests that are  withdrawn are not reported under HMDA.</p><p class="depth0">e. Use Code 5 if you sent a written notice of incompleteness under  Sec. 1002.9(c)(2) of Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity) and the  applicant did not respond to your request for additional information  within the period of time specified in your notice. Do not use this Code  for requests for preapproval that are incomplete; these preapproval  requests are not reported under HMDA.</p><p class="depth0">2. Date of Action.

Property Location</p><p class="depth0">Except as otherwise provided, enter in these columns the applicable  Codes for the MSA, or the MD if the MSA is divided into MDs, state,  county, and census tract to indicate the location of the property to  which a loan relates.</p><p class="depth0">1. MSA or Metropolitan Division.--For each loan or loan application,  enter the MSA, or the MD number if the MSA is divided into MDs. MSA and  MD boundaries are defined by OMB; use the boundaries that were in effect  on January 1 of the calendar year for which you are reporting. A listing  of MSAs and MDs is available from the appropriate Federal agency to  which you report data or the FFIEC.</p><p class="depth0">2. State and County. Use the Federal Information Processing Standard  (FIPS) two-digit numerical code for the state and the three-digit  numerical code for the county. These codes are available from the  appropriate Federal agency to which you report data or the FFIEC.</p><p class="depth0">3. Census Tract.--Indicate the census tract where the property is  located.

Under option one, the institution may enter the MSA or MD,  state and county codes and the census tract number; and if the property  is not located in any MSA or MD, the institution may enter ``NA'' in the  MSA or MD column. (Codes exist for all states and counties and numbers  exist for all census tracts.) Under this first option, the codes and  census tract number must accurately identify the property location.  Under the second option, which is not available if paragraph 6 applies,  an institution   may enter ``NA'' in all four columns, whether or not the codes or  numbers exist for the property location.</p><p class="depth0">6. Data Reporting for Banks and Savings Associations Required To  Report Data on Small Business, Small Farm, and Community Development  Lending Under the CRA Regulations.--If your institution is a bank or  savings association that is required to report data under the  regulations that implement the CRA, you must enter the property location  on your HMDA/LAR even if the property is outside the MSAs or MDs in  which you have a home or branch office, or is not located in any MSA.</p><p class="depth0">7. Requests for Preapproval. Notwithstanding paragraphs 1 through 6,  if the application is a request for preapproval that is denied or that  is approved but not accepted by the applicant, you may enter ``NA'' in  all four columns.</p><p class="depth0">D. Applicant Information--Ethnicity, Race, Sex, and Income</p><p class="depth0">Appendix B contains instructions for the collection of data on  ethnicity, race, and sex, and also contains a sample form for data  collection.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicability. Report this information for loans that you  originate as well as for applications that do not result in an  origination.</p><p class="depth0">a.

Mail, Internet, or Telephone Applications.--All loan  applications, including applications taken by mail, internet, or  telephone must use a collection form similar to that shown in appendix B  regarding ethnicity, race, and sex. For applications taken by telephone,  the information in the collection form must be stated orally by the  lender, except for information that pertains uniquely to applications  taken in writing. If the applicant does not provide these data in an  application taken by mail or telephone or on the internet, enter the  Code for ``information not provided by applicant in mail, internet, or  telephone application'' specified in paragraphs I.D.3., 4., and 5. of  this appendix.

If there is more than one co-applicant, provide the required  information only for the first co-applicant listed on the application  form. If there are no co-applicants or co-borrowers, use Code 5 (for  ethnicity) and Code 8 (for race) for ``no co-applicant'' in the co- applicant column.</p><p class="depth0">5. Sex of Borrower or Applicant. Use the following Codes to indicate  the sex of the applicant or borrower under column ``A'' and of any co- applicant or co-borrower under column ``CA.''

If your institution uses the model form for adverse action  contained in appendix C to Regulation B (Form C-1, Sample Notification  Form), use the foregoing Codes as follows:</p><p class="depth0">a. Code 1 for: Income insufficient for amount of credit requested,  and Excessive obligations in relation to income.</p><p class="depth0">b. Code 2 for: Temporary or irregular employment, and Length of  employment.</p><p class="depth0">c.

Code 7 for: Credit application incomplete.</p><p class="depth0">g. Code 9 for: Length of residence; Temporary residence; and Other  reasons specified on notice.</p><p class="depth0">G. Pricing-Related Data</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate Spread. a. For a home-purchase loan, a refinancing, or a  dwelling-secured home improvement loan that you originated, report the  spread between the annual percentage rate (APR) and the average prime  offer rate for a comparable transaction if the spread is equal to or  greater than 1.5 percentage points for first-lien loans or 3.5  percentage points for subordinate-lien loans. To determine whether the  rate spread meets this threshold, use the average prime offer rate in  effect for the type of transaction as of the date the interest rate was  set, and use the APR for the loan, as calculated and disclosed to the  consumer under Sec. Sec. 1026.6 or 1026.18, as applicable, of Regulation  Z (12 CFR part 1026). Current and historic average prime offer rates are  set forth in the tables published on the FFIEC's Web site (http:// www.ffiec.gov/hmda) entitled ``Average Prime Offer Rates-Fixed'' and  ``Average Prime Offer Rates-Adjustable.'' Use the most recently  available average prime offer rate. ``Most recently available'' means  the average prime offer rate set forth in the applicable table with the  most recent effective date as of the date the interest rate was set. Do  not use an average prime offer rate before its effective date.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the loan is not subject to Regulation Z, or is a home  improvement loan that is not dwelling-secured, or is a loan that you  purchased, enter ``NA.''</p><p class="depth0">c. Enter ``NA'' in the case of an application that does not result  in a loan origination.</p><p class="depth0">d. Enter the rate spread to two decimal places, and use a leading  zero. For example, enter 03.29. If the difference between the APR and  the average prime offer rate is a figure with more than two decimal  places, round the figure or truncate the digits beyond two decimal  places.</p><p class="depth0">e. If the difference between the APR and the average prime offer  rate is less than 1.5 percentage points for a first-lien loan and less  than 3.5 percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, enter ``NA.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Date the interest rate was set. The relevant date to use to  determine the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction is  the date on which the loan's interest rate was set by the financial  institution for the final time before closing. If an interest rate is  set pursuant to a ``lock-in'' agreement between the lender and the  borrower, then the date on which the agreement fixes the interest rate  is the date the rate was set. If a rate is re-set after a lock-in  agreement is executed (for example, because the borrower exercises a  float-down option or the agreement expires), then the relevant date is  the date the rate is re-set for the final time before closing. If no  lock-in agreement is executed, then the relevant date is the date on  which the institution sets the rate for the final time before closing.</p><p class="depth0">3. HOEPA Status. a. For a loan that you originated or purchased that  is subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994  (HOEPA), as implemented in Regulation Z (12 CFR 1026.32), because the  APR or the points and fees on the loan exceed the HOEPA triggers, enter  Code 1.</p><p class="depth0">b. Enter Code 2 in all other cases. For example, enter Code 2 for a  loan that you originated or purchased that is not subject to the  requirements of HOEPA for any reason; also enter Code 2 in the case of  an application that does not result in a loan origination.</p><p class="depth0">H. Lien Status</p><p class="depth0">Use the following Codes for loans that you originate and for  applications that do not result in an origination:  Code 1--Secured by a first lien. Code 2--Secured by a subordinate lien. Code 3--Not secured by a lien. Code 4--Not applicable (purchased loan).</p><p class="depth0">a. Use Codes 1 through 3 for loans that you originate, as well as  for applications that do not result in an origination (applications that  are approved but not accepted, denied, withdrawn, or closed for  incompleteness).</p><p class="depth0">b. Use Code 4 for loans that you purchase.</p><p class="depth0">II. Appropriate Federal Agencies for HMDA Reporting</p><p class="depth0">A. You are strongly encouraged to submit your loan/application  register via email. If you elect to use this method of transmission and  the appropriate Federal agency for your institution is the Bureau of  Consumer Financial Protection, the Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the National  Credit Union Administration, then you should submit your institution's  files to the email address dedicated to that purpose by the Bureau,  which can be found on the Web site of the FFIEC. If one of the foregoing  agencies is the appropriate Federal agency for your institution and you  elect to submit your data by regular mail, then use the following  address: HMDA, Federal Reserve Board, Attention: HMDA Processing,  (insert name of the appropriate Federal agency for your institution),  20th & Constitution Ave NW., MS N502, Washington, DC 20551-0001.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the Federal Reserve System (but not the Bureau of Consumer  Financial Protection) is the appropriate Federal agency for your  institution, you should use the email or regular mail address of your  district bank indicated on the Web site of the FFIEC. If the Department  of Housing and Urban Development is the appropriate Federal agency for  your institution, then you should use the email or regular mail address  indicated on the Web site of the FFIEC.

Appendix B to Part 1003--Form and Instructions for Data Collection</p><p class="depth0">on Ethnicity, Race, and Sex</p><p class="depth0">I. Instructions on Collection of Data on Ethnicity, Race, and Sex</p><p class="depth0">You may list questions regarding the ethnicity, race, and sex of the  applicant on your loan application form, or on a separate form that  refers to the application. (See the sample form below for model  language.)</p><p class="depth0">II. Procedures</p><p class="depth0">A. You must ask the applicant for this information (but you cannot  require the applicant to provide it) whether the application is taken in  person, by mail or telephone, or on the internet. For applications taken  by telephone, the information in the collection form must be stated  orally by the lender, except for that information which pertains  uniquely to applications taken in writing.</p><p class="depth0">B. Inform the applicant that the Federal government requests this  information in order to monitor compliance with Federal statutes that  prohibit lenders from discriminating against applicants on these bases.  Inform the applicant that if the information is not provided where the  application is taken in person, you are required to note the data on the  basis of visual observation or surname.</p><p class="depth0">C. You must offer the applicant the option of selecting one or more  racial designations.</p><p class="depth0">D. If the applicant chooses not to provide the information for an  application taken in person, note this fact on the form and then note  the applicant's ethnicity, race, and sex on the basis of visual  observation and surname, to the extent possible.</p><p class="depth0">E. If the applicant declines to answer these questions or fails to  provide the information on an application taken by mail or telephone or  on the internet, the data need not be provided. In such a case, indicate  that the application was received by mail, telephone, or Internet, if it  is not otherwise evident on the face of the application.

Supplement I to Part 1003--Staff Commentary</p><p class="depth0">Introduction</p><p class="depth0">1. Status. The commentary in this supplement is the vehicle by which  the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection issues formal staff  interpretations of Regulation C (12 CFR part 1003).</p><p class="depth0">Section 1003.1--Authority, Purpose, and Scope</p><p class="depth0">1(c) Scope.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. The comments in this section address issues affecting  coverage of institutions and exemptions from coverage.</p><p class="depth0">2. The broker rule and the meaning of ``broker'' and ``investor.''  For the purposes of the guidance given in this commentary, an  institution that takes and processes a loan   application and arranges for another institution to acquire the loan at  or after closing is acting as a ``broker,'' and an institution that  acquires a loan from a broker at or after closing is acting as an  ``investor.'' (The terms used in this commentary may have different  meanings in certain parts of the mortgage lending industry, and other  terms may be used in place of these terms, for example in the Federal  Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs.) Depending on the  facts, a broker may or may not make a credit decision on an application  (and thus it may or may not have reporting responsibilities). If the  broker makes a credit decision, it reports that decision; if it does not  make a credit decision, it does not report. If an investor reviews an  application and makes a credit decision prior to closing, the investor  reports that decision. If the investor does not review the application  prior to closing, it reports only the loans that it purchases; it does  not report the loans it does not purchase. An institution that makes a  credit decision on an application prior to closing reports that decision  regardless of whose name the loan closes in.</p><p class="depth0">3. Illustrations of the broker rule. Assume that, prior to closing,  four investors receive the same application from a broker; two deny it,  one approves it, and one approves it and acquires the loan. In these  circumstances, the first two report denials, the third reports the  transaction as approved but not accepted, and the fourth reports an  origination (whether the loan closes in the name of the broker or the  investor). Alternatively, assume that the broker denies a loan before  sending it to an investor; in this situation, the broker reports a  denial.</p><p class="depth0">4. Broker's use of investor's underwriting criteria. If a broker  makes a credit decision based on underwriting criteria set by an  investor, but without the investor's review prior to closing, the broker  has made the credit decision. The broker reports as an origination a  loan that it approves and closes, and reports as a denial an application  that it turns down (either because the application does not meet the  investor's underwriting guidelines or for some other reason). The  investor reports as purchases only those loans it purchases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Insurance and other criteria. If an institution evaluates an  application based on the criteria or actions of a third party other than  an investor (such as a government or private insurer or guarantor), the  institution must report the action taken on the application (loan  originated, approved but not accepted, or denied, for example).</p><p class="depth0">6. Credit decision of agent is decision of principal. If an  institution approves loans through the actions of an agent, the  institution must report the action taken on the application (loan  originated, approved but not accepted, or denied, for example). State  law determines whether one party is the agent of another.</p><p class="depth0">7. Affiliate bank underwriting (250.250 review). If an institution  makes an independent evaluation of the creditworthiness of an applicant  (for example, as part of a preclosing review by an affiliate bank under  12 CFR 250.250, a regulation of the Board of Governors of the Federal  Reserve System that interprets section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act),  the institution is making a credit decision. If the institution then  acquires the loan, it reports the loan as an origination whether the  loan closes in the name of the institution or its affiliate. An  institution that does not acquire the loan but takes some other action  reports that action.</p><p class="depth0">8. Participation loan. An institution that originates a loan and  then sells partial interests to other institutions reports the loan as  an origination. An institution that acquires only a partial interest in  such a loan does not report the transaction even if it has participated  in the underwriting and origination of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">9. Assumptions. An assumption occurs when an institution enters into  a written agreement accepting a new borrower as the obligor on an  existing obligation. An institution reports an assumption (or an  application for an assumption) as a home purchase loan in the amount of  the outstanding principal. If a transaction does not involve a written  agreement between a new borrower and the institution, it is not an  assumption for HMDA purposes and is not reported.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1003.2--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">Application.</p><p class="depth0">1. Consistency With Regulation B. Bureau interpretations that appear  in the official staff commentary to Regulation B (Equal Credit  Opportunity, 12 CFR part 1002, Supplement I) are generally applicable to  the definition of an application under Regulation C. However, under  Regulation C the definition of an application does not include  prequalification requests.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prequalification. A prequalification request is a request by a  prospective loan applicant (other than a request for preapproval) for a  preliminary determination on whether the prospective applicant would  likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a  determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective  applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate  prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the  institution's normal loan application process; others use the same  process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to  report prequalification requests on the HMDA/LAR, even though these  requests may constitute applications under Regulation B for purposes of  adverse action notices.</p><p class="depth0">3. Requests for preapproval. To be a covered preapproval program,  the written commitment issued under the program must result from a full  review of the creditworthiness of the applicant, including such  verification of income, resources and other matters as is typically done  by the institution as part of its normal credit evaluation program. In  addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable  property and verification that no material change has occurred in the  applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written  commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the  financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the  lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage application  approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring  an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear  termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use  the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a  new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale  of the present home.</p><p class="depth0">Branch office.</p><p class="depth0">1. Credit union. For purposes of Regulation C, a ``branch'' of a  credit union is any office where member accounts are established or  loans are made, whether or not the office has been approved as a branch  by a Federal or state agency. (See 12 U.S.C. 1752.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Depository institution. A branch of a depository institution does  not include a loan-production office, the office of an affiliate, or the  office of a third party such as a loan broker. (But see appendix A,  paragraph I.C.6, which requires certain depository institutions to  report property location even for properties located outside those MSAs  or Metropolitan Divisions in which the institution has a home or branch  office.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Nondepository institution. For a nondepository institution,  ``branch office'' does not include the office of an affiliate or other  third party such as a loan broker. (But note that certain nondepository  institutions must report property location even in MSAs or Metropolitan  Divisions where they do not have a physical location.)</p><p class="depth0">Dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">1. Coverage. The definition of ``dwelling'' is not limited to the  principal or other residence of the applicant or borrower, and thus  includes vacation or second homes and rental properties. A dwelling also  includes a multifamily structure such as an apartment building.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. Recreational vehicles such as boats or campers are  not dwellings for purposes of HMDA. Also excluded are transitory  residences such as hotels, hospitals, and college dormitories, whose  occupants have principal residences elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">Financial institution.</p><p class="depth0">1. General. An institution that met the test for coverage under HMDA  in year 1, and then ceases to meet the test (for example, because its  assets fall below the threshold on December 31 of year 2) stops  collecting HMDA data beginning with year 3. Similarly, an institution  that did not meet the coverage test for a given year, and then meets the  test in the succeeding year, begins collecting HMDA data in the calendar  year following the year in which it meets the test for coverage. For  example, a for-profit mortgage lending institution (other than a bank,  savings association, or credit union) that, in year 1, falls below the  thresholds specified in the definition of Financial institution in  Sec. 1003.2, but meets one of them in year 2, need not collect data in  year 2, but begins collecting data in year 3.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustment of exemption threshold for banks, savings  associations, and credit unions. For data collection in 2015, the asset- size exemption threshold is $44 million. Banks, savings associations,  and credit unions with assets at or below $44 million as of December 31,  2014, are exempt from collecting data for 2015.</p><p class="depth0">3. Coverage after a merger. Several scenarios of data-collection  responsibilities for the calendar year of a merger are described below.  Under all the scenarios, if the merger results in a covered institution,  that institution must begin data collection January 1 of the following  calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">i. Two institutions are not covered by Regulation C because of asset  size. The institutions merge. No data collection is required for the  year of the merger (even if the merger results in a covered  institution).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A covered institution and an exempt institution merge. The  covered institution is the surviving institution. For the year of the  merger, data collection is required for the covered institution's  transactions. Data collection is optional for transactions handled in  offices of the previously exempt institution.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A covered institution and an exempt institution merge. The  exempt institution is the surviving institution, or a new institution is  formed. Data collection is required for transactions of the covered  institution that take place prior to the merger. Data collection is  optional for transactions taking place after the merger date.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Two covered institutions merge. Data collection is required for  the entire year. The surviving or resulting institution files either a  consolidated submission or separate submissions for that year.</p><p class="depth0">4. Originations. HMDA coverage depends in part on whether an  institution has originated home purchase loans. To determine whether  activities with respect to a particular loan constitute an origination,  institutions should consult, among other parts of   the staff commentary, the discussion of the broker rule under  Sec. Sec. 1003.1(c) and 1003.4(a).</p><p class="depth0">5. Branches of foreign banks--treated as banks. A Federal branch or  a state-licensed insured branch of a foreign bank is a ``bank'' under  section 3(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.  1813(a)), and is covered by HMDA if it meets the tests for a depository  institution found in Sec. 1003.2 of Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">6. Branches and offices of foreign banks--treated as for-profit  mortgage lending institutions. Federal agencies, state-licensed  agencies, state-licensed uninsured branches of foreign banks, commercial  lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and entities  operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C.  601 and 611 (Edge Act and agreement corporations) are not ``banks''  under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. These entities are nonetheless  covered by HMDA if they meet the tests for a for-profit nondepository  mortgage lending institution found in Sec. 1003.2 of Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">Home improvement loan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Classification requirement for loans not secured by a lien on a  dwelling. An institution has ``classified'' a loan that is not secured  by a lien on a dwelling as a home improvement loan if it has entered the  loan on its books as a home improvement loan, or has otherwise coded or  identified the loan as a home improvement loan. For example, an  institution that has booked a loan or reported it on a ``call report''  as a home improvement loan has classified it as a home improvement loan.  An institution may also classify loans as home improvement loans in  other ways (for example, by color-coding loan files).</p><p class="depth0">2. Improvements to real property. Home improvements include  improvements both to a dwelling and to the real property on which the  dwelling is located (for example, installation of a swimming pool,  construction of a garage, or landscaping).</p><p class="depth0">3. Commercial and other loans. A home improvement loan may include a  loan originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending  division (such as a loan to improve an apartment building made through  the commercial loan department).</p><p class="depth0">4. Mixed-use property. A loan to improve property used for  residential and commercial purposes (for example, a building containing  apartment units and retail space) is a home improvement loan if the loan  proceeds are used primarily to improve the residential portion of the  property. If the loan proceeds are used to improve the entire property  (for example, to replace the heating system), the loan is a home  improvement loan if the property itself is primarily residential. An  institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use  of the property, such as by square footage or by the income generated.  An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.  If the loan is unsecured, to report the loan as a home improvement loan  the institution must also have classified it as such.</p><p class="depth0">5. Multiple-category loans. If a loan is a home improvement loan as  well as a refinancing, an institution reports the loan as a home  improvement loan.</p><p class="depth0">Home purchase loan.</p><p class="depth0">1. Multiple properties. A home purchase loan includes a loan secured  by one dwelling and used to purchase another dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mixed-use property. A dwelling-secured loan to purchase property  used primarily for residential purposes (for example, an apartment  building containing a convenience store) is a home purchase loan. An  institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use  of the property, such as by square footage or by the income generated.  An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">3. Farm loan. A loan to purchase property used primarily for  agricultural purposes is not a home purchase loan even if the property  includes a dwelling. An institution may use any reasonable standard to  determine the primary use of the property, such as by reference to the  exemption from Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures, 12 CFR  1024.5(b)(1)) for a loan on property of 25 acres or more. An institution  may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">4. Commercial and other loans. A home purchase loan may include a  loan originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending  division (such as a loan for the purchase of an apartment building made  through the commercial loan department).</p><p class="depth0">5. Construction and permanent financing. A home purchase loan  includes both a combined construction/permanent loan and the permanent  financing that replaces a construction-only loan. It does not include a  construction-only loan, which is considered ``temporary financing''  under Regulation C and is not reported.</p><p class="depth0">6. Second mortgages that finance the downpayments on first  mortgages. If an institution making a first mortgage loan to a home  purchaser also makes a second mortgage loan to the same purchaser to  finance part or all of the home purchaser's downpayment, the institution  reports each loan separately as a home purchase loan.</p><p class="depth0">7. Multiple-category loans. If a loan is a home purchase loan as  well as a home improvement loan, or a refinancing, an institution  reports the loan as a home purchase loan.</p><p class="depth0">Manufactured home.</p><p class="depth0">1. Definition of a manufactured home. The definition in Sec. 1003.2  refers to the Federal building code for factory-built housing  established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  The HUD code   requires generally that housing be essentially ready for occupancy upon  leaving the factory and being transported to a building site. Modular  homes that meet all of the HUD code standards are included in the  definition because they are ready for occupancy upon leaving the  factory. Other factory-built homes, such as panelized and pre-cut homes,  generally do not meet the HUD code because they require a significant  amount of construction on site before they are ready for occupancy.  Loans and applications relating to manufactured homes that do not meet  the HUD code should not be identified as manufactured housing under  HMDA.</p><p class="depth0">Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Metropolitan Divisions.</p><p class="depth0">1. Use of terms ``Metropolitan Statistical Area'' and ``Metropolitan  Division.'' The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines  Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Metropolitan Divisions to provide  nationally consistent definitions for collecting, tabulating, and  publishing Federal statistics for a set of geographic areas. OMB divides  every Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of 2.5  million or more into Metropolitan Divisions (MDs); MSAs with populations  under 2.5 million population are not so divided. 67 FR 82228 (December  27, 2000). For all purposes under Regulation C, if an MSA is divided by  OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic unit to be used is the MD; if  an MSA is not so divided by OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic  unit to be used is the MSA.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1003.4--Compilation of Loan Data</p><p class="depth0">4(a) Data format and itemization.</p><p class="depth0">1. Reporting requirements. i. An institution reports data on loans  that it originated and loans that it purchased during the calendar year  described in the report. An institution reports these data even if the  loans were subsequently sold by the institution.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An institution reports the data for loan applications that did  not result in originations--for example, applications that the  institution denied or that the applicant withdrew during the calendar  year covered by the report.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In the case of brokered loan applications or applications  forwarded through a correspondent, the institution reports as  originations the loans that it approved and subsequently acquired per a  pre-closing arrangement (whether or not they closed in the institution's  name). Additionally, the institution reports the data for all  applications that did not result in originations--for example,  applications that the institution denied or that the applicant withdrew  during the calendar year covered by the report (whether or not they  would have closed in the institution's name). For all of these loans and  applications, the institution reports the required data regarding the  borrower's or applicant's ethnicity, race, sex, and income.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Loan originations are to be reported only once. If the  institution is the loan broker or correspondent, it does not report as  originations the loans that it forwarded to another lender for approval  prior to closing, and that were approved and subsequently acquired by  that lender (whether or not they closed in the institution's name).</p><p class="depth0">v. An institution reports applications that were received in the  previous calendar year but were acted upon during the calendar year  covered by the current register.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A financial institution submits all required data to the  appropriate Federal agency in one package, with the prescribed  transmittal sheet. An officer of the institution certifies to the  accuracy of the data.</p><p class="depth0">vii. The transmittal sheet states the total number of line entries  contained in the accompanying data transmission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Updating--agency requirements. Certain state or Federal  regulations, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's  regulations, may require an institution to update its data more  frequently than is required under Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of quarterly updating. An institution may maintain the  quarterly updates of the HMDA/LAR in electronic or any other format,  provided the institution can make the information available to its  regulatory agency in a timely manner upon request.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0">1. Application date--consistency. In reporting the date of  application, an institution reports the date the application was  received or the date shown on the application. Although an institution  need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it  should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach  within a particular division of the institution or for a category of  loans).</p><p class="depth0">2. Application date--application forwarded by a broker. For an  application forwarded by a broker, an institution reports the date the  application was received by the broker, the date the application was  received by the institution, or the date shown on the application.  Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire  HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely  using one approach within a particular division of the institution or  for a category of loans).</p><p class="depth0">3. Application date--reinstated application. If, within the same  calendar year, an applicant asks an institution to reinstate a  counteroffer that the applicant previously did not accept (or asks the  institution to reconsider an application that was denied, withdrawn, or  closed for incompleteness), the institution may treat that request as  the continuation of the earlier transaction or as a new transaction. If  the institution treats   the request for reinstatement or reconsideration as a new transaction,  it reports the date of the request as the application date.</p><p class="depth0">4. Application or loan number. An institution must ensure that each  identifying number is unique within the institution. If an institution's  register contains data for branch offices, for example, the institution  could use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans or  applications of different branches, or could assign a certain series of  numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. Institutions  are strongly encouraged not to use the applicant's or borrower's name or  social security number, for privacy reasons.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application--year action taken. An institution must report an  application in the calendar year in which the institution takes final  action on the application.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. Purpose--statement of applicant. An institution may rely on the  oral or written statement of an applicant regarding the proposed use of  loan proceeds. For example, a lender could use a check-box, or a purpose  line, on a loan application to determine whether or not the applicant  intends to use loan proceeds for home improvement purposes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Purpose--multiple-purpose loan. If a loan is a home purchase loan  as well as a home improvement loan, or a refinancing, an institution  reports the loan as a home purchase loan. If a loan is a home  improvement loan as well as a refinancing, an institution reports the  loan as a home improvement loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(6).</p><p class="depth0">1. Occupancy--multiple properties. If a loan relates to multiple  properties, the institution reports the owner occupancy status of the  property for which property location is being reported. (See the  comments to paragraph 4(a)(9)).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(7).</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan amount--counteroffer. If an applicant accepts a counteroffer  for an amount different from the amount initially requested, the  institution reports the loan amount granted. If an applicant does not  accept a counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the  loan amount initially requested.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan amount--multiple-purpose loan. Except in the case of a home- equity line of credit, an institution reports the entire amount of the  loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is intended for home purchase  or home improvement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Loan amount--home-equity line. An institution that has chosen to  report home-equity lines of credit reports only the part that is  intended for home-improvement or home-purchase purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Loan amount--assumption. An institution that enters into a  written agreement accepting a new party as the obligor on a loan reports  the amount of the outstanding principal on the assumption as the loan  amount.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(8).</p><p class="depth0">1. Action taken--counteroffers. If an institution makes a  counteroffer to lend on terms different from the applicant's initial  request (for example, for a shorter loan maturity or in a different  amount) and the applicant does not accept the counteroffer or fails to  respond, the institution reports the action taken as a denial on the  original terms requested by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">2. Action taken--rescinded transactions. If a borrower rescinds a  transaction after closing, the institution may report the transaction  either as an origination or as an application that was approved but not  accepted.</p><p class="depth0">3. Action taken--purchased loans. An institution reports the loans  that it purchased during the calendar year, and does not report the  loans that it declined to purchase.</p><p class="depth0">4. Action taken--conditional approvals. If an institution issues a  loan approval subject to the applicant's meeting underwriting conditions  (other than customary loan commitment or loan-closing conditions, such  as a clear-title requirement or an acceptable property survey) and the  applicant does not meet them, the institution reports the action taken  as a denial.</p><p class="depth0">5. Action taken date--approved but not accepted. For a loan approved  by an institution but not accepted by the applicant, the institution  reports any reasonable date, such as the approval date, the deadline for  accepting the offer, or the date the file was closed. Although an  institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA  submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely  using one approach within a particular division of the institution or  for a category of loans).</p><p class="depth0">6. Action taken date--originations. For loan originations, an  institution generally reports the settlement or closing date. For loan  originations that an institution acquires through a broker, the  institution reports either the settlement or closing date, or the date  the institution acquired the loan from the broker. If the disbursement  of funds takes place on a date later than the settlement or closing  date, the institution may use the date of disbursement. For a  construction/permanent loan, the institution reports either the  settlement or closing date, or the date the loan converts to the  permanent financing. Although an institution need not choose the same  approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally  consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular  division of the institution or for a category of loans). Notwithstanding  this flexibility regarding the use of the closing date in connection  with reporting the date action was taken, the year in which an  origination goes to closing is the   year in which the institution must report the origination.</p><p class="depth0">7. Action taken--pending applications. An institution does not  report any loan application still pending at the end of the calendar  year; it reports that application on its register for the year in which  final action is taken.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(9).</p><p class="depth0">1. Property location--multiple properties (home improvement/ refinance of home improvement). For a home improvement loan, an  institution reports the property being improved. If more than one  property is being improved, the institution reports the location of one  of the properties or reports the loan using multiple entries on its  HMDA/LAR (with unique identifiers) and allocating the loan amount among  the properties.</p><p class="depth0">2. Property location--multiple properties (home purchase/refinance  of home purchase). For a home purchase loan, an institution reports the  property taken as security. If an institution takes more than one  property as security, the institution reports the location of the  property being purchased if there is just one. If the loan is to  purchase multiple properties and is secured by multiple properties, the  institution reports the location of one of the properties or reports the  loan using multiple entries on its HMDA/LAR (with unique identifiers)  and allocating the loan amount among the properties.</p><p class="depth0">3. Property location--loans purchased from another institution. The  requirement to report the property location by census tract in an MSA or  Metropolitan Division where the institution has a home or branch office  applies not only to loan applications and originations but also to loans  purchased from another institution. This includes loans purchased from  an institution that did not have a home or branch office in that MSA or  Metropolitan Division and did not collect the property-location  information.</p><p class="depth0">4. Property location--mobile or manufactured home. If information  about the potential site of a mobile or manufactured home is not  available, an institution reports using the Code for ``not applicable.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(10).</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicant data--completion by applicant. An institution reports  the monitoring information as provided by the applicant. For example, if  an applicant checks the ``Asian'' box the institution reports using the  ``Asian'' Code.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicant data--completion by lender. If an applicant fails to  provide the requested information for an application taken in person,  the institution reports the data on the basis of visual observation or  surname.</p><p class="depth0">3. Applicant data--application completed in person. When an  applicant meets in person with a lender to complete an application that  was begun by mail, internet, or telephone, the institution must request  the monitoring information. If the meeting occurs after the application  process is complete, for example, at closing, the institution is not  required to obtain monitoring information.</p><p class="depth0">4. Applicant data--joint applicant. A joint applicant may enter the  government monitoring information on behalf of an absent joint  applicant. If the information is not provided, the institution reports  using the Code for ``information not provided by applicant in mail,  internet, or telephone application.''</p><p class="depth0">5. Applicant data--video and other electronic-application processes.  An institution that accepts applications through electronic media with a  video component treats the applications as taken in person and collects  the information about the ethnicity, race, and sex of applicants. An  institution that accepts applications through electronic media without a  video component (for example, the internet or facsimile) treats the  applications as accepted by mail.</p><p class="depth0">6. Income data--income relied on. An institution reports the gross  annual income relied on in evaluating the creditworthiness of  applicants. For example, if an institution relies on an applicant's  salary to compute a debt-to-income ratio but also relies on the  applicant's annual bonus to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution  reports the salary and the bonus to the extent relied upon. Similarly,  if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate  creditworthiness, the institution includes this income to the extent  relied upon. But an institution does not include the income of a  guarantor who is only secondarily liable.</p><p class="depth0">7. Income data--co-applicant. If two persons jointly apply for a  loan and both list income on the application, but the institution relies  only on the income of one applicant in computing ratios and in  evaluating creditworthiness, the institution reports only the income  relied on.</p><p class="depth0">8. Income data--loan to employee. An institution may report ``NA''  in the income field for loans to its employees to protect their privacy,  even though the institution relied on their income in making its credit  decisions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(11).</p><p class="depth0">1. Type of purchaser--loan-participation interests sold to more than  one entity. An institution that originates a loan, and then sells it to  more than one entity, reports the ``type of purchaser'' based on the  entity purchasing the greatest interest, if any. If an institution  retains a majority interest, it does not report the sale.</p><p class="depth0">2. Type of purchaser--swapped loans. Loans ``swapped'' for mortgage- backed securities are to be treated as sales; the purchaser is the type  of entity receiving the loans that are swapped.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(12)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. Average prime offer rates are annual  percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and   other loan pricing terms offered to borrowers by a representative sample  of lenders for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing  characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices,  margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions.  Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and  transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner- occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime  offer rates, the Bureau uses a survey of lenders that both meets the  criteria of Sec. 1003.4(a)(12)(ii) and provides pricing terms for at  least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of  non-variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the  Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey[supreg].</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparable transaction. The rate spread reporting requirement  applies to a reportable loan with an annual percentage rate that exceeds  by the specified margin (or more) the average prime offer rate for a  comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set. The  tables of average prime offer rates published by the Bureau (see comment  4(a)(12)(ii)-3) indicate how to identify the comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Bureau tables. The Bureau publishes on the FFIEC's Web site  (http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda), in table form, average prime offer rates  for a wide variety of transaction types. The Bureau calculates an annual  percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (see 12 CFR 1026.22 and  part 1026, appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing  terms are available from the survey described in comment 4(a)(12)(ii)-1.  The Bureau estimates annual percentage rates for other types of  transactions for which direct survey data are not available based on the  loan pricing terms available in the survey and other information. The  Bureau publishes on the FFIEC's Web site the methodology it uses to  arrive at these estimates.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(14).</p><p class="depth0">1. Determining lien status for applications and loans originated. i.  Lenders are required to report lien status for loans they originate and  applications that do not result in originations. Lien status is  determined by reference to the best information readily available to the  lender at the time final action is taken and to the lender's own  procedures. Thus, lenders may rely on the title search they routinely  perform as part of their underwriting procedures--for example, for home  purchase loans. Regulation C does not require lenders to perform title  searches solely to comply with HMDA reporting requirements. Lenders may  rely on other information that is readily available to them at the time  final action is taken and that they reasonably believe is accurate, such  as the applicant's statement on the application or the applicant's  credit report. For example, where the applicant indicates on the  application that there is a mortgage on the property or where the  applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage--and  that mortgage is not going to be paid off as part of the transaction-- the lender may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a  subordinate lien. If the same application did not result in an  origination--for example, because the application is denied or  withdrawn--the lender would report the application as an application for  a subordinate-lien loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Lenders may also consider their established procedures when  determining lien status for applications that do not result in  originations. For example, a consumer applies to a lender to refinance a  $100,000 first mortgage; the consumer also has a home equity line of  credit for $20,000. If the lender's practice in such a case is to ensure  that it will have first-lien position--through a subordination agreement  with the holder of the mortgage on the home equity line--then the lender  should report the application as an application for a first-lien loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0">1. An institution that opts to report home-equity lines reports the  disposition of all applications, not just originations.</p><p class="depth0">4(d) Excluded data.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mergers, purchases in bulk, and branch acquisitions. If a covered  institution acquires loans in bulk from another institution (for  example, from the receiver for a failed institution) but no merger or  acquisition of the institution, or acquisition of a branch, is involved,  the institution reports the loans as purchased loans.</p><p class="depth0">Section 1003.5(a)--Disclosure and Reporting</p><p class="depth0">5(a) Reporting to agency.</p><p class="depth0">1. Submission of data. Institutions submit data to the appropriate  Federal agencies in an automated, machine-readable form. The format must  conform to that of the HMDA/LAR. An institution should contact the  appropriate Federal agency for information regarding procedures and  technical specifications for automated data submission; in some cases,  agencies also make software available for automated data submission. The  data are edited before submission, using the edits included in the  agency-supplied software or equivalent edits in software available from  vendors or developed in-house.</p><p class="depth0">2. Submission in paper form. Institutions that report twenty-five or  fewer entries on their HMDA/LAR may collect and report the data in paper  form. An institution that submits its register in non-automated form  sends two copies that are typed or computer printed and must use the  format of the HMDA/LAR (but need not use the form itself). Each page  must be numbered along   with the total number of pages (for example, ``Page 1 of 3'').</p><p class="depth0">3. Procedures for entering data. The required data are entered in  the register for each loan origination, each application acted on, and  each loan purchased during the calendar year. The institution should  decide on the procedure it wants to follow--for example, whether to  begin entering the required data, when an application is received, or to  wait until final action is taken (such as when a loan goes to closing or  an application is denied).</p><p class="depth0">4. Options for collection. An institution may collect data on  separate registers at different branches, or on separate registers for  different loan types (such as for home purchase or home improvement  loans, or for loans on multifamily dwellings). Entries need not be  grouped on the register by MSA or Metropolitan Division, or  chronologically, or by census tract numbers, or in any other particular  order.</p><p class="depth0">5. Change in appropriate Federal agency. If the appropriate Federal  agency for a covered institution changes (as a consequence of a merger  or a change in the institution's charter, for example), the institution  must report data to the new appropriate Federal agency beginning with  the year of the change.</p><p class="depth0">6. Subsidiaries. An institution is a subsidiary of a bank or savings  association (for purposes of reporting HMDA data to the same agency as  the parent) if the bank or savings association holds or controls an  ownership interest that is greater than 50 percent of the institution.</p><p class="depth0">7. Transmittal sheet--additional data submissions. If an additional  data submission becomes necessary (for example, because the institution  discovers that data were omitted from the initial submission, or because  revisions are called for), that submission must be accompanied by a  transmittal sheet.</p><p class="depth0">8. Transmittal sheet--revisions or deletions. If a data submission  involves revisions or deletions of previously submitted data, it must  state the total of all line entries contained in that submission,  including both those representing revisions or deletions of previously  submitted entries, and those that are being resubmitted unchanged or are  being submitted for the first time. Depository institutions must provide  a list of the MSAs or Metropolitan Divisions in which they have home or  branch offices.</p><p class="depth0">5(b) Public disclosure of statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Business day. For purposes of Sec. 1003.5, a business day is any  calendar day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. An institution may make the disclosure statement  available in paper form or, if the person requesting the data agrees, in  electronic form.</p><p class="depth0">5(c) Public disclosure of modified loan/application register.</p><p class="depth0">1. Format. An institution may make the modified register available  in paper or electronic form. Although institutions are not required to  make the modified register available in census tract order, they are  strongly encouraged to do so in order to enhance its utility to users.</p><p class="depth0">5(e) Notice of availability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Poster--suggested text. An institution may use any text that  meets the requirements of the regulation. Some of the Federal agencies  that receive HMDA data provide HMDA posters that an institution can use  to inform the public of the availability of its HMDA data, or the  institution may create its own posters. If an institution prints its  own, the following language is suggested but is not required:</p><p class="depth0">Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Notice</p><p class="depth0">The HMDA data about our residential mortgage lending are available  for review. The data show geographic distribution of loans and  applications; ethnicity, race, sex, and income of applicants and  borrowers; and information about loan approvals and denials. Inquire at  this office regarding the locations where HMDA data may be inspected.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional language for institutions making the disclosure  statement available on request. An institution that posts a notice  informing the public of the address to which a request should be sent  could include the following sentence, for example, in its general  notice: ``To receive a copy of these data send a written request to  [address].''</p><p class="depth0">Section 1003.6--Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">6(b) Bona fide errors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Bona fide error--information from third parties. An institution  that obtains the property-location information for applications and  loans from third parties (such as appraisers or vendors of ``geocoding''  services) is responsible for ensuring that the information reported on  its HMDA/LAR is correct.
