                            <p class="depth0">The Director will determine that a concessioner has operated  satisfactorily on an overall basis during the term of a concession  contract only if the concessioner (including a new concessioner  resulting from an assignment as described in this part, including,  without limit, an assignment of a controlling interest in a concessioner  as defined in this part) has or will have operated for more than two  years under a concession contract with a term of more than five years or  for one year under a concession contract with a term of five years or  less. For purposes of this section, a new concessioner's first day of  operation under an assigned concession contract (or as a new  concessioner after approval of an assignment of a controlling interest  in a concessioner) will be the day the Director approves the assignment  pursuant to this part. If the Director determines that an assignment was  compelled by circumstances beyond the control of the assigning  concessioner, the Director may make an exception to the requirements of  this section.</p>
