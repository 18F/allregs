When fruit or other perishable merchandise has been condemned by health officers or other legally constituted authorities within 10 days after landing, an importer who desires allowance in duties under section 506(2), Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1506(2)), shall within 5 days after such condemnation file with the port director written notice of the condemnation. The date of landing in the case of merchandise forwarded under an entry for immediate transportation is the date of arrival at the port of destination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allowance in duties. If the port director is satisfied after any necessary investigation that the claim is valid, allowance in duties shall be made in the liquidation of the entry. Such allowance shall be limited to perishable goods condemned by the health officers or authorities in the original package, unless segregation of the merchandise was under constant Customs supervision at the importer's expense.
