In that case, document its efforts to secure the parents'  participation, through records of phone calls, letters in the parents'  native language or visits to parents' homes or places of work, along  with any responses or results; and arrange an opportunity to meet with  the parents to review the results of the meeting and secure their input  and signature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Grantees must initiate the implementation of the IEP as soon as  possible after the IEP meeting by modifying the child's program in  accordance with the IEP and arranging for the provision of related  services.
