                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appeals of adverse determinations. If you are dissatisfied with  the response to your request, you may appeal an adverse determination  denying your request, in any respect, to the Chairman of the agency. You  must make your appeal in writing, by e-mail or letter, and it must be  received by the agency within 60 days of the date of the agency's  response denying your request. Your appeal should provide reasons and  supporting information as to why the initial determination was  incorrect. The appeal should clearly identify the particular  determination (including the assigned request number, if known) that you  are appealing. For the quickest possible handling of a mail request, you  should mark your appeal ``Freedom of Information Act Appeal.'' The  Chairman or his or her designee will act on the appeal, except that an  appeal ordinarily will not be acted on if the request becomes a matter  of FOIA litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responses to appeals. The decision on your appeal will be made  by e-mail or letter, ordinarily within 20 business days of receipt of  your appeal. A decision affirming an adverse determination in whole or  in part will contain a statement of the reason(s) for the affirmance,  including any FOIA exemption(s) applied, and will inform you of the FOIA  provisions for court review of the decision. (You also may be aware of  the mediation services that are offered by the Office of Government  Information Services (``OGIS'') of the National Archives and Records  Administration--see http://www.archives.gov/ogis/--as a non-exclusive  alternative to FOIA litigation.) If the adverse determination is  reversed or modified on appeal, in whole or in part, then you will be  notified in a written decision and your request will be reprocessed in  accordance with that appeal decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When appeal is required. As a general rule, if you wish to seek  review by a court of any adverse determination, you must first appeal it  in a timely fashion under this section.</p>
