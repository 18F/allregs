                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before work is performed in the fire, steam, or water spaces of  a boiler where employees may be subject to injury from the direct escape  of a high temperature medium such as steam, or water, oil, or other  medium at a high temperature entering from an interconnecting system,  the employer shall insure that the following steps are taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The isolation and shutoff valves connecting the dead boiler with  the live system or systems shall be secured, blanked, and then locked or  tagged, in accordance with Sec. 1915.89, indicating that employees are  working on the boiler. This lock or tag shall not be removed nor the  valves unblanked until it is determined that this may be done without  creating a hazard to the employees working on the boiler, or until the  work on the boiler is completed, in accordance with Sec. 1915.89. When  valves are welded instead of bolted, at least two isolation and shutoff  valves connecting the dead boiler with the live system or systems shall  be secured, and then locked or tagged, in accordance with Sec. 1915.89.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drain connections to atmosphere on all of the dead  interconnecting systems shall be opened for visual observation of  drainage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A warning sign calling attention to the fact that employees are  working in the boilers shall be hung in a conspicuous location in the  engine room. This sign shall not be removed until it is determined that  the work is completed and all employees are out of the boilers.  [47 FR 16986, Apr. 20, 1982, as amended at 76 FR 24711, May 2, 2011]</p>
