                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the CAA, in 40 CFR 63.2, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Additive means a material that is added to a coating after purchase from a supplier (e.g., catalysts, activators, accelerators).</p><p class="depth0">Add-on control means an air pollution control device, such as a thermal oxidizer or carbon adsorber, that reduces pollution in an air stream by destruction or removal before discharge to the atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Adhesive, adhesive coating means any chemical substance that is applied for the purpose of bonding two surfaces together. Products used on humans and animals, adhesive tape, contact paper, or any other product with an adhesive incorporated onto or in an inert substrate shall not be considered adhesives under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Assembled on-road vehicle coating means any coating operation in which coating is applied to the surface of some component or surface of a fully assembled motor vehicle or trailer intended for on-road use including, but not limited to, components or surfaces on automobiles and light-duty trucks that have been repaired after a collision or otherwise repainted, fleet delivery trucks, and motor homes and other recreational vehicles (including camping trailers and fifth wheels). Assembled on-road vehicle coating includes the concurrent coating of parts of the assembled on-road vehicle that are painted off-vehicle to protect systems, equipment, or to allow full coverage. Assembled on-road vehicle coating does not include surface coating operations that meet the applicability criteria of the automobiles and light-duty trucks NESHAP. Assembled on-road vehicle coating also does not include the use of adhesives, sealants, and caulks used in assembling on-road vehicles.</p><p class="depth0">Capture device means a hood, enclosure, room, floor sweep, or other means of containing or collecting emissions and directing those emissions into an add-on air pollution control device.</p><p class="depth0">Capture efficiency or capture system efficiency means the portion (expressed as a percentage) of the pollutants from an emission source that is delivered to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Capture system means one or more capture devices intended to collect emissions generated by a coating operation in the use of coatings or cleaning materials, both at the point of application and at subsequent points where emissions from the coatings and cleaning materials occur, such as flashoff, drying, or curing. As used in this subpart, multiple capture devices that collect emissions generated by a coating operation are considered a single capture system.</p><p class="depth0">Cleaning material means a solvent used to remove contaminants and other materials, such as dirt, grease, oil, and dried or wet coating (e.g., depainting or paint stripping), from a substrate before or after coating application or from equipment associated with a coating operation, such as spray booths, spray guns, racks, tanks, and hangers. Thus, it includes any cleaning material used on substrates or equipment or both.</p><p class="depth0">Coating means a material applied to a substrate for decorative, protective, or functional purposes. Such materials include, but are not limited to, paints, sealants, liquid plastic coatings, caulks, inks, adhesives, and maskants. Decorative, protective, or functional materials that consist only of protective oils for metal, acids, bases, or any combination of these substances, or paper film or plastic film which may be pre-coated with an adhesive by the film manufacturer, are not considered coatings for the purposes of this subpart. A liquid plastic coating means a coating made from fine particle-size polyvinyl chloride (PVC) in solution (also referred to as a plastisol).</p><p class="depth0">Coating operation means equipment used to apply cleaning materials to a substrate to prepare it for coating application (surface preparation) or to remove dried coating; to apply coating to a substrate (coating application) and to dry or cure the coating after application; or to clean coating operation equipment (equipment cleaning). A single coating operation may include any combination of these types of equipment, but always includes at least the point at which a given quantity of coating or cleaning material is applied to a given part and all subsequent points in the affected source where organic HAP are emitted from the specific quantity of coating or cleaning material on the specific part. There may be multiple coating operations in an affected source. Coating application with handheld, non-refillable aerosol containers, touch-up markers, or marking pens is not a coating operation for the purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Coatings solids means the nonvolatile portion of the coating that makes up the dry film.</p><p class="depth0">Continuous parameter monitoring system (CPMS) means the total equipment that may be required to meet the data acquisition and availability requirements of this subpart, used to sample, condition (if applicable), analyze, and provide a record of coating operation, or capture system, or add-on control device parameters.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled coating operation means a coating operation from which some or all of the organic HAP emissions are routed through an emission capture system and add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Deviation means any instance in which an affected source subject to this subpart, or an owner or operator of such a source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fails to meet any requirement or obligation established by this subpart including but not limited to, any emission limit or operating limit or work practice standard;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fails to meet any term or condition that is adopted to implement an applicable requirement in this subpart and that is included in the operating permit for any affected source required to obtain such a permit; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fails to meet any emission limit, or operating limit, or work practice standard in this subpart during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, regardless of whether or not such failure is permitted by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means the aggregate of all requirements associated with a compliance option including emission limit, operating limit, work practice standard, etc.</p><p class="depth0">Enclosure means a structure that surrounds a source of emissions and captures and directs the emissions to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Exempt compound means a specific compound that is not considered a VOC due to negligible photochemical reactivity. The exempt compounds are listed in 40 CFR 51.100(s).</p><p class="depth0">Extreme performance fluoropolymer coating means coatings that are formulated systems based on fluoropolymer resins which often contain bonding matrix polymers dissolved in non-aqueous solvents as well as other ingredients. Extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings are typically used when one or more critical performance criteria are required including, but not limited to a

nonstick low-energy surface, dry film lubrication, high resistance to chemical attack, extremely wide operating temperature, high electrical insulating properties, or that the surface comply with government (e.g., USDA, FDA) or third party specifications for health, safety, reliability, or performance. Once applied to a substrate, extreme performance fluoropolymer coatings undergo a curing process that typically requires high temperatures, a chemical reaction, or other specialized technology.</p><p class="depth0">Facility maintenance means the routine repair or renovation (including the surface coating) of the tools, equipment, machinery, and structures that comprise the infrastructure of the affected facility and that are necessary for the facility to function in its intended capacity.</p><p class="depth0">General use coating means any material that meets the definition of coating but does not meet the definition of high performance coating, rubber-to-metal coating, magnet wire coating, or extreme performance fluoropolymer coating as defined in this section.</p><p class="depth0">High performance architectural coating means any coating applied to architectural subsections which is required to meet the specifications of Architectural Aluminum Manufacturer's Association's publication number AAMA 605.2-2000.</p><p class="depth0">High performance coating means any coating that meets the definition of high performance architectural coating or high temperature coating in this section.</p><p class="depth0">High temperature coating means any coating applied to a substrate which during normal use must withstand temperatures of at least 538 degrees Celsius (1000 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p class="depth0">Hobby shop means any surface coating operation, located at an affected source, that is used exclusively for personal, noncommercial purposes by the affected source's employees or assigned personnel.</p><p class="depth0">Magnet wire coatings, commonly referred to as magnet wire enamels, are applied to a continuous strand of wire which will be used to make turns (windings) in electrical devices such as coils, transformers, or motors. Magnet wire coatings provide high dielectric strength and turn-to-turn conductor insulation. This allows the turns of an electrical device to be placed in close proximity to one another which leads to increased coil effectiveness and electrical efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">Magnet wire coating machine means equipment which applies and cures magnet wire coatings.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer's formulation data means data on a material (such as a coating) that are supplied by the material manufacturer based on knowledge of the ingredients used to manufacture that material, rather than based on testing of the material with the test methods specified in Sec. 63.3941. Manufacturer's formulation data may include, but are not limited to, information on density, organic HAP content, volatile organic matter content, and coating solids content.</p><p class="depth0">Mass fraction of organic HAP means the ratio of the mass of organic HAP to the mass of a material in which it is contained, expressed as kg of organic HAP per kg of material.</p><p class="depth0">Month means a calendar month or a pre-specified period of 28 days to 35 days to allow for flexibility in recordkeeping when data are based on a business accounting period.</p><p class="depth0">Non-HAP coating means, for the purposes of this subpart, a coating that contains no more than 0.1 percent by mass of any individual organic HAP that is an OSHA-defined carcinogen as specified in 29 CFR 1910.1200(d)(4) and no more than 1.0 percent by mass for any other individual HAP.</p><p class="depth0">Organic HAP content means the mass of organic HAP emitted per volume of coating solids used for a coating calculated using Equation 2 of Sec. 63.3941. The organic HAP content is determined for the coating in the condition it is in when received from its manufacturer or supplier and does not account for any alteration after receipt. For reactive adhesives in which some of the HAP react to form solids and are not emitted to the atmosphere, organic HAP content is the mass of organic HAP that is emitted, rather than the organic HAP content of the coating as it is received.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent total enclosure (PTE) means a permanently installed enclosure that

meets the criteria of Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51, for a PTE and that directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Personal watercraft means a vessel (boat) which uses an inboard motor powering a water jet pump as its primary source of motive power and which is designed to be operated by a person or persons sitting, standing, or kneeling on the vessel, rather than in the conventional manner of sitting or standing inside the vessel.</p><p class="depth0">Protective oil means an organic material that is applied to metal for the purpose of providing lubrication or protection from corrosion without forming a solid film. This definition of protective oil includes, but is not limited to, lubricating oils, evaporative oils (including those that evaporate completely), and extrusion oils. Protective oils used on miscellaneous metal parts and products include magnet wire lubricants and soft temporary protective coatings that are removed prior to installation or further assembly of a part or component.</p><p class="depth0">Reactive adhesive means adhesive systems composed, in part, of volatile monomers that react during the adhesive curing reaction, and, as a result, do not evolve from the film during use. These volatile components instead become integral parts of the adhesive through chemical reaction. At least 70 percent of the liquid components of the system, excluding water, react during the process.</p><p class="depth0">Research or laboratory facility means a facility whose primary purpose is for research and development of new processes and products, that is conducted under the close supervision of technically trained personnel, and is not engaged in the manufacture of final or intermediate products for commercial purposes, except in a de minimis manner.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth0">Rubber-to-metal coatings are coatings that contain heat-activated polymer systems in either solvent or water that, when applied to metal substrates, dry to a non-tacky surface and react chemically with the rubber and metal during a vulcanization process.</p><p class="depth0">Startup, initial means the first time equipment is brought online in a facility.</p><p class="depth0">Surface preparation means use of a cleaning material on a portion of or all of a substrate. This includes use of a cleaning material to remove dried coating, which is sometimes called depainting.</p><p class="depth0">Temporary total enclosure means an enclosure constructed for the purpose of measuring the capture efficiency of pollutants emitted from a given source as defined in Method 204 of appendix M, 40 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">Thinner means an organic solvent that is added to a coating after the coating is received from the supplier.</p><p class="depth0">Total volatile hydrocarbon (TVH) means the total amount of nonaqueous volatile organic matter determined according to Methods 204 and 204A through 204F of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 and substituting the term TVH each place in the methods where the term VOC is used. The TVH includes both VOC and non-VOC.</p><p class="depth0">Uncontrolled coating operation means a coating operation from which none of the organic HAP emissions are routed through an emission capture system and add-on control device.</p><p class="depth0">Volatile organic compound (VOC) means any compound defined as VOC in 40 CFR 51.100(s).</p><p class="depth0">Volume fraction of coating solids means the ratio of the volume of coating solids (also known as the volume of nonvolatiles) to the volume of a coating in which it is contained; liters (gal) of coating solids per liter (gal) of coating.</p><p class="depth0">Wastewater means water that is generated in a coating operation and is collected, stored, or treated prior to being discarded or discharged.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.

Appendix A to Subpart MMMM of Part 63--Alternative Capture</p><p class="depth0">Efficiency and Destruction Efficiency Measurement and Monitoring</p><p class="depth0">Procedures for Magnet Wire Coating Operations</p><p class="depth0">1.0 Introduction.</p><p class="depth0">1.1 These alternative procedures for capture efficiency and destruction efficiency measurement and monitoring are intended principally for newer magnet wire coating machines where the control device is internal and integral to the oven so that it is difficult or infeasible to make gas measurements at the inlet to the control device.</p><p class="depth0">1.2 In newer gas fired magnet wire ovens with thermal control (no catalyst), the burner tube serves as the control device (thermal oxidizer) for the process. The combustion of solvents in the burner tube is the principal source of heat for the oven.</p><p class="depth0">1.3 In newer magnet wire ovens with a catalyst there is either a burner tube (gas fired ovens) or a tube filled with electric heating elements (electric heated oven) before the catalyst. A large portion of the solvent is often oxidized before reaching the catalyst. The combustion of solvents in the tube and across the catalyst is the principal source of heat for the oven. The internal catalyst in these ovens cannot be accessed without disassembly of the oven. This disassembly includes removal of the oven insulation. Oven reassembly often requires the installation of new oven insulation.</p><p class="depth0">1.4 Some older magnet wire ovens have external afterburners. A significant portion of the solvent is oxidized within these ovens as well.</p><p class="depth0">1.5 The alternative procedure for destruction efficiency determines the organic carbon content of the volatiles entering the control device based on the quantity of coating used, the carbon content of the volatile portion of the coating and the efficiency of the capture system. The organic carbon content of the control device outlet (oven exhaust for ovens without an external afterburner) is determined using Method 25 or 25A.</p><p class="depth0">1.6 When it is difficult or infeasible to make gas measurements at the inlet to the control device, measuring capture efficiency with a gas-to-gas protocol (see Sec. 63.3965(d)) which relies on direct measurement of the captured gas stream will also be difficult or infeasible. In these situations, capture efficiency measurement is more appropriately done with a procedure which does not rely on direct measurement of the captured gas stream.</p><p class="depth0">1.7 Magnet wire ovens are relatively small compared to many other coating ovens. The exhaust rate from an oven is low and varies as the coating use rate and solvent loading rate change from job to job. The air balance in magnet wire ovens is critical to product quality. Magnet wire ovens must be operated under negative pressure to avoid smoke and odor in the workplace, and the exhaust rate must be sufficient to prevent over heating within the oven.</p><p class="depth0">1.8 The liquid and gas measurements needed to determine capture efficiency and control device efficiency using these alternative procedures may be made simultaneously.</p><p class="depth0">1.9 Magnet wire facilities may have many (e.g., 20 to 70 or more) individual coating lines each with its own capture and control system. With approval, representative capture efficiency and control device efficiency testing of one magnet wire coating machine out of a group of identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines may be performed rather than testing every individual magnet wire coating machine. The operating parameters must be established for each tested magnet wire coating machine during each capture efficiency test and each control device efficiency test. The operating parameters established for each tested magnet wire

coating machine also serve as the operating parameters for untested or very similar magnet wire coating machines represented by a tested magnet wire coating machine.</p><p class="depth0">2.0 Capture Efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">2.1 If the capture system is a permanent total enclosure as described in Sec. 63.3965(a), then its capture efficiency may be assumed to be 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0">2.2 If the capture system is not a permanent total enclosure, then capture efficiency must be determined using the liquid-to-uncaptured-gas protocol using a temporary total enclosure or building enclosure in Sec. 63.3965(c), or an alternative capture efficiency protocol (see Sec. 63.3965(e)) which does not rely on direct measurement of the captured gas stream.</p><p class="depth0">2.3 As an alternative to establishing and monitoring the capture efficiency operating parameters in Sec. 63.3967(f), the monitoring described in either section 2.4 or 2.5, and the monitoring described in sections 2.6 and 2.7 may be used for magnet wire coating machines.</p><p class="depth0">2.4 Each magnet wire oven must be equipped with an interlock mechanism which will stop or prohibit the application of coating either when any exhaust fan for that oven is not operating or when the oven experiences an over limit temperature condition.</p><p class="depth0">2.5 Each magnet wire oven must be equipped with an alarm which will be activated either when any oven exhaust fan is not operating or when the oven experiences an over limit temperature condition.</p><p class="depth0">2.6 If the interlock in 2.4 or the alarm in 2.5 is monitoring for over limit temperature conditions, then the temperature(s) that will trigger the interlock or the alarm must be included in the start-up, shutdown and malfunction plan and the interlock or alarm must be set to be activated when the oven reaches that temperature.</p><p class="depth0">2.7 Once every 6 months, each magnet wire oven must be checked using a smoke stick or equivalent approach to confirm that the oven is operating at negative pressure compared to the surrounding atmosphere.</p><p class="depth0">3.0 Control Device Efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Determine the weight fraction carbon content of the volatile portion of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material used during each test run using either the procedure in section 3.2 or 3.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Following the procedures in Method 204F, distill a sample of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material used during each test run to separate the volatile portion. Determine the weight fraction carbon content of each distillate using ASTM Method D5291-02, ``Standard Test Methods for Instrumental Determination of Carbon, Hydrogen, and Nitrogen in Petroleum Products and Lubricants'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14).</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Analyze each coating, thinner, additive or cleaning material used during each test run using Method 311. For each volatile compound detected in the gas chromatographic analysis of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material calculate the weight fraction of that whole compound in the coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material. For each volatile compound detected in the gas chromatographic analysis of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material calculate the weight fraction of the carbon in that compound in the coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material. Calculate the weight fraction carbon content of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material as the ratio of the sum of the carbon weight fractions divided by the sum of the whole compound weight fractions.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Determine the mass fraction of total volatile hydrocarbon (TVHi) in each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during each test run using Method 24. The mass fraction of total volatile hydrocarbon equals the weight fraction volatile matter (Wv in Method 24) minus the weight fraction water (Ww in Method 24), if any, present in the coating. The ASTM Method D6053-00, ``Standard Test Method for Determination of Volatile Organic Compound (VOC) Content of Electrical Insulating Varnishes'' (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 63.14), may be used as an alternative to Method 24 for magnet wire enamels. The specimen size for testing magnet wire enamels with ASTM Method D6053-00 must be 2.0 0.1 grams.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Determine the volume (VOLi) or mass (MASSi) of each coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during each test run.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Calculate the total volatile hydrocarbon input (TVHCinlet) to the control device during each test run, as carbon, using Equation 1:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA04.028



where:
TVHi = Mass fraction of TVH in coating, thinner, additive, or</p><p class="depth0">cleaning material, i, used in the coating operation during the</p><p class="depth0">test run.VOLi = Volume of coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning</p><p class="depth0">material, i, used in the coating operation during the test</p><p class="depth0">run, liters.Di = Density of coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning</p><p class="depth0">material, i, used in the coating operation during the test</p><p class="depth0">run, kg per liter.CDi = Weight fraction carbon content of the distillate from</p><p class="depth0">coating, thinner, additive, or cleaning material, i, used in</p><p class="depth0">the coating operation during the test run, percent.n = Number of coating, thinner, additive, and cleaning materials used in</p><p class="depth0">the coating operation during the test run.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 If the mass, MASSi, of each coating, solvent, additive, or cleaning material, i, used during the test run is measured directly then MASSi can be substituted for VOLi x Di in Equation 1 in section 3.6.</p><p class="depth0">3.8 Determine the TVHC output (TVHCoutlet) from the control device, as carbon, during each test run using the methods in Sec. 63.3966(a) and the procedure for determining Mfo in Sec. 63.3966(d). TVHCoutlet equals Mfo times the length of the test run in hours.</p><p class="depth0">3.9 Determine the control device efficiency (DRE) for each test run using Equation 2:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR02JA04.029</p><p class="depth0">3.10 The efficiency of the control device is the average of the three individual test run values determined in section 3.9.</p><p class="depth0">3.11 As an alternative to establishing and monitoring the destruction efficiency operating parameters for catalytic oxidizers in Sec. 63.3967(b), the monitoring described in sections 3.12 and 3.13 may be used for magnet wire coating machines equipped with catalytic oxidizers.</p><p class="depth0">3.12 During the performance test, you must monitor and record the temperature either just before or just after the catalyst bed at least once every 15 minutes during each of the three test runs. Use the data collected during the performance test to calculate and record the average temperature either just before or just after the catalyst bed during the performance test. This is the minimum operating limit for your catalytic oxidizer and for the catalytic oxidizers in identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines represented by the tested magnet wire coating machine.</p><p class="depth0">3.13 You must develop and implement an inspection and maintenance plan for your catalytic oxidizer(s). The plan must address, at a minimum, the elements specified in sections 3.14 and 3.15, and the elements specified in either (a) section 3.16 or (b) sections 3.17 and 3.18.</p><p class="depth0">3.14 You must conduct a monthly external inspection of each catalytic oxidizer system, including the burner assembly and fuel supply lines for problems and, as necessary, adjust the equipment to assure proper air-to-fuel mixtures.</p><p class="depth0">3.15 You must conduct an annual internal inspection of each accessible catalyst bed to check for channeling, abrasion, and settling. If problems are found, you must replace the catalyst bed or take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations. This provision does not apply to internal catalysts which cannot be accessed without disassembling the magnet wire oven.</p><p class="depth0">3.16 You must take a sample of each catalyst bed and perform an analysis of the catalyst activity (i.e., conversion efficiency) following the manufacturer's or catalyst supplier's recommended procedures. This sampling and analysis must be done within the time period shown in Table 1 below of the most recent of the last catalyst activity test or the last catalyst replacement. For example, if the warranty for the catalyst is 3 years and the catalyst was more recently replaced then the sampling and analysis must be done within the earlier of 26,280 operating hours or 5 calendar years of the last catalyst replacement. If the warranty for the catalyst is 3 years and the catalyst was more recently tested then the sampling and analysis must be done within the earlier of 13,140 operating hours or 3 calendar years of the last catalyst activity test. If problems are found during the catalyst activity test, you must replace the catalyst bed or take corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1--Catalyst Monitoring Requirements------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">And the catalyst</p><p class="depth0">Then the time     was more recently</p><p class="depth0">between catalyst    tested, then the</p><p class="depth0">If the catalyst was last (more     replacement and      time between</p><p class="depth0">recently) replaced and the      the next catalyst   catalyst activity</p><p class="depth0">warranty period is . . .         activity test       tests cannot</p><p class="depth0">cannot exceed the  exceed the earlier</p><p class="depth0">earlier of . . .        of . . .------------------------------------------------------------------------1 year..........................  8,760 operating     8,760 operating</p><p class="depth0">hours or 5          hours or 3</p><p class="depth0">calendar years.     calendar years.2 years.........................  15,520 operating    8,760 operating</p><p class="depth0">hours or 5          hours or 3</p><p class="depth0">calendar years.     calendar years.3 years.........................  26,280 operating    13,100 operating</p><p class="depth0">hours or 5          hours or 3</p><p class="depth0">calendar years.     calendar years.4 years.........................  35,040 operating    17,520 operating</p><p class="depth0">hours or 5          hours or 3</p><p class="depth0">calendar years.     calendar years.5 or more years.................  43,800 operating    21,900 operating</p><p class="depth0">hours or 5          hours or 3</p><p class="depth0">calendar years.     calendar years.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">3.17 During the performance test, you must determine the average concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the magnet wire oven exhaust stack gases (Cc in Equation 1 in Sec. 63.3966(d)) and the destruction efficiency of the catalytic oxidizer, and calculate the operating limit for oven exhaust stack gas concentration as follows. You must identify the highest organic HAP content coating used on this magnet wire coating machine or any identical or very similar magnet wire coating machines to which the same destruction efficiency test results will be applied. Calculate the percent emission reduction necessary to meet the magnet wire coating emission limit when using this coating. Calculate the average concentration of organic compounds as carbon in the magnet wire oven exhaust stack gases that would be equivalent to exactly meeting the magnet wire coating emissions limit when using the highest organic HAP content coating. The maximum operating limit for oven exhaust stack gas concentration equals 90 percent of this calculated concentration.</p><p class="depth0">3.18 For each magnet wire coating machine equipped with a catalytic oxidizer you must perform an annual 10 minute test of the oven exhaust stack gases using EPA Method 25A. This test must be performed under steady state operating conditions similar to those at which the last destruction efficiency test for equipment of that type (either the specific magnet wire coating machine or an identical or very similar magnet wire coating machine) was conducted. If the average exhaust stack gas concentration during the annual test of a magnet wire coating machine equipped with a catalytic oxidizer is greater than the operating limit established in section 3.17 then that is a deviation from the operating limit for that catalytic oxidizer. If problems are found during the annual 10-minute test of the oven exhaust stack gases, you must replace the catalyst bed or take other corrective action consistent with the manufacturer's recommendations.</p><p class="depth0">3.19 If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is not of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then you must conduct a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency according to Sec. 63.3966 and establish new operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer unless destruction efficiency test results and operating limits for an identical or very similar unit (including consideration of the replacement catalyst) are available and approved for use for the catalytic oxidizer with the replacement catalyst.</p><p class="depth0">3.20 If a catalyst bed is replaced and the replacement catalyst is of like or better kind and quality as the old catalyst, then a new performance test to determine destruction efficiency is not required and you may continue to use the previously established operating limits for that catalytic oxidizer.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart NNNN_National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:</p><p class="depth0">Surface Coating of Large Appliances</p><p class="depth0">Source: 67 FR 48262, July 23, 2002, unless otherwise noted.</p><p class="depth0">What This Subpart Covers</p>
