A PM must recruit and recommend for selection by us public and private entities to function as ENs under the program. A PM is also responsible for monitoring the ENs operating in its service delivery area. Such monitoring must be done to the extent necessary and appropriate to ensure that adequate choices of services are made available to beneficiaries with tickets. A PM may not limit the number of public or private entities being recommended to function as ENs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facilitating access by beneficiaries to ENs. A PM must assist beneficiaries with tickets in accessing ENs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A PM must establish and maintain lists of the ENs available to beneficiaries with tickets in its service delivery area and make these lists generally available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A PM must ensure that all information provided to beneficiaries with tickets about ENs is in accessible formats. For purposes of this section, accessible format means by media that is appropriate to a particular beneficiary's impairment(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A PM must take necessary measures to ensure that sufficient ENs are available and that each beneficiary under the Ticket to Work program has reasonable access to employment services, vocational rehabilitation services, and other support services. The PM shall ensure that services such as the following are available in each service area, including rural areas: case management, work incentives planning, supported employment, career planning, career plan development, vocational assessment, job training, placement, follow-up services, and other services that we may require in an agreement with a PM.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A PM must ensure that each beneficiary with a ticket is allowed to change ENs. When a change in the EN occurs, the PM must reassign the ticket based on the choice of the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Facilitating payments to ENs. A PM must facilitate payments to the ENs in its service delivery area. Subpart H explains the EN payment systems and the PM's role in administering these systems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A PM must maintain documentation and provide regular assurances to us that payments to an EN are warranted. The PM shall ensure that an EN is complying with the terms of its agreement and applicable regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon the request of an EN, the PM shall make a determination of the allocation of the outcome or milestone payments due to an EN based on the services provided by the EN when a beneficiary has been served by more than one EN.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Administrative requirements. A PM will perform such administrative tasks as are required to assist us in administering and implementing the Ticket to Work program. Administrative tasks required for the implementation of the Program may include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reviewing individual work plans (IWPs) submitted by ENs for ticket assignment. These reviews will be conducted to ensure that the IWPs meet the requirements of Sec. 411.465. (The PM will not review individualized plans for employment developed by State VR agencies and beneficiaries.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing amendments to IWPs to ensure that the amendments meet the requirements in Sec. 411.465.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ensuring that ENs only refer an individual to a State VR agency for services pursuant to an agreement regarding the conditions under which such services will be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Resolving a dispute between an EN and a State VR agency with respect

to agreements regarding the conditions under which services will be provided when an individual is referred by an EN to a State VR agency for services.</p><p class="depth3">Evaluation of Program Manager Performance</p>
