Among acts or practices which will be considered in determining if the initial sale was in good faith, and not a strategem to sell other merchandise, are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Accepting a deposit for the advertised product, then switching the purchaser to a higher-priced product,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to make delivery of the advertised product within a reasonable time or to make a refund,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disparagement by acts or words of the advertised product, or the disparagement of the guarantee, credit terms, availability of service, repairs, or in any other respect, in connection with it,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The delivery of the advertised product which is defective, unusable or impractical for the purpose represented or implied in the advertisement. [Guide 4]</p><p class="depth2">Note: Sales of advertised merchandise. Sales of the advertised merchandise do not preclude the existence of a bait and switch scheme. It has been determined that, on occasions, this is a mere incidental byproduct of the fundamental plan and is intended to provide an aura of legitimacy to the overall operation.</p>
