                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evidence. Every party shall have the right to present its case  or defense by oral and documentary evidence, unless otherwise limited by  law or regulation, to conduct such cross-examination and to submit  rebuttal evidence as may be required for a full and true disclosure of  the facts. Irrelevant, immaterial, privileged, or unduly repetitious  evidence shall be excluded. Unless otherwise provided for in this part,  the Federal Rules of Evidence shall provide guidance to the hearing  officer in the conduct of proceedings under this part, but shall not be  binding. Parties may object to clearly irrelevant material, but  technical and hearsay objections to testimony as used in a court of law  will not be sustained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testimony under oath or affirmation. All witnesses shall testify  under oath or affirmation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence  shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections. Rulings on  objections shall be a part of the transcript. Failure to object to  admission or exclusion of evidence or to any evidentiary ruling shall be  considered a waiver of objection, but no exception to a ruling on an  objection is necessary in order to preserve it for appeal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authenticity of documents. Unless specifically challenged, it  shall be presumed that all relevant documents are authentic. An  objection to the authenticity of a document shall not be sustained  merely on the basis that it is not the original.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Stipulations. The parties may stipulate as to any relevant  matters of fact. Stipulations may be received in evidence at a hearing,  and when received shall be binding on the parties with respect to the  matters stipulated. The parties are encouraged to enter into  stipulations of fact whenever possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Official notice. All matters officially noticed by the hearing  officer shall appear on the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Burden of proof. The burden of proof shall be upon the proponent  of an action or affirmative defense, including, where applicable,  mitigating factors, unless otherwise provided by law or regulation.</p>
