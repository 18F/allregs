                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The drop test must be conducted for the qualification  of all IBC design types and performed periodically as specified in  Sec. 178.801(e) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special preparation for the drop test. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Metal, rigid plastic,  and composite IBCs intended to contain solids must be filled to not less  than 95 percent of their maximum capacity, or if intended to contain  liquids, to not less than 98 percent of their maximum capacity. Pressure  relief devices must be removed and their apertures plugged or rendered  inoperative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fiberboard and wooden IBCs must be filled with a solid material  to not less than 95 percent of their maximum capacity; the contents must  be evenly distributed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Flexible IBCs must be filled to the maximum permissible gross  mass; the contents must be evenly distributed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Rigid plastic IBCs and composite IBCs with plastic inner  receptacles must be conditioned for testing by reducing the temperature  of the packaging and its contents to -18 C (0 F) or lower. Test  liquids must be kept in the liquid state, if necessary, by the addition  of anti-freeze. Water/anti-freeze solutions with a minimum specific  gravity of 0.95 for testing at -18 C (0 F) or lower are considered  acceptable test liquids, and may be considered equivalent to water for  test purposes. IBCs conditioned in this way are not required to be  conditioned in accordance with Sec. 178.802.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test method. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Samples of all IBC design types must be dropped  onto a rigid, non-resilient, smooth, flat and horizontal surface. The  point of impact must be the most vulnerable part of the base of the IBC  being tested. Following the drop, the IBC must be restored to the  upright position for observation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> IBC design types with a capacity of 0.45 cubic meters (15.9  cubic feet) or less must be subject to an additional drop test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Drop height. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For all IBCs, drop heights are specified as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Packing Group I: 1.8 m (5.9 feet).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Packing Group II: 1.2 m (3.9 feet).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Packing Group III: 0.8 m (2.6 feet).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drop tests are to be performed with the solid or liquid to be  transported or with a non-hazardous material having essentially the same  physical characteristics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The specific gravity and viscosity of a substituted non- hazardous material used in the drop test for liquids must be similar to  the hazardous material intended for transportation. Water also may be  used for the liquid drop test under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity not  exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be those specified in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section for each IBC design type; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where the substances to be carried have a specific gravity  exceeding 1.2, the drop heights must be as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Packing Group I: SG x 1.5 m (4.9 feet).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Packing Group II: SG x 1.0 m (3.3 feet).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Packing Group III: SG x 0.67 m (2.2 feet).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Criteria for passing the test. For all IBC design types, there  may be no damage which renders the IBC unsafe to be transported for  salvage or for disposable, and no loss of contents. The IBC shall be  capable of being lifted by an appropriate means until clear of the floor  for five minutes. A slight discharge from a closure upon impact is not  considered to be a failure of the IBC provided that no further leakage  occurs. A slight discharge (e.g., from closures or stitch holes) upon  impact is not considered a failure of the flexible IBC provided that no  further leakage occurs after the IBC has been raised clear of the  ground.
