                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Army Law Enforcement (LE) personnel will collect  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) pursuant to DoDI 5505.14   (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/ 550514p.pdf), DNA Collection Requirements for Criminal Investigations.  Per this subpart, a sample of an individual's DNA is to allow for  positive identification and to provide or generate evidence to solve  crimes through database searches of potentially matching samples. DNA  samples will not be collected from juveniles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Army LE personnel will obtain a DNA sample from a civilian in  their control at the point it is determined there is probable cause to  believe the detained person violated a Federal statute equivalent to the  offenses identified in DoDI 5505.11 (available at http://www.dtic.mil/ whs/directives/corres/pdf/550511p.pdf), Fingerprint Card and Final  Disposition Report Submission Requirements, and 32 CFR part 310,  Department of Defense Privacy Program, except for the listed violations  that are exclusively military offenses. For the purposes of this rule,  DNA shall be taken from all civilian drug offenders, except those who  are arrested or detained for the offenses of simple possession and  personal use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When Army LE personnel make a probable cause determination  concerning a civilian not in their control, Army LE personnel are not  required to collect DNA samples. Likewise, Army LE personnel are not  required to obtain DNA samples when another LE agency has, or will,  obtain the DNA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Army LE personnel will use the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation  Laboratory (USACIL) DNA kit which includes a DNA sample card and the  USACIL DNA database collection eform. Army LE personnel will forward  civilian DNA samples to the USACIL. Army LE personnel will document, in  the appropriate case file, when civilian LE agencies handle any aspect  of the DNA processing and whether the civilian LE agency forwarded the  DNA sample to the FBI laboratory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DoD Instruction 5505.14 (available at http://www.dtic.mil/whs/ directives/corres/pdf/550514p.pdf) details the procedures former  Soldiers and civilians must follow to request expungement of their DNA  records. Former Soldiers and civilians from whom DNA samples have been  taken, but who were not convicted of any offense giving rise to the  collection of DNA, do not submit requests to have their DNA record  expunged through installation PMO/DES channels. To request expungement  of DNA records for civilians pursuant to Sections 14132 of title 42,  United States Code, the requestor or legal representative must submit a  written request to: FBI, Laboratory Division, 2501 Investigation  Parkway, Quantico, VA 22135, Attention: Federal Convicted Offender  Program Manager.</p>
