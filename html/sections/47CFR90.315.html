Table 1 allows this station to operate with 250 W ERP. Now assume the shore station communicating with the offshore station is 48 km (30 mi) from the offshore station and 241 km (150 mi) from Bude, Miss. The shore station antenna height is 152.5 m (500 ft) above ground. The shore station will be allowed the same ERP as the offshore station (250 W) in the direction of the offshore station. Table 2 indicates that the effective radiated power in a sector <22\1/2\ from the line joining the shore antenna to Bude, Miss. can only be 15 W. Consequently, a directional antenna must be used whose minimum front-to-back ratio over this 45 sector must be at least 12.2 dB.
