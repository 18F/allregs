                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability and adoption of the citizen participation plan. (1) The State is required to adopt a citizen participation plan that sets forth the State's policies and procedures for citizen participation. (Where a State, before March 6, 1995, adopted a citizen participation plan that complies with section 104(a)(3) of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304(A)(3)) but will need to amend the citizen participation plan to comply with provisions of this section, the citizen participation plan shall be amended by the first day of the State's program year that begins on or after 180 days following March 6, 1995.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State is required to adopt a citizen participation plan that sets forth the State's policies and procedures for citizen participation.

(i) The citizen participation plan must provide for and encourage citizens to participate in the development of the consolidated plan, any substantial amendments to the consolidated plan, and the performance report. These requirements are designed especially to encourage participation by low- and moderate-income persons, particularly those living in slum and blighted areas and in areas where CDBG funds are proposed to be used, and by residents of predominantly low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. A State is also expected to take whatever actions are appropriate to encourage the participation of all its citizens, including minorities and non-English speaking persons, as well as persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The citizen participation plan must provide for and encourage citizens to participate in the development of the consolidated plan, any substantial amendments to the consolidated plan, and the performance report.

A State is also expected to take whatever actions are appropriate to encourage the participation of all its citizens, including minorities and non-English speaking persons, as well as persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The State shall encourage the participation of local, regional, and statewide institutions, Continuums of Care, and other organizations (including businesses, developers, nonprofit organizations, philanthropic organizations, and community-based and faith-based organizations) that are involved with or affected by the programs or activities covered by the consolidated plan in the process of developing and implementing the consolidated plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The state should explore alternative public involvement techniques that encourage a shared vision of change for the community and the review of program performance; e.g., the use of focus groups and the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Citizen and local government comment on the citizen participation plan and amendments.
