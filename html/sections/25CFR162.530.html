                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before we approve a WEEL, we must determine that the WEEL is in  the best interest of the Indian landowners. In making that  determination, we will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Review the WEEL and supporting documents;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify potential environmental impacts and ensure compliance  with all applicable environmental laws, land use laws, and ordinances;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the lease is being approved under 25 U.S.C. 415, assure  ourselves that adequate consideration has been given to the factors in  25 U.S.C. 415(a); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Require any lease modifications or mitigation measures necessary  to satisfy any requirements including any other Federal or tribal land  use requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receiving the WEEL package, we will promptly notify the  parties whether the package is or is not complete. A complete package  includes all the information and supporting documents required for a  WEEL, including but not limited to, NEPA review documentation, where  applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the WEEL package is not complete, our letter will identify  the missing information or documents required for a complete package. If  we do not respond to the submission of a WEEL package, the parties may  take action under Sec. 162.588.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the WEEL package is complete, we will notify the parties of  the date we receive the complete package, and, within 20 days of the  date of receipt of the package at the appropriate BIA office, approve or  disapprove the WEEL or return the package for revision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If we do not meet the deadline in this section, then the parties  may take appropriate action under Sec. 162.588.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will provide any WEEL approval determination and the basis  for the determination, along with notification of appeal rights under  part 2 of this chapter, in writing to the parties to the WEEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> We will provide any WEEL disapproval determination and the basis   for the determination, along with notification of rights to an informal  conference, in writing to the parties. Within 30 days of receipt of the  disapproval determination, the parties may request an informal  conference with the official who issued the determination. Within 30  days of receiving this request, the official must hold the informal  conference with the parties. Within 10 days of the informal conference,  the official must issue a decision and the basis for the decision, along  with a notification of appeal rights under part 2 of this chapter, in  writing to the parties to the WEEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> We will provide the approved WEEL on tribal land to the lessee  and provide a copy to the tribe. We will provide the approved WEEL on  individually owned Indian land to the lessee, and make copies available  to the Indian landowners upon written request.</p>
