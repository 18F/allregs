                            <p class="depth0">Each navigation light system must meet the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Feeders. On vessels required to have a final emergency power source by Sec.  112.05-5(a) of this chapter, each navigation light panel must be supplied by a feeder from the emergency switchboard (see Sec.  112.43-13). The feeder must be protected by overcurrent devices rated or set at a value of at least twice that of the navigation light panel main fuses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Navigation light indicator panel. Each self-propelled vessel must have a navigation light indicator panel in the navigating bridge to control side, masthead, and stern lights. The panel must visually and audibly signal the failure of each of these navigation lights. Each light source must be connected to a separate fused branch circuit. The panel must have a fused feeder disconnect switch, and the fuses must have at least twice the rating of the largest branch circuit fuse and must be greater than the maximum panel load.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dual light sources. Each self-propelled vessel must have duplicate light sources for the side, masthead, and stern lights.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Navigation lights. Each navigation light must meet the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Meet the technical details of the applicable navigation rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be certified by an independent laboratory to the requirements of UL 1104 (incorporated by reference; see 46 CFR 110.10-1) or an equivalent standard under 46 CFR 110.20-1. Portable battery powered lights need meet only the requirements of the standard applicable to those lights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be labeled with a label stating the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``MEETS _____.'' (Insert the identification name or number of the standard under paragraph (d)(2) of this

section to which the light was type-tested.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> ``TESTED BY _____.'' (Insert the name or registered certification mark of the independent laboratory that tested the fixture to the standard under paragraph (d)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Manufacturer's name.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Model number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Visibility of the light in nautical miles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Date on which the fixture was type-tested.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Identification of bulb used in the compliance test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If it is a flashing light, have its intensity determined by the formula:
Ie = G/(0.2 + t2-t1)
Where
Ie = Luminous Intensity.G = Integral of Idt evaluated between the limits of t1 and t2.t1 = Time in seconds of the beginning of the flash.t2 = Time in seconds of the end of the flash.I = Instantaneous intensity during the flash.</p><p class="depth3">Note: The limits, t1 and t2, are to be chosen so as to maximize Ie.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Installation of navigation lights. Each navigation light must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be installed so that its location and its angle of visibility meet the applicable navigation rules;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as permitted by the applicable navigation rules, be arranged so that light from a navigation light is not obstructed by any part of; the vessel's structure or rigging;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be wired by a short length of heavy-duty, flexible cable to a watertight receptacle outlet next to the light or, for permanently mounted fixtures, by direct run of fixed cable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If it is a double-lens, two-lamp type, have each lamp connected to its branch circuit conductors either by an individual flexible cable and watertight receptacle plug or, for permanently mounted fixtures, by an individual direct run of fixed cable.
