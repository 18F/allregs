If the MAP Participant's required contribution is specified as a dollar amount and the MAP Participant does not make the required contribution, the MAP Participant shall pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount specified in the approval letter. If the MAP Participant's required contribution is specified as a percentage of the total amount reimbursed by CCC, the MAP Participant may either return to CCC the amount of funds reimbursed by CCC to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level or pay to CCC in dollars the difference between the amount actually contributed and the amount of funds necessary to increase its actual contribution percentage to the required level. A MAP Participant shall remit such payment within six months after the end of its program year. The MAP Participant shall make such payment in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise approved in advance by CCC.</p>
