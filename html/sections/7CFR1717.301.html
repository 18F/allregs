                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> RUS makes and guarantees loans to borrowers to bring electric  service to persons in rural areas. RUS requires, as a condition to  making or guaranteeing any loans to power supply borrowers, that the  borrower enter into RUS wholesale power contracts with its several  members and assign and pledge such contracts as security for the  repayment of loans made or guaranteed by RUS and for other loans which,  pursuant to the RE Act, RUS has permitted to be secured pursuant to the  RUS mortgage. The RUS wholesale power contract requires, among other  matters, that the rates charged for power and energy sold thereunder  produce revenues sufficient to enable the power supply borrower to make  payments on account of all indebtedness of the power supply borrower.  The Administrator relies upon the RUS wholesale power contracts together  with other RUS documents to find and certify, as required in section 4  of the RE Act (7 U.S.C. 904), that the security for the loan is  reasonably adequate and the loan will be repaid within the time agreed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS requires power supply borrowers to take such actions as may  be necessary to charge rates for the sale of electric power and energy  which are sufficient to pay the principal and interest on loans made or  guaranteed by RUS in a timely manner and to meet the requirements of the  RUS wholesale power contract and other RUS documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to power supply borrowers which are not subject to  rate regulation by a state regulatory authority, RUS requires that such  borrowers establish rates and obtain RUS approval of such rates as  required by the terms of the RUS wholesale power contract and other RUS  documents.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> With respect to power supply borrowers which are subject to  regulation by a state regulatory authority, RUS does not make or  guarantee a loan for the construction, operation or enlargement of any  generating plant or transmission facility unless the consent of the  state regulatory authority having jurisdiction in the premises is first  obtained.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Pursuant to applicable provisions of state law state regulatory  authorities regulate many aspects of a power supply borrowers business  activities, including such matters as the setting of wholesale electric  rates, the borrowing of money, and the mortgaging of property. A state  regulatory authority's jurisdiction over the rates charged by a power  supply borrower shall be pre-empted where the Administrator has  determined that such jurisdiction has compromised Federal interests,  including without limitation, the ability of the borrower to repay its  secured loans in accordance with the terms of the RUS documents.  Thereupon, RUS shall, pursuant to the RUS documents, exercise exclusive  jurisdiction over the rates charged by a power supply borrower.  [55 FR 38646, Sept. 19, 1990; 55 FR 53100, Dec. 26, 1990]</p>
