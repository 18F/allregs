                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Required fees. DHS will charge a fee, as prescribed in 8 CFR 103.7(b)(1), for collecting biometric information at a DHS office, other designated collection site overseas, or a registered State or local law enforcement agency designated by a cooperative agreement with DHS to provide biometric collection services, to conduct required law enforcement checks, and to maintain this biometric information for reuse to support other benefit requests. Requests for benefits must be submitted with the biometric service fee for all individuals who are required to submit biometric information and a biometric services fee and who reside in the United States at the time of filing for the benefit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Non-payment of biometric service fee. (1) If a benefit request is received by DHS without the correct biometric service fee, DHS will notify the applicant, petitioner, and, when appropriate, the applicant or petitioner's representative, of the deficiency, and no further action will be taken on the benefit request until payment is received. Failure to submit the correct biometric service fee in response to a notice of deficiency within the time allotted in the notice will result in denial of the benefit request. There is no appeal from the denial of a benefit request for failure to submit the correct

biometric service fee. A motion to reopen a benefit request denied for failure to submit the correct biometric service fee will be granted only on proof that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a benefit request is received by DHS without the correct biometric service fee, DHS will notify the applicant, petitioner, and, when appropriate, the applicant or petitioner's representative, of the deficiency, and no further action will be taken on the benefit request until payment is received.

If the fee and charges are not paid within 14 calendar days, the benefit request will be denied.
