                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any report of pulmonary function tests submitted in connection  with a claim for benefits shall record the results of flow versus volume  (flow-volume loop). The instrument shall simultaneously provide records  of volume versus time (spirometric tracing). The report shall provide  the results of the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and the  forced vital capacity (FVC). The report shall also provide the FEV1/FVC  ratio, expressed as a percentage. If the maximum voluntary ventilation  (MVV) is reported, the results of such test shall be obtained  independently rather than calculated from the results of the FEV1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All pulmonary function test results submitted in connection with  a claim for benefits shall be accompanied by three tracings of the flow  versus volume and the electronically derived volume versus time  tracings. If the MVV is reported, two tracings of the MVV whose values  are within 10% of each other shall be sufficient. Pulmonary function  test results developed in connection with a claim for benefits shall  also include a statement signed by the physician or technician  conducting the test setting forth the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Date and time of test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name, DOL claim number, age, height, and weight of claimant at  the time of the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name of technician;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Name and signature of physician supervising the test;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Claimant's ability to understand the instructions, ability to  follow directions and degree of cooperation in performing the tests. If  the claimant is unable to complete the test, the person executing the  report shall set forth the reasons for such failure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Paper speed of the instrument used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Name of the instrument used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Whether a bronchodilator was administered. If a bronchodilator  is administered, the physician's report must detail values obtained both  before and after administration of the bronchodilator and explain the  significance of the results obtained; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> That the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section  have been complied with.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in this paragraph, no results of a pulmonary  function study shall constitute evidence of the presence or absence of a  respiratory or pulmonary impairment unless it is conducted and reported  in accordance with the requirements of this section and Appendix B to  this part. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, compliance with  the requirements of Appendix B shall be presumed. In the case of a  deceased miner, where no pulmonary function tests are in substantial  compliance with paragraphs (a) and (b) and Appendix B, noncomplying  tests may form the basis for   a finding if, in the opinion of the adjudication officer, the tests  demonstrate technically valid results obtained with good cooperation of  the miner.</p>
