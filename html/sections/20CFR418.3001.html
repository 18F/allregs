                            <p class="depth0">This subpart D relates to sections 1860D-1 through 1860D-24 of title XVIII of the Social Security Act (the Act) as added by section 101 of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-173). Sections 1860D-1 through 1860D-24 established Part D of title XVIII of the Act to create a Medicare program known as the Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program. Section 1860D-14, codified into the Act by section 101, includes a provision for subsidies of prescription drug premiums and of Part D cost-sharing requirements for Medicare beneficiaries whose income and resources do not exceed certain levels. The regulations in this subpart explain how we decide whether you are eligible for a Part D premium subsidy as defined in 42 CFR 423.780 and cost-sharing subsidy as defined in 42 CFR 423.782. The rules are divided into the following groups of sections according to subject content:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Sections 418.3001 through 418.3010 contain the introduction, a statement of the general purpose underlying the subsidy program for the Voluntary Prescription Drug Benefit Program under Medicare Part D, general provisions that apply to the subsidy program, a description of how we administer the program, and definitions of terms that we use in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sections 418.3101 through 418.3125 contain the general requirements that you must meet in order to be eligible for a subsidy. These sections set forth the subsidy eligibility requirements of being a Medicare beneficiary, of having income and resources below certain levels, and of filing an application. These sections also explain when we will redetermine your eligibility for a subsidy and the period covered by a redetermination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sections 418.3201 through 418.3230 contain the rules that relate to the filing of subsidy applications.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Sections 418.3301 through 418.3350 contain the rules that explain how we consider your income (and your spouse's income, if applicable) and define what income we count when we decide whether you are eligible for a subsidy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Sections 418.3401 through 418.3425 contain the rules that explain how we consider your resources (and your spouse's resources, if applicable) and define what resources we count when we decide whether you are eligible for a subsidy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sections 418.3501 through 418.3515 contain the rules that explain when we

will adjust or when we will terminate your eligibility for a subsidy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Sections 418.3601 through 418.3680 contain the rules that we apply when you appeal our determination regarding your subsidy eligibility or our determination of whether you should receive a full or partial subsidy. They also contain the rules that explain that our decision is binding unless you file an action in Federal district court seeking review of our final decision and what happens if your case is remanded by a Federal court</p>
