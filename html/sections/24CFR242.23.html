                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adjusted mortgage amount-rehabilitation projects. A mortgage financing the substantial rehabilitation of an existing hospital shall be subject to the following limitations, in addition to those set forth in Sec. 242.7:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Property held unencumbered. If the mortgagor is the fee simple owner of the property and the property is not encumbered by an outstanding indebtedness, the mortgage shall not exceed 100 percent of HUD's estimate of the cost of the proposed substantial rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Property subject to existing mortgage. If the mortgagor owns the property subject to an outstanding indebtedness, which is to be refinanced with part of the insured mortgage, the mortgage shall not exceed the total of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commissioner's estimate of the cost of substantial rehabilitation, plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such portion of the capital debt as does not exceed 90 percent of HUD's estimate of the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to substantial rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Property to be acquired. If the property is to be acquired by the mortgagor and the purchase price is to be financed with a part of the insured mortgage, the mortgage shall not exceed 90 percent of the total of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commissioner's estimate of the cost of substantial rehabilitation, plus</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The actual purchase price of the land and improvements or HUD's estimate (prior to substantial rehabilitation) of the fair market value of such land and improvements, whichever is the lesser.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 242/223(f) refinancing and acquisition--additional limits. (1) In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 242.7, if the hospital's existing capital debt is to be refinanced by the insured mortgage (i.e., without a change in ownership or with the hospital sold to a purchaser who has an identity of interest as defined by the Commissioner with the seller), the maximum mortgage amount must not exceed the cost to refinance the existing indebtedness, which will consist of the following items, the eligibility and amounts of which must be determined by the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 242.7, if the hospital's existing capital debt is to be refinanced by the insured mortgage (i.e., without a change in ownership or with the hospital sold to a purchaser who has an identity of interest as defined by the Commissioner with the seller), the maximum mortgage amount must not exceed the cost to refinance the existing indebtedness, which will consist of the following items, the eligibility and amounts of which must be determined by the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The amount required to pay off the existing capital debt;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The estimated hard costs, if any, totaling less than 20 percent of the mortgage amount; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Soft costs that would normally be allowable in a Section 242 insured loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to meeting the requirements of Sec. 242.7, if mortgage proceeds are to be used for an acquisition, the maximum mortgage amount must not exceed the cost to acquire the hospital, which will consist of the following items, the eligibility and amounts of which must be determined by the Commissioner:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual purchase price of the land and improvements or HUD's estimate (prior to repairs, renovation, and/or equipment replacement) of the fair market value of such land plus the replacement cost of improvements, whichever is the lesser;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The estimated hard costs, if any, totaling less than 20 percent of the mortgage amount; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Soft costs that would normally be allowable in a Section 242 insured loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reduced mortgage amount--leaseholds. In the event the mortgage is secured by a leasehold estate rather than a fee simple estate, the value or replacement cost of the property described in the mortgage shall be the value or replacement cost of the leasehold estate (as determined by HUD), which shall in all cases be less than the value or replacement cost of the property in fee simple.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cash equity. Depending on the financial circumstances of each hospital facility, HUD shall have the discretion to evaluate, on a case-by-case basis, the amount of equity that a mortgagor must supply in addition to the value of plant, property, and equipment and other values recognized as loan security in the commitment process. Exercise of this discretion shall never cause a loan to exceed 90 percent of estimated replacement cost, although it may cause it to be less than 90 percent. The equity contribution may not be made from borrowed funds. A private nonprofit or public mortgagor, but not a proprietary mortgagor, at the mortgagee's option and subject to 24 CFR 242.49, may provide any such required equity in the form of a letter of credit.
