A petition under  this section is not required if a request for continued examination  under Sec.  1.114 is filed prior to payment of the issue fee. If the  Office withdraws the application from issue, the Office will issue a new  notice of allowance if the Office again allows the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Once the issue fee has been paid, the Office will not withdraw  the application from issue at its own initiative for any reason except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A mistake on the part of the Office;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A violation of Sec.  1.56 or illegality in the application;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unpatentability of one or more claims; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For an interference or derivation proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Once the issue fee has been paid, the application will not be  withdrawn from issue upon petition by the applicant for any reason  except:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unpatentability of one of more claims, which petition must be  accompanied by an unequivocal statement that one or more claims are  unpatentable, an amendment to such claim or claims, and an explanation  as to how the amendment causes such claim or claims to be patentable;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Consideration of a request for continued examination in  compliance with Sec.  1.114; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Express abandonment of the application.
