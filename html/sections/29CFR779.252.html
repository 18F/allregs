                                Sec. 779.252  Not in deliveries from the reselling establishment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Goods which move across State lines only in the course of deliveries  from the reselling establishment of the enterprise are not included as  goods which ``move or have moved across State lines.'' Thus, goods  delivered by the enterprise to its customers outside of the State are  not, for that reason, considered goods which ``move or have moved across  State lines.'' The purpose of the provision excepting ``deliveries from  the reselling establishment'' is to limit the test to goods which flow  into the enterprise and to exclude those goods which only cross State  lines when they flow out of the enterprise as an incident of the sale of  such goods by the enterprise. In other words, this is an inflow test and  not an outflow test.</p>
