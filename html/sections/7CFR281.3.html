                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Request for determination of State government agency failure.  FNS shall examine State agency adminstration of SNAP on all or part of a  reservation when requested by the ITO, the State agency or at FNS'  discretion. When FNS determines that a deficiency in a State agency  operation of SNAP on all or part of an Indian reservation may be serious  enough to warrant a review, FNS shall advise the State agency and the  ITO in writing of the alleged deficiencies and of its plans to conduct  the   review and document deficiencies, if any are found. Subsequent to  October 1, 1979 FNS shall complete these reviews within 90 days from  receipt of an ITO's or State agency's request except under unusual  circumstances such as the receipt of a large number of simultaneous  requests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Content of the review for State agency performance.  The review shall be designed to determine whether or not the State  agency is properly administering SNAP on a specific reservation. When an  agency of State government is administering the Program on a  reservation, FNS shall as a part of the review consult with the ITO  about the operation of the Program on the reservation. The review  should, depending on the nature of the complaint, include but not be  limited to, an analysis of some or all of the following data:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The records of State agency consultation with the ITO required  under Sec. 281.2(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The estimated percentage of all eligible Indians on the  reservation who are participating the Program;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nature and extent of violations, if any, of the 30-day and  other processing standards for Indians;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The percentage of errors made in determining eligibility and/or  the amount of benefits overissued or underissued;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Compliance with standards for location and hours of  certification and issuance offices as required in Sec. 272.5;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Compliance with bilingual requirements of this regulation,  where appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Compliance with nondiscrimination requirements of this  regulation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Compliance with other significant program requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Comparison with services provided in all other areas of the  State; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Any other relevant information that becomes available during the  course of reviews including information received through contacts with  the Indian tribe.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Finding of no or of minor deficiencies. If after the review FNS  determines either that deficiencies do not exist or that only minor  deficiencies exist, FNS shall issue a report documenting its findings to  both the State agency and the ITO and shall work closely with the State  agency to achieve corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Formal warning. After the review is completed, if FNS determines  that major deficiencies exist, a formal warning shall be issued to the  State, with a copy to the ITO. At a minimum, such warning shall indicate  the State agency deficiencies and shall detail the basis upon which  deficiencies were determined. The State shall have 30 days to respond  with evidence that it is in compliance or to submit a corrective action  proposal under part 276. If satisfactory compliance is achieved by the  State agency on deficiencies cited in a formal warning, FNS shall notify  the State, with a copy to the ITO, that the warning for those  deficiences is satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of failure and sanctions. If at any time after the  formal warning period, or during or after the corrective action period,  FNS determines that major deficiencies still exist which the State  agency has not satisfactorily addressed or is not satisfactorily  addressing, FNS shall determine State failure and may impose appropriate  Federal sanctions on the State agency as specified in part 276.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> ITO operations. If FNS has determined State failure and FNS has  also determined that the ITO is capable of administering a SNAP in  accordance with the terms and requirements for participating State  agencies as established in the Act and regulations, then the ITO shall  assume adminstration of SNAP on the reservation. The State agency shall  continue to administer SNAP on the reservation until an effective  termination and transition arrangement has been completed in accordance  with Sec. 281.8.</p>
