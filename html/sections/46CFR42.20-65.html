Where the height exceeds the  standard the least difference (Z) between the actual and standard  heights shall be added to each end ordinate. Similarly, the intermediate  ordinates at distances of \1/6\L and \1/3\L from each perpendicular  shall be increased by 0.444Z and 0.111Z respectively.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Where the deck of an enclosed superstructure has at least the  same sheer as the exposed freeboard deck, the sheer of the enclosed  portion of the freeboard deck shall not be taken into account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Where an enclosed poop or forecastle is of standard height with  greater sheer than that of the freeboard deck, or is of more than  standard height, an addition to the sheer of the freeboard deck shall be  made as provided in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em>:</p><p class="depth2">Table 42.20-65(b)(1)--Standard Sheer Profile</p><p class="depth2">[Where L is in feet] ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Station          Ordinate (in inches)   Ordinate (in inches)  Factor ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- After half.........................

The difference  between the sums of the respective products and those of the standard  divided by 8 measures the deficiency or excess of sheer in the forward  or after half. The arithmetical mean of the excess or deficiency in the  forward and after halves measures the excess or deficiency of sheer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the after half of the sheer has an excess and the forward  half of the sheer has a deficiency, no credit shall be allowed for the  part in excess and deficiency only shall be measured.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where the forward half of the sheer profile exceeds the  standard, and the after portion of the sheer profile is not less than 75  percent of the standard, credit shall be allowed for the part in excess;  where the after part is less than 50 percent of the standard, no credit  shall be given for the excess sheer forward. Where the after sheer is  between 50 percent and 75 percent of the standard, intermediate  allowances may be granted for excess sheer forward.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where sheer credit is given for a poop or forecastle, the  following formula shall be used:  s = (y/3)(L'/L)  where:  s = sheer credit, to be deducted from the deficiency or added to the</p><p class="depth3">excess of sheer. y = difference between actual and standard height of superstructure at</p><p class="depth3">the end ordinate. L' = mean enclosed length of poop or forecastle up to a maximum length</p><p class="depth3">of 0.5L. L = length of vessel as defined in Sec. 42.13-15(a).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> The formula in this paragraph (c)(4) of this section provides a  curve in the form of a parabola tangent to the actual sheer curve at the  freeboard deck and intersecting the end ordinate at a point below the  superstructure deck a distance equal to the standard height of a  superstructure. The superstructure deck shall not be less than standard  height above this curve at any point. This curve shall be used in  determining the sheer profile for forward and after halves of the  vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Correction for variations from standard sheer profile. (1) The  correction for sheer shall be the deficiency or excess of sheer (see  paragraphs (c) (1) to (4) inclusive of this section) multiplied by:  0.75-(S/2L)  where:  S is the total length of enclosed superstructures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Addition for deficiency in sheer. (1) Where the sheer is less  than the standard, the correction for deficiency in sheer (see paragraph  (d)(1) of this section) shall be added to the freeboard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Deduction for excess sheer. (1) In vessels where an enclosed  superstructure covers 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships, the  correction for excess of sheer as calculated under the provisions of  paragraph (d)(1) of this section shall be deducted from the freeboard;  in vessels where no enclosed superstructure covers amidships, no  deduction shall be made from the freeboard; where an enclosed  superstructure covers less than 0.1L before and 0.1L abaft amidships,  the deduction   shall be obtained by linear interpolation. The maximum deduction for  excess sheer shall be at the rate of 1\1/2\ inches per 100 feet of  length.
