                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan identifies the Michigan Department of Labor and the Department of Public Health as the agencies to be responsible for administering the plan throughout the State. The Department of Labor will be responsible for promulgating and enforcing general safety and construction safety standards while the Department of Public Health will be responsible for the promulgation and enforcement of occupational health standards. Two independent commissions within the Department of Labor, the Construction Safety Commission and the Occupational Safety Standards Commission will promulgate general and construction safety standards while the Director of Public Health will promulgate health standards. Applications for variances to standards will be handled by the two Departments. Administrative adjudications will be the responsibility of the Occupational Safety Compliance and Appeals Board, the Construction Safety Compliance and Appeals Board, and the Occupational Health Review Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State program is expected to extend its protection to all employees in the State (including those employed by it and its political subdivisions) except those employed by Federal agencies, maritime workers, household domestic workers, and mine workers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Plan provides that the State agencies will have full authority to administer and to enforce all laws, rules and orders protecting employee safety and health in all places of employment in the State. It also proposes procedures for providing prompt and effective standards for the protection of employees against new and unforseen hazards, and for furnishing information to employees on hazards, precautions, symptoms, and emergency treatment, and procedures for variances and the protection of employees from hazards. It further, provides employer and employee representatives an opportunity to accompany inspectors and call attention to possible violations before, during and after inspections, protection of employees against discharge or discrimination in terms and conditions of employment, notice to employees or their representatives when no compliance action is taken upon complaints, including informal review, notice to employees of their protections and obligations, adequate safeguards to protect trade secrets, prompt notice to employers and employees of alleged violations of standards and abatement requirements, effective remedies against employers, and the right to review alleged violations, abatement periods, and proposed penalties with opportunity for employee participation in the review proceeding, procedures for prompt restraint or elimination of imminent danger conditions, provision for the issuance of cease operation orders in cases where employers fail to comply with final orders for abatement, and provision for inspections in response to complaints.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The State intends to promulgate standards for all of the issues contained in 29 CFR parts 1910 and 1926 with the exception of Ship Repairing (Sec. 1910.13), Shipbuilding (Sec. 1910.14), Shipbreaking (Sec. 1910.15) and Longshoring (Sec. 1910.16), which standards are to be as effective as Federal standards. Michigan had originally not intended to promulgate a standard covering cooperage machinery comparable to 29 CFR 1910.214, but it has now provided assurances that it will promulgate such standard if the hazards covered by the Federal cooperage standard are found to exist in Michigan. The State has already promulgated standards as effective as subparts F, K, M, Q and S and the remaining subparts are to be covered by State standards which are to be promulgated by June 1975.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Plan includes a statement of the Governor's support for the proposed legislation and a statement of legal opinion that it will meet the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, and is consistent with the Constitution and laws of Michigan. The Plan sets out goals and provides a timetable for bringing it into full conformity with part 1902 of this title upon enactment of the proposed legislation by the State legislature. A merit system of personnel administration will be used. In addition,

health and safety education and training programs are to be carried on for the benefit of employers and employees. The Department of Labor will also be conducting a Safety Director Program wherein companies which are found to have high injury incident rates will be assisted in developing safety programs.
