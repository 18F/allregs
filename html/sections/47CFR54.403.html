                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The federal Lifeline support amount for all eligible  telecommunications carriers shall equal:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic support amount. Federal Lifeline support in the amount of  $9.25 per month will be made available to an eligible telecommunications  carrier providing Lifeline service to a qualifying low-income consumer,  if that carrier certifies to the Administrator that it will pass through  the full amount of support to the qualifying low-income consumer and  that it has received any non-federal regulatory approvals necessary to  implement the rate reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tribal lands support amount. Additional federal Lifeline support  of up to $25 per month will be made available to an eligible  telecommunications carrier providing Lifeline service to an eligible  resident of Tribal lands, as defined in Sec. 54.400 (e), to the extent  that the eligible telecommunications carrier certifies to the  Administrator that it will pass through the full Tribal lands support  amount to the qualifying eligible resident of Tribal lands and that it  has received any non-federal regulatory approvals necessary to implement  the required rate reduction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application of Lifeline discount amount. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Eligible  telecommunications carriers that charge federal End User Common Line  charges or equivalent federal charges must apply federal Lifeline  support to waive the federal End User Common Line charges for Lifeline  subscribers. Such carriers must apply any additional federal support  amount to a qualifying low-income consumer's intrastate rate, if the  carrier has received the non-federal regulatory approvals necessary to  implement the required rate reduction. Other eligible telecommunications  carriers must apply the federal Lifeline support amount, plus any  additional support amount, to reduce the cost of any generally available  residential service plan or package offered by such carriers that  provides voice telephony service as described in Sec. 54.101, and  charge Lifeline subscribers the resulting amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where a subscriber makes only a partial payment to an eligible  telecommunications carrier for a bundled service package, the eligible  telecommunications carrier must apply the partial payment first to the  allocated price of the voice telephony service component of the package  and then to the cost of any additional services included in the bundled  package.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Toll limitation service. An eligible telecommunications carrier  providing toll limitation service voluntarily elected by Lifeline  subscribers whose Lifeline plans would otherwise include a fee for  placing a toll call that would be in addition to the per month or per  billing cycle price of the subscriber's Lifeline service, shall, for  April 2012 Lifeline disbursements through December 2013 Lifeline  disbursements, receive support in an amount equal to the lesser of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The eligible telecommunications carrier's incremental cost of  providing either toll blocking services or toll control services to each  Lifeline subscriber who has selected such service; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following amounts for each Lifeline subscriber who has  selected toll blocking services or toll control services:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> $3.00 per month per subscriber during 2012; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> $2.00 per month per subscriber during 2013.
