The forms of discovery which a Judge can order under paragraph (a) of this section include requests for admissions, requests for production of documents, interrogatories, and depositions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitations. Discovery may be limited in accordance with the terms of a protective order (see Sec. 134.205). Further, privileged information and irrelevant issues or facts will not be subject to discovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disputes. If a dispute should arise between the parties over a particular discovery request, the party seeking discovery may file and serve a motion to compel discovery. Discovery may be opposed on the grounds of harassment, needless embarrassment, irrelevance, undue burden or expense, privilege, or confidentiality.
