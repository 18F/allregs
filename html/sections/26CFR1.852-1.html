See section 853(b)(1)(B) and paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.853-2 for amounts to be added to the dividends paid deduction, and section 855 and Sec. 1.855-1, relating to dividends paid after the close of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for taxable years of regulated investment companies beginning before March 1, 1958. The provisions of part I of subchapter M (including section 852(c)) are not applicable to a regulated investment company for a taxable year beginning before March 1, 1958, unless such company meets the requirements of section 852(a) and subparagraph (1) (i) and (ii) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Failure to qualify. If a regulated investment company does not meet the requirements of section 852(a) and paragraph (a)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section for the taxable year, it will, even though it may otherwise be classified as a regulated investment company, be

taxed in such year as an ordinary corporation and not as a regulated investment company. In such case, none of the provisions of part I of subchapter M (other than section 852(c) in the case of taxable years beginning after February 28, 1958) will be applicable to it. For the rules relating to the applicability of section 852(c), see Sec. 1.852-5.
