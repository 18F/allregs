                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preservatives and other substances not permitted in domestic  product under the regulations in this subchapter may be used in the  preparation and packing of product intended for export provided the  product (1) accords to the specifications or directions of the foreign  purchaser; (2) is not in conflict with the laws of the country to which  it is intended for export; and (3) is labeled on the outside container  to show that it is intended for export, and is otherwise labeled as  required by this subchapter for such export product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The preparation and packing of export product as provided for in  paragraph (a) of this section shall be done in a manner acceptable to  the inspector in charge so that the identity of the export product is  maintained conclusively and the preparation of domestic product is  adequately protected. The preservatives and other substances not  permitted in domestic product shall be stored in a room or compartment  separate from areas used to store other supplies and shall be held under  Program lock. Use of the preservatives or other substances shall be  under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The packing of all articles under paragraph (a) of this section  shall be conducted under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No article prepared or packed for export under paragraph (a) of  this section shall be sold or offered for sale for domestic use or  consumption, but unless exported shall be destroyed for food purposes  under the direct supervision of a Program employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The contents of the container of any article prepared or packed  for export under paragraph (a) of this section shall not be removed, in  whole or in part, from such container prior to exportation, except under  the supervision of a Program employee. If such contents are removed  prior to exportation, then the article shall be either repacked, in  accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section, or destroyed for food purposes under the direct supervision of  a Program employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Permission must be obtained from the Administrator before meats  packed in borax are shipped from one official establishment to another  or to an unofficial establishment for storage, except such meat prepared  for the account of Federal agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> At all times, the identity of meat to which borax has been added  shall be effectively maintained. In no case shall such meat, nor any  trimmings or fat derived from such meat, whether unwashed or washed, or  otherwise treated, be diverted to domestic use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Salt used for bulking meat previously packed in borax may not  again be used in an edible products department other than in connection  with the packing of meat in borax. Only metal equipment should be used  for handling such meat. Particularly effective cleansing will be  required if wooden equipment such as trucks, washing vats, etc., is  used. Boxes from which boraxed meat has been removed may be used for  repacking meat in borax, but their use as containers for other meat will  be dependent upon the effective removal of all traces of borax.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The following instructions pertain to export cured pork packed  in borax for the account of Federal agencies. The meat may be packed in  borax in a room in which there is borax-free meat, provided proper care  is taken to see that the borax-free meat is not affected by the borax.  Under the same condition, meat packed in borax may be received,  unpacked, defrosted, soaked, washed, smoked, and repacked in a room  where there is other meat. However, meat originally packed in borax  shall at all times be subject to the restrictions of meat so packed,  even though repacked without borax. After packing or repacking, borax  packed meat may be stored in a room with meat not packed in borax,  provided a reasonable degree of separation is maintained between the two  classes of product.
