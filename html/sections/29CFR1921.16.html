                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon the basis of and after due consideration of the whole  record, the Assistant Secretary shall render his decision, which shall  adopt, modify, or set aside the findings, conclusions, and order  contained in the decision of the hearing examiner, and shall include a  statement of the reasons or bases for the action taken. With respect to  the findings of fact, the Assistant Secretary shall upset only those  findings that are clearly erroneous. Copies of the decision and order  shall be served upon the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a final order of the Assistant Secretary issued pursuant to  Sec. 1921.13(c) or paragraph (a) of this section has been in force for  2 years or more, a party may file with the Assistant Secretary a  petition for modification or vacation of the order. Such petition must  be in writing, and must be based upon satisfactory compliance   with the order during the 24 months immediately preceding the filing  thereof and upon such changes in conditions and circumstances as to  demonstrate, if established, that a continuation of the order in full  force and effect is no longer required to assure satisfactory compliance  with the regulations under the order. Such changes in conditions and  circumstances as are relied upon must be expressly set forth together  with the reasons why petitioner believes relief is justified and the  precise nature of the relief sought. The petition may be supported by  affidavits as to matters of fact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If, after such investigation as the Assistant Secretary deems  appropriate, in his judgment sufficient cause has been shown to justify  the relief requested, he will enter an order granting relief. If in his  judgment, sufficient cause has not been shown he shall so notify  petitioner, who may then in writing request a hearing. Upon receipt of  such request the Assistant Secretary will refer the petition with its  supporting documents and the request to the Chief Hearing Examiner who  will assign the matter for a hearing to be held on not less than 10 days  notice at a time and place to be set by the hearing examiner. The Deputy  Solicitor of Labor may file a pleading and otherwise appear in  opposition to the petition. The hearing will be subject to all of the  provisions of Sec. Sec. 1921.9 through 1921.22.
