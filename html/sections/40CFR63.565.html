(1) Alternate test procedures to those described in this section may be used upon application to, and approval by, the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the owner or operator intends to demonstrate compliance by using an alternative to any test method specified, the owner or operator shall refrain from conducting the performance test until the Administrator approves the use of the alternative method when the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan (if review of the site-specific test plan is requested) or until after the alternative method is approved (see Sec. 63.7(f) of subpart A of this part). If the Administrator does not approve the site-specific test plan (if review is requested) or the use of the alternative method within 30 days before the test is scheduled to begin, the performance test dates specified in Sec. 63.563(b)(1) shall be extended such that the owner or operator shall conduct the performance test within 60 calendar days after the Administrator approves the site-specific test plan or after use of the alternative method is approved. Notwithstanding the requirements in the preceding two sentences, the owner or operator may proceed to conduct the performance test as required in this section (without the Administrator's prior approval of the site-specific test plan) if he/she subsequently chooses to use the specified testing and monitoring methods instead of an alternative.
