                            <p class="depth0">States use clearance patterns to project when funds are paid out,  given a known dollar amount and a known date of disbursement. A State  must ensure that clearance patterns meet the following standards:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A clearance pattern must be auditable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A clearance pattern must accurately represent the flow of  Federal funds under the Federal assistance programs to which it is  applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A clearance pattern must include seasonal or other periodic  variations in clearance activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A clearance pattern must be based on at least three consecutive  months of disbursement data, unless additional data is required to  accurately represent the flow of Federal funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a State uses statistical sampling to develop a clearance  pattern, the sample size must be sufficient to ensure a 96 percent  confidence interval no more than plus or minus 0.25 weighted days above  or below the estimated mean.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A clearance pattern must extend, at a minimum, until 99 percent  of the dollars in a disbursement have been paid out for Federal  assistance program purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> We and a State may agree to other procedures, such as estimates  to project when funds are paid out when the dollar amount and/or the  timing of disbursements are not known.</p>
