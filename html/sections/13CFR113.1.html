The purpose of this part is to reflect to the fullest extent possible the nondiscrimination policies of the Federal Government as expressed in the several statutes, Executive Orders, and messages of the President dealing with civil rights and equality of opportunity, and in the previous determination of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration that discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, marital status, handicap or national origin shall be prohibited, to the extent that it is not prohibited by part 112 of this chapter, to all recipients of financial assistance from SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In accordance with Pub. L. 94-239, 15 U.S.C. 1691, cited as the Equal Credit Act Amendments of 1976, it is unlawful for any recipient creditor to discriminate against any applicant, with respect to any aspect of a credit transaction because of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age: (Provided, the applicant has the capacity to contract), because all or part of the applicant's income derives from any public assistance program, or because the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is the intention of the Administrator that the prohibitions in this part supplement those in part 112 of this chapter, that the two parts be read in pari materia, and that the procedures established herein be harmonized to the maximum extent feasible with those established in part 112 of this chapter.</p>
