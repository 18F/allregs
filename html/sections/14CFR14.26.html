Such further proceedings  shall be held only when necessary for full and fair resolution of the  issues arising from the application and shall be conducted as promptly  as possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A request that the administrative law judge order further  proceedings under this section shall specifically identify the  information sought or the disputed issues and shall explain why the  additional proceedings are necessary to resolve the issues.
