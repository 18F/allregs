                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Catcher vessel requirements. A catcher vessel used to harvest CR  crab must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carry and use a VMS as described in paragraph (d) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Land all retained crab to an RCR operating under an approved  catch monitoring plan as described in paragraph (g) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Catcher/processor requirements. A catcher/processor used to  harvest CR crab must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Carry and use a VMS as described in paragraph (d) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Weigh all retained crab to be processed on board, in its raw  form, on a scale approved by NMFS as described in paragraph (e) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Land all retained crab not processed on board at an RCR;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Offload all CR crab product processed onboard at a shoreside  location in the United States accessible by road or regularly scheduled  air service; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Provide an approved observer platform scale and test weights  that meet the requirements in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> RCR requirements. An RCR must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that all CR crab landings are weighed on a scale approved  by the State in which the landing takes place.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that all crab landing and weighing be conducted as  specified in an approved crab monitoring plan as described in paragraph  (g) of this section, and that a copy of the crab monitoring plan is made  available to NMFS personnel or authorized officer upon demand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Vessel Monitoring System (VMS) requirements--(1) General  requirements. General VMS requirements concerning the approval and  installation of VMS components and the responsibilities of vessel owners  and operators are detailed at Sec. 679.28(f)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> through (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> VMS transmission requirements. A vessel's transmitter must be  transmitting if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The vessel is operating in any reporting area (see definitions  at Sec. 679.2) off Alaska;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The vessel has crab pots or crab pot hauling equipment, or a  crab pot launcher onboard; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel has or is required to have a Federal crab vessel  permit for that crab fishing year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> At-sea scale tests. To verify that the scale meets the MPEs  specified in this paragraph, the vessel operator must test each scale or  scale system used to weigh CR crab one time during each 24-hour period  when use of the scale is required. The vessel owner must ensure that  these tests are performed in an accurate and timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Belt scales. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale tests is plus or  minus 3 percent of the known weight of the test material. The scale must  be tested by weighing at least 400 kg (882 lb) of crab or an alternative  material supplied by the scale manufacturer on the scale under test. The  known weight of the test material must be determined by weighing it on a  platform scale approved for use under Sec. 679.28 (b)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Automatic hopper scales. An automatic hopper scale must be  tested at its minimum and maximum capacity with approved test weights.  Test weights must be placed in the bottom of the hopper unless an  alternative testing method is approved by NMFS. The MPE for the daily  at-sea scale tests is plus or minus 2 percent of the weight of the  approved test weights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Platform scales used for observer sampling. A platform scale  used for observer sampling must be tested at 10, 25, and 50 kg (or 20,  50, and 100 lb if the scale is denominated in pounds) using approved  test weights. The MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus or minus  0.5 percent if the scale is used to determine the known weight of test  material for the purpose of testing a belt scale. If the scale is not  used for that purpose, the MPE for the daily at-sea scale test is plus  or minus 1 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Approved test weights. Each test weight must have its weight  stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of each  test weight must be annually certified by a National Institute of  Standards and Technology approved metrology laboratory or approved for  continued use by the NMFS authorized inspector at the time of the annual  scale inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Requirements for all scale tests. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Notify the observer at  least 15 minutes before the time that the test will be conducted, and  conduct the test while the observer is present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conduct the scale test and record the following information on  the at-sea scale test report form:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Vessel name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Month, day, and year of test;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Time test started to the nearest minute;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Known weight of test weights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Weight of test weights recorded by scale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Percent error as determined by subtracting the known weight of  the test weights from the weight recorded on the scale, dividing that  amount by the known weight of the test weights, and multiplying by 100;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Sea conditions at the time of the scale test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Maintain the test report form on board the vessel until the end  of the crab fishing year during which the tests were conducted, and make  the report forms available to observers, NMFS personnel, or an  authorized officer. In addition, the vessel owner must retain the scale  test report forms for 3 years after the end of the crab fishing year  during which the tests were performed. All scale test report forms must  be signed by the vessel operator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scale maintenance. The vessel owner must ensure that the vessel  operator maintains the scale in proper operating condition throughout  its use, that adjustments made to the scale are made so as to bring the  performance errors as close as practicable to a zero value, and that no  adjustment is made that will cause the scale to weigh inaccurately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Printed reports from the scale. The vessel owner must ensure  that the printed reports are provided as required by this paragraph.  Printed reports from the scale must be maintained on board the vessel  until the end of the year during which the reports were made and be made  available to NMFS or NMFS authorized personnel. In addition, the vessel  owner must retain printed reports for 3 years after the end of the year  during which the printouts were made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reports of catch weight and cumulative weight. Reports must be  printed at least once every 24 hours prior to submitting a CR crab  landing report as described in Sec. 680.5. Reports must also be printed  before any information stored in the scale computer memory is replaced.  Scale weights must not be adjusted by the scale operator to account for  the perceived weight of water, mud, debris, or other materials. Scale  printouts must show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The vessel name and Federal crab vessel permit number;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The weight of each load in the weighing cycle (hopper scales  only);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date and time the information was printed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The total amount weighed since the last printout was made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The total cumulative weight of all crab or other material  weighed on the scale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Printed report from the audit trail. The printed report must  include the information specified in sections 2.3.1.8, 3.3.1.7, and  4.3.1.8 of appendix A to 50 CFR part 679. The printed report must be  provided to the authorized scale inspector at each scale inspection and  must also be printed at any time upon request of NMFS staff or other  NMFS-authorized personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Platform scales used for observer sampling. A platform scale  used for observer sampling is not required to   produce a printed record unless that scale is also used to obtain raw  weight for a CR crab landing report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scale installation requirements. Unless otherwise approved by  NMFS, a scale used to obtain raw weight for a CR crab landing report  must be installed such that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> From the location where the observer samples unsorted crab, the  observer can ensure that all crab are being weighed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The scale may not be installed in a manner that facilitates  bypassing. It must not be possible for the scale inspector and an  assistant to bypass the scale with 100 kg (220 lb) of test material in  less than 20 seconds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Scales approved by the state. Scale requirements in this  paragraph are in addition to those requirements set forth by the State  in which the scale is approved, and nothing in this paragraph may be  construed to reduce or supersede the authority of the State to regulate,  test, or approve scales within the State. Scales used to weigh CR crab  that are also required to be approved by the State must meet the  following requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Verification of approval. The scale must display a valid State  sticker indicating that the scale was inspected and approved within the  previous 12 months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Visibility. An RCR must ensure that the scale and scale display  are visible simultaneously. NMFS personnel or NMFS authorized personnel,  including observers, must be allowed to observe the weighing of crab on  the scale and be allowed to read the scale display at all times.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Printed scale weights. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An RCR must ensure that printouts of  the scale weight of each delivery are made available to NMFS personnel  or to NMFS authorized personnel, including observers, at the time  printouts are generated. An RCR must maintain printouts on site until  the end of the fishing year during which the printouts were made and  make them available upon request by an authorized officer for 3 years  after the end of the fishing year during which the printout was made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A scale used to weigh any portion of a landing of CR crab must  produce a printed record for each landing, or portion of each landing,  weighed on that scale. The printed record must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The RCR's name;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The weight of each load in the weighing cycle;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The total weight of crab in each landing, or portion of the  landing that was weighed on that scale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The date and time the information is printed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The name and ADF&G; vessel registration number of the vessel  making the delivery. The scale operator may write this information on  the scale printout in ink at the time of landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Inseason scale testing. Scales used to weigh CR crab must be  tested by RCR personnel when testing is requested by NMFS-staff or by  NMFS-authorized personnel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inseason testing criteria. To pass an inseason test, NMFS staff  or NMFS-authorized personnel will verify that the scale display and  printed information are clear and easily read under all conditions of  normal operation, that weight values are visible on the display until  the value is printed, and that the scale does not exceed the maximum  permissible errors specified in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Maximum error</p><p class="depth0">Test load in scale divisions                   in scale</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> 0-500...............................................               1 (B) 501-2,000...........................................               2 (C) 2,001-4,000.........................................               3 (D) 4,000....................................               4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)(D)</em> of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Automatic hopper 0 to 150 kg (0 to 300 lb) capacity.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Minimum weighment or 10 kg (20 lb),     Minimum.</p><p class="depth0">whichever is greater.

An RCR must ensure that there are  sufficient test weights on-site to test each scale used to weigh CR  crab. Each test weight used for inseason scale testing must have its  weight stamped on or otherwise permanently affixed to it. The weight of  each test weight must be certified by a National Institute of Standards  and Technology approved metrology laboratory every 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other test material. When permitted in paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of  this section, a scale may be tested with test material other than  certified test weights.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)(5)</em> of this section.  An RCR that processes only CR crab harvested under a CPO or CPC IFQ  permit is not required to prepare a CMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> CMP Approval. NMFS will approve a CMP if it meets all the  performance standards specified in paragraph (g)(5) of this section. The  location or vessel identified in the CMP may be inspected by NMFS prior  to approval of the CMP to ensure that the location conforms to the  elements addressed in the CMP. If NMFS disapproves a CMP, the plant  owner or manager may resubmit a revised CMP or file an administrative  appeal as set forth under the administrative appeals procedures  described in Sec. 679.43.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inspection scheduling. The time and place of a CMP inspection  may be arranged by submitting a written request for an inspection to  NMFS, Alaska Region. An inspection must be requested no less than 10  working days before the requested inspection date. NMFS staff will  conduct CMP inspections in any port located in the United States that  can be reached by regularly scheduled commercial air service.
