                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Effect on other regulations. All regulations, orders, or like  directions heretofore issued by any officer of the Department which  impose requirements designed to prohibit any discrimination against  individuals on the ground of race, color, or national origin under any  program to which this regulation applies, and which authorize the  suspension or termination of or refusal to grant or to continue Federal  financial assistance to any applicant for or recipient of assistance for  failure to comply with such requirements, are hereby superseded to the  extent that such discrimination is prohibited by this regulation, except  that nothing in this regulation shall be deemed to relieve any person of  any obligation assumed or imposed under any such superseded regulation,  order, instruction, or like direction prior to the effective date of  this regulation. Nothing in this regulation, however, shall be deemed to  supersede any of the following (including future amendments thereof):  (1) The ``Standards for a Merit System of Personnel Administration,''  issued jointly by the Secretaries of Defense, of Health and Human  Services, and of Labor, 45 CFR part 70; (2) Executive Order 11063 and  regulations issued thereunder, or any other regulations or instructions,  insofar as such Order, regulations, or instructions prohibit  discrimination on the ground of race, color, or national origin in any  program or situation to which this regulation is inapplicable, or  prohibit discrimination on any other ground; or (3) requirements for  Emergency School Assistance as published in 35 FR 13442 and codified as  45 CFR part 181.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Forms and instructions. The responsible Department official  shall issue and promptly make available to interested persons forms and  detailed instructions and procedures for effectuating this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Supervision and coordination. The responsible Department  official may from time to time assign to officials of the Department, or  to officials of other departments or agencies of the Government with the  consent of such departments or agencies, responsibilities in connection  with the effectuation of the purposes of Title VI of the Act and this  regulation (other than responsibility for review as provided in Sec.  80.10(e)), including the achievements of effective coordination and  maximum uniformity within the Department and within the Executive Branch  of the Government in the application of Title VI and this regulation to  similar programs and in similar situations. Any action taken,  determination made, or requirement imposed by an official of another  Department or Agency acting pursuant to an assignment of responsibility  under this subsection shall have the same effect as though such action  had been taken by the responsible official of this Department.
