The notice will describe the manner in which the record will be disclosed. The appropriate Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel or the IG, as appropriate, will provide the record in the form or format requested if the record is readily reproducible in that form or format, provided the requester has agreed to pay and/or has paid any fees required by Sec. 2411.13 of this part. The appropriate Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel, or the IG, as appropriate, will determine on a case-by-case basis what constitutes a readily reproducible format. These offices will make a reasonable effort to maintain their records in commonly reproducible forms or formats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternatively, the appropriate Regional Director, the Freedom of Information Officer of the General Counsel, the Solicitor of the Authority, the Executive Director of the Panel, or the IG, as appropriate, may make a copy of the releasable portions of the record available to the requester for inspection at a reasonable time and place. The procedure for such an inspection will not unreasonably disrupt the operations of the office.</p>
