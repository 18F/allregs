                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Where a distribution made after the close of the taxable year is considered as paid during such taxable year, for purposes of applying section 562(a) the distribution shall be considered as made on the last day of such taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Personal holding company tax. In the case of a corporation which under the law applicable to the taxable year in respect of which a distribution is made under section 563(b) and Sec. 1.563-2 is a personal holding company under the law applicable to such taxable year, section 316(b)(2) provides that the term dividend means (in addition to the general rule under section 316(a)) any distribution to the extent of the corporation's undistributed personal holding company income (determined under section 545 without regard to distributions under section 316(b)(2)) for such year. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.316-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dividends paid on or before December 15, 1955. The Act of June 15, 1955 (Public Law 74, 84th Cong., 69 Stat. 136), repealed sections 452 and 462 of the Code, relating to prepaid income and reserve for estimated expenses. Under section 4(c)(4) of that Act, dividends paid after the 15th day of the third month following the close of the taxable year and on or before December 15, 1955, may be treated as having been paid on the last day of the taxable year for purposes of the accumulated earnings tax or the personal holding company tax and in the case of regulated investment companies, but only to the extent that such dividends are attributable to an increase in taxable income for the taxable year by reason of the repeal of sections 452 and 462. See paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.9000-8, relating to treatment of certain dividends, prescribed pursuant to section 4(c)(4) of the Act of June 15, 1955.</p>
