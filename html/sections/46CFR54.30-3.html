                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Large conventional pressure vessels used to transport liquefied  petroleum and natural gases, at ``low temperatures'' may often be  difficult to thermally stress relieve. Where no other problem, such as  corrosion exists, mechanical stress relief will be permitted for Class  II-L pressure vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Mechanical stress relief serves to cause small flaws,  particularly in the weld zone, to yield plastically at the flaw tip  resulting in a local relief of stress and a blunting of the crack tip.  To achieve the maximum benefit from mechanical stress relief, it is  necessary that the stresses so imposed be more severe than those  expected in normal service life. At the same time, it is necessary that  the stresses which are imposed are not so high as to result in  appreciable deformation or general yielding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> of section VIII of the ASME  Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code that permits omitting all radiography  does not apply. Spot examination shall follow UW-52 of section VIII of  the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and, in addition, these vessels  will be required to have radiographic examination of intersecting  circumferential and longitudinal joints for a distance of at least 20  times the plate thickness from the junction. See 46 CFR 54.25-8 on spot  radiography.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Severe cold forming will not be permitted unless thermal stress  relief is used. For example, parts of the vessels which are individually  cold formed, such as heads, must be thermally stress relieved, where the  extreme fiber strain measured at the surface exceeds 5 percent as  determined by:  Percent strain = (65t/Rf)[1-(Rf/Ro)]  where:  t = Plate thickness. Rf = Final radius. Ro = Original radius (equals infinity for flat plate).
