Such interest shall be charged at the rate of interest which  the United States Treasury charges CCC for funds, as of the date CCC  made such benefits available. Such interest shall accrue from the date  such benefits were made available to the date of repayment but the  interest rate shall increase to reflect any increase in the rate charged  to CCC by Treasury for any percent of time for which the interest  assessment is collected. CCC may waive the accrual of interest if CCC  determines that the cause of the erroneous determination was not due to  any action of the producer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Late payment interest shall be assessed on refunds in accordance  with the provisions of, and subject to the rates in part 1403 of this  chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Producers must refund to CCC any excess payments made by CCC  with respect to any application in which they have an interest. Such  refund shall be subject to interest at the same rate that applies to  other refunds.  [66 FR 13404, Mar. 6, 2001. Redesignated and amended at 74 FR 15656,  Apr. 7, 2009]</p>
