                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Calculation of commodity prices on a common basis. In testing whether the purchase price of a commodity exceeds the price in comparable export sales or in comparable domestic sales, as applicable under Sec. 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), it is necessary to insure that the price being tested as well as the prices being used as a test or measurement are calculated on the basis of delivery alongside or on board the vessel or other export conveyance. Such prices will include, therefore, in addition to the price of the commodity at an internal point in the source country, transportation from that point to the port of export in the source country, and to the extent not already included in the price at the internal point, inspection, export packing, forwarder's fees at customary rates, the cost of placing the commodities on board the vessel or export conveyance (unless this cost is covered in the export freight), and other necessary costs customary in the trade.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Calculation of commodity prices which involve transportation costs. (1) In testing the purchase price which includes transportation cost (customarily known as a c. & f. or c.i.f. price) for compliance with the requirements of Sec. 201.63 (a), (c), (d) and (e), USAID will subtract transportation cost as calculated by reference to the freight rate, for the type and flag of vessel on which the commodity was shipped, prevailing on the date the purchase price is fixed. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, the actual transportation cost paid by the supplier shall be presumed to be the transportation cost calculated in accordance with the formula contained in the foregoing sentence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In testing a purchase price involving transportation cost for compliance with Sec. 201.62 and Sec. 201.63(b), the test or measurement prices shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prices based upon transportation by a U.S.-flag vessel if the price tested involves transportation by such vessel; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prices based upon transportation by either a U.S.-flag or a foreign-flag vessel, whichever is lower, if the price tested involves transportation by a foreign-flag vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Calculation of amount eligible for financing when shipment is through or out of a free port or bonded warehouse. (1) When a shipment to a cooperating country has passed through a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum price described in Sec. 201.63(f)(1), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum price described in Sec. 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of Sec. 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D), and any transportation costs out of the free port or bonded warehouse on a vessel flying the flag of a country included in the authorized geographic code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When a shipment is f.o.b. or f.a.s. a free port or bonded warehouse, USAID will finance no more than the lower of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The maximum price described in Sec. 201.63(f)(2), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum price described in Sec. 201.63(f)(1)(i), plus any transportation costs into the free port or bonded warehouse which meet the requirements of Sec. 201.13(b)(1)(i)(D).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Determination of prevailing prices. In the determination of any prevailing market price of any commodity or any prevailing price or maximum eligible freight rate for a commodity related service, relevant published and unpublished price information will be considered.</p>
