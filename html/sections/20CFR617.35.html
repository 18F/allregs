A State agency shall promptly make and record  determinations necessary to assure entitlement of an individual to a job  search allowance at any time, before or after a certification covering  the individual is made. No job search allowance may be paid or advanced  to an individual until the State agency determines that the individual  is covered under a certification. A State agency shall make payment as  promptly as possible upon determining that the individual is covered  under a certification and is otherwise eligible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment. Unless paragraph (a) of this section applies, a job  search allowance shall be paid promptly after an individual completes a  job search and complies with paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Advances. A State agency may advance an individual (except an  individual not yet covered under a certification) 60 percent of the  estimated amount of the job search allowance payable on completion of  the job search, but not exceeding $360, within 5 days prior to  commencement of a job search. Such advance shall be deducted from any  payment under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Worker evidence. On completion of a job search, the individual  shall certify on forms furnished by the State agency as to employer  contacts made and amounts expended daily for lodging and meals. Receipts  shall be required for all lodging and purchased transportation expenses  incurred by the individual pursuant to the job search. An adjustment  shall be made if the amount of an advance is less or more than the  amount to which the individual is entitled under Sec. 617.34.</p>
