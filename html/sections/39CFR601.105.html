                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A person or organization wishing to have a continuing  business relationship with the Postal Service in purchasing matters is  expected to treat the Postal Service in the same manner as it would  other valued customers of similar size and importance. The Postal  Service reserves the right to decline to accept or consider proposals  from a person or organization when that person or organization fails to  meet reasonable business expectations or provide a high level of  confidence regarding quality, prompt service, and overall  professionalism.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Declining to accept or consider proposals. The Postal Service  may decline to accept or consider proposals when a person or  organization exhibits unacceptable conduct or business practices that do  not meet reasonable business expectations or does not provide a high  level of confidence about the entity's current or future business  relations. Unacceptable conduct or business practices include, but are  not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Marginal or dilatory contract performance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure to deliver on promises made in the course of dealings  with the Postal Service;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Providing false or misleading information regarding financial  condition, ability to perform, or other material matters, including any  aspect of performance on a contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engaging in other questionable or unprofessional conduct or  business practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice. If the Postal Service elects to decline to accept or  consider proposals from a person or organization, the vice president,  Supply Management, or his or her designee, will provide a written notice  to the person or organization by Certified Mail, return receipt  requested, explaining:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reasons for the decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The scope of the decision;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The period of time the decision will be in effect, (a matter at  the Postal Service's discretion consistent with the circumstances); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The supplier's right to contest the decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Contesting Decisions. If a person or organization believes the  decision not to accept or consider proposals is not merited, it may  contest the matter in accordance with Sec. 601.108. The Postal Service  may reconsider the matter and, if warranted, rescind or modify the  decision to decline to accept or consider proposals.    Sec. 601.106  [Reserved]</p>
