The following areas in each tank must not be shielded from direct impingement by large primary structural members or any other structural member determined to be equivalent to a large primary structural member by the Commandant when reviewing the plans submitted under Sec. 157.100 or Sec. 157.102:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 90 percent or more of the total horizontal area of the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tank bottom;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upper surfaces of large primary structural members; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upper surfaces of any other structural member determined to be equivalent to a large primary structural member by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 85 percent or more of the total vertical area of the tank sides and swash bulkheads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each cargo tank on a vessel having a COW system under Sec. 157.10a(a)(2) or Sec. 157.10c(b)(2) with complicated internal structural members does not have to meet paragraph (e) of this section if the following areas of each cargo tank are washed by direct impingement and the tank vessel can pass the inspections under Sec. 157.140:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> 90 percent or more of the total horizontal area of all the:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tank bottoms;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upper surfaces of large primary structural members; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upper surfaces of any other structural member determined to be equivalent to a large primary structural member by the Commandant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 85 percent or more of the total vertical area of all the tank sides and swash bulkheads.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each single nozzle COW machine that is mounted to the deck must have a means located outside of the cargo tank that indicates the arc and rotation of the movement of the COW machine during COW operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each multi-nozzle COW machine that is mounted to the deck must have a means located outside of the cargo tank that indicates the movement of the COW machine during COW operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Each COW machine mounted to or close to the bottom of a tank without a means located outside of the cargo tank that indicates movement of the machine must not be programmable.</p><p class="depth2">Notes: 1.
