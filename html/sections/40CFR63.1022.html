Except for inaccessible, ceramic, or ceramic-lined connectors meeting the provision of Sec.  63.1027(e)(2) and instrumentation systems identified pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, identify the connectors subject to the requirements of this subpart. Connectors need not be individually identified if all connectors in a designated area or length of pipe subject to the provisions of this subpart are identified as a group, and the number of connectors subject is indicated. With respect to connectors, the identification shall be complete no later than the completion of the initial survey required by paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routed to a process or fuel gas system or equipped with a closed vent system and control device.

Identify the pressure relief devices equipped with rupture disks, under the provisions of Sec.  63.1030(e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Instrumentation systems. Identify instrumentation systems subject to the provisions of Sec.  63.1029 of this subpart. Individual components in an instrumentation system need not be identified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Equipment in service less than 300 hours per calendar year. The identity, either by list, location (area or group), or other method, of equipment in regulated material service less than 300 hours per calendar year within a process unit or affected facilities subject to

the provisions of this subpart shall be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Special equipment designations: Equipment that is unsafe or difficult-to-monitor--(1) Designation and criteria for unsafe-to-monitor. Valves meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1025(e)(1), pumps meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1026(e)(6), connectors meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1027(e)(1), and agitators meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1028(e)(7) may be designated unsafe-to-monitor if the owner or operator determines that monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with the monitoring requirements of this subpart. Examples of unsafe-to-monitor equipment include, but is not limited to, equipment under extreme pressure or heat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Designation and criteria for unsafe-to-monitor. Valves meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1025(e)(1), pumps meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1026(e)(6), connectors meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1027(e)(1), and agitators meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1028(e)(7) may be designated unsafe-to-monitor if the owner or operator determines that monitoring personnel would be exposed to an immediate danger as a consequence of complying with the monitoring requirements of this subpart. Examples of unsafe-to-monitor equipment include, but is not limited to, equipment under extreme pressure or heat.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Designation and criteria for difficult-to-monitor. Valves meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1025(e)(2) may be designated difficult-to-monitor if the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(i) apply. Agitators meeting the provisions of Sec.  63.1028(e)(5) may be designated difficult-to-monitor if the provisions of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Valves. (A) The owner or operator of the valve determines that the valve cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a support surface or it is not accessible in a safe manner when it is in regulated material service; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The owner or operator of the valve determines that the valve cannot be monitored without elevating the monitoring personnel more than 2 meters (7 feet) above a support surface or it is not accessible in a safe manner when it is in regulated material service; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The process unit or affected facility within which the valve is located is an existing source, or the owner or operator designates less than 3 percent of the total number of valves in a new source as difficult-to-monitor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agitators.
