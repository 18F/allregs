                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Registration of leverage commodities. Each leverage commodity  upon which a leverage contract is offered for sale or purchase or is  sold or purchased by a particular leverage transaction merchant must be  separately registered with the Commission. Registration will be granted  only when the following conditions are, and continue to be, met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The person requesting registration of a leverage commodity is a  registered leverage transaction merchant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The commodity to be registered is a leverage commodity as  defined in Sec. 31.4(g);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There exists a widely accepted and broadly disseminated  commercial or retail cash price series for the commodity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The commodity can be readily purchased or sold in normal  commercial or retail channels by leverage customers making or taking  delivery on a leverage contract;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The terms and conditions of the leverage contracts based on the  leverage commodity are consistent with the Act and the regulations  thereunder, and are not contrary to the public interest; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The terms and conditions of the leverage contracts based on the  leverage commodity do not include substantial characteristics of other  interests, such as options, certificates of deposit, or other regulated  instruments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Application for registration. Applications to register leverage  commodities should be filed with the Commission at its Washington, DC  headquarters. Attn: Secretariat. Three copies of each such submission  should be filed. The Commission may return any application which does  not comply with the form and content requirements of this section. Each  applicant must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide evidence that the person applying for registration of  the leverage commodity is registered or has applied to the National  Futures Association for registration as a leverage transaction merchant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide an explanation of the distinguishing characteristics of  the leverage commodity for which registration is sought, including a  complete description of the cash market for the leverage commodity, and  for the spot, forward, and futures markets for the generic commodity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Specify a commercial or retail cash price series including  prevailing premiums or discounts governing cash market transactions in  the quantities specified by the leverage contract and justify the use of  such price series with respect to the particular leverage commodity for  which registration is sought;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide evidence and a complete evaluation of how the  distinguishing characteristics of the leverage commodity would be  expected to affect the ability of leverage customers electing to make or  take delivery of the commodity at an economic price in normal cash  market channels;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include a description of the commodity inspection and/or  certification procedures typically required for commercial or retail  sales of the specified commodity. Such description must be accompanied  by information regarding the availability of any normally required  certification or inspection service at the delivery points including  those of the leverage transaction merchant; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Include copies of all leverage contracts which are to be offered  by the leverage transaction merchant on the leverage commodity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Continuing registration of leverage commodities. A registered  leverage transaction merchant must submit to the Commission for its  review, at least forty-five (45) days before their effective date, any  proposed changes in the specifications of the leverage commodity and the  terms and conditions of the leverage contract from those submitted as  part of the registration application unless such contract specifically  provides that such terms and conditions are subject to change. Three  copies of each such submission must be furnished to the Commission at  its Washington, DC headquarters. Attn: Secretariat. The Commission may  return any submission which does not comply with the form and content  requirements of this section. Each such submission must, in the  following order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Explain how any such changes might affect the ability of  leverage customers to realize the leverage commodity's economic value  and how such amendments might affect the ability of leverage customers  making or taking delivery to buy or sell the leverage commodity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Explain the effect of such changes upon the continued  appropriateness of the commercial or retail cash price series submitted  pursuant to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, or, as an alternative,  submit a new price series and a justification of its use; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Indicate whether, if such changes are applied to existing  leverage commodities, there will be a change in the economic value of  such commodities and, if so, quantify the extent of such changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Authority to disapprove amendments. The Commission may  disapprove, alter, or amend changes to the distinguishing  characteristics of the registered leverage commodity, or to the terms  and conditions of the leverage contracts offered thereon, after  appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, when the Commission  determines that such a change is in violation of any of the provisions  of the Act or any of the regulations thereunder, or that it is necessary  or appropriate to ensure the financial solvency of leverage transactions  or prevent manipulation or fraud. Upon notification by the Commission of  its determination to disapprove, alter or amend such changes, the  proposed changes will not become effective pending a final determination  by the Commission to disapprove, alter, or amend such changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Authority to alter or amend specifications of the registered  leverage commodity or the terms and conditions of leverage contract. The  Commission may alter or amend specific distinguishing characteristics of  the registered leverage commodity or the terms and conditions of  leverage contracts after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing  when the Commission determines that, in light of intervening events,  such alterations or amendments would be necessary or appropriate to  ensure the financial solvency of leverage transactions or prevent  manipulation or fraud.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission hereby delegates to the Director of the  Division of Market Oversight until such time as the Commission orders  otherwise, all functions reserved to the Commission in paragraphs (b)  and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Director of the Division of Market Oversight may submit any  matter which has been delegated to the Director under paragraph (f)(1)  of this section to the Commission for its consideration.
