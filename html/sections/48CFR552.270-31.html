                            <p class="depth0">As prescribed in 570.703, insert the following clause:</p><p class="depth0">Prompt Payment (JUN 2011)</p><p class="depth0">The Government will make payments under the terms and conditions  specified in this clause. Payment shall be considered as being made on  the day a check is dated or an electronic funds transfer is made. All  days referred to in this clause are calendar days, unless otherwise  specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment due date--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rental payments. Rent shall be paid  monthly in arrears and   will be due on the first workday of each month, and only as provided for  by the lease.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the date for commencement of rent falls on the 15th day of  the month or earlier, the initial monthly rental payment under this  contract shall become due on the first workday of the month following  the month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When the date for commencement of rent falls after the 15th day  of the month, the initial monthly rental payment under this contract  shall become due on the first workday of the second month following the  month in which the commencement of the rent is effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other payments. The due date for making payments other than rent  shall be the later of the following two events:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The 30th day after the designated billing office has received a  proper invoice from the Contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The 30th day after Government acceptance of the work or  service. However, if the designated billing office fails to annotate the  invoice with the actual date of receipt, the invoice payment due date  shall be deemed to be the 30th day after the Contractor's invoice is  dated, provided a proper invoice is received and there is no  disagreement over quantity, quality, or Contractor compliance with  contract requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Invoice and inspection requirements for payments other than  rent. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contractor shall prepare and submit an invoice to the  designated billing office after completion of the work. A proper invoice  shall include the following items:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of the Contractor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Invoice date.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Lease number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Government's order number or other authorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Description, price, and quantity of work or services delivered.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Name and address of Contractor official to whom payment is to  be sent (must be the same as that in the remittance address in the lease  or the order).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Name (where practicable), title, phone number, and mailing  address of person to be notified in the event of a defective invoice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Government will inspect and determine the acceptability of  the work performed or services delivered within seven days after the  receipt of a proper invoice or notification of completion of the work or  services unless a different period is specified at the time the order is  placed. If actual acceptance occurs later, for the purpose of  determining the payment due date and calculation of interest, acceptance  will be deemed to occur on the last day of the seven day inspection  period. If the work or service is rejected for failure to conform to the  technical requirements of the contract, the seven days will be counted  beginning with receipt of a new invoice or notification. In either case,  the Contractor is not entitled to any payment or interest unless actual  acceptance by the Government occurs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Interest Penalty. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An interest penalty shall be paid  automatically by the Government, without request from the Contractor, if  payment is not made by the due date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The interest penalty shall be at the rate established by the  Secretary of the Treasury under Section 12 of the Contract Disputes Act  of 1978 (41 U.S.C. 611) that is in effect on the day after the due date.  This rate is referred to as the ``Renegotiation Board Interest Rate,''  and it is published in the Federal Register semiannually on or about  January 1 and July 1. The interest penalty shall accrue daily on the  payment amount approved by the Government and be compounded in 30-day  increments inclusive from the first day after the due date through the  payment date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interest penalties will not continue to accrue after the filing  of a claim for such penalties under the clause at 52.233-1, Disputes, or  for more than one year. Interest penalties of less than $1.00 need not  be paid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Interest penalties are not required on payment delays due to  disagreement between the Government and Contractor over the payment  amount or other issues involving contract compliance or on amounts  temporarily withheld or retained in accordance with the terms of the  contract. Claims involving disputes, and any interest that may be  payable, will be resolved in accordance with the clause at 52.233-1,  Disputes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Overpayments. If the Lessor becomes aware of a duplicate payment  or that the Government has otherwise overpaid on a payment, the  Contractor shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Return the overpayment amount to the payment office cited in the  contract along with a description of the overpayment including the--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Circumstances of the overpayment (e.g., duplicate payment,  erroneous payment, liquidation errors, date(s) of overpayment);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Affected lease number;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Affected lease line item or subline item, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Lessor point of contact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide a copy of the remittance and supporting documentation to  the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth3">(End of clause)</p><p class="depth3">Alternate I (SEP 1999). If Alternate I is used, subparagraph (a)(1)  of the basic clause should be designated as paragraph (a) and  subparagraph (a)(2) and paragraph (b) should be deleted. Paragraph (c)  of the basic clause should be redesignated as (b).  [76 FR 30847, May 27, 2011]</p>
