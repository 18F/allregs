                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. An FDIC-supervised institution may calculate its risk-weighted asset amount for equity exposures using the IMA by modeling publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section) or by modeling only publicly traded equity exposures (in accordance with paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualifying criteria. To qualify to use the IMA to calculate risk-weighted assets for equity exposures, an FDIC-supervised institution must receive prior written approval from the FDIC. To receive such approval, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate to the FDIC's satisfaction that the FDIC-supervised institution meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution must have one or more models that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Assess the potential decline in value of its modeled equity exposures;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Are commensurate with the size, complexity, and composition of the

FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Adequately capture both general market risk and idiosyncratic risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution's model must produce an estimate of potential losses for its modeled equity exposures that is no less than the estimate of potential losses produced by a VaR methodology employing a 99th percentile one-tailed confidence interval of the distribution of quarterly returns for a benchmark portfolio of equity exposures comparable to the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures using a long-term sample period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of risk factors and exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification in the FDIC-supervised institution's model and benchmarking exercise must be sufficient to provide confidence in the accuracy and robustness of the FDIC-supervised institution's estimates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution's model and benchmarking process must incorporate data that are relevant in representing the risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures, and must include data from at least one equity market cycle containing adverse market movements relevant to the risk profile of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures. In addition, the FDIC-supervised institution's benchmarking exercise must be based on daily market prices for the benchmark portfolio. If the FDIC-supervised institution's model uses a scenario methodology, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate that the model produces a conservative estimate of potential losses on the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures over a relevant long-term market cycle. If the FDIC-supervised institution employs risk factor models, the FDIC-supervised institution must demonstrate through empirical analysis the appropriateness of the risk factors used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The FDIC-supervised institution must be able to demonstrate, using theoretical arguments and empirical evidence, that any proxies used in the modeling process are comparable to the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures and that the FDIC-supervised institution has made appropriate adjustments for differences. The FDIC-supervised institution must derive any proxies for its modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio using historical market data that are relevant to the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures and benchmark portfolio (or, where not, must use appropriately adjusted data), and such proxies must be robust estimates of the risk of the FDIC-supervised institution's modeled equity exposures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Risk-weighted assets calculation for an FDIC-supervised institution using the IMA for publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures. If an FDIC-supervised institution models publicly traded and non-publicly traded equity exposures, the FDIC-supervised institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under Sec. 324.152) and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under Sec. 324.154); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The greater of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The estimate of potential losses on the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (c)(1) of this section) generated by the FDIC-supervised institution's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the FDIC-supervised institution's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> 300 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures that are not publicly traded,

do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Risk-weighted assets calculation for an FDIC-supervised institution using the IMA only for publicly traded equity exposures. If an FDIC-supervised institution models only publicly traded equity exposures, the FDIC-supervised institution's aggregate risk-weighted asset amount for its equity exposures is equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The risk-weighted asset amount of each equity exposure that qualifies for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under Sec. Sec. 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i) (as determined under Sec. 324.152), each equity exposure that qualifies for a 400 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(5) or a 600 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(6) (as determined under Sec. 324.152), and each equity exposure to an investment fund (as determined under Sec. 324.154); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The greater of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The estimate of potential losses on the FDIC-supervised institution's equity exposures (other than equity exposures referenced in paragraph (d)(1) of this section) generated by the FDIC-supervised institution's internal equity exposure model multiplied by 12.5; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate adjusted carrying value of the FDIC-supervised institution's publicly traded equity exposures that do not belong to a hedge pair, do not qualify for a 0 percent, 20 percent, or 100 percent risk weight under Sec. 324.152(b)(1) through (b)(3)(i), and are not equity exposures to an investment fund; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 200 percent multiplied by the aggregate ineffective portion of all hedge pairs.</p>
