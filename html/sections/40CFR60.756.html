maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications, the following equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A temperature monitoring device equipped with a continuous recorder and having a minimum accuracy of 1 percent of the temperature being measured expressed in degrees Celsius or 0.5 degrees Celsius, whichever is greater. A temperature monitoring device is not required for boilers or process heaters with design heat input capacity equal to or greater than 44 megawatts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A device that records flow to or bypass of the control device. The owner or operator shall either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that shall record the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator seeking to comply with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii) using an open flare shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate according to the manufacturer's specifications the following equipment:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A heat sensing device, such as an ultraviolet beam sensor or thermocouple, at the pilot light or the flame itself to indicate the continuous presence of a flame.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A device that records flow to or bypass of the flare. The owner or operator shall either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install, calibrate, and maintain a gas flow rate measuring device that shall record the flow to the control device at least every 15 minutes; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Secure the bypass line valve in the closed position with a car-seal or a lock-and-key type configuration. A visual inspection of the seal or closure mechanism shall be performed at least once every month to ensure that the valve is maintained in the closed position and that the gas flow is not diverted through the bypass line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(iii) using a device other than an open flare or an enclosed combustor shall provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i)(B) describing the operation of the control device, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator shall review the information and either approve it, or request that additional information be submitted. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each owner or operator seeking to install a collection system that does not meet the specifications in Sec. 60.759 or seeking to monitor alternative parameters to those required by Sec. 60.753 through Sec. 60.756 shall provide information satisfactory to the Administrator as provided in Sec. 60.752(b)(2)(i) (B) and (C) describing the design and operation of the collection system, the operating parameters that would indicate proper performance, and appropriate monitoring procedures. The Administrator may specify additional appropriate monitoring procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each owner or operator seeking to demonstrate compliance with Sec. 60.755(c), shall monitor surface concentrations of methane according to the instrument specifications and procedures provided in Sec. 60.755(d). Any closed landfill that has no monitored exceedances of the operational standard in three consecutive quarterly monitoring periods may skip to annual monitoring. Any methane reading of 500 ppm or more above background detected during the annual monitoring returns the frequency for that landfill to quarterly monitoring.
