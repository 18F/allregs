                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For annuity computation purposes, the service of an employee who  retires on immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor entitled to  annuity is increased by the days of unused sick leave to his credit  under a formal leave system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An immediate annuity is one which begins to accrue not later  than 1 month after the employee is separated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A formal leave system is one which is provided by law or  regulation or operates under written rules specifying a group or class  of employees to which it applies and the rate at which sick leave is  earned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In general, 8 hours of unused sick leave increases total  services by 1 day. In cases where more or less than 8 hours of sick  leave would be charged for a day's absence, total service is increased  by the number of days in the period between the date of separation and  the date that the unused sick leave would have expired had the employee  used it (except that holidays falling within the period are treated as  work days, and no additional leave credit is earned for that period).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an employee's tour of duty changes from part time to full  time or full time to part time within 180 days before retirement, the  credit for unused sick leave is computed as though no change had  occurred.
