A denial of a motion to set aside a non-final default  order by the official who issued the order shall be treated as an  initial decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance  with the requirements of Sec. 12.401 of these rules. A grant of a  motion to set aside a non-final default order may be appealed only in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 12.309 of these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Default order final. A default order that has become final  pursuant to Sec. 12.22(c) shall not be set aside except upon a motion  filed and served by the defaulted party showing that he should be  relieved from the default order because of fraud perpetrated on a  decisionmaking official or the Commission, mistake, excusable neglect,  or because the order is void for want of jurisdiction. Such a motion  shall also show that, if the default order were set aside, there would  be a reasonable likelihood of success for his claim or defense on the  merits and that no party would be prejudiced thereby. Motions to set  aside a final default order for fraud, mistake, or excusable neglect  shall be filed within one year after the order was issued. All motions  to set aside default orders shall be decided, in the first instance, by  the official who issued the order. A denial of a motion to set aside a  default order that has become final shall be treated as an initial  decision, which may be appealed to the Commission in accordance with the  requirements of Sec. 12.401 of these rules. A grant of a motion to set  aside a final default order shall be treated as a non-final order which  may be appealed only in accordance with the requirements of Sec. 12.309  of these rules.</p>
