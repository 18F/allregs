                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A sworn claim under this subpart shall be filed in the form  prescribed in Exhibit No. 1 to this subpart. Three (3) copies of this  claim must be filed, together with the same number of copies of such  supporting documents as may be deemed necessary to establish the claim.  Copies of tariff pages need not be filed; reference to such tariffs or  to pertinent parts thereof will be sufficient. Supporting documents may  consist of affidavits, correspondence, bills of lading, paid freight  bills, export declarations, dock or wharf receipts, or of such other  documents as, in the judgment of the claimant, tend to establish the  claim. The Small Claims Officer may, if deemed necessary, request  additional documents or information from claimants. Claimant may attach  a memorandum, brief or other document containing discussion, argument,  or legal authority in support of its claim. If a claim filed under this  subpart involves any shipment which has been the subject of a previous  claim filed with the Commission, formally or informally, full reference  to such previous claim must be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Claims under this subpart shall be addressed to the Office of  the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission, Washington, DC 20573. Such  claims shall be accompanied by remittance of a $67 filing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each claim under this subpart will be acknowledged with a  reference to the Informal Docket Number assigned. The number shall  consist of a numeral(s) followed by capital ``I'' in parentheses. All  further correspondence pertaining to such claims must refer to the  assigned Informal Docket Number. If the documents filed fail to  establish a claim for which relief may be granted, the parties affected  will be so notified in writing. The claimant may thereafter, but only if  the period of limitation has not run, resubmit its claim with such  additional proof as may be necessary to establish the claim. In the  event a complaint has been amended because it failed to state a claim  upon which relief may be granted, it will be considered as a new  complaint.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A copy of each claim filed under this subpart, with attachments,  shall be served by the Secretary on the respondent named in the claim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Within twenty-five (25) days from the date of service of the  claim, the respondent shall serve upon the claimant and file with the  Commission its response to the claim, together with an indication, in  the form prescribed in Exhibit No. 2 to this subpart, as to whether the  informal procedure provided in this subpart is consented to. Failure of  the respondent to indicate refusal or consent in its response will be  conclusively deemed to indicate such consent. The response shall consist  of documents, arguments, legal authorities, or precedents, or any other  matters considered by the respondent to be a defense to the claim. The  Small Claims Officer may request the respondent to furnish such further  documents or information as deemed necessary, or he or she may require  the claimant to reply to the defenses raised by the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the respondent refuses to consent to the claim being  informally adjudicated pursuant to this subpart, the claim will be  considered a complaint under Sec. 502.311 and will be adjudicated under  subpart T of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Both parties shall promptly be served with the Small Claims  Officer's decision which shall state the basis upon which the decision  was made. Where appropriate, the Small Claims Officer may require that  the respondent publish notice in its tariff of the substance of the  decision. This decision shall be final, unless, within thirty (30) days  from the date of service of the decision, the Commission exercises its  discretionary right to review the decision. The Commission shall not, on  its own initiative, review any decision or order of dismissal unless  such review is   requested by an individual Commissioner. Any such request must be  transmitted to the Secretary within thirty (30) days after date of  service of the decision or order. Such request shall be sufficient to  bring the matter before the Commission for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Within thirty (30) days after service of a final decision by a  Small Claims Officer, any party may file a petition for reconsideration.  Such petition shall be directed to the Small Claims Officer and shall  act as a stay of the review period prescribed in paragraph (g) of this  section. A petition will be subject to summary rejection unless it: (1)  Specifies that there has been a change in material fact or in applicable  law, which change has occurred after issuance of the decision or order;  (2) identifies a substantive error in material fact contained in the  decision or order; (3) addresses a material matter in the Small Claims  Officer's decision upon which the petitioner has not previously had the  opportunity to comment. Petitions which merely elaborate upon or repeat  arguments made prior to the decision or order will not be received. Upon  issuance of a decision or order on reconsideration by the Small Claims  Officer, the review period prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section  will recommence.
