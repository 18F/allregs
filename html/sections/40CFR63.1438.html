                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring levels. The owner or  operator of a combustion, recovery, or recapture device that has one or  more parameter monitoring level requirements specified under this  subpart shall establish a maximum or minimum level for each measured  parameter. If a performance test is required by this subpart for a  combustion, recovery, or recapture device, the owner or operator shall  use the procedures in either paragraph (b) or (c) of this section to  establish the parameter monitoring level(s). If a performance test is  not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture  device, the owner or operator may use the procedures in paragraph (b),  (c), or (d) of this section to establish the parameter monitoring  levels. When using the procedures specified in paragraph (c) or (d) of  this section, the owner or operator shall submit the information  specified in Sec.  63.1439(e)(4)(viii) for review and approval, as part  of the Precompliance Report.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall operate combustion, recovery, and  recapture devices such that the daily average value of monitored  parameters remains at or above the minimum established level, or remains  at or below the maximum established level, except as otherwise provided  in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As specified in Sec.  63.1439(e)(5)(ii), all established levels,  along with their supporting documentation and the definition of an  operating day, shall be submitted as part of the Notification of  Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow a monitoring  parameter excursion caused by an activity that violates other applicable  provisions of 40 CFR part 63, subparts A, F, G, or H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> or (2) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Process vents from continuous unit operations. During initial  compliance testing, the appropriate parameter shall be continuously  monitored during   the required 1-hour runs for process vents from continuous unit  operations. The monitoring level(s) shall then be established as the  average of the maximum (or minimum) point values from the three 1-hour  test runs. The average of the maximum values shall be used when  establishing a maximum level, and the average of the minimum values  shall be used when establishing a minimum level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Process vents from batch unit operations. For process vents from  batch unit operations, during initial compliance testing, the  appropriate parameter shall be monitored continuously during the entire  test period. The monitoring level(s) shall be those established during  from the compliance test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> and (2) of this section shall  be provided in the Notification of Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The specific level of the monitored parameter(s) for each  emission point.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rationale for the specific level for each parameter for each  emission point, including any data and calculations used to develop the  level and a description of why the level indicates proper operation of  the combustion, recovery, or recapture device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Establishment of parameter monitoring based on engineering  assessments and/or manufacturer's recommendations. If a performance test  is not required by this subpart for a combustion, recovery, or recapture  device, the maximum or minimum level may be based solely on engineering  assessments and/or manufacturers' recommendations. As required in  paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the determined level and all  supporting documentation shall be provided in the Notification of  Compliance Status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em>, (ii), or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For each condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of  the emission limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each recovery or recapture device other than a condenser,  where an organic monitoring device is used to monitor concentration,  each excursion constitutes a violation of the emission limit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For each combustion, recovery, or recapture device other than  a condenser, each excursion constitutes a violation of the operating  limit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)(B)</em>, and (f)(3)(ii) of this section constitutes a  violation of the operating limit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> through  (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The daily average value of one or more monitored parameters is  above the maximum level or below the minimum level established for the  given parameters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device  operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this  section, is 4 hours or greater in an operating day and monitoring data  are insufficient, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section, to  constitute a valid hour of data for at least 75 percent of the operating  hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The period of combustion, recovery, or recapture device  operation, with the exception noted in paragraph (f)(1)(v) of this  section, is less than 4   hours in an operating day and more than 2 of the hours during the period  of operation do not constitute a valid hour of data due to insufficient  monitoring data, as defined in paragraph (f)(1)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Monitoring data are insufficient to constitute a valid hour of  data, as used in paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section, if  measured values are unavailable due to monitoring system breakdowns,  repairs, calibrated checks, or zero (low-level) and high level  adjustments, for any of the 15-minute periods within the hour. For data  compression systems approved under Sec.  63.1439(g)(3), monitoring data  are insufficient to calculate a valid hour of data if there are less  than four data measurements made during the hour.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Periods of non-operation of the affected source (or portion  thereof), resulting in cessation of the emissions to which the  monitoring applies, are not considered to be part of the period of  combustion, recovery, or recapture device operation, for the purposes of  paragraphs (f)(1)(ii) and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)(A)</em> or (B)  of this section is considered a single excursion for the combustion  device.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> When the average value of one or more parameters, averaged over  the time during which the storage vessel is being filled (i.e., when the  liquid level in the storage vessel is being raised), is above the  maximum level or below the minimum level established for the given  parameters.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> When monitoring data are insufficient. Monitoring data shall be  considered insufficient when measured values are not available, due to  monitoring system breakdowns, repairs, calibration checks, or zero (low- level) and high-level adjustments, for at least 75 percent of the  specific intervals at which parameters are to be monitored and recorded,  according to the storage vessel's monitoring plan, during which the  storage vessel is being filled.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the monitoring plan does not specify monitoring a parameter  and recording its value at specific intervals (for example, if the  relevant operating requirement is to exchange a disposable carbon  canister before expiration of its rated service life), the monitoring  plan shall define an excursion in terms of the relevant operating  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and  (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When the daily average value of one or more monitored parameters  is above the maximum or below the minimum established level for the  given parameters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> through (D) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Determine the total amount of time during the operating day when  batch emission episodes selected to be controlled are being vented to  the control device.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Subtract the time during the periods of non-operation of the  affected source (or portion thereof), resulting in cessation of the  emissions to which the monitoring applies, from the total amount of time  determined above in paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, to obtain  the operating time used to determine if monitoring data are  insufficient.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Determine the total number of 15-minute periods in the operating  time used to determine if monitoring data are insufficient, as was  determined in accordance with paragraph (f)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> If measured values are not available for at least 75 percent of  the total number of 15-minute periods determined in paragraph  (f)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, the monitoring data are insufficient for  the operating day.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> With respect to process vents using ECO to reduce epoxide  emissions, an excursion means any of the situations described in Sec.   63.1427(i)(3)(i) through (v). For each excursion, the owner or operator  shall be deemed out of compliance with the provisions of this subpart,  in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section.
