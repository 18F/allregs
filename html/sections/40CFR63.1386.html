(1) The owner or operator shall develop a written plan as described in Sec.  63.6(e)(3) that contains specific procedures to be followed for operating the source and maintaining the source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process modifications and control systems used to comply with the standards. In addition to the information required in Sec.  63.6(e)(3), the plan shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator shall develop a written plan as described in Sec.  63.6(e)(3) that contains specific procedures to be followed for operating the source and maintaining the source during periods of startup, shutdown, and malfunction and a program of corrective action for malfunctioning process modifications and control systems used to comply with the standards.
