                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part 48 are designated ``Manufacturers and  Retailers Excise Tax Regulations.'' The regulations relate to the excise  taxes imposed by chapter 31 and 32 of the Internal Revenue Code. Chapter  31 (relating to retail taxes) imposes tax on certain luxury items,  special fuels, fuel used in commercial transportation on inland  waterways, and heavy trucks and trailers. Chapter 32 (relating to  manufacturers taxes) imposes tax on gas guzzler automobiles, highway- type tires, taxable fuel, aviation fuel, coal, certain vaccines,  sporting goods, and taxable medical devices. Although chapter 32 also  imposes a tax on firearms, this tax is under the jurisdiction of the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms. See part 40 of this chapter  for regulations relating to returns, payments, and deposits of taxes  imposed by chapters 31 and 32 (other than the tax on firearms imposed by  section 4181).
