                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Act in section 2(b) provides in part as follows:</p><p class="depth2">The locator of a placer claim under this Act, however, shall conduct no mining operations for a period of sixty days after the filing of a notice of location pursuant to section 4 of this Act. If the Secretary of the Interior, within sixty days from the filing of the notice of location, notifies the locator by registered mail of the Secretary's intention to hold a public hearing to determine whether placer mining operations would substantially interfere with other uses of the land included within the placer claim, mining operations on that claim shall be further suspended until the Secretary has held the hearing and has issued an appropriate order. The order issued by the Secretary of the Interior shall provide for one of the following: (1) a complete prohibition of placer mining; (2) a permission to engage in placer mining upon the condition that the locator shall, following placer operations, restore the surface of the claim to the condition in which it was immediately prior to those operations; or (3) a general permission to engage in placer mining. No order by the Secretary with respect to such operations shall be valid unless a certified copy is filed in the same State or county office in which the locator's notice of location has been filed, in compliance with the United States mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of a notice of location of a placer claim filed in accordance with Sec. 3734.1 for land subject to location under the act, a determination will be made by the authorized officer of the Bureau of Land Management as to whether placer mining operations on the land may substantially interfere with other uses thereof. If it is determined that placer operations may substantially interfere with other uses, a notice of intention to hold a hearing will be sent to each of the locators by registered or certified mail within 60 days from date of filing of the location notice.
