                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requirement for filing. Documents relating to any matter pending before the Commissioners for decision or to any matter pending before the Commission which is likely to come before the Commissioners for decision, whether or not relating to proceedings governed by this part, must be filed with

the Secretary, Federal Maritime Commission. Such documents should not be filed with or separately submitted to the offices of individual Commissioners. Distribution to Commissioners and other agency personnel is handled by the Office of the Secretary to ensure that persons in decision-making and advisory positions receive identical copies of submissions in a uniform and impersonal manner and to avoid the possibility of ex parte communications within the meaning of Sec. 502.11. These considerations apply to informal and oral communications as well, such as requests for expedited consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Date and time of filing. (1) Documents may be hand-delivered at the Commission during normal business hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Documents may be hand-delivered at the Commission during normal business hours from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except with respect to initial filing of complaints pursuant to Sec.
