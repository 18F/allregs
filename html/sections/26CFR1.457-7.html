                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rules for when amounts are included in gross income. The  rules for determining when an amount deferred under an eligible plan is  includible in the gross income of a participant or beneficiary depend on  whether the plan is an eligible governmental plan or an eligible plan of  a tax-exempt entity. Paragraph (b) of this section sets forth the rules  for an eligible governmental plan. Paragraph (c) of this section sets  forth the rules for an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts included in gross income under an eligible governmental  plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amounts included in gross income in year paid under an  eligible governmental plan. Except as provided in paragraphs (b)(2) and  (3) of this section (or in Sec. 1.457-10(c) relating to payments to a  spouse or former spouse pursuant to a qualified domestic relations  order), amounts deferred under an eligible governmental plan are  includible in the gross income of a participant or beneficiary for the  taxable year in which paid to the participant or beneficiary under the  plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> from an eligible government plan is a distribution that  is subject to the distribution requirements of Sec. 1.457-6.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Amounts taxable under section 72(p)(1). In accordance with  section 72(p), the amount of any loan from an eligible governmental plan  to a participant or beneficiary (including any pledge or assignment  treated as a loan under section 72(p)(1)(B)) is treated as having been  received as a distribution from the plan under section 72(p)(1), except  to the extent set forth in section 72(p)(2) (relating to loans that do  not exceed a maximum amount and that are repayable in accordance with  certain terms) and Sec. 1.72(p)-1. Thus, except to the extent a loan  satisfies section 72(p)(2), any amount loaned from an eligible  governmental plan to a participant or beneficiary (including any pledge  or assignment treated as a loan under section 72(p)(1)(B)) is includible  in the gross income of the participant or beneficiary for the taxable  year in which the loan is made. See generally Sec. 1.72(p)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Eligible Plan G of a governmental entity  permits distribution of benefits in a single sum or in installments of  up to 20 years, with such benefits to commence at any date that is after  severance from employment (up to the later of severance from employment  or the plan's normal retirement age of 65). Effective for participants  who have a severance from employment after December 31, 2001, Plan X  allows an election--as to both the date on which payments are to begin  and the form in which payments are to be made--to be made by the  participant at any time that is before the commencement date selected.  However, Plan X chooses to require elections to be filed at least 30  days before the commencement date selected in order for Plan X to have  enough time to be able to effectuate the election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No amounts are included in gross income before  actual payments begin. If installment payments begin (and the  installment payments are payable over at least 10 years so as not to be  eligible rollover distributions), the amount included in gross income  for any year is equal to the amount of the installment payment paid  during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as in Example 1, except that the  same rules are extended to participants who had a severance from  employment before January 1, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For all participants (that is, both those who have  a severance from employment after December 31, 2001, and those who have  a severance from employment before January 1, 2002, including those  whose benefit payments have commenced before January 1, 2002), no  amounts are included in   gross income before actual payments begin. If installment payments begin  (and the installment payments are payable over at least 10 years so as  not to be eligible rollover distributions), the amount included in gross  income for any year is equal to the amount of the installment payment  paid during the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amounts included in gross income under an eligible plan of a  tax-exempt entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amounts included in gross income in year paid or  made available under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity. Amounts  deferred under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity are includible in  the gross income of a participant or beneficiary for the taxable year in  which paid or otherwise made available to the participant or beneficiary  under the plan. Thus, amounts deferred under an eligible plan of a tax- exempt entity are includible in the gross income of the participant or  beneficiary in the year the amounts are first made available under the  terms of the plan, even if the plan has not distributed the amounts  deferred. Amounts deferred under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity  are not considered made available to the participant or beneficiary  solely because the participant or beneficiary is permitted to choose  among various investments under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When amounts deferred are considered to be made available under  an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Except as  provided in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section, amounts  deferred under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity are considered  made available (and, thus, are includible in the gross income of the  participant or beneficiary under this paragraph (c)) at the earliest  date, on or after severance from employment, on which the plan allows  distributions to commence, but in no event later than the date on which  distributions must commence pursuant to section 401(a)(9). For example,  in the case of a plan that permits distribution to commence on the date  that is 60 days after the close of the plan year in which the  participant has a severance from employment with the eligible employer,  amounts deferred are considered to be made available on that date.  However, distributions deferred in accordance with paragraphs (c)(2)(ii)  through (iv) of this section are not considered made available prior to  the applicable date under paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this  section. In addition, no portion of a participant or beneficiary's  account is treated as made available (and thus currently includible in  income) under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity merely because the  participant or beneficiary under the plan may elect to receive a  distribution in any of the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A distribution in the event of an unforeseeable emergency to the  extent the distribution is permitted under Sec. 1.457-6(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A distribution from an account for which the total amount  deferred is not in excess of the dollar limit under section  411(a)(11)(A) to the extent the distribution is permitted under  Sec. 1.457-6(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initial election to defer commencement of distributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In  general. An eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity may provide a period  for making an initial election during which the participant or  beneficiary may elect, in accordance with the terms of the plan, to  defer the payment of some or all of the amounts deferred to a fixed or  determinable future time. The period for making this initial election  must expire prior to the first time that any such amounts would be  considered made available under the plan under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Failure to make initial election to defer commencement of  distributions. Generally, if no initial election is made by a  participant or beneficiary under this paragraph (c)(2)(ii), then the  amounts deferred under an eligible plan of a tax-exempt entity are  considered made available and taxable to the participant or beneficiary  in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section at the earliest  time, on or after severance from employment (but in no event later than  the date on which distributions must commence pursuant to section  401(a)(9)), that distribution is permitted to commence under the terms  of the plan. However, the plan may provide for a default payment  schedule that applies if no election is made. If the plan provides for a  default payment schedule, the amounts deferred are includible in the  gross income of the participant or beneficiary   in the year the amounts deferred are first made available under the  terms of the default payment schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>. A participant or beneficiary is not precluded  from making an additional election to defer commencement of  distributions merely because the participant or beneficiary has  previously received a distribution under Sec. 1.457-6(c) because of an  unforeseeable emergency, has received a distribution of smaller amounts  under Sec. 1.457-6(e), has made (and revoked) other deferral or method  of payment elections within the initial election period, or is subject  to a default payment schedule under which the commencement of benefits  is deferred (for example, until a participant is age 65).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Election as to method of payment. An eligible plan of a tax- exempt entity may provide that an election as to the method of payment  under the plan may be made at any time prior to the time the amounts are  distributed in accordance with the participant or beneficiary's initial  or additional election to defer commencement of distributions under  paragraph (c)(2)(ii) or (iii) of this section. Where no method of  payment is elected, the entire amount deferred will be includible in the  gross income of the participant or beneficiary when the amounts first  become made available in accordance with a participant's initial or  additional elections to defer under paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (iii) of  this section, unless the eligible plan provides for a default method of  payment (in which case amounts are considered made available and taxable  when paid under the terms of the default payment schedule). A method of  payment means a distribution or a series of periodic distributions  commencing on a date determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(2)(ii)  or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Eligible Plan X of a tax-exempt entity  provides that a participant's total account balance, representing all  amounts deferred under the plan, is payable to a participant in a single  sum 60 days after severance from employment throughout these examples,  unless, during a 30-day period immediately following the severance, the  participant elects to receive the single sum payment at a later date  (that is not later than the plan's normal retirement age of 65) or  elects to receive distribution in 10 annual installments to begin 60  days after severance from employment (or at a later date, if so elected,  that is not later than the plan's normal retirement age of 65). On  November 13, 2004, K, a calendar year taxpayer, has a severance from  employment with the eligible employer. K does not, within the 30-day  window period, elect to postpone distributions to a later date or to  receive payment in 10 fixed annual installments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The single sum payment is payable to K 60 days  after the date K has a severance from employment (January 12, 2005), and  is includible in the gross income of K in 2005 under section 457(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The terms of eligible Plan X are the same as  described in Example 1. Participant L participates in eligible Plan X.  On November 11, 2003, L has a severance from the employment of the  eligible employer. On November 24, 2003, L makes an initial deferral  election not to receive the single-sum payment payable 60 days after the  severance, and instead elects to receive the amounts in 10 annual  installments to begin 60 days after severance from employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No portion of L's account is considered made  available in 2003 or 2004 before a payment is made and no amount is  includible in the gross income of L until distributions commence. The  annual installment payable in 2004 will be includible in L's gross  income in 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  that eligible Plan X also provides that those participants who are  receiving distributions in 10 annual installments may, at any time and  without restriction, elect to receive a cash out of all remaining  installments. Participant M elects   to receive a distribution in 10 annual installments commencing in 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. M's total account balance, representing the total  of the amounts deferred under the plan, is considered made available and  is includible in M's gross income in 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except  that, instead of providing for an unrestricted cashout of remaining  payments, the plan provides that participants or beneficiaries who are  receiving distributions in 10 annual installments may accelerate the  payment of the amount remaining payable to the participant upon the  occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency as described in Sec. 1.457- 6(c)(1) in an amount not exceeding that described in Sec. 1.457-6(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No amount is considered made available to  participant M on account of M's right to accelerate payments upon the  occurrence of an unforeseeable emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Eligible Plan Y of a tax-exempt entity  provides that distributions will commence 60 days after a participant's  severance from employment unless the participant elects, within a 30-day  window period following severance from employment, to defer  distributions to a later date (but no later than the year following the  calendar year the participant attains age 70\1/2\). The plan provides  that a participant who has elected to defer distributions to a later  date may make an election as to form of distribution at any time prior  to the 30th day before distributions are to commence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No amount is considered made available prior to the  date distributions are to commence by reason of a participant's right to  defer or make an election as to the form of distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except  that the plan also permits participants who have made an initial  election to defer distribution to make one additional deferral election  at any time prior to the date distributions are scheduled to commence.  Participant N has a severance from employment at age 50. The next day,  during the 30-day period provided in the plan, N elects to receive  distribution in the form of 10 annual installment payments beginning at  age 55. Two weeks later, within the 30-day window period, N makes a new  election permitted under the plan to receive 10 annual installment  payments beginning at age 60 (instead of age 55). When N is age 59, N  elects under the additional deferral election provisions, to defer  distributions until age 65.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this example, N's election to defer  distributions until age 65 is a valid election. The two elections N  makes during the 30-day window period are not additional deferral  elections described in paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section because  they are made before the first permissible payout date under the plan.  Therefore, the plan is not precluded from allowing N to make the  additional deferral election. However, N can make no further election to  defer distributions beyond age 65 (or accelerate distribution before age  65) because this additional deferral election can only be made once.
