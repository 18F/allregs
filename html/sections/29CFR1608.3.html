                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adverse effect. Title VII prohibits practices, procedures, or policies which have an adverse impact unless they are justified by business necessity. In addition, title VII proscribes practices which ``tend to deprive'' persons of equal employment opportunities. Employers, labor organizations and other persons subject to title VII may take affirmative action based on an analysis which reveals facts constituting actual or potential adverse impact, if such adverse impact is likely to result from existing or contemplated practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effects of prior discriminatory practices. Employers, labor organizations, or other persons subject to title VII may also take affirmative action to correct the effects of prior discriminatory practices. The effects of prior discriminatory practices can be initially identified by a comparison between the employer's work force, or a part thereof, and an appropriate segment of the labor force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limited labor pool. Because of historic restrictions by employers, labor organizations, and others, there are circumstances in which the available pool, particularly of qualified minorities and women, for employment or promotional opportunities is artificially limited. Employers, labor organizations, and other persons subject to

title VII may, and are encouraged to take affirmative action in such circumstances, including, but not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Training plans and programs, including on-the-job training, which emphasize providing minorities and women with the opportunity, skill, and expericence necessary to perform the functions of skilled trades, crafts, or professions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Extensive and focused recruiting activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elimination of the adverse impact caused by unvalidated selection criteria (see sections 3 and 6, Uniform Guidelines on Employee Selection Procedures (1978), 43 FR 30290; 38297; 38299 (August 25, 1978));</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Modification through collective bargaining where a labor organization represents employees, or unilaterally where one does not, of promotion and layoff procedures.</p>
