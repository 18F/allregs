To the best of my knowledge and belief, no conflict of interest  exists that may diminish my capacity to perform an impartial and  objective review of the offeror's proposal, or may otherwise result in a  biased opinion or an unfair advantage. If a potential conflict of  interest arises or if I identify such a conflict, I agree to notify the  Government promptly concerning the potential conflict. In determining  whether any potential conflict of interest exists, I agree to review  whether my or my employer's relationships with other persons or  entities, including, but not limited to, ownership of stocks, bonds,  other outstanding financial interests or commitments, employment  arrangements (past, present, or under consideration), and, to the extent  known by me, all financial interests and employment arrangements of my  spouse, minor children, and other members of my immediate household, may  place me in a position of conflict, real or apparent, with the  evaluation proceedings.</p><p class="depth2">2. I agree to use proposal information only for evaluation purposes.  I understand that any authorized restriction on disclosure placed upon  the proposal by the prospective contractor or subcontractor or by the  Government shall be applied to any reproduction or abstracted  information of the proposal. I agree to use my best effort to safeguard  such information physically, and not to disclose the contents of, or  release any information relating to, the proposal(s) to anyone outside  of the Source Evaluation Board or other   panel assembled for this acquisition, the Contracting Officer, or other  individuals designated by the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth2">3.

Attach a copy of this Government notice to every reproduction or  abstract of the proposal. Any authorized restrictive notices which the  submitter places on this proposal shall be strictly complied with.  Disclosure of this proposal outside the Government for evaluation  purposes shall be made only to the extent authorized by, and in  accordance with, FAR 3.104-4, FAR 15.207, and AGAR 415.207.
