The Commandant will designate the barge  hull types to be used for carrying cargoes in order to insure that the  vessel is designed consistent with the degree and nature of the hazard  of the commodity carried.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For this purpose the barge hull types shall be as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Type I barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type I are those  designed to carry products which require the maximum preventive measures  to preclude the uncontrolled release of the cargo to the waterways and/ or atmosphere.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Type II barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type II are those  designed to carry products which require substantial preventive measures  to preclude uncontrolled release to the atmosphere, but whose  uncontrolled release to the waterways does not constitute a longlasting  public or operating personnel hazard, though local and temporary  pollution may occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Type III barge hull. Barge hulls classed as Type III are those  designed to carry products of sufficient hazard to require a moderate  degree of control.</p>
