                            <p class="depth0">For scheduled service in the areas set forth in Sec. 399.32(a),  certificated air carriers have the following fare flexibility in  addition to that set forth in Sec. 399.32:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> First class. Carriers may without restriction set the level of  first class fares.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Small aircraft. Carriers may without restriction set the level  of fares for service with aircraft designed to have a maximum passenger  capacity of 60 or fewer seats.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Through service and on-line connecting service. For through  service and on-line connecting service, carriers may set their fares up  to the sum of the local fares minus one tax-rounded coach ceiling  terminal charge for each local fare after the first, if that level is  higher than the ceiling set forth in Sec. 399.32(d). The Board will not  suspend such a fare on the ground that its level is unreasonable except  upon a clear showing of abuse of market power that   the Board does not expect to be corrected through marketplace forces.
