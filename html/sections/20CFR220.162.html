The report should include the name and address of the railroad or non-railroad employer, a description of the work and the amount of gross wages (before deductions) or the net income from self-employment (earnings after deducting business expenses).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employee reports. In addition to the requirement described in (a), a report of earnings over $400 a month must be made before the employee accepts a disability annuity (the annuity payment is issued and not returned) for the second month after the first month in which earnings are over $400. Along with the report, the employee must return the annuity payment for any month in which he or she earns over $400.</p>
