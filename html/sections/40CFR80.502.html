                                Sec. 80.502  What definitions apply for purposes of this subpart?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The definitions of Sec. 80.2 and the following additional definitions apply to this subpart I:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Entity means any refiner, importer, distributor, retailer or wholesale-purchaser consumer of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Facility means any place, or series of places, where an entity produces, imports, or maintains custody of any distillate fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from the time it is received to the time custody is transferred to another entity, except as described in paragraphs (b)(1) through (4) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where an entity maintains custody of a batch of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) from one place in the distribution system to another place (e.g., from a pipeline to a terminal), all owned by the same entity, both places combined are considered to be one single aggregated facility, except where an entity chooses to treat components of such an aggregated facility as separate facilities. The choice made to treat these places as separate facilities may not be changed by the entity during any applicable compliance period. Except as specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, where compliance requirements depend upon facility-type, the entire facility must comply with the requirements that apply to its components as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an aggregated facility includes a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to refineries.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If an aggregated facility includes a truck loading terminal but not a refinery, the entire facility must comply with the requirements applicable to truck loading terminals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Situations where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I produced by such refinery and distributed over the truck terminal rack must be included in refinery batches that may be based on shipments to a truck terminal rack tank or on the total volumes delivered to tanker trucks for a period not to exceed 1 calendar month per batch.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Where a refinery is aggregated with a truck loading terminal, diesel fuel or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I that were imported or produced by another refinery, and that are distributed through the refinery or truck terminal rack, must be treated as previously designated fuel for which the aggregated facility is responsible for all applicable balance and downgrade requirements under Sec. Sec. 80.527, 80.598, 80.599 and related recordkeeping and reporting requirements like any other distributor downstream from the refiner or importer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A refinery or import facility may not be aggregated with facilities that receive fuel from other refineries or import facilities, either directly or indirectly. For example, a refinery may not be aggregated with a terminal that receives any fuel from a common carrier pipeline. However, a refinery may

be aggregated with a pipeline and terminal that are owned by the same entity and which receive no fuel from any source other than the refinery. Likewise, a refinery may not be aggregated with a mobile facility that is also carrying another entity's fuel; it may however be aggregated with a mobile facility that does not receive fuel from any source other than the refinery. If a refinery or import facility is aggregated with other facilities, then the aggregated facility is treated as a refinery or import facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Retail outlets or wholesale purchaser consumers may not be aggregated with any other facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mobile components and mobile facilities. (i) Where an entity maintains custody of diesel fuel in one or more mobile components (e.g., rail, barge, shipping, or trucking operations), the mobile components may be aggregated as a single facility. Mobile components may also be aggregated with a facility from which they receive fuel or a facility to which they deliver fuel. However, mobile components may not be aggregated with both a facility from which they receive fuel and a facility to which they deliver fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where an entity maintains custody of diesel fuel in one or more mobile components (e.g., rail, barge, shipping, or trucking operations), the mobile components may be aggregated as a single facility. Mobile components may also be aggregated with a facility from which they receive fuel or a facility to which they deliver fuel. However, mobile components may not be aggregated with both a facility from which they receive fuel and a facility to which they deliver fuel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When an entity maintains title to, but not custody of, diesel fuel in one or more mobile components, the entity may treat the mobile component(s) as a facility under this paragraph (b), but only for the fuel to which the entity has title. In the event that title changes while a mobile component is in transport (but the fuel physically remains in the same mobile facility), the original entity that had title to the fuel continues to be responsible for the designate and track requirements until custody of the fuel is transferred from the mobile facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> An individual refinery or contiguous pipeline may not be subdivided into more than one facility. An individual terminal may not be subdivided into more than one facility unless approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Truck loading terminal means any facility that dyes NRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel, pays taxes on motor vehicle diesel fuel per IRS code (26 CFR part 48), or adds a fuel marker pursuant to Sec. 80.510 to heating oil and delivers diesel fuel or heating oil into trucks for delivery to retail or ultimate consumer locations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Batch means a quantity of diesel fuel (or other product subject to the requirements of this subpart I) which is homogeneous with regard to those properties that are specified for MVNRLM diesel fuel or ECA marine fuel under this subpart I, has the same designation under this subpart I (if applicable), and whose custody is transferred from one facility to another facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of aggregated facilities consisting of a refinery and a truck loading terminal, a batch may be defined by one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sum of the deliveries from the truck loading terminal rack to trucks for periods not to exceed 1 month;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each individual truck or truck compartment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For refineries with ``certification tanks'' where testing is performed and ``rack tanks'' that feed the truck loading terminal rack, each transfer from the certification tank to the rack tank. If this method of determining a batch is selected, it must be the sole method used and must be performed such that no double-counting or undercounting of volumes occurs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Downstream location means any point in the diesel fuel distribution system that is downstream of refineries and import facilities, for example, diesel fuel at facilities of distributors, carriers, retailers, kerosene blenders, and wholesale purchaser-consumers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Definition of PADD. For the purposes of this subpart only, the following definitions of PADDs apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following States are included in PADD I:
ConnecticutDelawareDistrict of ColumbiaFloridaGeorgiaMaineMarylandMassachusettsNew HampshireNew JerseyNew YorkNorth CarolinaPennsylvaniaRhode Island

An Emission Control Area (ECA), for the purposes of this subpart, means the ``ECA'' as defined in 40 CFR 1043.20 as well as ``ECA associated area'' as defined in 40 CFR 1043.20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Marine diesel engine. For the purposes of this subpart I only, marine diesel engine means a diesel engine installed on a Category 1 (C1) or Category 2 (C2) marine vessel.
