                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Traffic rules. Rules set forth under 36 CFR part 261 and this  section shall   apply to all National Forest System roads under the jurisdiction of the  Forest Service except when in conflict with written agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Traffic on roads is subject to State traffic laws where  applicable except when in conflict with designations established under  subpart B of this part or with the rules at 36 CFR part 261.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Specific. The following specific traffic rules shall apply  unless different rules are established in 36 CFR part 261.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The load, weight, length, height, and width limitations of  vehicles shall be in accordance with the laws of the States wherein the  road is located. Greater or lesser limits may be imposed and these  greater or lesser limits shall be established as provided in 36 CFR part  261.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Roads, or segments thereof, may be restricted to use by certain  classes of vehicles or types of traffic as provided in 36 CFR part 261.  Classes of vehicles may include but are not limited to distinguishable  groupings such as passenger cars, buses, trucks, motorcycles, all- terrain vehicles, 4-wheel drive vehicles, off-highway vehicles, and  trailers. Types of traffic may include but are not limited to groupings  such as commercial hauling, recreation, and administrative.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Roads, or segments thereof, may be closed to all vehicle use  as provided in 36 CFR part 261.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Additional rules may be imposed as provided in 36 CFR part 261.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Road system--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of road system. For each  national forest, national grassland, experimental forest, and any other  units of the National Forest System (Sec. 212.1), the responsible  official must identify the minimum road system needed for safe and  efficient travel and for administration, utilization, and protection of  National Forest System lands. In determining the minimum road system,  the responsible official must incorporate a science-based roads analysis  at the appropriate scale and, to the degree practicable, involve a broad  spectrum of interested and affected citizens, other state and federal  agencies, and tribal governments. The minimum system is the road system  determined to be needed to meet resource and other management objectives  adopted in the relevant land and resource management plan (36 CFR part  219), to meet applicable statutory and regulatory requirements, to  reflect long-term funding expectations, to ensure that the identified  system minimizes adverse environmental impacts associated with road  construction, reconstruction, decommissioning, and maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification of unneeded roads. Responsible officials must  review the road system on each National Forest and Grassland and  identify the roads on lands under Forest Service jurisdiction that are  no longer needed to meet forest resource management objectives and that,  therefore, should be decommissioned or considered for other uses, such  as for trails. Decommissioning roads involves restoring roads to a more  natural state. Activities used to decommission a road include, but are  not limited to, the following: reestablishing former drainage patterns,  stabilizing slopes, restoring vegetation, blocking the entrance to the  road, installing water bars, removing culverts, reestablishing drainage- ways, removing unstable fills, pulling back road shoulders, scattering  slash on the roadbed, completely eliminating the roadbed by restoring  natural contours and slopes, or other methods designed to meet the  specific conditions associated with the unneeded road. Forest officials  should give priority to decommissioning those unneeded roads that pose  the greatest risk to public safety or to environmental degradation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost recovery on National Forest System roads. The Chief may  determine that a share of the cost of acquisition, construction,  reconstruction, improvement, or maintenance of a road, or segment  thereof, used or to be used for commercial hauling of non-Federal  forests products and other non-Federal products, commodities and  materials, should be borne by the owners or haulers thereof. The Chief  may condition the permission to use a road, or segment thereof, upon  payment to the United States of the proportionate share of the cost and  bearing proportionate maintenance as determined to be attributable to  the owner's or hauler's use in accordance with Sec. 212.9. This   condition to use roads would apply where the owners or haulers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have not shared in the cost of acquisition, construction,  reconstruction, or improvements, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Have not made contributions to pay their proportionate share of  the costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Maintenance and reconstruction of National Forest System roads  by users--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintenance. The Chief may require, but not in conflict  with an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the  user or users of a road, including purchasers of Government timber and  other products, to maintain the roads in a satisfactory condition  commensurate with the particular use requirements of each. The  maintenance to be borne by each user shall be proportionate to total use  and no individual user shall be required to perform or bear the costs of  maintenance other than that commensurate with his use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reconstruction. The Chief may require, but not in conflict with  an existing permit, easement, contract, or other agreement, the user or  users of a road to reconstruct it when, at the time the use is  requested, reconstruction is determined to be necessary to accommodate  his use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deposits in lieu of performance. If the maintenance or  reconstruction cannot be so provided or if the Chief determines that  maintenance or reconstruction by a user would not be practical, the  Chief may require that sufficient funds be deposited by the user to  provide his portion of the total maintenance or reconstruction costs.  Deposits made to cover maintenance or reconstruction of roads shall be  used for the purposes deposited, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Deposits received for work on adjacent and overlapping areas may  be combined when it is the most practicable and efficient manner of  performing the work, and cost thereof may be determined by estimates,  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unexpended balances upon accomplishment of the purposes for  which deposited shall be transferred to miscellaneous receipts or  refunded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Deposits for making delayed payments to cooperator. Any fees or  other collections received by the Chief under the terms of an agreement  or other document providing for delayed payments to the Government's  cooperator for use of a road shall be placed in a fund available for  making these payments.
