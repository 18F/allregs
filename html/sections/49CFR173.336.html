UN tubes and MEGCs are not authorized for  use. Cylinders must be equipped with a stainless steel valve and valve  seat that will not deteriorate in contact with nitrogen dioxide. Each  valve opening must be closed by a solid metal plug with tapered thread  properly luted to prevent leakage. Transportation in DOT 3AL cylinders  is authorized only by highway and rail.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each UN pressure receptacle must be cleaned in accordance with  the requirements of ISO 11621 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).  Each DOT specification cylinder must be cleaned according to the  requirements of GSA Federal Specification RR-C-901D, paragraphs 3.3.1  and 3.3.2 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter). Cleaning agents  equivalent to those specified in RR-C-901D may be used; however, any  cleaning agent must not be capable of reacting with oxygen. One cylinder  selected at random from a group of 200 or fewer and cleaned at the same  time must be tested for oil contamination in accordance with  Specification RR-C-901D, paragraph 4.3.2 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this  subchapter) and meet the standard of cleanliness specified therein.
