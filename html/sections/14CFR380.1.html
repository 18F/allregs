This part also relieves such  charter operators from various provisions of subtitle VII of Title 49 of  the United   States Code (statute), formerly Title IV of the Federal Aviation Act of  1958, as amended, for the purpose of enabling them to provide Public  Charters utilizing aircraft chartered from such direct air carriers. It  also declines jurisdiction over foreign Public Charter operators  operating foreign-originating Public Charters.</p>
