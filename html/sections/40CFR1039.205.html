We may require you to provide additional information to  evaluate your application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Describe the engine family's specifications and other basic  parameters of the engine's design and emission controls. List the fuel  type on which your engines are designed to operate (for example, ultra  low-sulfur diesel fuel). List each distinguishable engine configuration  in the engine family. For each engine configuration, list the maximum  engine power and the range of values for maximum engine power resulting  from production tolerances, as described in Sec.  1039.140.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>, treat as separate AECDs any devices that modulate or  activate differently from each other. Include all the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Give a general overview of the engine, the emission-control  strategies, and all AECDs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe each AECD's general purpose and function.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identify the parameters that each AECD senses (including  measuring, estimating, calculating, or empirically deriving the values).  Include equipment-based parameters and state whether you simulate them  during testing with the applicable procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Describe the purpose for sensing each parameter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify the location of each sensor the AECD uses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Identify the threshold values for the sensed parameters that  activate the AECD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Describe the parameters that the AECD modulates (controls) in  response to any sensed parameters, including the range of modulation for  each parameter, the relationship between the sensed parameters and the  controlled parameters and how the modulation achieves the AECD's stated  purpose. Use graphs and tables, as necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Describe each AECD's specific calibration details. This may be  in the form of data tables, graphical representations, or some other  description.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Describe the hierarchy among the AECDs when multiple AECDs sense  or modulate the same parameter. Describe whether the strategies interact  in a comparative or additive manner and identify which AECD takes  precedence in responding, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Explain the extent to which the AECD is included in the  applicable test procedures specified in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Do the following additional things for AECDs designed to  protect engines or equipment:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identify the engine and/or equipment design limits that make  protection necessary and describe any damage that would occur without  the AECD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Describe how each sensed parameter relates to the protected  components' design limits or those operating conditions that cause the  need for protection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Describe the relationship between the design limits/parameters  being protected and the parameters   sensed or calculated as surrogates for those design limits/parameters,  if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describe how the modulation by the AECD prevents engines and/or  equipment from exceeding design limits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Explain why it is necessary to estimate any parameters instead  of measuring them directly and describe how the AECD calculates the  estimated value, if applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Describe how you calibrate the AECD modulation to activate only  during conditions related to the stated need to protect components and  only as needed to sufficiently protect those components in a way that  minimizes the emission impact.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Describe the engines you selected for testing and the reasons  for selecting them.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Describe the test equipment and procedures that you used,  including any special or alternate test procedures you used (see Sec.   1039.501).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Describe how you operated the emission-data engine before  testing, including the duty cycle and the number of engine operating  hours used to stabilize emission levels. Explain why you selected the  method of service accumulation. Describe any scheduled maintenance you  did.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> List the specifications of the test fuel to show that it falls  within the required ranges we specify in 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Identify the engine family's useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Include the maintenance instructions you will give to the  ultimate purchaser of each new nonroad engine (see Sec.  1039.125).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Include the emission-related installation instructions you will  provide if someone else installs your engines in a piece of nonroad  equipment (see Sec.  1039.130).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Describe your emission control information label (see Sec.   1039.135).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Identify the emission standards or FELs to which you are  certifying engines in the engine family. Identify the ambient operating  regions that will apply for NTE testing under Sec.  1039.101(e)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Identify the engine family's deterioration factors and describe  how you developed them (see Sec.  1039.245). Present any emission test  data you used for this.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> State that you operated your emission-data engines as described  in the application (including the test procedures, test parameters, and  test fuels) to show you meet the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Present emission data for hydrocarbons (such as NMHC or THCE, as  applicable), NOX, PM, and CO on an emission-data engine to  show your engines meet the applicable duty-cycle emission standards we  specify in Sec.  1039.101. Show emission figures before and after  applying adjustment factors for regeneration and deterioration factors  for each engine. Include emission results for each mode if you do  discrete-mode testing under Sec.  1039.505. Present emission data to  show that you meet any applicable smoke standards we specify in Sec.   1039.105. If we specify more than one grade of any fuel type (for  example, high-sulfur and low-sulfur diesel fuel), you need to submit  test data only for one grade, unless the regulations of this part  specify otherwise for your engine. Note that Sec.  1039.235 allows you  to submit an application in certain cases without new emission data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> State that all the engines in the engine family comply with the  not-to-exceed emission standards we specify in subpart B of this part  for all normal operation and use when tested as specified in Sec.   1039.515. Describe any relevant testing, engineering analysis, or other  information in sufficient detail to support your statement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> For engines above 560 kW, include information showing how your  emission controls will function during normal in-use transient  operation. For example, this might include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Emission data from transient testing of engines using  measurement systems designed for measuring in-use emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Comparison of the engine design for controlling transient  emissions with that from engines for which you have emission data over  the transient duty cycle for certification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Detailed descriptions of control algorithms and other design  parameters for controlling transient emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Report test results as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Report all test results involving measurement of pollutants for  which emission standards apply. Include test results from invalid tests  or from any other tests, whether or not they were conducted according to  the test procedures of subpart F of this part. We may ask you to send  other information to confirm that your tests were valid under the  requirements of this part and 40 CFR part 1065.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report measured CO2, N2O, and  CH4 as described in Sec.  1039.235. Small-volume engine  manufacturers may omit reporting N2O and CH4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Describe all adjustable operating parameters (see Sec.   1039.115(e)), including production tolerances. Include the following in  your description of each parameter:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The nominal or recommended setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The intended physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The limits or stops used to establish adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Information showing why the limits, stops, or other means of  inhibiting adjustment are effective in preventing adjustment of  parameters on in-use engines to settings outside your intended  physically adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> Provide the information to read, record, and interpret all the  information broadcast by an engine's onboard computers and electronic  control units. State that, upon request, you will give us any hardware,  software, or tools we would need to do this. If you broadcast a  surrogate parameter for torque values, you must provide us what we need  to convert these into torque units. You may reference any appropriate  publicly released standards that define conventions for these messages  and parameters. Format your information consistent with publicly  released standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> Confirm that your emission-related installation instructions  specify how to ensure that sampling of exhaust emissions will be  possible after engines are installed in equipment and placed in service.  If this cannot be done by simply adding a 20-centimeter extension to the  exhaust pipe, show how to sample exhaust emissions in a way that  prevents diluting the exhaust sample with ambient air.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> State whether your certification is intended to include engines  used in stationary applications. State whether your certification is  limited for certain engines. If this is the case, describe how you will  prevent use of these engines in applications for which they are not  certified. This applies for engines such as the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Constant-speed engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Engines used for transportation refrigeration units that you  certify under the provisions of Sec.  1039.645.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Hand-startable engines certified under the provisions of Sec.   1039.101(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Engines above 560 KW that are not certified to emission  standards for generator-set engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(w)</em> Unconditionally certify that all the engines in the engine  family comply with the requirements of this part, other referenced parts  of the CFR, and the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(x)</em> Include good-faith estimates of U.S.-directed production  volumes.
