                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided by Sec. Sec. 2806.25 and 2806.26, the BLM calculates your rent by multiplying the rent per acre for the appropriate county (or other geographical area) zone from the current schedule by the number of acres (as rounded up to the nearest tenth of an acre) in the right-of-way area that fall in each zone and multiplying the result by the number of years in the rental payment period (the length of

time for which the holder is paying rent).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The BLM will phase-in the initial implementation of the Per Acre Rent Schedule (see Sec. 2806.20(c)) by reducing the 2009 per acre rent by 25 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the BLM has not previously used the rent schedule to calculate your rent, we may do so after giving you reasonable written notice.
