hundred percent of the principal amount of each Bond must be used to make Bond Loans. As a Bond Loan is repaid, such repaid Bond Loan proceeds in excess of those required for debt service payments on the Bond must be used to repay the Bond or held in the Relending Account and used for additional Secondary Loans, to the extent authorized under Sec. 1808.308.</p>
