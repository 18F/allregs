                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as otherwise provided in this section, public announcement of open meetings and meetings or portions thereof closed under Sec. 1600.7 will be made at least seven days in advance of each meeting. Except to the extent that such information is determined to be exempt from disclosure under Sec. 1600.6, each such public announcement will state the time, place, and subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of the official designated to respond to requests for information about the meeting. Each such announcement shall be submitted for publication in the Federal Register. Copies of the announcement shall also be mailed to holders of Class B and Class C Bank stock.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a meeting is closed, the Board may omit from the announcement information usually included, if and to the extent that it finds that disclosure would be likely to have any of the consequences listed in Sec. 1600.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a majority of the Board members determine by recorded vote that Bank business requires that a meeting be called on less than ten days notice, public announcement shall be made at the earliest practicable time. Such announcement will state the time, place, and the subject matter of the meeting, whether it is to be open or closed to the public, and the name and telephone number of the official designated to respond to requests for information about the meeting.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The time or place of a meeting may be changed following the public announcement required by paragraph (a) of this section only if the Secretary publicly announces such change at the earliest practicable time. The subject matter of a meeting, or the determination of the Board to open or close a meeting, or portion of a meeting, to the public, may be changed following the public announcement required by this section only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A majority of the Directors determines by a recorded vote that business so requires and that no earlier announcement of the change was possible; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary publicly announces such change and the vote of each Director upon such change at the earliest practicable time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The earliest practicable time, as used in this subsection, means as soon as possible, which should in few, if any, instances be later than the commencement of the meeting or portion in question.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each person interested in attending an open meeting of the Board should notify the Assistant Secretary of the Board at least one business day prior to the open meeting of their intention to attend the meeting. Any person who fails to do so may not be accommodated if there is insufficient space in the meeting room.</p>
