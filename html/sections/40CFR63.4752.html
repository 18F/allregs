                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To demonstrate continuous compliance, the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period, calculated using Equation 3 of Sec. 63.4751, must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690. A compliance period consists of 12 months. Each month after the end of the initial compliance period described in Sec. 63.4750 is the end of a compliance period consisting of that month and the preceding 11 months. You must perform the calculations in Sec. 63.4751(a) through (g) on a monthly basis using data from the previous 12 months of operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the organic HAP emission rate for any 12-month compliance period exceeded the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690, this is a deviation from the emission limitations for that compliance period and must be reported as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4710(c)(6) and 63.4720(a)(6).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As part of each semiannual compliance report required by Sec. 63.4720, you must identify the coating operation(s) for which you used the emission rate without add-on controls option. If there were no deviations from the emission limitations, you must submit a statement that the coating operation(s) was (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the reporting period because the organic HAP emission rate for each compliance period was less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Sec. 63.4690, determined according to Sec. 63.4751(a) through (g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must maintain records as specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4730 and 63.4731.</p><p class="depth2">Compliance Requirements for the Emission Rate With Add-On Controls</p><p class="depth2">Option</p>
