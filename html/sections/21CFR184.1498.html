                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Microparticulated protein product is prepared from egg whites or  milk protein or a combination of egg whites and milk protein. These  protein sources may be used alone or in combination with other safe and  suitable ingredients to form the microparticulated product. The mixture  of ingredients is high-shear heat processed to achieve a smooth and  creamy texture similar to that of fat. Safe and suitable ingredients  used in the preparation of the microparticulated protein product must be  used in compliance with the limitations of the appropriate regulations  in parts 172, 182, and 184 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> at levels not to exceed current good manufacturing  practice. The affirmation of the use of this ingredient as generally  recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct human food ingredient is based  upon the following conditions of use:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The ingredient is used in food as a thickener as defined in  Sec. 170.3(o)(28) of this chapter or as a texturizer as defined in  Sec. 170.3(o)(32) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The ingredient is used in frozen dessert-type products except  that the ingredient may not be used to replace the milk fat required in  standardized frozen desserts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The name of the ingredient used in the ingredient statement on  both bulk and packaged food must include the source of the protein  (e.g., ``microparticulated egg white protein''), followed by a  parenthetical listing of each of the ingredients in the  microparticulated protein product, in descending order of predominance.  Microparticulated protein product must be used in accordance with this  requirement or its addition to food will be considered by FDA to  constitute the use of an unapproved food additive (see  Sec. 184.1(b)(2)).
