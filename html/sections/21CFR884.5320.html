                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A glans sheath device is a sheath which covers only the glans penis or part thereof and may also cover the area in the immediate proximity thereof, the corona and frenulum, but not the entire shaft of the penis. It is indicated only for the prevention of pregnancy and not for the prevention of sexually-transmitted diseases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class III (premarket approval).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Date premarket approval application (PMA) or notice of completion of a product development protocol (PDP) is required. A PMA or a notice of completion of a PDP is required to be filed with the Food and Drug Administration on or before September 12, 2002, for any glans sheath that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, or that has, on or before September 12, 2002, been found to be substantially equivalent to a glans sheath that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976. Any other glans sheath shall have an approved PMA or declared completed PDP in effect before being placed in commercial distribution.
