                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each instrument with static air case connections must be vented  to the outside atmosphere through an appropriate piping system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each vent must be located where its orifices are least affected  by airflow variation, moisture, or foreign matter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each static pressure port must be designed and located in such  manner that the correlation between air pressure in the static pressure  system and true ambient atmospheric static pressure is not altered when  the rotorcraft encounters icing conditions. An anti-icing means or an  alternate source of static pressure may be used in showing compliance  with this requirement. If the reading of the altimeter, when on the  alternate static pressure system, differs from the reading of altimeter  when on the primary static system by more than 50 feet, a correction  card must be provided for the alternate static system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except for the vent into the atmosphere, each system must be  airtight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each pressure altimeter must be approved and calibrated to  indicate pressure altitude in a standard atmosphere with a minimum  practicable calibration error when the corresponding static pressures  are applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each system must be designed and installed so that an error in  indicated pressure altitude, at sea level, with a standard atmosphere,  excluding instrument calibration error, does not result in an error of  more than 30 feet per 100 knots speed. However,  the error need not be less than 30 feet.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (h) of this section, if the  static pressure system incorporates both a primary and an alternate  static pressure source, the means for selecting one or the other source  must be designed so that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When either source is selected, the other is blocked off; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Both sources cannot be blocked off simultaneously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> For unpressurized rotorcraft, paragraph (g)(1) of this section  does not apply if it can be demonstrated that the static pressure system  calibration, when either static pressure source is selected, is not  changed by the other static pressure source being open or blocked.
