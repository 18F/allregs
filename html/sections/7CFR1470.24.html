                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual payments. Subject to the availability of funds, NRCS will  provide, as appropriate, annual payments under the program to compensate  a participant for installing and adopting additional conservation  activities, and improving, maintaining, and managing existing  conservation activities across the entire agricultural operation in a  manner that increases or extends the conservation benefits in place at  the time the contract offer is accepted by NRCS. A split-rate annual  payment structure is used to provide separate payments for additional  and existing conservation activities in order to place emphasis on  implementing additional conservation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To receive annual payments, a participant must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Install and adopt additional conservation activities as  scheduled in the conservation stewardship plan. At least one additional  conservation activity must be scheduled, installed, and adopted in the  first fiscal year of the contract. All enhancements must be scheduled,  installed, and adopted by the end of the third fiscal year of the  contract. Installed enhancements must be maintained for the remainder of  the contract period and adopted enhancements must recur for the  remainder of the contract period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At a minimum, maintain activities to the level of existing  conservation performance identified at the time of enrollment for the  conservation stewardship contract period, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To earn annual payments for an eligible land use, a participant  must schedule, install, and adopt at least one additional conservation  activity on that land-use type. Eligible land-use types that fail to  have at least one additional conservation activity scheduled, installed,  and adopted will not receive annual payments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A participant's annual payments will be determined using the  conservation performance computed by land-use type for eligible land  earning payments. Conservation performance is prorated over the contract  term so as to accommodate, to the extent practicable, participants  earning equal annual payments in each fiscal year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The annual payment rates will be based to the maximum extent  practicable, on the following factors:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Costs incurred by the participant associated with planning,  design, materials, installation, labor, management, maintenance, or  training,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Income foregone by the participant,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Expected conservation benefits,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which priority resource concerns will be  addressed through the installation and adoption of conservation  activities on the agricultural operation,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The level of stewardship in place at the time of application and  maintained over the term of the contract,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The degree to which the conservation activities will be  integrated across the entire agricultural operation for all applicable  priority resource concerns over the term of the contract, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Such other factors as determined by the Chief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The annual payment will accommodate some participant operational  adjustments.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Enhancements may be replaced with similar enhancements without  adjustment of annual payment as long as the conservation performance is  determined by NRCS to be equal to or better than the conservation  performance of the additional enhancements offered at enrollment. An  enhancement replacement that results in a decline below that  conservation performance level will be considered a violation of the  contract, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Adjustments to existing activities may occur consistent with  conservation performance requirements from Sec. 1470.23; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Conservation activities may be applied on other land included in  an agricultural operation, as determined by NRCS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Supplemental payments. Subject to the availability of funds,  NRCS will provide a supplemental payment to a participant receiving  annual payments, who also agrees to adopt or improve a resource- conserving crop rotation as defined by NRCS to achieve beneficial crop  rotations as appropriate for the eligible land of the participant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS will determine whether a resource-conserving crop rotation  is eligible for supplemental payments based on whether the resource- conserving crop rotation is designed to provide natural resource  conservation and production benefits;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A participant must adopt or improve the resource-conserving crop  rotation for the term of the contract to be eligible to receive a  supplemental payment. A resource-conserving crop rotation is considered  adopted when the resource-conserving crop is planted on at least one- third of the rotation acres. The resource-conserving crop must be  adopted by the third fiscal year of the contract and planted on all  rotation acres by the fifth fiscal year of the contract; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The supplemental payment is to encourage a producer to adopt or  improve a resource-conserving crop rotation and will be based, to the  maximum extent practicable, on the factors from Sec. 1470.24(a)(4).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum contract payment. NRCS will make a minimum contract  payment to participants who are historically underserved producers, at a  rate determined by the Chief in any fiscal year that a contract's  payment amount total is less than $1,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing of payments. NRCS will make payments as soon as  practicable after October 1 of each fiscal year for activities carried  out in the previous fiscal year. For newly enrolled contracts, payments  will be made as soon as practicable after October 1 following the fiscal  year of enrollment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Noncompensatory matters. A CSP payment to a participant will not  be provided for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> New conservation activities applied with financial assistance  through other USDA conservation programs;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The design, construction, or maintenance of animal waste storage  or treatment facilities, or associated waste transport or transfer  devices for animal feeding operations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Conservation activities for which there is no cost incurred or  income foregone by the participant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Payment limits. A person or legal entity may not receive,  directly or indirectly, payments that, in the aggregate, exceed $40,000  during any fiscal year for all CSP contracts entered into, and $200,000  under all CSP contracts entered into during fiscal years 2014 through  2018, excluding funding arrangements with Indian tribes, regardless of  the number of contracts entered into under the CSP by the person or   legal entity. NRCS may waive the annual payment limitations in this  section where NRCS determines that due to circumstances beyond the  participant's control, payment for implementation for a fiscal year's  activities cannot be made as scheduled under the CSP contract.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Contract limits. Each conservation stewardship contract will be  limited to $200,000 over the term of the initial contract period, except  that conservation stewardship contracts with joint operations will be  limited to $80,000 per fiscal year and $400,000 over the term of the  initial contract period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Payment and contract limitation provisions for individual  Indians and Indian Tribes. Payment limitations apply to individual  tribal member(s) when applying and subsequently being granted a contract  as an individual(s). Contracts with Indian Tribes are not subject to  payment or contract limitations. Indian Tribes and BIA will certify in  writing that no one individual, directly or indirectly, will receive  more than the payment limitation. Certification provided at the time of  enrollment will cover the entire contract period. The Tribal entity must  also provide, upon request from NRCS, a listing of individuals and  payment made, by Social Security number or other unique identification  number, during the previous year for calculation of overall payment  limitations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Tax Identification Number. To be eligible to receive a CSP  payment, all legal entities or persons applying, either alone or as part  of a joint operation, must provide a tax identification number and  percentage interest in the legal entity. In accordance with 7 CFR part  1400, an applicant applying as a joint operation or legal entity must  provide a list of all members of the legal entity and joint operation  and associated embedded entities, along with the members' Social  Security numbers and percentage of interest in the joint operation or  legal entity. Payments will be directly attributed to legal entity  members for the purpose of complying with Sec. 1470.24(f). Applicant  applying as a joint operation must provide an EIN for the joint  operation to qualify for the contract limit available under Sec.  1470.24(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Unique tax identification numbers. American Indians, Alaska  Natives, and Pacific Islanders may use another unique identification  number for each individual eligible for payment. Any participant that  utilizes a unique identification number as an alternative to a tax  identification number will utilize only that identifier for all CSP  contracts to which the participant is a party.</p>
