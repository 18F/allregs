Therefore, the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1630.4(b)(1)(ii) and 1630.5 of the Standard apply to carpets with alumina trihydrate in the backings. This interpretation continues in effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> On May 19, 1972, the Federal Trade Commission published a notice in the Federal Register (37 FR 10104) temporarily suspending the washing requirements under FF 1-70 for carpets and rugs containing alumina trihydrate in the backing. This temporary suspension was extended a number of times. On March 28, 1973 the Federal Trade Commission proposed in the Federal Register (38 FR 8101) an alternative laundering procedure for such carpets and rugs and gave notice that the suspension of the laundering requirement was extended until the completion of the proceeding to establish an alternative laundering procedure. The suspension continues in effect.
