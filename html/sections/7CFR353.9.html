                                Sec. 353.9  Standards for accreditation of non-government facilities inspection.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for accreditation, certification of accreditation,  and monitoring of accredited facilities. A facility may apply to be  accredited to perform laboratory seed health testing or seed crop  phytosanitary inspection, or to renew such accreditation, by submitting  an application in accordance with Sec. 353.8(b)(2) of this part. If  there are portions of the application deemed to contain trade secret or  confidential business information (CBI), each page of the application  containing such information should be marked ``CBI Copy.'' The  application must be accompanied by a copy of the facility's quality  manual and a nonrefundable application fee of $1,000. The applicant must  make additional deposits to cover the costs of gaining and maintaining  accreditation into a trust fund established in accordance with Sec.  353.8(c) of this part upon request by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon determining that a facility is eligible for accreditation,  the Administrator will issue the facility a certificate of  accreditation. Accreditation will be for a period of 3 years from the  date of issuance of the certificate of accreditation and may be renewed  by submitting a new application and application fee in accordance with  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(ii)</em> of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A facility that has been denied accreditation or had its  accreditation withdrawn may not reapply within 60 days of the date the  facility was notified in writing that accreditation was denied or  withdrawn.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After a facility is accredited, the facility must allow APHIS  access to the facility and all of its equipment and records for the  purpose of conducting unannounced audits to determine the facility's  continuing eligibility for accreditation. Such audits will occur at  least once a year and may be performed more frequently at the discretion  of the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em> of this part, applies to be accredited to perform  laboratory seed health testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspection  will be evaluated for accreditation against these standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Physical plant. The facility's physical plant (e.g., laboratory  space, office space, greenhouses, vehicles, etc.) must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Have laboratory and office spaces enclosed by walls and locking  doors to prevent unauthorized access;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Conform to all State and local zoning and other ordinances; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Provide a work area that is dedicated to laboratory functions  and has sufficient space to conduct the required tests and store the  materials and samples required for the tests in a manner that prevents  contamination by other   samples in the laboratory and from other sources.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The facility must have access to all equipment required to  conduct the laboratory testing or seed crop phytosanitary inspections  for which it is accredited. Specific test methodologies, materials, and  the calibration and monitoring of the equipment must conform to  Reference Manual B, which is incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.4 of  this chapter. The general requirements for each test category are as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Seed crop phytosanitary inspections. Seed crop phytosanitary  inspection may also include related activities such as collection of  seed samples for later laboratory testing, visual inspection of seed  just prior to export, and inspection of greenhouses or growth chambers  where plants are grown for seed production, as well as visual inspection  of seed crops. In the field, inspectors must use accurate field maps,  hand lenses, and secure containers for the collection, storage, and  transportation of samples. Inspectors must have direct access to a  laboratory that is fully equipped to carry out any necessary diagnostic  tests needed for field samples.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct visual examination. Visual examination of seed requires  a stereo microscope. Visual examination of tissue requires a compound  light microscope. Visual examination of loosely attached or accompanying  material requires a centrifuge and shaker.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Incubation. Required equipment includes incubation chambers,  laminar flow hoods, media preparation equipment, scales, pH meters,  distilled and sterile water, gas burners, an autoclave, and the  appropriate media for the specified tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Grow-out tests. Grow-out tests require a greenhouse, growth  chamber, or an outdoor quarantine location, and access to a laboratory  that is fully equipped to carry out any required diagnostic tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Serological tests. These tests require grinding, extraction, and  sample purification equipment; fluorescent microscopes; plate readers;  spectrophotometers; and the appropriate assay materials; or the  appropriate equipment to use field ready test kits.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> DNA probes. To conduct these tests, a laboratory must be  equipped with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) equipment, including  thermal cyclers, electrophoresis and gel blotting equipment, and the  reagents and DNA polymerases necessary to conduct the PCR.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Methods of testing and inspection. The facility must conduct its  laboratory seed health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection  procedures in accordance with Reference Manual B. The facility must have  a quality manual documenting its quality system for laboratory seed  health testing and seed crop phytosanitary inspection procedures. The  quality system must follow the general guidelines described in ANSI/ASQC  Q9001-1994, American National Standard: Quality Systems-Model for  Quality Assurance in Design, Development, Production, Installation and  Servicing. Acceptable models for quality systems for accredited  facilities are also described in detail in Reference Manual A, which is  incorporated by reference at Sec. 300.3 of this chapter. The personnel  who perform the testing and inspection services must comply with the  quality manual, and management must enforce this compliance. The  facility must maintain documented procedures for identification,  collection, indexing, access, filing, storage, maintenance, and  disposition of quality system records. The facility must maintain  quality system records to demonstrate conformance to the quality manual  and the effective operation of the quality system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Personnel. There must be a selection procedure and a training  system to ensure technical competence of all staff members. The  education, technical knowledge, and experience required to perform  assigned test and inspection functions must be documented and clearly  defined. In addition:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Evaluation of plant or tissue samples must be undertaken by a  plant pathologist or by laboratory technicians under the supervision of  a plant pathologist, who may provide such supervision either on-site, or  from a remote location. Where personnel are required to be trained at a  facility to evaluate the particular types of plants or tissue samples  handled by the facility, the   training program must be evaluated by APHIS and determined to be  effective.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All staff must have access to and be familiar with the  reference materials, guides, and manuals required for the routine  performance of the tests and inspections they conduct.
