The name of the viticultural area described in this section is ``Texas Davis Mountains.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved map. The appropriate maps for determining the boundary of the Texas Davis Mountains viticultural area are two U.S.G.S. metric topographical maps of the 1:100 000 scale, titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Fort Davis, Texas,'' 1985.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Mount Livermore, Texas--Chihuahua,'' 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary. The Texas Davis Mountains viticultural area is located in Jeff Davis County, Texas. The boundary is as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning point is the intersection of Texas Highway 17 and Farm Road 1832 on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the beginning point, the boundary follows Highway 17 in a southeasterly and then southwesterly direction until it reaches the intersection of Limpia Creek with the unnamed stream which flows through Grapevine Canyon on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The boundary then proceeds in a straight line in a southwesterly direction until it meets Highway 118 at a gravel pit 1\3/4\ miles southeast of the intersection of Highway 118 and Highway 17;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The boundary then proceeds in a straight line east by southeast until it meets Highway 166 at its junction with Highway 17;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The boundary then follows Highway 166 in a southwesterly direction onto the Mt. Livermore, Texas-Chihuahua, U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The boundary then continues to follow Highway 166 in a westerly direction;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The boundary then continues to follow Highway 166 as it turns in a northerly and then northeasterly direction to the point where it meets Highway 118;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The boundary then follows Highway 118 in a northerly direction until it reaches a point where it intersects with the 1600 meter contour line, just north of Robbers Roost Canyon;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The boundary then proceeds in a straight line due east for about two miles until it reaches the 1600 meter contour line to the west of Friend Mountain;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The boundary then follows the 1600 meter contour line in a northeasterly direction until it reaches the northernmost point of Friend Mountain;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The boundary then diverges from the contour line and proceeds in a straight line east-southeast until it reaches the beginning point of Buckley Canyon, approximately three fifths of a mile;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The boundary then follows Buckley Canyon in an easterly direction to the point where it meets Cherry Canyon;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The boundary then follows Cherry Canyon in a northeasterly direction to the point where it meets Grapevine Canyon on the Mt. Livermore, Texas-Chihuahua, U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> The boundary then proceeds in a straight line from the intersection of Cherry and Grapevine Canyons to the peak of Bear Cave Mountain, on the Fort Davis, Texas, U.S.G.S. map;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> The boundary then proceeds in a straight line from the peak of Bear Cave Mountain to the point where Farm Road 1832 begins;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> The boundary then follows Farm Road 1832 back to its intersection with Texas Highway 17, at the point of beginning.
