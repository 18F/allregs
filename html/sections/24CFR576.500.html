                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The recipient must have policies and procedures to ensure the requirements of this part are met. The policies and procedures must be established in writing and implemented by the recipient and its subrecipients to ensure that ESG funds are used in accordance with the requirements. In addition, sufficient records must be established and maintained to enable the recipient and HUD to determine whether ESG requirements are being met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Homeless status. The recipient must maintain and follow written intake procedures to ensure compliance with the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2. The procedures must require documentation at intake of the evidence relied upon to establish and verify homeless status. The procedures must establish the order of priority for obtaining evidence as third-party documentation first, intake worker observations second, and certification from the person seeking assistance third. However, lack of third-party documentation must not prevent an individual or family from being immediately admitted to emergency shelter, receiving street outreach services, or being immediately admitted to shelter or receiving services provided by a victim service provider. Records contained in an HMIS or comparable database used by victim service or legal service providers are acceptable evidence of third-party documentation and intake worker observations if the HMIS retains an auditable history of all entries, including the person who entered the data, the date of entry, and the change made; and if the HMIS prevents overrides or changes of the dates on which entries are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(i) or (ii) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, acceptable evidence includes a written observation by an outreach worker of the conditions where the individual or family was living, a written referral by another housing or service provider, or a certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the individual qualifies as homeless under paragraph (1)(iii) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, because he or she resided in an emergency shelter or place not meant for human habitation and is exiting an institution where he or she resided for 90 days or less, acceptable evidence includes the evidence described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Discharge paperwork or a written or oral referral from a social worker, case manager, or other appropriate official of the institution, stating the beginning and end dates of the time residing in the institution.

The intake worker must record the statement and certify that it was found credible. To be found credible, the oral statement must either: (I) be verified by the owner or renter of the housing in which the individual or family resides at the time of application for homeless assistance and documented by a written certification by the owner or renter or by the intake worker's recording of the owner or renter's oral statement; or (II) if the intake worker is unable to contact the owner or renter, be documented by a written certification by the intake worker of his or her due diligence in attempting to obtain the owner or renter's verification and the written certification by the individual or head of household seeking assistance that his or her statement was true and complete;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Certification by the individual or head of household that no subsequent residence has been identified; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Certification or other written documentation that the individual or family lacks the resources and support networks needed to obtain other permanent housing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the individual or family qualifies as homeless under paragraph (3) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, because the individual or family does not otherwise qualify as homeless under the homeless definition but is an unaccompanied youth under 25 years of age, or homeless family with one or more children or youth, and is defined as homeless under another Federal statute or section 725(2) of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11434a(2)), the evidence must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For paragraph (3)(i) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, certification of homeless status by the local private nonprofit organization or state or local governmental entity responsible for administering assistance under the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act (42 U.S.C. 5701 et seq.), the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), subtitle N of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (42 U.S.C. 14043e et seq.), section 330 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254b), the Food and Nutrition Act of 2008 (7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.), section 17 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1786), or subtitle B of title VII of the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11431 et seq.), as applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For paragraph (3)(ii) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, referral by a housing or service provider, written observation by an outreach worker, or certification by the homeless individual or head of household seeking assistance;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For paragraph (3)(iii) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, certification by the individual or head of household and any available supporting documentation that the individual or family moved two or more times during the 60-day period immediately preceding the date of application for homeless assistance, including: recorded statements or records obtained from each owner or renter of housing, provider of shelter or housing, or social worker, case worker, or other appropriate official of a hospital or institution in which the individual or family resided; or, where these statements or records are unobtainable, a written record of the intake worker's due diligence in attempting to obtain these statements or records. Where a move was due to the individual or family fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, then the intake worker may alternatively obtain a written certification from the individual or head of household seeking assistance that they were fleeing that situation and that they resided at that address; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For paragraph (3)(iv) of the homeless definition in Sec.  576.2, written diagnosis from a professional who is licensed by the state to diagnose and treat that condition (or intake staff-recorded observation of disability that within 45 days of date of the application for assistance is confirmed by a professional who is licensed by the

If the individual or family is receiving shelter or services provided by a victim service provider, the oral statement must be documented by either a certification by the individual or head of household; or a certification by the intake worker. Otherwise, the oral statement that the individual or head of household seeking assistance has not identified a subsequent residence and lacks the resources or support networks, e.g., family, friends, faith-based or other social networks, needed to obtain housing must be documented by a certification by the individual or head of household that the oral statement is true and complete, and, where the safety of the individual or family would not be jeopardized, the domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, stalking, or other dangerous or life-threatening condition must be verified by a written observation by the intake worker or a written referral by a housing or service provider, social worker, legal assistance provider, health-care provider, law enforcement agency, legal assistance provider, pastoral counselor, or any other organization from whom the individual or head of household has sought assistance for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
