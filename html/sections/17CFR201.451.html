                                Sec. 201.451  Oral argument before the Commission.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability. The Commission, on its own motion or the motion of  a party or any other aggrieved person entitled to Commission review, may  order oral argument with respect to any matter. Motions for oral  argument with respect to whether to affirm all or part of an initial  decision by a hearing officer shall be granted unless exceptional  circumstances make oral argument impractical or inadvisable. The  Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters properly  before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral  argument unless the Commission determines that the presentation of facts  and legal arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process  would be significantly aided by oral argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate  motion accompanying the initial brief on the merits. The Commission  shall issue an order as to whether oral argument is to be heard, and if  so, the time and place therefor. If oral argument is granted, the time  fixed for oral argument shall be changed only by written order of the  Commission, for good cause shown. The order shall state at whose request  the change is made and the reasons for any such changes. No visual aids  may be used at oral argument unless copies have been provided to the  Commission and all parties at least five business days before the  argument is to be held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time allowed. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more  than one half-hour per side will be allowed for oral argument. The  Commission may, in its discretion, determine that several persons have a  common interest, and that the interests represented will be considered a  single side for purposes of allotting time for oral argument. Time will  be divided equally among persons on a single side, provided, however,  that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their time among  themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion filed  reasonably in advance of the date fixed for argument.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Participation of Commissioners. A member of the Commission who  was not present at the oral argument may participate in the decision of  the proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed the transcript of  such argument prior to such participation. The   decision shall state whether the required review was made.  [60 FR 32796, June 23, 1995, as amended at 69 FR 13180, Mar. 19, 2004]</p>
