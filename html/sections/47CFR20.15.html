CMRS providers may exclude test calls that are dropped or  otherwise disconnected in 10 seconds or less from calculation of the  yield percentage (both the denominator and numerator).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Collection and reporting of aggregate live 911 call location  data. CMRS providers providing service in any of the Test Cities or  portions thereof must collect and report aggregate data on the location  technologies used for live 911 calls in those areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> CMRS providers subject to this section shall identify and  collect information regarding the location technology or technologies  used for each 911 call in the reporting area during the calling period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> CMRS providers subject to this section shall report Test City  call location data on a quarterly basis to the Commission, the National  Emergency Number Association, the Association of Public Safety  Communications Officials, and the National Association of State 911  Administrators, with the first report due 18 months from the effective  date of rules adopted in this proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> CMRS providers subject to this section shall also provide  quarterly live call data on a more granular basis that allows evaluation  of the performance of individual location technologies within different  morphologies (e.g., dense urban, urban, suburban, rural). To the extent  available, live call data for all CMRS providers shall delineate based  on a per technology basis accumulated and so identified for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each of the ATIS ESIF morphologies;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On a reasonable community level basis; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> By census block. This more granular data will be used for  evaluation and not for compliance purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Non-nationwide CMRS providers that operate in a single Test City  need only report live 911 call data from that city or portion thereof  that they cover. Non-nationwide CMRS providers that operate in more than  one Test City must report live 911 call data only in half of the regions  (as selected by the provider). In the event a non-nationwide CMRS  provider begins coverage in a Test City it previously did not serve, it  must update its certification pursuant to paragraph (i)(2)(iii)(C) of  this section to reflect this change in its network and begin reporting  data from   the appropriate areas. All non-nationwide CMRS providers must report  their Test City live call data every 6 months, beginning 18 months from  the effective date of rules adopted in this proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Non-nationwide CMRS providers that do not provide coverage in  any of the Test Cities can satisfy the requirement of paragraph  (i)(3)(ii) of this section by collecting and reporting data based on the  largest county within its footprint. In addition, where a non-nationwide  CMRS provider serves more than one of the ATIS ESIF morphologies, it  must include a sufficient number of representative counties to cover  each morphology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Data retention. CMRS providers shall retain testing and live  call data gathered pursuant to this section for a period of 2 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Submission of plans and reports. The following reporting and  certification obligations apply to all CMRS providers subject to this  section, which may be filed electronically in PS Docket No. 07-114:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(2)</em> of this section. Non- nationwide CMRS providers will have an additional 6 months to submit  their implementation plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Progress reports. No later than 18 months from the effective  date of the adoption of this rule, each CMRS provider shall file a  progress report on implementation of indoor location accuracy  requirements. Non-nationwide CMRS providers will have an additional 6  months to submit their progress reports. All CMRS providers shall  provide an additional progress report no later than 36 months from the  effective date of the adoption of this rule. The 36-month reports shall  indicate what progress the provider has made consistent with its  implementation plan, and the nationwide CMRS providers shall include an  assessment of their deployment of dispatchable location solutions. For  any CMRS provider participating in the development of the NEAD database,  this progress report must include detail as to the implementation of the  NEAD database described in paragraphs (i)(4)(iii) and (iv) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> NEAD privacy and security plan. Prior to activation of the  NEAD but no later than 18 months from the effective date of the adoption  of this rule, the nationwide CMRS providers shall file with the  Commission and request approval for a security and privacy plan for the  administration and operation of the NEAD. The plan must include the  identity of an administrator for the NEAD, who will serve as a point of  contact for the Commission and shall be accountable for the  effectiveness of the security, privacy, and resiliency measures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> NEAD use certification. Prior to use of the NEAD or any  information contained therein to meet such requirements, CMRS providers  must certify that they will not use the NEAD or associated data for any  non-911 purpose, except as otherwise required by law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Confidence and uncertainty data. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in  paragraphs (j)(2)-(3) of this section, CMRS providers subject to this  section shall provide for all wireless 911 calls, whether from outdoor  or indoor locations, x- and y-axis (latitude, longitude) confidence and  uncertainty information (C/U data) on a per-call basis upon the request  of a PSAP. The data shall specify</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The caller's location with a uniform confidence level of 90  percent, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The radius in meters from the reported position at that same  confidence level. All entities responsible for transporting confidence  and uncertainty between CMRS providers and PSAPs, including LECs, CLECs,  owners of E911 networks, and emergency service providers, must enable  the transmission of confidence and uncertainty data provided by CMRS  providers to the requesting PSAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> of this section, CMRS providers shall provide with wireless  911 calls that have a dispatchable location the C/U data for the x- and  y-axis (latitude, longitude) required under paragraph (j)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Upon meeting the 6-year timeframe pursuant to paragraph  (i)(2)(i) of this section, CMRS providers shall provide with wireless  911 calls that have a dispatchable location the C/U data for the x- and  y-axis (latitude, longitude) required under paragraph (j)(1) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Provision of live 911 call data for PSAPs.

CMRS providers must  also record the confidence and uncertainty data that they provide  pursuant to paragraphs (j)(1) through (3) of this section. This  information must be made available to PSAPs upon request, and shall be  retained for a period of two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Reports on Phase II plans. Licensees subject to this section  shall report to the Commission their plans for implementing Phase II  enhanced 911 service, including the location-determination technology  they plan to employ and the procedure they intend to use to verify  conformance with the Phase II accuracy requirements by November 9, 2000.  Licensees are required to update these plans within thirty days of the  adoption of any change. These reports and updates may be filed  electronically in a manner to be designated by the Commission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Conditions for enhanced 911 services--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Generally. The  requirements set forth in paragraphs (d) through (h)(2) and in paragraph  (j) of this section shall be applicable only to the extent that the  administrator of the applicable designated PSAP has requested the  services required under those paragraphs and such PSAP is capable of  receiving and utilizing the requested data elements and has a mechanism  for recovering the PSAP's costs associated with them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Commencement of six-month period. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in  paragraph (ii) of this section, for purposes of commencing the six-month  period for carrier implementation specified in paragraphs (d), (f) and  (g) of this section, a PSAP will be deemed capable of receiving and  utilizing the data elements associated with the service requested, if it  can demonstrate that it has:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ordered the necessary equipment and has commitments from  suppliers to have it installed and operational within such six-month  period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Made a timely request to the appropriate local exchange carrier  for the necessary trunking, upgrades, and other facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of commencing the six-month period for carrier  implementation specified in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, a  PSAP that is Phase I-capable using a Non-Call Path Associated Signaling  (NCAS) technology will be deemed capable of receiving and utilizing the  data elements associated with Phase II service if it can demonstrate  that it has made a timely request to the appropriate local exchange  carrier for the ALI database upgrade necessary to receive the Phase II  information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Tolling of six-month period. Where a wireless carrier has served  a written request for documentation on the PSAP within 15 days of  receiving the PSAP's request for Phase I or Phase II enhanced 911  service, and the PSAP fails to respond to such request within 15 days of  such service, the six-month period for carrier implementation specified  in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g) of this section will be tolled until the  PSAP provides the carrier with such documentation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)(x)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> As a prerequisite to filing such certification, no later than 21  days prior to such filing, the wireless carrier must notify the affected  PSAP, in writing, of its intent to file such certification. Any response  that the carrier   receives from the PSAP must be included with the carrier's certification  filing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The certification process shall be subject to the procedural  requirements set forth in sections 1.45 and 1.47 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The certification must be in the form of an affidavit signed  by a director or officer of the carrier, documenting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The basis for the carrier's determination that the PSAP will not  be ready;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each of the specific steps the carrier has taken to provide the  E911 service requested;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The reasons why further implementation efforts cannot be made  until the PSAP becomes capable of receiving and utilizing the data  elements associated with the E911 service requested; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The specific steps that remain to be completed by the wireless  carrier and, to the extent known, the PSAP or other parties before the  carrier can provide the E911 service requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> All affidavits must be correct.

Sec. 1.720 through 1.736 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> If a wireless carrier's certification is facially inadequate,  the six-month implementation period specified in paragraphs (d), (f) and  (g) of this section will not be suspended as provided for in paragraph  (j)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> If a wireless carrier's certification is inaccurate, the  wireless carrier will be liable for noncompliance as if the  certification had not been filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A carrier that files a certification under paragraph (j)(4) of  this section shall have 90 days from receipt of the PSAP's written  notice that it is capable of receiving and utilizing the data elements  associated with the service requested to provide such service in  accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (d) through (h) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Modification of deadlines by agreement. Nothing in this section  shall prevent Public Safety Answering Points and carriers from  establishing, by mutual consent, deadlines different from those imposed  for carrier and PSAP compliance in paragraphs (d), (f), and (g)(2) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Dispatch service. A service provider covered by this section who  offers dispatch service to customers may meet the requirements of this  section with respect to customers who utilize dispatch service either by  complying with the requirements set forth in paragraphs (b) through (e)  of this section, or by routing the customer's emergency calls through a  dispatcher. If the service provider chooses the latter alternative, it  must make every reasonable effort to explicitly notify its current and  potential dispatch customers and their users that they are not able to  directly reach a PSAP by calling 911 and that, in the event of an  emergency, the dispatcher should be contacted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Non-service-initialized handsets. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Licensees subject to this  section that donate a non-service-initialized handset for purposes of  providing access to 911 services are required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Program each handset with 911 plus the decimal representation of  the seven least significant digits of the Electronic Serial Number,  International Mobile Equipment Identifier, or any other identifier  unique to that handset;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Affix to each handset a label which is designed to withstand  the length of service expected for a non-service-initialized phone, and  which notifies the user that the handset can only be used to dial 911,  that the 911 operator will not be able to call the user back, and that  the user should convey   the exact location of the emergency as soon as possible; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Institute a public education program to provide the users of  such handsets with information regarding the limitations of non-service- initialized handsets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturers of 911-only handsets that are manufactured on or  after May 3, 2004, are required to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Program each handset with 911 plus the decimal representation of  the seven least significant digits of the Electronic Serial Number,  International Mobile Equipment Identifier, or any other identifier  unique to that handset;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Affix to each handset a label which is designed to withstand  the length of service expected for a non-service-initialized phone, and  which notifies the user that the handset can only be used to dial 911,  that the 911 operator will not be able to call the user back, and that  the user should convey the exact location of the emergency as soon as  possible; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Institute a public education program to provide the users of  such handsets with information regarding the limitations of 911-only  handsets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definitions.
