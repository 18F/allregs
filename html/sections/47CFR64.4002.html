                                Sec. 64.4002  Notification obligations of LECs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To the extent that the information is reasonably available to a LEC,  the LEC shall provide to an IXC the customer account information  described in this section consistent with Sec. 64.4004. Nothing in this  section shall prevent a LEC from providing additional customer account  information to an IXC to the extent that such additional information is  necessary for billing purposes or to properly execute a customer's PIC  order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Customer-submitted PIC order. Upon receiving and processing a  PIC selection submitted by a customer and placing the customer on the  network of the customer's preferred interexchange carrier at the LEC's  local switch, the LEC must notify the IXC of this event. The  notification provided by the LEC to the IXC must contain all of the  customer account information necessary to allow for proper billing of  the customer by the IXC including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone  number, and billing name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the PIC change;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement describing the customer type (i.e., business or  residential);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, that the  customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and  is not available from directory assistance or is not printed in a  directory but is available from directory assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e.,  intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If relevant, a statement indicating that the customer's account  is subject to a PIC freeze. The notification also must contain  information, if relevant and to the extent that it is available,  reflecting the fact that a customer's PIC selection was the result of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A move (an end user customer has moved from one location to  another within a LEC's service territory);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A change in responsible billing party; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The resolution of a PIC dispute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Confirmation of IXC-submitted PIC order. When a LEC has placed a  customer on an IXC's network at the local switch in response to an IXC- submitted PIC order, the LEC must send a confirmation to the submitting  IXC. The confirmation provided by the LEC to the IXC must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone  number, and billing name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the PIC change;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement describing the customer type (i.e., business or  residential);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, if the  customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and  is not available from directory assistance, or is not printed in a  directory but is available from directory assistance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e.,  intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC. If the PIC order at  issue originally was submitted by an underlying IXC on behalf of a toll  reseller, the confirmation provided by the LEC to the IXC must indicate,  to the extent that this information is known, a statement indicating  that the customer's PIC is a toll reseller.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rejection of IXC-submitted PIC order. When a LEC rejects or  otherwise does not act upon a PIC order submitted to it by an IXC, the  LEC must notify the IXC and provide the reason(s) why the PIC order  could not be processed. The notification provided by the LEC to the IXC  must state that it has rejected the IXC-submitted PIC order and specify  the reason(s) for the rejection (e.g., due to a lack of information,  incorrect information, or a PIC freeze on the customer's account). The  notification must contain the identical data elements that were provided  to the LEC in the original IXC-submitted PIC order (i.e., mirror image  of the original order), unless otherwise specified by this paragraph. If  a LEC rejects an IXC-submitted PIC order for a multi-line account (i.e.,  the customer has selected the IXC as his PIC for two or more lines or  terminals associated with his billing telephone number), the  notification provided by the LEC rejecting that order must explain the  effect of the rejection with respect to each line (working telephone  number or terminal) associated with the customer's billing telephone  number. A LEC is not required to generate a line-specific or terminal- specific response, however, and may communicate the rejection at the  billing telephone level, when the LEC is unable to process an entire  order, including all working telephone numbers and terminals associated  with a particular billing telephone number. In addition, the  notification must indicate the jurisdictional scope of the PIC order  rejection (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international). If a  LEC rejects a PIC order because:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer's telephone number has been ported to another LEC;  or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The customer has otherwise changed local service providers, the  LEC must include in its notification, to the extent that it is  available, the identity of the customer's new LEC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Customer contacts LEC or new IXC to change PIC(s) or customer  contacts LEC or current IXC to change PIC to No-PIC. When a LEC has  removed at its local switch a presubscribed customer from an IXC's  network in response to a customer order, upon receipt of a properly  verified PIC order submitted by another IXC, or in response to a  notification from the customer's current IXC relating to the customer's  request to change his or her PIC to No-PIC, the LEC must notify the  customer's former IXC of this event. The LEC must provide to the IXC the  customer account information that is necessary to allow for proper final  billing of the customer by the IXC including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone  number, and billing name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The effective date of the PIC change;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the customer type (i.e., business or  residential);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the lines or terminals affected  (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC. If a customer  changes PICs but retains the same LEC, the LEC is responsible for  notifying both the old PIC and new PIC of the PIC change. The  notification also must contain information, if relevant and to the  extent that it is available, reflecting the fact   that a customer's PIC removal was the result of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The customer moving from one location to another within the  LEC's service territory, but where there is no change in local service  provider;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A change of responsible party on an account; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A disputed PIC selection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Particular changes to customer's local service account. When,  according to a LEC's records, certain account or line information  changes occur on a presubscribed customer's account, the LEC must  communicate this information to the customer's PIC. For purposes of this  paragraph, the LEC must provide to the appropriate IXC account change  information that is necessary for the IXC to issue timely and accurate  bills to its customers including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone  number, and billing name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The customer code assigned to that customer by the LEC;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The type of customer account (i.e., business or residential);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The status of the customer's telephone service listing, to the  extent appropriate, as not printed in a directory and not available from  directory assistance, or not printed in a directory but available from  directory assistance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e.,  intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The effective date of any change to a customer's local service  account; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC. If there are changes  to the customer's billing or working telephone number, customer code, or  customer type, the LEC must supply both the old and new information for  each of these categories.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Local service disconnection. Upon receipt of an end user  customer's request to terminate his entire local service account or  disconnect one or more lines (but not all lines) of a multi-line  account, the LEC must notify the PIC(s) for the billing telephone number  or working telephone number on the account of the account termination or  lines disconnected. In conjunction with this notification requirement,  the LEC must provide to a customer's PIC(s) all account termination or  single/multi-line disconnection change information necessary for the  PIC(s) to maintain accurate billing and PIC records, including but not  limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The effective date of the termination/disconnection; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The customer's working and billing telephone numbers and billing  name and address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The type of customer account (i.e., business or residential);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the PIC installation (i.e.,  intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Change of local service provider. When a customer changes LECs,  the customer's former LEC must notify the customer's PIC(s) of the  customer's change in LEC and, if known, the identity of the customer's  new LEC. If the customer also makes a PIC change, the customer's former  LEC must also notify the customer's former PIC(s) of the change. When a  customer only changes LECs, the new LEC must notify the customer's  current PIC(s) that the customer's PIC selection has not changed. If the  customer also makes a PIC change, the new LEC must notify the customer's  new PIC of the customer's PIC selection. If the customer's former LEC is  unable to identify the customer's new LEC, the former LEC must notify  the customer's PIC(s) of a local service disconnection as described in  paragraph (f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The required notifications also must contain information, if  relevant and to the extent that it is available, reflecting the fact  that an account change was the result of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The customer porting his number to a new LEC;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A local resale arrangement (customer has transferred to local  reseller); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The discontinuation of a local resale arrangement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notification provided by the LEC to the IXC must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The customer's billing telephone number, working telephone  number, and, billing name and address;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effective date of the change of local service providers or  PIC change;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A description of the customer type (i.e., business or  residential);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The jurisdictional scope of the lines or terminals affected  (i.e., intraLATA and/or interLATA and/or international); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The carrier identification code of the IXC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> IXC requests for customer BNA information. Upon the request of  an IXC, a LEC must provide the billing name and address information  necessary to facilitate a customer's receipt of a timely, accurate bill  for services rendered and/or to prevent fraud, regardless of the type of  service the end user receives/has received from the requesting carrier  (i.e., presubscribed, dial-around, casual). In response to an IXC's BNA  request for ANI, a LEC must provide the BNA for the submitted ANI along  with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The working telephone number for the ANI;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of the BNA response;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The carrier identification code of the submitting IXC; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement indicating, to the extent appropriate, if the  customer's telephone service listing is not printed in a directory and  is not available from directory assistance, or is not printed in a  directory but is available from directory assistance. A LEC that is  unable to provide the BNA requested must provide the submitting carrier  with the identical information contained in the original BNA request  (i.e., the mirror image of the original request), along with the  specific reason(s) why the requested information could not be provided.  If the BNA is not available because the customer has changed local  service providers or ported his telephone number, the LEC must include  the identity of the new provider when this information is available.
