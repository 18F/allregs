                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Automatic commercial ice maker means a factory-made assembly (not necessarily shipped in 1 package) that--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Consists of a condensing unit and ice-making section operating as an integrated unit, with means for making and harvesting ice; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> May include means for storing ice, dispensing ice, or storing and dispensing ice.</p><p class="depth2">Basic model means all units of a given type of covered product (or class thereof) manufactured by one manufacturer, having the same primary energy source, and which have essentially

identical electrical, physical, and functional (or hydraulic) characteristics that affect energy consumption, energy efficiency, water consumption, or water efficiency.</p><p class="depth2">Batch type ice maker means an ice maker having alternate freezing and harvesting periods. This includes automatic commercial ice makers that produce cube type ice and other batch technologies. Referred to as cubes type ice maker in AHRI 810 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.133).</p><p class="depth2">Continuous type ice maker means an ice maker that continually freezes and harvests ice at the same time.</p><p class="depth2">Cube type ice means ice that is fairly uniform, hard, solid, usually clear, and generally weighs less than two ounces (60 grams) per piece, as distinguished from flake, crushed, or fragmented ice. Note that this conflicts and takes precedence over the definition established in AHRI 810 (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 431.133), which indicates that ``cube'' does not reference a specific size or shape.</p><p class="depth2">Energy use means the total energy consumed, stated in kilowatt hours per one-hundred pounds (kWh/100 lb) of ice stated in multiples of 0.1. For remote condensing (but not remote compressor) automatic commercial ice makers and remote condensing and remote compressor automatic commercial ice makers, total energy consumed shall include the energy use of the ice-making mechanism, the compressor, and the remote condenser or condensing unit.</p><p class="depth2">Harvest rate means the amount of ice (at 32 degrees F) in pounds produced per 24 hours.</p><p class="depth2">Ice hardness factor means the latent heat capacity of harvested ice, in British thermal units per pound of ice (Btu/lb), divided by 144 Btu/lb, expressed as a percent.</p><p class="depth2">Ice-making head means automatic commercial ice makers that do not contain integral storage bins, but are generally designed to accommodate a variety of bin capacities. Storage bins entail additional energy use not included in the reported energy consumption figures for these units.</p><p class="depth2">Maximum condenser water use means the maximum amount of water used by the condensing unit (if water-cooled), stated in gallons per 100 pounds (gal/100 lb) of ice, in multiples of 1.</p><p class="depth2">Remote compressor means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in which the ice-making mechanism and compressor are in separate sections.</p><p class="depth2">Remote condensing means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in which the ice-making mechanism and condenser or condensing unit are in separate sections.</p><p class="depth2">Self-contained means a type of automatic commercial ice maker in which the ice-making mechanism and storage compartment are in an integral cabinet.
