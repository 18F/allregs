                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Controlling works. The controlling works shall be so operated  that the water level in the Chicago River will be maintained at a level  lower than that of the lake, except in times of excessive storm run-off  into the river or when the level of the lake is below minus 2 feet,  Chicago City Datum.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The elevation to be maintained in the Chicago River at the west  end of the lock will be determined from time to time by the U.S.  District Engineer, Chicago, Illinois. It shall at no time be higher than  minus 0.5 foot, Chicago City Datum, and at no time lower than minus 2.0  feet, Chicago City Datum, except as noted in the preceding paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Operation. The lock shall be operated by the  Metropolitan Sanitary District of Chicago under the general supervision  of the U.S. District Engineer, Chicago, Illinois. The lock gates shall  be kept in the closed position at all times except for the passage of  navigation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Description of lock.  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Feet ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Clear length..................................................       600 Clear width...................................................        80 Depth over sills..............................................  \1\ 24.4 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ \1\ This depth is below Chicago City Datum which is the zero of the</p><p class="depth0">gages mounted on the lock. The clear depth below Low Water Datum for</p><p class="depth0">Lake Michigan, which is the plane of reference for U. S. Lake Survey</p><p class="depth0">Charts, is 23.0 feet.   The east end of the northeast guide wall shall be marked by an  intermittent red light, and by a traffic light showing a fixed red or  fixed green light. The west end of the northwest gate block shall be  marked by a traffic light showing a fixed red or fixed green light. The  east end of the southeast guide wall and the west end of the southwest  guide wall shall be marked by an intermittent white light.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Authority of lockmasters. The lockmaster shall be charged with  the immediate control and management of the lock, and of the area set  aside as the lock area, including the lock approach channels. He shall  see that all laws, rules and regulations for the use of the lock and  lock area are duly complied with, to which end he is authorized to give  all necessary orders and directions in accordance therewith, both to  employees of the Government and to any and every person within the  limits of the lock or lock area, whether navigating the lock or not. No  one shall cause any movement of any vessel, boat, or other floating  thing in the lock or approaches except by or under the direction of the  lockmaster or his assistants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Signals. (i) Signals from vessels for lockage shall be by  whistle, horn or by idling or standing near the ends of the lock guide  walls. Signals from the lockmaster shall be by the traffic light and  horn and/or by voice with or without electrical amplification. In case  of emergency, the lockmaster may signal the vessel by wave of hand or  lantern, and the signals thus given shall have the same weight as though  given by visual or sound devices at the lock. Vessels must approach the  lock with caution and shall not enter or leave the lock until signaled  to do so by the lockmaster. The following lockage signals and duration  of sound signals are prescribed. A long blast shall be of 4 second  duration; a short blast shall be of 1 second duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Vessel signals. Inbound vessels at a distance of not more than  4,000 feet from the lock and outbound vessels immediately after crossing  under the Lake Shore Drive bridge shall signal for lockage by 2 long and  2 short blasts of a whistle or horn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Lock signals. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When the lock is ready for entrance, the  traffic light will show green, and vessels under 500 gross tons shall  come ahead under caution and enter the lock; vessels of 500 gross tons  or more shall come to a stop along the guide wall, as prescribed in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Should the traffic light be out of  order or be invisible due to thick weather, vessels shall upon 1 long  blast of the lock horn approach and moor to the south guide   wall or continue into the lock if so directed by the lockmaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When the lock is not ready for entrance, the traffic light will  show red, and vessels shall not pass beyond the end of the south guide  wall: Provided, however, That vessels may approach and moor to said wall  if authorized by 1 long blast of the lock horn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Permission to leave the lock shall be indicated by 1 short blast  of the lock horn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Caution or danger will be indicated by 4 or more flashes of the  red traffic light or 4 or more short blasts of the lock horn delivered  in rapid succession.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When in the lock, vessels shall not blow whistle signals for  tugs, bridges, landings, etc., without the lockmaster's permission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The master and chief engineer of each vessel of 500 gross tons  or more shall be on duty at their respective stations when passing  through the lock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Stop before entering. All vessels or tows of 500 gross tons or  more shall come to a full stop at the point indicated by the sign  reading ``Stop'' on the south guide wall and shall not proceed into the  lock until so directed by the lockmaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Maximum draft. Vessels drawing within 6 inches of the depth over  the sills shall not be permitted lockage except under special permission  from the lockmaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Precedence at locks. The vessel arriving first at a lock shall  be first to lock through; but precedence shall be given to vessels  belonging to the United States and to commercial vessels in the order  named. Arrival posts or markers may be established ashore above or below  the locks. Vessels arriving at or opposite such posts or markers will be  considered as having arrived at the locks within the meaning of this  paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Lockage of pleasure boats. The lockage of pleasure boats, house  boats or like craft shall be expedited by locking them through with  commercial craft (other than barges carrying petroleum products or  highly hazardous materials) in order to utilize the capacity of the lock  to its maximum. If, after the arrival of such craft, no separate or  combined lockage can be accomplished within a reasonable time, not to  exceed the time required for three other lockages, then separate lockage  shall be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Speed of approach and departure. Vessels of 500 gross tons or  more when approaching the lock shall navigate at a speed not exceeding 2  miles per hour, and when leaving the lock shall navigate at a speed not  exceeding 6 miles per hour. While entering or leaving the lock, the  propellers of vessels of 500 gross tons or more shall be operated at  slow speed so as not to undermine or injure the concrete paving on the  bottom of the lock chamber. Tugs assisting vessels in lockage, and Coast  Guard and fire vessels, may navigate at a higher speed when authorized  by the lockmaster. Vessels of less than 500 gross tons shall operate at  reasonable speed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Mooring. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Vessels shall be moored in the lock or along its  approach walls in such manner as may be directed by the lockmaster.  Tying to lock ladders, lamp standards, or railings is strictly  prohibited. Commercial vessels and tows of 500 gross tons or more shall,  in general, have at least one line out when entering the lock and shall  be moored in the lock with two bow and two stern lines, which shall lead  forward and aft at each end of the vessel or tow. When the gates are  closed, commercial vessels shall not be permitted to work their wheels.  Said vessels shall have at least two seamen ashore to handle the mooring  lines while they are in the lock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mooring lines shall not be cast off until after the lock gates  have been opened fully into their recesses, and the signal given to  leave the lock. The lines leading aft shall be released first. The lines  leading forward shall not be released until the vessel has started to  move forward, so as to prevent the vessel from drifting back into the  lock gates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Unnecessary delay at lock. Masters and pilots must use every  precaution to prevent unnecessary delay in entering of leaving the lock.  Vessels failing to enter lock with reasonable promptness, when signaled  to do so, shall lose their turn. Vessels arriving at the lock   with their tows in such shape so as to impede lockage, shall lose their  turn.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Depositing refuse prohibited. The depositing of ashes or refuse  matter of any kind in the lock; the passing of coal from barges or flats  while in the lock; and the emission of dense smoke from any vessel while  passing through the lock, is forbidden.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Vessels denied lockage. The lockmaster may deny the privilege  of passage through the lock to any vessel with sharp or rough projecting  surfaces of any kind, or overhanging rigging, or any vessel which is  badly leaking or in a sinking condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Fenders. All barges and oil tankers must be provided with  suitable nonmetallic fenders so as to eliminate damage to the lock or  approach walls and reduce fire hazard. Said fenders shall be used as may  be directed by the lockmaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Operating machinery. Lock employees only shall be permitted to  operate the lock gates, valves, signals or other appliances. Tampering  or meddling with machinery or other parts of the lock is strictly  forbidden.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(18)</em> Vessels to carry regulations. A copy of the regulations in this  section shall be kept at all times on board each vessel regularly  engaged in navigating this lock. Copies may be obtained without charge  from the lockmaster.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(19)</em> Failure to comply with regulations. Any vessel failing to  comply with this section or any orders given in pursuance thereof, may  in the discretion of the lockmaster be denied the privilege of passage  through or other use of the lock or appurtenant structures.
