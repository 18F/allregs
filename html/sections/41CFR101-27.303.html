                                Sec. 101-27.303  Reducing long supply.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Through effective interagency matching of material and requirements  before the material becomes excess,   unnecessary procurements and investment losses can be reduced. Timely  action is required to reduce inventories to their normal stock levels by  curtailing procurement and by utilizing and redistributing long supply.  (The term long supply means the increment of inventory of an item that  exceeds the stock level criteria established for that item by the  inventory manager, but excludes quantities to be declared excess.) In  this connection, requirements for agency managed items should be  obtained from long supply inventories offered by agencies rather than by  procurement from commercial sources. Because supply requirements usually  fluctuate over a period of time, a long supply quantity which is 10  percent or less of the total stock of the item is considered marginal  and need not be reduced.
