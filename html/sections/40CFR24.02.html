When the  order is issued unilaterally, the order shall be referred to as an  initial administrative order and may be referenced as a proceeding under  section 3008(h) or 9003(h) of the Act. When the order has become  effective, either after issuance of a final order following a final  decision by the Regional Administrator, or after thirty days from  issuance if no hearing is requested, the order shall be referred to as a  final administrative order. Where the order is agreed to by the parties,  the order shall be denominated as a final administrative order on  consent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The initial administrative order shall be executed by an  authorized official of EPA (petitioner), other than the Regional  Administrator or the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Solid  Waste and Emergency Response. For orders issued by EPA Headquarters,  rather than by a Regional office, all references in these procedures to  the Regional Administrator shall be   understood to be to the Assistant Administrator for Solid Waste and  Emergency Response or his delegatee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The initial administrative order shall contain:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A reference to the legal authority pursuant to which the order  is issued,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A concise statement of the factual basis upon which the order is  issued, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notification of respondent's right to request a hearing with  respect to any issue of material fact or the appropriateness of the  proposed corrective action.
