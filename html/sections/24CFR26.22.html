                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any party may serve upon any other party a written request for the admission of the genuineness of any relevant documents described in the request or of the truth of any relevant matters of fact. Copies of documents shall be delivered with the request unless copies have already been furnished. Each requested admission shall be considered admitted, unless within 30 days after service of the request, or within such other time as the parties may agree, or the hearing officer determines, the party from whom the admission is sought serves upon the party making the request either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A statement that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Denies specifically the relevant matters for which an admission is requested, or sets forth in detail the reasons why the party can neither truthfully admit nor deny them;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Fairly meets the substance of the requested admission and, when good faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of which an admission is requested, specifies as much of it as is true and qualifies or denies the remainder; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Does not assert lack of information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny, unless the party states that the party has made reasonable inquiry, and that the information known or readily obtainable by the party is insufficient to enable the party to admit or deny; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Written objections to a requested admission that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> State the grounds for the objection; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Object to a requested admission, if necessary, either in whole or in part, on the basis of privilege or relevance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responses to the request for admission on matters to which objections have been made may be deferred until the objection is ruled upon, but if written objections are made only to a part of a request, a response to the remainder of the request shall be provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any matter admitted under this rule is conclusively established unless the hearing officer, on motion, permits withdrawal or amendment of the admission. Admissions obtained pursuant to this procedure may be used in evidence only for the purposes of the pending action. The use of obtained admissions as evidence is permitted to the same extent and subject to the same objections as other evidence.</p><p class="depth2">Hearings</p>
