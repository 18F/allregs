                            <p class="depth0">Following the approval of a proposal, the CCC will enter into a  written agreement with the organization that submitted the proposal.  This program agreement will incorporate the proposal as approved by the  FAS, include a maximum dollar amount that may be reimbursed (the funding  level), and identify terms and conditions under   which the CCC will reimburse certain costs of the project. Program  agreements also will outline any specific responsibilities of the  participant, including, but not limited to, the timely and effective  implementation of program activities and the submission of a written  report(s), on no less than an annual basis, which evaluates the TASC  project using the performance measures presented in the approved  proposal.
