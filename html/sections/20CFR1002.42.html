                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If an employee is laid off with recall rights, on strike, or on  a leave of absence, he or she is an employee for purposes of USERRA. If  the employee is on layoff and begins service in the uniformed services,  or is laid off while performing service, he or she may be entitled to  reemployment on return if the employer would have recalled the employee  to employment during the period of service. Similar principles   apply if the employee is on strike or on a leave of absence from work  when he or she begins a period of service in the uniformed services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the employee is sent a recall notice during a period of  service in the uniformed services and cannot resume the position of  employment because of the service, he or she still remains an employee  for purposes of the Act. Therefore, if the employee is otherwise  eligible, he or she is entitled to reemployment following the conclusion  of the period of service even if he or she did not respond to the recall  notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the employee is laid off before or during service in the  uniformed services, and the employer would not have recalled him or her  during that period of service, the employee is not entitled to  reemployment following the period of service simply because he or she is  a covered employee. Reemployment rights under USERRA cannot put the  employee in a better position than if he or she had remained in the  civilian employment position.</p>
