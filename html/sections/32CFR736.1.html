                            <p class="depth0">Real and personal property under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Navy, exclusive of battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, destroyers, and submarines (referred to as warships in this part) and certain public domain lands and mineral interests, may be disposed of under the authority contained in the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 377), as amended (40 U.S.C. 471), in this part referred to as the Federal Property Act. The Federal Property Act places the responsibility for the disposition of excess and surplus property located in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, Guam, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands with the Administrator of General Services, and for disposition of such property located in foreign areas, with the head of each executive agency. The Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 451; 10 U.S.C. 7304, 7305, 7307) and Executive Order 11765 of January 21, 1974, (39 FR 2577) provide authority for the disposal of warships as well as other vessels stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. The United States Maritime Commission, however, is authorized to dispose of surplus vessels, other than warships, or 1,500 gross tons or more which the Commission determines to be merchant vessels or capable of conversion to merchant use (40 U.S.C. 484(i)). Accordingly, in disposing of its property, the Department of the Navy is subject to applicable regulations of the Administrator of General Services and the Secretary of Defense, and, in regard to potential merchant vessels other than warships, to determinations of the United States Maritime Commission. In general, property of the Department of the Navy, which becomes excess to its needs, may not be disposed of to the general public until it has been determined to be surplus after screening such property with the other military departments of the Department of Defense and all other agencies of the Government, and after it has been offered for donation to educational institutions, and law enforcement and marine research activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within the limitations indicated in the introductory paragraph of this section, the Department of the Navy is authorized to sell its surplus personal property under the authority of the Federal Property Act and the Act of August 10, 1956 (70A Stat. 451; 10 U.S.C. 7305), and to report its real property,

when excess to the needs of the Department of Defense, to the General Services Administration for ultimate disposition by that agency or the Department of the Navy. The Department of the Navy is also authorized to transfer real and personal property to other departments or agencies of the Government, and to sell, transfer and otherwise dispose of certain vessels and other personal property under special statutory authority. Ships other than warships are sold pursuant to the Federal Property Act (40 U.S.C. 484(i)) by the U.S. Maritime Commission if over 1500 gross tons and determined by the Maritime Commission to be merchant vessels or capable of conversion to merchant use. In certain cases, Navy vessels and other property may be transferred or otherwise made available to other agencies without reimbursement (sec. 616, 73 Stat. 381; 40 U.S.C. 483a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This part sets forth the general procedures and authority with respect to the disposition of property under the control of the Department of the Navy except disposition of property to foreign governments under the authority of such statutes as the Aid to American Republics Act (54 Stat. 396; 22 U.S.C. 521) and the Mutual Defense Assistance Control Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 644; 22 U.S.C. 1611-1613c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Department of Defense Material Disposition Manual and directives issued by the Department of the Navy cover the disposition of all property of the Department including disposition under the Federal Property Act. The Defense Material Disposition Manual is available on the internet at www.drms.dla.mil. Section XXIV of Navy Procurement Directives contains similar information applicable to the disposition of contractor inventory. These publications are available for inspection at the offices of the Commandants of the several Naval Districts; and at various Navy and Marine Corps installations.
