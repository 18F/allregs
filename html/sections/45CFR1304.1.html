                            <p class="depth0">This part describes regulations implementing sections 641A, 644(a) and (c), and 645A(h) of the Head Start Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 9801 et seq.). Section 641A, paragraph (a)(3)(C) directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to review and revise, as necessary, the Head Start Program Performance Standards in effect under prior law. This paragraph further provides that any revisions should not result in an elimination or reduction of requirements regarding the scope or types of Head Start services to a level below that of the requirements in effect on November 2, 1978. Section 641A(a) directs the Secretary to issue regulations establishing performance standards and minimum requirements with respect to health, education, parent involvement, nutrition, social, transition, and other Head Start services as well as administrative and financial management, facilities, and other appropriate program areas. Sections 644(a) and (c) require the issuance of regulations setting standards for the organization, management, and administration of Head Start programs. Section 645A(h) requires that the Secretary develop and publish performance standards for the newly authorized program for low-income pregnant women and families with infants and toddlers, entitled ``Early Head Start.'' The following regulations respond to these provisions in the Head Start Act, as amended, for new or revised Head Start Program Performance Standards. These new regulations define standards and minimum requirements for the entire range of Early Head Start and Head Start services, including those specified in the authorizing legislation. They are applicable to both Head Start and Early Head Start programs, with the exceptions noted, and are to be used in conjunction with the regulations at 45 CFR parts 1301, 1302, 1303, 1305, 1306, and 1308.</p>
