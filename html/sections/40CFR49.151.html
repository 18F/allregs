                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> What constitutes the Federal minor new source review (NSR)  program in Indian country? As set forth in this Federal Implementation  Plan (FIP), the Federal minor NSR program in Indian country (or  ``program'') consists of Secs. 49.151 through 49.165.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What is the purpose of this program? This program has the  following purposes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It establishes a preconstruction permitting program for new and  modified minor sources (minor sources) and minor modifications at major  sources located in Indian country to meet the requirements of section  110(a)(2)(C) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> It establishes a registration system that will allow the  reviewing authority to develop and maintain a record of minor source  emissions in Indian country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> It provides a mechanism for an otherwise major source to  voluntarily accept restrictions on its potential to emit to become a  synthetic minor source. This mechanism may also be used by an otherwise  major source of HAPs to voluntarily accept restrictions on its potential  to emit to become a synthetic minor HAP source. Such restrictions must  be enforceable as a practical matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> It provides an additional mechanism for case-by-case maximum  achievable control technology (MACT) determinations for those major  sources of HAPs subject to such determinations under section 112(g)(2)  of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> It sets forth the criteria and procedures that the reviewing  authority (as defined in Sec. 49.152(d)) will use to administer the  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> When and where does this program apply? (1) The provisions of  this program apply in Indian country where there is no EPA-approved  minor NSR program, according to the following implementation schedule:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Existing major sources. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you wish to begin construction of  a minor modification at an existing major source on or after August 30,  2011, you must obtain a permit pursuant to Secs. 49.154 and 49.155 (or a  general permit pursuant to Sec. 49.156, if applicable) prior to  beginning construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If you wish to obtain a synthetic minor source permit pursuant  Sec. 49.158 to establish a synthetic minor source and/or a synthetic  minor HAP source   at your existing major source, you may submit a synthetic minor source  permit application on or after August 30, 2011. However, if your permit  application for a synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor HAP  source pursuant to the FIPs for reservations in Idaho, Oregon and  Washington has been determined complete prior to August 30, 2011, you do  not need to apply for a synthetic minor source permit under this  program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Synthetic minor sources. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you wish to begin construction  of a new synthetic minor source and/or a new synthetic minor HAP source  or a modification at an existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic  minor HAP source on or after August 30, 2011, you must obtain a permit  pursuant to Sec. 49.158 prior to beginning construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor  HAP source was established pursuant to the FIPs applicable to the Indian  reservations in Idaho, Oregon and Washington or was established under an  EPA-approved rule or permit program limiting potential to emit, you do  not need to take any action under this program unless you propose a  modification for this existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic  minor HAP source, on or after August 30, 2011. For these modifications,  you need to obtain a permit pursuant to Sec. 49.158 prior to beginning  construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor  HAP source was established under a permit with enforceable emissions  limitations issued pursuant to part 71 of this chapter, the reviewing  authority has the discretion to require you to submit a permit  application for a synthetic minor source permit under this program by  September 4, 2012 and pursuant to Sec. 49.158, to require you to submit  a permit application for a synthetic minor source permit under this  program (pursuant to Sec. 49.158) at the same time that you apply to  renew your part 71 permit or to allow you to continue to maintain  synthetic minor status through your part 71 permit. If the reviewing  authority requires you to obtain a synthetic minor source permit and/or  synthetic minor HAP source permit under this program (pursuant to  Sec. 49.158) it also has the discretion to require any additional  requirements, including control technology requirements, based on the  specific circumstances of the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If your existing synthetic minor source and/or synthetic minor  HAP source was established through a mechanism other than those  described in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii)(B) and (C) of this section, you must  submit an application pursuant to Sec. 49.158 for a synthetic minor  source permit under this program by September 4, 2012. The reviewing  authority has the discretion to require any additional requirements,  including control technology requirements, based on the specific  circumstances of the source.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> True minor sources. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you own or operate an existing true  minor source in Indian country (as defined in 40 CFR 49.152(d)), you  must register your source with the reviewing authority in your area by  March 1, 2013. If your true minor source is not an oil and natural gas  source, and you commence construction after August 30, 2011, and before  September 2, 2014, you must also register your source with the reviewing  authority in your area within 90 days after the source begins operation.  If your true minor source is an oil and natural gas source, and you  commence construction after August 30, 2011, and before March 2, 2016,  you must register your source with the reviewing authority in your area  within 90 days after the source begins operation. You are exempt from  these registration requirements if your true minor source is subject to  Sec. 49.138.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If your true minor source is not an oil and natural gas source  and you wish to begin construction of a new true minor source or a  modification at an existing true minor source on or after September 2,  2014, you must first obtain a permit pursuant to Secs. 49.154 and 49.155  (or a general permit/permit by rule pursuant to Sec. 49.156, if  applicable). If your true minor source is an oil and natural gas source  and you wish to begin construction of a new true minor source or a  modification at an existing true minor source on or after March 2, 2016,  you must first obtain a permit pursuant to Secs. 49.154 and 49.155 (or a  general permit/permit by rule pursuant   to Sec. 49.156, if applicable). The proposed new source or modification  will also be subject to the registration requirements of Sec. 49.160,  except for sources that are subject to Sec. 49.138.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(C)</em> of the Act for  the construction and modification of minor sources and minor  modifications at major sources. Permits previously issued under this  program will remain in effect and be enforceable as a practical matter  until and unless the Tribe issues new permits to these sources based on  the provisions of the EPA-approved Tribal implementation plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> What general provisions apply under this program? The following  general provisions apply to you as an owner/operator of a minor source:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If you begin construction of a new source or modification that  is subject to this program after the applicable date specified in  paragraph (c) of this section without applying for and receiving a  permit pursuant to this program, you will be subject to appropriate  enforcement action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you do not construct or operate your source or modification  in accordance with the terms of your minor NSR permit, you will be  subject to appropriate enforcement action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If you are subject to the registration requirements of this  program, you must comply with those requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Issuance of a permit does not relieve you of the responsibility  to comply fully with applicable provisions of any EPA-approved  implementation plan or FIP and any other requirements under applicable  law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Nothing in this program prevents a Tribe from administering a  minor NSR permit program with different requirements in an approved  Tribal Implementation Plan (TIP) as long as the TIP does not interfere  with any applicable requirement of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)(1)</em> through (8) of this section need to be completed. The  processes for issuing general permits and synthetic minor source permits  are set out in Sec. 49.156 and Sec. 49.158, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must submit a permit application that meets the requirements  of Sec. 49.154(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The reviewing authority determines completeness of the permit  application as provided in Sec. 49.154(b) within 45 days of receiving  the application (60 days for minor modifications at major sources).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The reviewing authority determines the appropriate emission  limitations and permit conditions for your affected emissions units  under Sec. 49.154(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The reviewing authority may require you to submit an Air Quality  Impact Analysis (AQIA) if it has reason to be concerned that the  construction of your minor source or modification would cause or  contribute to a NAAQS or PSD increment violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If an AQIA is submitted, the reviewing authority determines that  the new or modified source will not cause or contribute to a NAAQS or  PSD increment violation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> The reviewing authority develops a draft permit that meets the  permit content requirements of Sec. 49.155(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> The reviewing authority provides for public participation,  including a 30-day period for public comment, according to the  requirements of Sec. 49.157.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The reviewing authority either issues a final permit that meets  the requirements of Sec. 49.155(a) or denies the permit and provides  reasons for the denial, within 135 days (or within 1 year for minor  modifications at major sources) after the date the application is deemed  complete and all additional information necessary to make an informed  decision has been provided.
