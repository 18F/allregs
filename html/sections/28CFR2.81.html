                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the prisoner is not serving a new, parolable D.C. Code sentence, the Commission's decision to grant or deny reparole on the parole violation term shall be made by reference to the reparole guidelines at Sec.  2.21. The Commission shall establish a presumptive or effective release date pursuant to Sec.  2.12(b), and conduct interim hearings pursuant to Sec.  2.14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the prisoner is eligible for parole on a new D.C. Code felony sentence that has been aggregated with the prisoner's parole violation term, the Commission shall make a decision to grant or deny parole on the basis of the aggregate sentence, and in accordance with the guidelines at Sec.  2.80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the prisoner is eligible for parole on a new D.C. Code felony sentence but the prisoner's parole violation term has not commenced (i.e., the warrant has not been executed), the Commission shall make a single parole/reparole decision by applying the guidelines at Sec.  2.80. The Commission shall establish an appropriate date for the execution of the outstanding warrant in order for the guidelines at Sec.  2.80 to be satisfied. In cases where the execution of the warrant will not result in the aggregation of the new sentence and the parole violation term, the Commission shall make parole and reparole decisions that are consistent with the guidelines at Sec.  2.80.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All reparole hearings shall be conducted according to the procedures set forth in Sec.  2.72, and may be combined with the holding of a revocation hearing if the prisoner's parole has not previously been revoked. If the prisoner is serving a period of imprisonment imposed upon revocation of his parole by the D.C. Board of Parole, the Commission shall consider all available and relevant information concerning the prisoner's conduct while on parole, including any allegations of criminal or administrative violations left unresolved by the Board, pursuant to the procedures applicable to initial hearings under Sec.  2.72 and Sec.  2.19(c). The same procedures shall apply in the case of any new information concerning criminal or administrative violations of parole presented to the Commission for the first time following the conclusion of a revocation proceeding that resulted in the revocation of parole and the return of the offender to prison.
