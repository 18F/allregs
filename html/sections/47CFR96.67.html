that reveals other operational information of any federal system that is not required by this part to effectively operate the ESC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> ESC equipment may be deployed in the vicinity of the Exclusion Zones and Protection Zones to accurately detect federal Incumbent User transmissions.</p><p class="depth2">Effective Date Note: At 80 FR 36222, June 23, 2015, Sec. 96.67 was added, however, paragraphs (b) and (c) contain information collection and recordkeeping requirements and will not become effective until approval has been given by the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
