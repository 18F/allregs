                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart prescribes the rules of practice for administrative  proceedings relating to the determination of an individual's fitness for  performing safety-sensitive functions under the Federal railroad safety  laws at 49 U.S.C. 20111(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of this subpart is to prevent accidents and  casualties in railroad operations that result from the presence in the  work force of railroad employees, including managers and supervisors,  and agents of railroads who have demonstrated their unfitness to perform  the safety-sensitive functions described in Sec. 209.303 by violating  any rule, regulation, order or standard prescribed by FRA. Employees and  agents who evidence such unfitness may be disqualified, under specified  terms and conditions, temporarily or permanently, from performing such  safety-sensitive functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart does not preempt a railroad from initiating  disciplinary proceedings and imposing disciplinary sanctions against its  employees, including managers and supervisors, under its collective  bargaining agreements or in the normal and customary manner.  Disqualification determinations made under this subpart shall have no  effect on prior or subsequent disciplinary actions taken against such  employees by railroads.
