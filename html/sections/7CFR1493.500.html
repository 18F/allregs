                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of default. If the importer fails to make payment pursuant to the terms of the importer obligation, the exporter or the exporter's assignee must submit a notice of default to CCC as soon as possible, but not later than 10 calendar days after the date that payment was due from the importer (the due date). A notice of default must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R. If the exporter or the exporter's assignee fails to promptly notify CCC of defaults in accordance with this paragraph, CCC may make the payment guarantee null and void with respect to any payment(s) applicable to such default. This time limit may be extended only under extraordinary circumstances and if such extension is determined by the Controller, CCC, to be in the best interests of CCC. The notice of default must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment guarantee number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Name of the country;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Name of the defaulting importer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Due date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Total amount of the defaulted payment due, indicating separately the amounts for principal and interest;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Date of importer's refusal to pay, if applicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Reason for importer's refusal to pay, if known.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Filing a claim for loss. A claim for a loss by the exporter or the exporter's assignee will not be paid if it is made later than six months from the due date of the defaulted payment. A claim for loss must be submitted in writing to the Treasurer, CCC, at the address specified in the Contacts P/R. The claim for loss must include the following information and documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Payment guarantee number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certification that the scheduled payment has not been received;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A certification of the amount of accrued interest in default, the date interest began to accrue, and the interest rate on the importer obligation applicable to the claim;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A copy of each of the following documents, with a cover document containing a signed certification by the exporter or the exporter's assignee that each page of each document is a true and correct copy:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The importer obligation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Depending upon the method of shipment, the negotiable ocean carrier or intermodal bill(s) of lading signed by the shipping company with the onboard ocean carrier date for each shipment, the airway bill, or, if shipped by rail or truck, the entry certificate or similar document signed by an official of the importing country;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(A)</em> The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The exporter's invoice showing, as applicable, the FAS, FOB, CFR or CIF values; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If there was an intervening purchaser, both the exporter's invoice to the intervening purchaser and the intervening purchaser's invoice to the importer;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An instrument, in form and substance satisfactory to CCC, subrogating to CCC the respective rights of the exporter and the exporter's assignee, if applicable, to the amount of

payment in default under the applicable export sale. The instrument must reference the applicable importer obligation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A copy of the report(s) of export previously submitted by the exporter to CCC pursuant to Sec. 1493.470(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subsequent claims for defaults on installments. If the initial claim is found in good order, the exporter or an exporter's assignee need only provide all of the required claims documents with the initial claim relating to a covered transaction. For subsequent claims relating to failure of the importer to make scheduled installments on the same export shipment, the exporter or the exporter's assignee need only submit to CCC a notice of such failure containing the information stated in paragraph (b) (1), (2), and (3) of this section; an instrument of subrogation as per paragraph (b)(4)(iv) of this section, and including the date the original claim was filed with CCC.</p>
