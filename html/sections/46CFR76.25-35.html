                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The system shall be so arranged and installed that a fire in any of the protected spaces will open the affected sprinkler heads. Water from the pressure tank shall be immediately available to the affected sprinkler head and before the supply from the pressure tank is exhausted, the sprinkler pump shall be automatically started and shall supply the system until manually shut off. Suitable test stations shall be installed in each zone to test the operation of the system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The system shall be so arranged and installed that the presence of a fire in any of the protected spaces will automatically be registered visibly and audibly in the pilothouse or fire control station. The visible notice shall automatically indicate the zone in which the alarm originated. On vessels over 150 feet in length, there shall also be an audible alarm in the engine room.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There shall be not less than two sources of power supply for the sea water pumps, air compressors and automatic alarms. Where the sources of power are electrical, these shall be a main generator and an emergency source of power. One supply shall be taken from the main switchboard, by separate feeders reserved solely for that purpose. Such feeders shall be run to a change-over switch situated near to the sprinkler unit and the switch shall normally be kept closed to the feeder from the emergency switchboard. The change-over switch shall be clearly labeled and no other switch shall be permitted in these feeders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Where subject to freezing, sprinkler systems shall be of the dry pipe type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The sprinkler heads, the cabinet, alarms, dry valves and actuating mechanisms shall be of an approved type.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> In general, the sprinkler heads shall be rated not lower than 135 degrees F. nor higher than 165 degrees F. However, in spaces where a high ambient temperature may be expected, sprinkler heads rated at 212 degrees F. shall be used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The automatic sprinkling system and all its components shall be used for no other purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All wiring and electrical circuits and equipment shall meet the applicable requirements of subchapter J (Electrical Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> All piping, valves, fittings, pressure tanks, etc., must meet the applicable requirements of subchapter F (Marine Engineering) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A framed chart or diagram shall be installed in the wheelhouse or control station adjacent to the detecting cabinet indicating the location of the various detecting zones and giving instructions for the operation, maintenance, and testing of the system. This chart, or a separate card or booklet to be kept near the chart, shall have tabulated spaces for the date and signature of the licensed officer of the vessel who shall witness or conduct the periodic tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> The audible alarms shall be identified as required by Sec.  78.47-13 of this subchapter.
