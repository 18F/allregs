                            <p class="depth0">Response to the safety at sea requirements in essence will involve  vessel inspection requirements. These inspection requirements may be  identified by reference to present laws and regulations. The primary  inspection statutes pertaining to United States flag vessels are: 46  U.S.C. 86 (Loadlines); 46 U.S.C.   395 (Inspection of seagoing barges over 100 gross tons); 46 U.S.C. 367  (Inspection of sea-going motor vessels over 300 gross tons); and 46  U.S.C. 404 (Inspection of vessels above 15 gross tons carrying freight  for hire). All United States flag vessels will be required to meet  existing regulatory requirements applicable to such vessels. This  includes the requirement for a current valid Coast Guard Certificate of  Inspection, as specified in Sec. 970.205. Being United States flag,  these vessels will be under United States jurisdiction on the high seas  and subject to domestic enforcement procedures. With respect to foreign  flag vessels, the SOLAS 74 or SOLAS 60 certificate requirements or  alternative IACS requirements, as specified in Sec. 970.205, apply.  [46 FR 45909, Sept. 15, 1981]</p>
