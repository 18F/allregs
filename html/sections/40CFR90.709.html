The manufacturer rounds these results to the number of decimal places contained in the applicable emission standard expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Final test results are calculated by summing the initial test results derived in paragraph (a) of this section for each test engine, dividing by the number of tests conducted on the engine, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard expressed to one additional significant figure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The final deteriorated test results for each test engine are calculated by applying the appropriate deterioration factors, derived in the certification process for the engine to the final test results, and rounding to the same number of decimal places contained in the applicable standard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If, at any time during the model year, the CumSum statistic exceeds the applicable action limit, H, in two consecutive tests for any regulated pollutant, (HC+NOX (NMHC+NOX) or CO) the engine family may be determined
