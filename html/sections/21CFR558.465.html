Type A medicated articles: 99.5 percent to 066104 in Sec. 510.600(c) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Conditions of use. (1) For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle, use 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid Type C feed (1.65 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) and wheat pasture bloat in cattle, use 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid Type C feed (1.65 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For control of legume (alfalfa, clover) bloat in cattle grazing of prebloom legumes, use 10.00 grams of poloxalene per pound of liquid Type C feed (2.2 percent weight/weight). Each animal must consume 0.15 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily for adequate protection. If consumption exceeds 0.2 pound of Type C feed per 100 pounds of body weight daily, cattle should be changed to a Type C feed containing 7.5 grams of poloxalene per pound.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Poloxalene liquid Type A article must be thoroughly blended and evenly distributed into a liquid Type C feed and offered to cattle in a covered liquid Type C feed feeder with lick wheels. The formula for the liquid Type C feed, on a weight/weight basis, is as follows: Ammonium polyphosphate 2.66 percent, phosphoric acid (75 percent) 3.37 percent, sulfuric acid 1.00 percent, water 10.00 percent, and molasses sufficient to make 100.00 percent, vitamins A and D and/or trace minerals may be added. One free-turning lick wheel per 25 head of cattle must be provided.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The medicated liquid Type C feed must be introduced at least 2 to 5 days before legume consumption to accustom the cattle to the medicated liquid Type C feed and to lick wheel feedings. If the medicated liquid wheel Type C feed feeding is interrupted, this 2- to 5-day introductory feeding should be repeated.
