                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The HOME Investment Trust Fund account established in  the United States Treasury is managed through a computerized  disbursement and information system established by HUD. The system  disburses HOME funds that are allocated or reallocated, and collects and  reports information on the use of HOME funds in the United States  Treasury account. (For purposes of reporting in the Integrated  Disbursement and Information System, a HOME project is an activity.) The  participating jurisdiction must report all program income in HUD's  computerized disbursement and information system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Project set-up. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the participating jurisdiction  executes the HOME Investment Partnership Agreement, submits the  applicable banking and security documents, complies with the  environmental requirements under 24 CFR part 58 for release of funds and  commits funds to a specific local project, the participating  jurisdiction may identify (set up) specific investments in the  disbursement and information system. Investments that require the set-up  of projects in the system are the acquisition, new construction, or  rehabilitation of housing, and the provision of tenant-based rental  assistance. The participating jurisdiction is required to enter complete  project set-up information at the time of project set-up.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the project set-up information is not completed within 20  days of the project set-up, the project may be cancelled by the system.  In addition, a project that has been committed in the system for 12  months without an initial disbursement of funds may be cancelled by the  system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disbursement of HOME funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After complete project set-up  information is entered into the disbursement and information system,  HOME funds for the project may be drawn down from the United States  Treasury account by the participating jurisdiction by electronic funds  transfer. The funds will be deposited in the local account of the HOME  Investment Trust Fund of the participating jurisdiction within 48 to 72  hours of the disbursement request. Any drawdown of HOME funds from the  United States Treasury account is conditioned upon the provision of  satisfactory information by the participating jurisdiction about the  project or tenant-based rental assistance and compliance with other  procedures, as specified by HUD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> HOME funds drawn from the United States Treasury account must be  expended for eligible costs within 15 days. Any interest earned within  the 15 day period may be retained by the participating jurisdiction as  HOME funds. Any funds that are drawn down and not expended for eligible  costs within 15 days of the disbursement must be returned to HUD for  deposit in the participating jurisdiction's United States Treasury  account of the HOME Investment Trust Fund. Interest earned after 15 days  belongs to the United States and must be remitted promptly, but at least  quarterly, to HUD, except that a local participating jurisdiction may  retain interest amounts up to $100 per year for administrative expenses  and States are subject to the Intergovernmental Cooperation Act (31  U.S.C. 6501 et seq.).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HOME funds in the local account of the HOME Investment Trust  Fund must be disbursed before requests are made for HOME funds in the  United States Treasury account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A participating jurisdiction will be paid on an advance basis  provided it complies with the requirements of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Project completion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Complete project completion information  must be entered into the disbursement and information system, or  otherwise provided, within 120 days of the final project drawdown. If  satisfactory project completion information is not provided, HUD may  suspend further project set-ups or take other corrective actions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional HOME funds may be committed to a project up to one  year after project completion, but the amount of HOME funds in the  project may not exceed the maximum per-unit subsidy amount established  under Sec. 92.250.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Access by other participants. Access to the disbursement and  information system by other entities participating in the HOME program  (e.g., State recipients) will be governed by procedures established by  HUD. Only participating jurisdictions and State recipients (if permitted  by the State) may request disbursement.  [61 FR 48750, Sept. 16, 1996, as amended at 78 FR 44679, July 24, 2013]</p>
