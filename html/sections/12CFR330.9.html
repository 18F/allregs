                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Separate insurance coverage. Qualifying joint accounts, whether  owned as joint tenants with the right of survivorship, as tenants in  common or as tenants by the entirety, shall be insured separately from  any individually owned (single ownership) deposit accounts maintained by  the co-owners.   (Example: If A has a single ownership account and also is a joint owner  of a qualifying joint account, A's interest in the joint account would  be insured separately from his or her interest in the individual  account.) Qualifying joint accounts in the names of both husband and  wife which are comprised of community property funds shall be added  together and insured up to twice the SMDIA, separately from any funds  deposited into accounts bearing their individual names.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of insurance coverage. The interests of each co- owner in all qualifying joint accounts shall be added together and the  total shall be insured up to the SMDIA. (Example: ``A&B;'' have a  qualifying joint account with a balance of $150,000; ``A&C;'' have a  qualifying joint account with a balance of $200,000; and ``A&B;&C;'' have  a qualifying joint account with a balance of $375,000. A's combined  ownership interest in all qualifying joint accounts would be $300,000  ($75,000 plus $100,000 plus $125,000); therefore, A's interest would be  insured in the amount of $250,000 and uninsured in the amount of  $50,000. B's combined ownership interest in all qualifying joint  accounts would be $200,000 ($75,000 plus $125,000); therefore, B's  interest would be fully insured. C's combined ownership interest in all  qualifying joint accounts would be $225,000 ($100,000 plus $125,000);  therefore, C's interest would be fully insured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Qualifying joint accounts. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A joint deposit account shall be  deemed to be a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this section,  only if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All co-owners of the funds in the account are ``natural  persons'' (as defined in Sec. 330.1(l)); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each co-owner has personally signed a deposit account signature  card; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each co-owner possesses withdrawal rights on the same basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The signature-card requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section shall not apply to certificates of deposit, to any deposit  obligation evidenced by a negotiable instrument, or to any account  maintained by an agent, nominee, guardian, custodian or conservator on  behalf of two or more persons.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All deposit accounts that satisfy the criteria in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, and those accounts that come within the  exception provided for in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, shall be  deemed to be jointly owned provided that, in accordance with the  provisions of Sec. 330.5(a), the FDIC determines that the deposit  account records of the insured depository institution are clear and  unambiguous as to the ownership of the accounts. If the deposit account  records are ambiguous or unclear as to the manner in which the deposit  accounts are owned, then the FDIC may, in its sole discretion, consider  evidence other than the deposit account records of the insured  depository institution for the purpose of establishing the manner in  which the funds are owned. The signatures of two or more persons on the  deposit account signature card or the names of two or more persons on a  certificate of deposit or other deposit instrument shall be conclusive  evidence that the account is a joint account (although not necessarily a  qualifying joint account) unless the deposit records as a whole are  ambiguous and some other evidence indicates, to the satisfaction of the  FDIC, that there is a contrary ownership capacity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nonqualifying joint accounts. A deposit account held in two or  more names which is not a qualifying joint account, for purposes of this  section, shall be treated as being owned by each named owner, as an  individual, corporation, partnership, or unincorporated association, as  the case may be, and the actual ownership interest of each individual or  entity in such account shall be added to any other single ownership  accounts of such individual or other accounts of such entity, and shall  be insured in accordance with the provisions of this part governing the  insurance of such accounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination of interests. The interests of the co-owners of  qualifying joint accounts, held as tenants in common, shall be deemed  equal, unless otherwise stated in the depository institution's deposit  account records. This section applies regardless of whether the  conjunction ``and'' or ``or'' is used in the title of a joint deposit  account, even when both terms are used, such as   in the case of a joint deposit account with three or more co-owners.
