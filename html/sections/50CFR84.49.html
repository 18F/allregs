                            <p class="depth0">All requests for additional monies for approved coastal wetland  grants will be subject to the entire review process along with new  grants. Any monies left over after the project is complete, or if the  project is not completed, should be returned to Headquarters for use in  following years. If a State has lands it wishes to acquire, restore, or  enhance in close proximity to the original project, and the Region deems  that spending project monies in these areas would provide similar  benefits, the Region may use unspent balances to pay for these projects  with prior approval from Headquarters. States must provide adequate  justification and documentation to the Regions that the lands acquired,  restored, or enhanced are similar to those in the original proposal and  provide similar benefits to fish and wildlife.
