The borrower shall  provide RUS with satisfactory evidence to enable the Administrator to  determine that the security for the loan is reasonably adequate and the  loan will be repaid on time. This finding is based on the following  factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Self-liquidation of the loan within the loan amortization  period; this requires that there be sufficient revenues from the  borrower's system, in excess of operating expenditures (including  maintenance and replacement), to repay the loan with interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable assurance of achieving the telephone market  projections upon which the loan is based.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Economic feasibility (based on projected revenues, expenses, net  income, maximum debt service, and rate of return on investment) for the  proposed system using local service rate schedules appropriate for the  area served.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Impact of the proposed loan and construction on the ratio of the  borrower's secured debt to assets.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Projected growth in the borrower's equity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Satisfactory experience and reputation of the system's principal  owners and manager.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A first lien on the borrower's total system or other adequate  security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Fair market value of the borrower's assets as represented in its  financial reports to RUS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Appropriate financial and managerial controls included in the  loan documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Other factors determined to be relevant by RUS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Area coverage. The borrower shall provide RUS with satisfactory  evidence to enable the Administrator to determine that adequate  telephone service will be made available to the widest practical number  of rural users during the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonduplication or certificate requirement. The borrower shall  provide RUS with satisfactory evidence to enable the Administrator to  determine that no duplication of service shall result from a particular  loan for those borrowers not required by the state regulatory commission  to have a certificate of convenience and necessity (or its equivalent).  For borrowers required to have a certificate of convenience and  necessity, all portions of the existing and proposed system must be  covered by the certificate.  [54 FR 13351, Apr. 3, 1989.
