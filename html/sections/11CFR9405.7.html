                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests for copies of Commission records under the FOIA shall  be made in writing and addressed to the Chief FOIA Officer, U.S.  Election Assistance Commission, 1201 New York Avenue, NW., Suite 300,  Washington, DC 20005. The request shall reasonably describe the records  sought with sufficient specificity with respect to names, dates, and  subject matter to permit the records to be located. A requester will be  promptly advised if the records cannot be located on the basis of the  description given and that further identifying information must be  provided before the request can be satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for Commission records and copies thereof shall specify  the preferred form or format (including electronic formats) of the  response. The Commission shall accommodate requesters as to form or  format if the record is readily available in that form or format. When  requesters do not specify the form or format of the response, the  Commission shall respond in the form or format in which the document is  most accessible to the Commission. In the interest of efficiency and  economy, the Commission's preference is to furnish records to requesters  in electronic format, whenever possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission shall determine within 20 working days after  receipt of a request, or 20 working days after an appeal is granted,  whether to comply with such request, unless in unusual circumstances the  time is extended. The 20-day period shall commence on the date on which  the request was first received by the appropriate component of the  Commission, but in any event, not later than 10 days after the request  is first received by the component of the Commission designated to  receive requests under this part. The 20-day period shall not be tolled  by the Commission except--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission may make one request of the requester for  information and toll the 20-day period while it is awaiting such  information that it has reasonably requested from the requester.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If it is necessary to clarify with the requester issues  regarding fee assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Under paragraphs (c)(1) or (2) of this section, the Commission's  receipt of the requester's response to the Commission's request for  information or clarification ends the tolling period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the event the time is extended under paragraph (c) of this  section, the requester shall be notified of the reasons for the  extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be made.  An extension may be made if it is--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Necessary to locate records or transfer them from physically  separate facilities; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Necessary to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a  large quantity of separate and distinct records that are the subject of  a single request; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Necessary for consultation with another agency that has a  substantial interest in the determination of the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the Commission determines that an extension of time is  necessary to respond to a request satisfying the unusual circumstances  specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Commission shall so  notify the requester and give the requester an opportunity to limit the  scope of the request so that it may be processed within the time limit  prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section or arrange with the  Commission an alternative time frame for processing the request or a  modified request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Commission may aggregate and process as a single request  requests by the same requester, or a group of requesters acting in  concert, if the Commission reasonably believes that the requests  actually constitute a single request that would otherwise satisfy the  unusual circumstances specified in paragraph (c) of this section, and  the requests involve clearly related matters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The Commission will process requests under the FOIA based on the  order they are received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Commission shall consider requests for the expedited  processing of requests in cases where the requester demonstrates a  compelling need for such processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``compelling need'' means, with respect to a request  made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency  to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal government  activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requesters for expedited processing must include in their  requests a statement setting forth the basis for the claim that a  ``compelling need'' exists for the requested information, certified by  the requester to be true and correct to the best of his or her knowledge  and belief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Commission shall determine whether to grant a request for  expedited processing and notify the requester of such determination  within   10 days of receipt of the request. Denials of requests for expedited  processing may be appealed as set forth in Sec. 9405.8. The Commission  shall expeditiously determine any such appeal. As soon as practicable,  the Commission shall process the documents responsive to a request for  which expedited processing is granted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any person denied access to records by the Commission shall be  notified immediately of the denial, including the reasons for the  decision and notified of his or her right to appeal the adverse  determination to the Commission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The date of receipt of a request under this part shall be the  date on which the Chief FOIA Officer actually receives the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Each request received by the Chief FOIA Officer will be assigned  an individualized tracking number. Requesters may call (866) 747-1471  and, using the tracking number, obtain information about the request,  including the date on which the Commission originally received the  request and an estimated date on which the Commission will complete  action on the request.
