                            <p class="depth0">If including the income deemed to you from your essential person causes you to be ineligible for an SSI benefit, you are no longer considered to have that essential person whose income makes you ineligible. To determine your eligibility for that month we deduct only your own countable income from your Federal benefit rate. However, other deeming rules may then apply as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Essential person is your spouse. If the person who was your essential person is your ineligible spouse, we apply the deeming rules in Sec. 416.1163 beginning with the month that the income of your essential person is no longer deemed to you.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Essential person is your parent. If you are a child under age 18, and the person who was your essential person is your ineligible parent, we apply the deeming rules in Sec. 416.1165 beginning with the month that the income of your essential person is no longer deemed to you.
