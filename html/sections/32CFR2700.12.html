                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General Policy. Documents or other material are to be classified  only when protecting the national security requires that the information  they contain be withheld from public disclosure. Information may not be  classified to conceal violations of law, inefficiency, or administrative  error, or to prevent embarrassment to a person, organization or agency,  or to restrain competition. No material may be classified to limit  dissemination, or to prevent or delay public release, unless its  classification is consistent with E.O. 12065.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. To be eligible for classification, information must  meet two requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> First, it must deal with one of the criteria set forth in  section 1-301 of E.O. 12065;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Second, the President's Personal Representative for Micronesian  Status Negotiations or his delegate who has original classification  authority must determine that unauthorized disclosure of the information  or material can reasonably be expected to cause at least identifiable  harm to the national security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Classification designations. Only three designations of  classification are authorized--``Top Secret,'' ``Secret,''  ``Confidential.'' No other classification designation is authorized or  shall have force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unnecessary classification, and classification at a level higher  than is necessary, shall be avoided. If there is reasonable doubt as to  which designation in section 1-1 of E.O. 12065 is appropriate, or  whether information should be classified at all, the less restrictive  designation should be used, or the information should not be classified.</p>
