                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You must pay a fee with the application to cover the costs to  the Federal Government of processing your application before the Federal  Government incurs them. The fees for Processing Categories 1 through 4  (see paragraph (b) of this section) are one-time fees and are not  refundable. The fees are categorized based on an estimate of the amount  of time that the Federal Government will expend to process your  application and issue a decision granting or denying the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> There is no processing fee if work is estimated to take one hour  or less. Processing fees are based on categories. These categories and  fees for 2005 are:</p><p class="depth2">2005 Processing Fee Schedule ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Processing fee per application as of June 21,</p><p class="depth2">Federal work hours    2005.

BLM will round these changes to the  nearest dollar. BLM will update Category 5 processing fees as specified  in the Master Agreement. You   also may obtain a copy of the current schedule from any BLM state or  field office or by writing: Director, BLM, 1849 C St., NW., Mail Stop  1000LS, Washington, DC 20240. BLM also posts the current schedule on the  BLM Homepage on the Internet at http://www.blm.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> After an initial review of your application, BLM will notify you  of the processing category into which your application fits. You must  then submit the appropriate payment for that category before BLM begins  processing your application. Your signature on a cost recovery Master  Agreement constitutes your agreement with the processing category  decision. If you disagree with the category that BLM has determined for  your application, you may appeal the decision under Sec. 2881.10 of  this part. If you paid the processing fee and you appeal a Processing  Category 1 through 4 or a Processing Category 6 determination to IBLA,  BLM will process your application while the appeal is pending. If IBLA  finds in your favor, you will receive a refund or adjustment of your  processing fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In processing your application, BLM may determine at any time  that the application requires preparing an EIS. If this occurs, BLM will  send you a decision changing your processing category to Processing  Category 6. You may appeal the decision under Sec. 2881.10 of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If you hold an authorization relating to TAPS, BLM will send you  a written statement seeking reimbursement of actual costs within 60  calendar days after the close of each quarter. Quarters end on the last  day of March, June, September, and December. In processing applications  and administering authorizations relating to TAPS, the Department of the  Interior will avoid unnecessary employment of personnel and needless  expenditure of funds.</p>
