Any information covered by a claim will be disclosed by EPA only as  provided in procedures set forth at part 2 of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If no claim accompanies a document at the time it is submitted  to EPA, the document will be placed in an open file available to the  public without further notice to the respondent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To asset a claim of confidentiality for information contained in  a submitted record, the respondent must submit two copies of the  document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> One copy must be complete. In that copy, the respondent must  indicate what information, if any, is claimed as confidential by marking  the specific information on each page with   a label such as ``confidential'', ``proprietary'', or ``trade secret''  and briefly state the basis of the claim.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If some information is claimed as confidential, the respondent  must submit a second copy of the record. The second copy must be  complete, except that all information claimed as confidential in the  first copy must be deleted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The first copy will be for internal use by EPA. The second copy  will be placed in an open file to be available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Failure to furnish a second copy when information is claimed as  confidential in the first copy will be considered a presumptive waiver  of the claim of confidentiality. EPA will notify the respondent by  certified mail that a finding of a presumptive waiver of the claim of  confidentiality has been made. The respondent will be given 30 days from  the date of receipt of notification to submit the required second copy.  If the respondent fails to submit the second copy within the 30 days,  EPA will place the first copy in the public file.</p>
