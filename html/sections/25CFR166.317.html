                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If improvements are to be constructed on Indian land, the permit must contain a provision that improvements will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remain on the land upon termination of the permit, in a condition that is in compliance with applicable codes, to become the property of the Indian landowner; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be removed and the land restored within a time period specified in the permit. The land must be restored as close as possible to the original condition prior to construction of such improvements. At the request of the permittee we may, at our discretion, grant an extension of time for the removal of improvements and restoration of the land for circumstances beyond the control of the permittee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the permittee fails to remove improvements within the time allowed in the permit, the permittee may forfeit the right to remove the improvements and the improvements may become the property of the Indian landowner or at the request of the Indian landowner, we will apply the bond for the removal of the improvement and restoration of the land.</p>
