Sec. 2920.5-2  Application content.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Applications for land use authorizations shall include a reference to the notice of realty action under which the application is filed and a description of the proposed land use in sufficient detail to enable the authorized officer to evaluate the feasibility of the proposed land use, the impacts, if any, on the environment, the public or other benefits from the land use, the approximate cost of the proposed land use, any threat to the public health and safety posed by the proposed use and whether the proposed use is, in the opinion of the applicant, in conformance with the Bureau of Land Management plans, programs and policies for the public lands covered by the proposed use. The description shall include, but not be limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Details of the proposed uses and activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A description of all facilities for which authorization is sought, access needs and special types of easements that may be needed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A map of sufficient scale to allow all of the required information to be legible and a legal description of primary and alternative project locations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A schedule for construction of any facilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Additional information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> After review of the project description, the authorized officer may require the applicant(s) to fund or to perform additional studies or submit additional environmental data, or both, so as to enable the Bureau of Land Management to prepare an environmental analysis in accordance with section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.); and comply with the requirements of the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (16 U.S.C. 470); The Archeological and Historic Preservation Act of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 469 et seq.); Executive Order 11593, ``Protection and

The authorized officer may require the applicant to furnish such documents, or proof of application for such documents, as part of the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The authorized officer may require evidence that the applicant has, or prior to commencement of construction will have, the technical and financial capability to construct, operate, maintain and terminate the authorized land use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The application shall include the name and legal mailing address of the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Business Associations. If the applicant is other than an individual, the application shall include the name and address of an agent authorized to receive notice of actions pertaining to the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Federal departments and agencies.

The applicant shall certify that there have been no changes in any of the information.


Sec. 2920.5-3  Application review.</p><p class="depth0">Every application shall be reviewed to determine if it conforms to the notice of realty action.

Sec. 2920.5-4  Competitive or non-competitive bids.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Competitive. Land use authorizations may be offered on a competitive basis if, in the judgment of the authorized officer, a competitive interest exists or if no equities, such as prior use of the lands, warrant non-competitive land use authorization. Land use authorizations shall be awarded on the basis of the public benefit to be provided, the financial and technical capability of the bidder to undertake the project and the bid offered. A bid at less than fair market value shall not be considered. Each bidder shall submit information required by the notice of realty action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-competitive. Land use authorizations may be offered on a negotiated, non-competitive basis, when, in the judgement of the authorized officer equities, such as prior use of the lands, exist, no competitive interest exists or where competitive bidding would represent unfair competitive and economic disadvantage to the originator of the unique land use concept. The non-competitive bid shall not be for less than fair market value.


Sec. 2920.5-5  Application processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> After review of applications filed, the authorized officer shall select one application for further processing in accordance with the notice of realty action. The authorized officer shall provide public notice of the selection of an applicant and notify the selected applicant, in writing, of the selection. All other applications shall be rejected and returned to the applicants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The selected land use applicant shall submit any additional information that the authorized officer considers necessary to process the land use authorization.</p>
