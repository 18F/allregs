                                Sec. 552.102  Live-in domestic service employees.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Domestic service employees who reside in the household where  they are employed are entitled to the same minimum wage as domestic  service employees who work by the day. However, section 13(b)(21)  provides an exemption from the Act's overtime requirements for domestic  service employees who reside in the household where employed. But this  exemption does not excuse the employer from paying the live-in worker at  the applicable minimum wage rate for all hours worked. In determining  the number of hours worked by a live-in worker, the employee and the  employer may exclude, by agreement between themselves, the amount of  sleeping time, meal time and other periods of complete freedom from all  duties when the employee may either   leave the premises or stay on the premises for purely personal pursuits.  For periods of free time (other than those relating to meals and  sleeping) to be excluded from hours worked, the periods must be of  sufficient duration to enable the employee to make effective use of the  time. If the sleeping time, meal periods or other periods of free time  are interrupted by a call to duty, the interruption must be counted as  hours worked. See regulations part 785, Sec. 785.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If it is found by the parties that there is a significant  deviation from the initial agreement, the parties should reach a new  agreement that reflects the actual facts of the hours worked by the  employee.  [40 FR 7405, Feb. 20, 1975, as amended at 78 FR 60557, Oct. 1, 2013]</p>
