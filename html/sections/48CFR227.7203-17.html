Do not use   the clause in contracts for special works.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the Government does not require unlimited rights, the  clause at 252.227-7032 may be modified to accommodate the needs of a  specific overseas procurement situation. The Government should obtain  rights to the computer software or computer software documentation that  are not less than the rights the Government would have obtained under  the software rights clause(s) prescribed in this part for a comparable  procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracts for Canadian purchases shall include the appropriate  software rights clause prescribed in this part for a comparable  procurement performed within the United States or its outlying areas.
