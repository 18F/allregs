The   request shall be clearly marked FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT REQUEST.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A request may not be combined with any other request to the  Board except for a request under 12 CFR 261a.3(a) (Rules Regarding  Access to and Review of Personal Information under the Privacy Act of  1974) and a request made under Sec. 261.22(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of request.

The Board need not accept or process a  request that does not reasonably describe the records requested or that  does not otherwise comply with the requirements of this section.

The  requester may submit a corrected request, which will be treated as a new  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Oral requests. The Freedom of Information Office may honor an  oral request for records, but if the requester is dissatisfied with the  Board's response and wishes to seek review, the requester must submit a  written request, which shall be treated as an initial request.
