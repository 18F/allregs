                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A corporation may elect under  section 46(a)(2)(B) of the Code to obtain an additional investment  credit for property described in section 46(a)(2)(D). This section  provides rules for electing to have the provisions of section  46(a)(2)(B) apply and for implementing an employee stock ownership plan  under section 301(d) of the Tax Reduction Act of 1975 (``1975 TRA'').  The plan must meet the formal requirements of paragraph (d), and the  operational requirements of paragraph (e), of this section. An  additional credit may be obtained for the periods described in   section 46(a)(2)(D). Unless otherwise indicated, statutory references in  this section are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 as in effect prior  to the amendments made by the Revenue Act of 1978.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reports. The returns required by section 6058(a) must be filed  on behalf of a plan established under paragraph (c)(7) of this section,  whether or not the plan is qualified under section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cross-references.

TRASOP</p><p class="depth0">securities. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. When used in this section, the terms listed below  have the indicated meanings:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> of this  section and may, but need not, be an ESOP under Sec.  54.4975-11 of this  chapter (Pension Excise Tax Regulations). See Sec.  1.46-8(d)(5)  concerning use of TRASOP assets as collateral for debts and expenses of  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(B)(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employer. An ``employer'' is a corporation that establishes a  TRASOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employer securities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. ``Employer securities'' are  common stock, and securities convertible into common stock, of the  employer or of a corporation that is a member of a controlled group of  corporations including the employer. Employer securities must meet the  requirements of paragraph (g) of this section. Membership in a  controlled group for purposes of this section is determined under  section 414(b) of the Code.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pre-1977 employer securities. In addition, employer securities  acquired by a TRASOP before January 1, 1977, include common stock, and  securities convertible into common stock, of a corporation in control of  the employer within the meaning of section 368(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Caution. An employer security under this section is not  necessarily a qualifying employer security as defined in section  407(d)(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA)  or section 4975(e)(8). Moreover, sections 406, 407, and 408 of ERISA in  certain cases limit the acquisition and disposition of qualifying  employer securities as defined in section 407(d)(5) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> TRASOP securities. ``TRASOP securities'' are employer securities  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are transferred to a TRASOP, or acquired with cash transferred  to a TRASOP, to obtain an additional credit, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided under paragraphs (g) (4) and (5) of this  section, or as required by applicable law, are subject to no other put,  call, or other option, or buy-sell or similar arrangement while held by  the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Publicly traded. The term ``publicly traded'' has the meaning  specified in Sec.  54.4975-7(b)(1)(iv) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Value--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. With respect to the transfer of TRASOP  securities by a corporation to a TRASOP or the   acquisition of TRASOP securities with cash transferred by a corporation  to a TRASOP, ``value'' means fair market value determined in good faith  and based on all relevant factors as of the date of transfer or  acquisition of the TRASOP securities. If the plan acquires TRASOP  securities from other than a disqualified person within the meaning of  section 4975(e)(2), a good faith determination of value includes a  determination of fair market value based on an appraisal independently  arrived at by a person who customarily makes such appraisals and who is  independent of any person from whom the TRASOP securities are acquired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Twenty-day average rule. A special 20-day average valuation  rule applies to certain publicly traded securities transferred by a  corporation to a TRASOP. It does not apply to securities acquired with  cash transferreed by a corporation to a TRASOP. Under the special rule,  the term ``value'' refers to an average of daily closing prices for a  security, as reported on any national securities exchange or as quoted  on any system sponsored by a national securities association, over the  20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the applicable last  day described in paragraph (c)(8)(i) of this section. The average is  based on the closing prices for each day when the security is in fact  traded during the 20-day period. However, the special rule does not  apply unless the security is in fact traded for at least 10 of the 20  days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 20-day average transitional exception. If a TRASOP security is  transferred before March 20, 1979, the plan may value the security on  the basis of the 20 consecutive trading days preceding the date on which  the security is transferred or the date as of which the security is  allocated to a participant's account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Compensation. ``Compensation'' means ``participant's  compensation'' under section 415(c)(3) and Sec.  1.415-2(d). However,  except for purposes of applying section 415, compensation must be  determined for a plan year, not a limitation year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Procedures for additional credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicable year--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  General rule. With respect to a qualified investment, the ``applicable  year'' of a corporation is generally the taxable year in which the  investment is made. For purposes of this section, an investment is made  either in a year when section 38 property is placed in service or in a  year when qualified progress expenditures are incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryover option. A corporation may determine the applicable  years for qualified investments made in any taxable year beginning after  December 31, 1976, under the following method: The first applicable year  with respect to the additional credit for a given year's qualified  investment is the year the qualified investment is made or, if later,  the first taxable year for which any additional credit is allowable if  claimed for that qualified investment. If there is an investment credit  carryover from the first applicable year, each taxable year to which any  part of the additional credit for that qualified investment is carried  over is also an applicable year. If the carryover treatment is elected  for the additional credit attributable to a year's qualified investment,  all applicable years for the additional credit attributable to that  investment must be determined under the carryover option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Increased credit. A taxable year in which a corporation's  additional credit is increased because of a redetermination is also an  applicable year. See paragraph (c)(9)(iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Illustration. To illustrate the application of paragraphs  (c)(1) (i) and (ii) of this section, assume that a calendar-year  corporation makes a qualified investment in 1977 and that 1977 is an  unused credit year described in section 46(b)(1). If the general rule is  applied, 1977 is an applicable year. However, because 1977 is an unused  credit year (at least with respect to the additional credit), if the  corporation does not elect to treat 1977 as an applicable year but  carries over its entire additional credit for 1977 to 1978 and uses it  in 1978, then 1978 is an applicable year. If part of the additional  credit is carried over further to 1979, the year 1979 is also an  applicable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Change in method. The choice between the general rule and  carryover   option methods of determining the additional credit attributable to  applicable years is made with respect to each year's qualified  investment, and does not bind the corporation with respect to selection  of methods for the additional credit attributable to other years'  qualified investment. A failure to comply does not occur merely because  a corporation elects to apply either method for the additional credit  attributable to separate years' qualified investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Time and manner of electing. A corporation with a qualified  investment must elect to be eligible for an additional credit by  attaching a statement of election--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> To its income tax return, filed on or before the due date  including extensions of time, for a taxable year not later than its  first applicable year with respect to a qualified investment, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a return filed before December 31, 1975, to an  amended return filed on or before December 31, 1975.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Statement of election. The statement of election must contain  the name and taxpayer identification number of the corporation. Also, it  must declare in the following words, or in words having substantially  the same meaning, that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of the  Internal Revenue Code of 1954 apply; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The corporation agrees to implement (or continue to implement,  as appropriate) a TRASOP and to claim the additional credit as required  by Sec.  1.46-8 of the Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Separate election. A separate election must be made for each  taxable year's qualified investment to obtain an additional credit for  that qualified investment. If a corporation does not make a timely  election to obtain an additional credit for a taxable year, it may not  subsequently make the election on an amended return or otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No partial election. An election to obtain an additional credit  applies to a corporation's entire qualified investment for a taxable  year. Thus, a corporation may not elect to obtain a partial additional  credit for any year's qualified investment. However, the partial  disallowance of an additional credit will not result in an election  being treated as a partial election. Also, an election by a member of a  controlled group of corporations that applies only to the electing  member's qualified investment is not a partial election. See Sec.  1.46- 8(h)(9) with respect to transitional rules for elections made before  January 19, 1979.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No revocation of election. After the time for electing the  additional credit has expired for a taxable year, a corporation may not  revoke its election for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Establishing a TRASOP--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A corporation electing to  obtain an additional credit must establish a TRASOP with accompanying  trust on or before the last day for making the election regardless of  when in fact the election is made. A TRASOP is considered to be in  existence on a particular date if it meets the requirements of Sec.   1.410(a)-2(c)(1). A new plan need not be established if an existing plan  qualifies as a TRASOP, or is amended to meet the requirements of this  section, on or before the last day for making the election. The  requirements of this section are not satisfied merely by establishing  and crediting a separate ``TRASOP'' account on the corporation's books.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Type of plan. A TRASOP need not meet the requirements of  section 401(a). However, it must be a stock bonus plan, a combination  stock bonus plan and money purchase pension plan, or a profit-sharing  plan under Sec.  1.401-1(b)(1) of this chapter. See section 301(d)(7)(A)  of the 1975 TRA for the tax consequences relating to a TRASOP that does  not meet the requirements of section 401(a). See also title I of ERISA  for additional provisions applicable to a TRASOP as an employee pension  benefit plan under section 3(2) of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Funding a TRASOP--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A corporation electing to  obtain an additional credit must fund its TRASOP by transferring TRASOP  securities or cash to it no later than 30 days after the applicable last  day. That day is the last day for electing the additional credit,  irrespective of when the election is actually made. However, in the case  of an investment credit that was carried over and claimed in a  subsequent applicable year by reason of   paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section, that day is the last day  (including extensions) for filing its income tax return for the  subsequent applicable year. TRASOP securities may be transferred to a  plan at any time during the applicable year, but not before the first  day of an applicable year. If TRASOP securities are transferred to the  plan within the permissible time period after the close of the  applicable year, they are treated as transferred during that applicable  year first until all TRASOP securities required by this paragraph (c)  for that applicable year are transferred to, and taken into account  under, the TRASOP. Thus, for example, assume that on a return filed on  September 17, 1979 (with extensions, the last day for filing a return  for 1978), a calendar-year corporation claims an additional credit of  $5,000 for 1978, an applicable year under the TRASOP. No contributions  were made in 1978 on account of the 1978 credit, but TRASOP securities  with a value of $6,000 were contributed in 1979. The corporation also  expects to be able to claim an additional credit of $10,000 for 1979.  TRASOP securities transferred between January 1, 1979, and October 17,  1979, must be taken into account under the plan for 1978 before they are  taken into account for 1979. Accordingly, securities having a value of  $5,000 are applied against the obligation for 1978, and $1,000 of the  contribution is retained to be applied to the eventual obligation for  1979.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cash transfers. A corporation may transfer cash to the TRASOP  instead of TRASOP securities only if the TRASOP uses the cash to acquire  TRASOP securities no later than 30 days after the time for funding the  TRASOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Valuation. The value of the TRASOP securities for an  applicable year must equal one percent of the corporation's qualified  investment for that year. However, if paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this  section is followed by a corporation, the value of TRASOP securities for  an applicable year must equal the amount of additional credit claimed  for that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Cash reserve. The value of TRASOP securities acquired with cash  transferred by a corporation may be reduced by two items. The first item  is an amount not more than the value of fractional shares allocable to  participants entitled to receive an immediate distribution at the time  of the transfer. The second item is start-up expenses and administrative  expenses to the extent permitted under section 301(d)(13) of the 1975  TRA and paragraphs (e) (6) and (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Conditional funding. The funding of a TRASOP may be conditional  if the TRASOP satisfies the provisions of section 301(d)(14) of the 1975  TRA. For purposes of section 301(d)(14), an investment credit is  considered to be allowed on the date the election for the applicable  year is made under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certain benefit offset mechanisms. A TRASOP will be deemed to  be not funded to the extent that TRASOP securities are used to offset  benefits under a defined benefit plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Claiming additional credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Section 46(a)(3)  subjects the amount of investment credit earned with respect to a  taxpayer's qualified investment for a taxable year to a limitation based  on the corporation's tax liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unused credit year. Section 46(a)(1) provides a first-in-first- out rule for the investment credit in a taxable year. Section 46(b)(1)  provides for the carryback and carryover of unused credits. If less than  all of a taxpayer's credit earned for a taxable year is allowable, the  10-percent credit determined under section 46(a)(2)(A) earned for a  particular year is allowed first. Any portion of the additional credit  for a taxable year that is not allowable may be carried back or carried  over to the extent permitted by section 46(b)(1). However, an additional  credit which is allowed for a taxable year is not reduced by a carryback  to that year of an unused credit from a succeeding taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. Paragraph (c)(9)(ii) of this section is illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. A calendar-year corporation begins operation and  establishes a TRASOP in 1975. The facts and treatment relating to the  corporation's qualified investments and investment tax credits for 1975  and 1976 are as follows:     ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1975        1976 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Facts:</p><p class="depth0">1. Qualified investment.......................    $500,000    $500,000</p><p class="depth0">2. Credits earned:</p><p class="depth0">a. 10% credit...............................      50,000      50,000</p><p class="depth0">b. Additional credit........................       5,000       5,000</p><p class="depth0">c. Carryover of additional credit from prior  ..........       3,000</p><p class="depth0">year, line 5...............................</p><p class="depth0">3. Sec. 46(a)(3) limitation                         52,000      47,000 Treatment of credits:</p><p class="depth0">4. Credits allowed:</p><p class="depth0">a. Carryover of additional credit...........  ..........       3,000</p><p class="depth0">b. Current 10% credit.......................      50,000      44,000</p><p class="depth0">c. Current additional credit................       2,000           0</p><p class="depth0">5. Unused credits:</p><p class="depth0">a. 10% credit...............................           0       6,000</p><p class="depth0">b. Additional credit........................       3,000       5,000 ------------------------------------------------------------------------   Thus, in 1975 the section 46(a)(3) limitation ($52,000) is applied first  to allow all of the 10-percent investment credit ($50,000). Accordingly  only $2,000 of the additional credit earned is allowed in 1975 and  $3,000 of the additional credit is carried forward to 1976. In 1976,  section 46(a)(1) requires that this $3,000 of additional credit is  allowed first, and then only $44,000 of the 10-percent credit earned in  1976 is allowed since the section 46(a)(3) limitation for that year is  $47,000. The unused credits from 1976 cannot be carried back since 1975,  the only prior year, is an unused credit year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em>, the date of the increase is  determined under paragraph (e)(9)(iii) of this section as if it were the  date of a reduction. Thus, for example, assume that a calendar-year  corporation claims an additional credit of $100,000 in 1978 because of a  qualified investment in that year. In 1980, the additional credit  attributable to 1978 qualified investment is redetermined to be  $110,000. With respect to the 1978 qualified investment, 1980 is also an  applicable year to the extent of $10,000. The increased credit is  reflected on the employer's return for 1980. The corporation must fund  the TRASOP with this $10,000 under paragraph (c)(8) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Redeterminations increasing tax liability. If a corporation's  tax liability for a year is increased such that an additional credit  carried forward and claimed in a later year is allowable in the earlier  year, the claim of the additional credit will be considered timely if it  was otherwise timely under this section. Thus, for example, assume that  a calendar-year corporation makes qualified investment of $5,000,000 in  1978 but, based on its income tax liability, is unable to use any of the  credit until 1979, when the entire $50,000 additional credit can be  used. The corporation adopts the TRASOP, elects the full $50,000 credit  and funds in a timely manner for tax year 1979. However, as a result of  a 1981 redetermination of the 1978 tax liability, the corporation is  able to use $30,000 of the additional credit in 1978 and the remaining  $20,000 in 1979. The allowable credit for 1978 is increased by $30,000  and the increase is treated as an unused credit carryover, for which the  year of redetermination, 1981, is the applicable year. Assuming that no  other credits are available, the 1979 credit is reduced from $50,000 to  $20,000, and this reduction is taken into account in the redetermination  year by offsetting the reduction against amounts due the plan or by  deducting the amount of the reduction. The adoption of the TRASOP for  1979, rather than 1978, is considered timely.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Deductions at expiration of carryover period. Under paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section, a corporation that uses no additional credit  in the year of a qualifed investment may nonetheless treat the year in  which the qualified investment is made as the first applicable year. If  the carryover period under section 46(b)(1)(B) expires before the  corporation uses the entire additional credit with respect to the  qualified investment, contributions attributable to the unused credit  are deductible, subject to the limitations of section 404(a), as if made  in the taxable year when the carryover period expires. The amount  deductible is the dollar amount of the unused credit irrespective of the  current value of the securities contributed with respect to the credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Formal plan requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. To be a TRASOP, a plan  must meet the formal requirements of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Plan year. To be a TRASOP, a plan must specify a plan year that  begins with or within the corporation's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Designed to invest primarily in employer securities. To be a  TRASOP, a plan must state that it is designed to invest primarily in  employer securities. A TRASOP intended to qualify as an ESOP under Sec.   54.4975-11 must state that it is designed to invest primarily in  employer securities. See paragraph (e)(10) of this section concerning  the requirement that a plan invest in employer securities on an ongoing  basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Separate accounting. To be a TRASOP, a plan must state that  TRASOP securities are to be accounted for separately from any other  contributions to the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Debts and expenses of the TRASOP. To be a TRASOP, a plan must  state that TRASOP securities cannot be used to satisfy a loan made to  the TRASOP or be used as collateral for a loan made to a TRASOP.  However, if the plan so provides, to the extent permitted under section  301(d)(13) of the 1975 TRA and paragraphs (e) (6) and (7) of this  section, certain amounts may be used for the TRASOP's start-up expenses  and administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Allocation of TRASOP securities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rules. To be a  TRASOP, a plan must provide for the allocation of TRASOP securities  under section 301(d)(3) of the 1975 TRA and this subparagraph (6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Timing. TRASOP securities are allocated as of the last day of  the plan year beginning with or within the appropriate applicable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Participants. Each employee who is a participant at any time  during the plan year for which allocation is made must receive an  allocation as of the end of that year even though not then employed by  the employer. However, to receive allocations, employees must satisfy  the minimum participation requirements of the plan (for example, 1,000  hours of service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Compensation considered. Under section 301(d)(3) of the 1975  TRA, allocations must be based on the proportion that each participant's  compensation bears to all participants' compensation. Compensation in  excess of $100,000 must be disregarded in making these allocations. A  plan may have a lower stated ceiling on compensation (from $0 to  $100,000) and if the plan has such a lower ceiling, compensation in  excess of this ceiling must likewise be disregarded. Also, allocations  must be based on a participant's compensation while actually employed,  not just while actually participating, in the plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> applies to a TRASOP when, under section 415(f)(1)(B), the TRASOP is  treated along with an employer's other defined contribution plans as one  plan for purposes of section 415.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Unallocated amounts. Under section 301(d)(3) of the 1975 TRA,  TRASOP securities unallocated for a plan year to participants' accounts  because of section 415 must be allocated proportionately to the accounts  of other participants until the addition to the account of each  participant reaches the limits of section 415.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Suspense account. If, after these allocations, TRASOP  securities remain unallocated, they must be held in an unallocated  suspense account under the TRASOP. Any income produced by these  securities must also be held in the account. A plan with such an account  will not fail to qualify under section 401(a) merely because of the  account. In each successive TRASOP plan year (whether or not an  applicable year), the unallocated assets are released from this account  for allocation on a first-in-first-out basis. They are then allocated to  the participants' accounts proportionately under paragraph (d)(6) (i)  through (vi) of this section for each later year until no   TRASOP securities remain unallocated. Value for this allocation is  determined under paragraph (b)(7) of this section as of the date of  transfer from the suspense account or, if the special 20-day average  rule applies, the value is determined on the basis of the 20 consecutive  trading days immediately preceding the date of transfer from the  suspense account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Escrow account. A TRASOP may provide for the establishment of  an escrow account instead of a suspense account. The escrow account must  satisfy paragraph (d)(6)(vii) of this section. The beneficiary of the  escrow account is to be the TRASOP. The corporation may establish the  escrow account and contribute stock or cash to it. In such a case, the  escrow agent must transfer assets to the plan each year equal to the  amount to be allocated proportionately under paragraph (d)(6)(i)-(vi) of  this section. Assets held in an escrow account are plan assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Treatment of certain plan terminations. To be a TRASOP, a plan  must provide that, if a plan terminates because the corporation ceases  to exist, unallocated amounts described in paragraph (d)(6)(vi) of this  section must be allocated to the extent possible under section 415 for  the year of termination. The remaining unallocated amounts must then be  withdrawn. These unallocated amounts are treated as recaptured under all  the rules of paragraph (e)(9)(vii) of this section except its last  sentence. See paragraph (d)(9)(i) of this section concerning  distributions of allocated TRASOP securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> No integration. No TRASOP may be integrated, directly or  indirectly, with contributions or benefits under title II of the Social  Security Act or any other state or federal law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Fractional securities. Participants' accounts are to be  allocated fractional securities or fractional rights to securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Accounting for amounts withheld by employer or paid by plan as  start-up or administrative expenses. An employer may withhold certain  start-up and administrative expenses from TRASOP securities due the  plan. Also, a plan may reduce amounts to be allocated to the extent that  certain plan assets are used to reimburse the employer, for example for  salaries of employees providing services to the plan, or to pay fees  directly to independent contractors for expenses. These expenses do not  reduce the amount of additional credit claimed and are not allowable as  expenses in computing taxable income. Additional rules concerning these  expenses are in paragraphs (e) (6) and (7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Nonforfeitability. To be a TRASOP, a plan must state that each  participant has a nonforfeitable right to allocated TRASOP securities.  For purposes of this section, forfeitures described in section 411(a)(3)  are not permitted. However, amounts shall not fail to be considered to  be nonforfeitable if the plan provides for their return to the  corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of conditional contributions, under section  301(d)(14) of the 1975 TRA and paragraph (c)(8)(v) of this section, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of investment credit recapture or an event deemed  to be a recapture, under section 301(f) of the 1975 TRA and paragraph  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Voting rights--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Provision for passthrough. To be a TRASOP, a  plan must state that each participant is entitled to direct a designated  fiduciary how to exercise any voting rights on TRASOP securities  allocated to the account of the participant. The plan need not permit  participants to direct the voting of unallocated TRASOP or other  securities held by the trust. It may authorize the designated fiduciary  to exercise voting rights for unallocated securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notification by the employer. To be a TRASOP, the plan must  obligate the corporation to furnish the designated fiduciary and  participants with notices and information statements when voting rights  are to be exercised. The time and manner for furnishing participants  with a notice or information statement must comply with both applicable  law and the corporation's charter and bylaws as generally applicable to  security holders. In general, the content of the statement must be the  same for plan participants as for other security holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fractional securities. To be a TRASOP, the plan must allow the  participants to vote any allocated fractional securities or fractional  rights to securities. This requirement is met if the designated  fiduciary votes the combined fractional securities or rights to the  extent possible to reflect the direction of the voting participants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Unexercised voting rights. To be a TRASOP, the plan may not  permit the designated fiduciary to exercise voting rights which a  participant fails to exercise. However, the plan may permit the  solicitation and exercise of participants' voting rights by management  and others under a proxy provision applicable to all security holders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Distributions--(i) In general. To be a TRASOP, a plan must  permit the distribution of allocated TRASOP securities only as provided  under section 301(d)(4) of the 1975 TRA. Also, under Sec.  1.401- 1(b)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this chapter, to the extent that a TRASOP is a money  purchase pension plan, it can only provide for a distribution in the  case of separation from service, death, or disability. No TRASOP may  provide for the distribution of TRASOP securities upon plan termination  within the 84-month holding period. For purposes of section 301(d)(4) of  the 1975 TRA, the 84-month holding period begins on the date as of which  TRASOP securities are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain fractional securities. A stock bonus TRASOP may  distribute cash instead of fractional securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Operational plan requirements--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. To be a TRASOP,  a plan in operation must meet the requirements of this paragraph (e).  However, the provisions under paragraph (e)(8) of this section apply  only to TRASOPs qualified under section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Compliance with plan provisions. To be a TRASOP, a plan must  operate in compliance with its provisions. Failure to operate in  compliance with plan provisions constitutes an operational failure to  comply. See paragraph (h)(5)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Compliance with certain Code provisions. To be a TRASOP, a plan  must meet the requirements of section 301(d)(7) of the 1975 TRA. Thus,  whether or not it is qualified under section 401(a), a TRASOP must meet  the requirements of section 401(a) with respect to allocations, section  410 with respect to participation, and section 415 with respect to  limitations on contributions and benefits. However, these requirements  are modified by paragraph (d)(6) of this section, relating to  allocations and section 415.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employee contributions. Under a TRASOP, the participants'  receipt of benefits attributable to TRASOP securities contributed for  the additional credit (but not the extra additional credit) must not  depend on contributions by participants. If a corporation has a plan in  existence which requires employee contributions, a portion of the plan  may be a TRASOP if employee contributions are not required with respect  to that portion of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Controlled group of corporations, etc. Whether or not a TRASOP  is qualified under section 401(a), all employees who by reason of  section 414 (b) and (c) are treated as employees of an electing  corporation are treated as employed by the corporation in determining  whether the plan satisfies the requirements of sections 301(d)(7) (B)  and (C) of the 1975 TRA. A member of a controlled group under paragraph  (b)(4)(i) of this section with a qualified investment but with no actual  employees may obtain an additional credit even though the only  participants in the corporation's TRASOP are actually employed by  another member of the controlled group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Start-up expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this section,  the term ``start-up expense'' means any ordinary and necessary amount of  a nonrecurring nature paid or incurred by the corporation or by the plan  in connection with the establishment of a TRASOP under paragraph (c)(7)  of this section. Thus, for example, start-up expenses may include  expenses relating to: the drafting or amending of plan documents to  establish a TRASOP under section 301(d) or (e) of the 1975 TRA, the  seeking of agency approval for these documents and related transactions,  the obtaining of shareholder approval for establishing a TRASOP, and the  registering of securities for initial funding of a TRASOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of start-up expenses. Start-up expenses may be  withheld by the employer from amounts that would   otherwise be due the plan under paragraph (c)(8) of this section, to the  extent that these amounts are known by the employer when funding first  occurs for an applicable year. To the extent that these amounts are not  withheld by the employer, the plan may pay remaining amounts from plan  assets within a reasonable time after the amounts are known by the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ceiling on start-up expenses. Reimbursement for start-up  expenses is limited to a ceiling. This ceiling is the sum of 10 percent  of the first $100,000 that an employer is first required to transfer  under paragraph (c)(8) of this section for an applicable year and 5  percent of that amount in excess of $100,000. If this first year is an  unused credit year from which there is a carryover, amounts required to  be transferred in subsequent years for claiming carryovers from this  first year are considered in determining this ceiling. Thus, for  example, assume that a calendar-year corporation first earns an  additional credit in 1977 of $9,000 and that $3,000 of this amount is  claimed on the income tax return for 1977, for 1978 and for 1979. The  corporation's ceiling on start-up expenses is $300 when its 1977 return  is filed. The total ceiling increases to $600 when its 1978 return is  filed and to $900 when its 1979 return is filed, with the claiming of an  additional $3,000 credit for each of the three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Special rule for taxable years ending before January 1, 1977.  Special treatment is available for expenses paid or incurred before  January 1, 1977, that were not taken into account in the manner provided  by section 301(d)(13) of the 1975 TRA. These expenses may be withdrawn  under paragraph (e)(9)(vii) of this section in the same manner as  reductions in the corporation's additional credit caused by a recapture.  This withdrawal may only be made during the first taxable year ending  after March 20, 1979. It is subject to the ceiling of section 301(d)(13)  of the 1975 TRA. Expenses previously deducted by a corporation must be  reduced on a timely-filed amended return by the amount of this  withdrawal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Administrative expenses--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this  section, the term ``administrative expense'' means any amount, other  than a start-up expense, paid or incurred by the corporation or by the  plan that is ordinary and necessary in maintaining the TRASOP. Thus, for  example, administrative expenses may include expenses relating to:  compensating plan fiduciaries and administrators, leasing office space  and equipment, reproducing and mailing information to participants and  beneficiaries, and filing reports, returns, and amendments relating to a  TRASOP. Paragraph (e)(6) (ii) and (iv), relating to treatment of start- up expenses and to a special rule for taxable years ending before  January 1, 1977, also applies to administrative expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of this section is  limited to the smaller of two amounts for each plan year. The first  amount is $100,000. The second amount is the sum of 10 percent of the  first $100,000 of dividend income paid with respect to TRASOP securities  held by the plan during the plan year ending with or within the  corporation's taxable year and 5 percent of any such dividend income in  excess of $100,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> TRASOP qualification under section 401(a)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Permanence. A  TRASOP is not required to be a qualified plan under section 401(a).  However, to meet the requirements of section 401(a), a TRASOP must be a  permanent plan, as described in Sec.  1.401-1(b)(2) of this chapter.  Under section 401(a)(21), a plan will not fail to be considered  permanent merely because the amount of employer contributions under the  plan is determined solely by reference to the amount of additional  credit allowable under this section. Thus, for example, it will not fail  to be considered permanent merely because employer contributions are not  made for a year for which an additional credit is not available by  reason of no qualified investment for which an additional credit can be  obtained. Section 401(a)(21) applies only to the extent the TRASOP is  funded with TRASOP securities and cash in lieu of TRASOP securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partial discontinuance of contributions. A plan that meets the  requirements of section 401(a) may receive contributions of TRASOP  securities as   well as other contributions. If the other contributions continue on a  permanent basis, the plan's qualification under section 401(a) will not  be adversely affected merely because TRASOP securities cease to be  contributed to it. The discontinuance of TRASOP contributions does not  alter the requirement that past TRASOP contributions remain invested in  employer securities. See paragraph (e)(10) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Income distribution. Income paid with respect to employer  securities acquired by a TRASOP may be distributed at any time after  receipt by the plan to participants on whose behalf such securities have  been allocated without adversely affecting the qualified status of the  plan under section 401(a). (See the last sentence of section 803(h), Tax  Reform Act of 1976.) However, under a TRASOP that is a stock bonus or  profit-sharing plan, income held by the plan for a 2-year period or  longer must be distributed under rules generally applicable to stock  bonus and profit-sharing plans qualified under section 401(a). Income  distributed by a TRASOP is not subject to the partial exclusion of  dividends provided in section 116, whether or not the income is held by  the plan for two or more years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Reductions in investment credit--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Certain  reductions in a corporation's investment credit result from either a  recapture under section 47 of the corporation's investment credit or a  redetermination of the allowable credit. If these reductions are taken  into account under a TRASOP, the plan may only use one or more of the  methods described in paragraphs (e)(9), (v), (vi), and (vii) of this  section for taking into account these reductions. Thus, for example,  more than one method is permitted upon a recapture with respect to a  qualified investment made in a particular year. However, the method  described in paragraphs (e)(9)(vii) of this section applies only to a  recapture and not to a redetermination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> does not apply to a reduction solely of the  additional credit as could occur, for example, in the case of a  redetermination caused by a mathematical error in computing the  additional credit or in the case of a recapture caused by a bad faith  failure to comply under paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em>,  relating to personal holding company tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Year for taking reduction into account. A reduction in  investment credit must be taken into account in the earliest year or  years possible under the applicable method beginning no later than the  year in which the date of the reduction falls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Decrease future contributions. The reduction may be taken into  account as a decrease in the value of TRASOP securities to be  transferred to the plan. The amount of the decrease is equal to the  dollar amount of the reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Deduct under section 404. On the date of the reduction, the  amount of the reduction may be treated as an amount paid to the TRASOP  for purposes of, and as a deduction to the extent allowed under, section  404.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Withdraw TRASOP securities. If an additional credit allowed  for a taxable year is recaptured, the corporation may withdraw from the  plan TRASOP securities transferred to, or acquired by, the plan for  claiming that year's credit. The withdrawal must only be from assets  segregated under paragraph (f)(2) of this section and must be first from  assets accounted for in an unallocated suspense account for   the particular year. The amount of assets actually withdrawn bears the  same proportion to the amount of assets subject to withdrawal as the  amount of additional credit recaptured bears to the amount of additional  credit claimed. Thus, for example, if the assets subject to withdrawal  consist of 300 shares of one class of employer stock and one-third of  the additional credit is recaptured, 100 shares of the stock are  withdrawn. However, if the current value of the assets subject to  withdrawal exceeds the dollar amount of the additional credit claimed,  assets may be withdrawn only to the extent that their current value does  not exceed the dollar amount of the recaptured portion of the additional  credit. Thus, for example, if the 300 segregated shares in the prior  example have a current value of $9,000 and the dollar value of the  additional credit claimed is $4,500, when one-third of the additional  credit is recaptured, only 50 shares, not 100 shares, are withdrawn.  Current value is determined under paragraph (b)(7) of this section as of  the withdrawal date or, if the special 20-day average rule is applied,  it is based on the 20 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the  withdrawal date. Withdrawals from an individual's account for the year  with respect to which recapture occurs must bear the same ratio to the  total amount withdrawn for that year as the individual's TRASOP account  balance for that year bears to the total TRASOP account balances for  that year. In the case of a TRASOP security acquired after March 20,  1979, the corporation may not withdraw it unless the plan meets the  requirements of paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section when the plan  acquires the TRASOP security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Prior distribution rule. If a TRASOP distributes an amount  allocated with respect to an investment credit for a taxable year and  the credit for that year is later recaptured, withdrawals may not reduce  participants' accounts below the level to which they would have been  reduced had the prior distribution not occurred. Recaptured amounts  above this level may only be deducted under paragraph (e)(9)(vi) of this  section. They may not be used to decrease future contributions under  paragraph (e)(9)(v).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Illustration. The operation of paragraph (e)(9)(viii) of this  section is illustrated as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example. For 1977, a calendar-year corporation claims an additional  credit of $10,000. The corporation's TRASOP meets the requirements of  section 301(f) of the 1975 TRA. Each of 10 participants under the plan  for that year receives an equal allocation of 10 shares valued at  $1,000. In 1978, one participant terminates employment and receives a  distribution of 10 shares. In 1979, a recapture reduces the 1977  additional credit by $2,000. The value of employer securities has not  changed from the allocation date. If the 10 shares had not been  distributed, 20 shares would be available for withdrawal, 2 shares from  each participant's account. Since 9 participants remain from 1977, only  18 shares are available for withdrawal (2 sharesx9 remaining  participants). If these 18 shares are withdrawn, the corporation may  take into account 2 shares by deducting their value to the extent  permitted under paragraph (e)(9)(vi) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Continued investment in employer securities. The requirement  that a plan be designed to invest primarily in employer securities is a  continuing obligation. Therefore, a transaction changing the status of a  corporation as an employer may require the conversion of certain plan  assets into other securities. See paragraphs (d)(9) and (g)(6) of this  section. In general, cash or other assets derived from the disposition  of employer securities must be reinvested in employer securities not  later than the 90th day following the date of disposition. However, the  Commissioner may grant an extension of the period for reinvestment in  employer securities depending on the facts and circumstances of each  case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> withdrawals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. No assets may be  withdrawn by a corporation under section 301(f) of the 1975 TRA unless  the assets are either TRASOP securities or plan assets into which TRASOP  securities have been converted (``withdrawal assets''). See paragraph  (e)(10) concerning restrictions on investment of TRASOP assets in assets  other than employer securities. Withdrawal assets must meet the  segregated accounting requirements of this paragraph. The physical  segregation of assets is not required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Segregated accounting. The segregated accounting requirements  are that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Withdrawal assets must be segregated from other plan assets on a  taxable-year-by-taxable-year basis; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Separate accounts must be maintained on a taxable-year-by- taxable-year basis for each participant on whose behalf withdrawal  assets are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Aggregate plan year accounting. Withdrawal assets for taxable  years beginning before October 4, 1976, also meet the segregated  accounting requirements if they are aggregated and accounted for in one  separate account apart from withdrawal assets in separate accounts for  later taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Requirements for employer securities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rules. The  term ``employer security'' does not include stock rights, warrants and  options. An employer security that is not common stock must at all times  be immediately convertible into common stock that is an employer  security at a conversion price which is no greater than the fair market  value of that common stock at the time the plan acquires the security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Common stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. To be an employer security, common  stock must meet certain voting power and dividend right requirements.  For purposes of this paragraph (g), stock held by the TRASOP is not  treated as outstanding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Voting power and dividend rights. To be an employer security,  common stock must have voting power and dividend rights which, when  taken together, are ``no less favorable'' than the voting power and  dividend rights of any other common stock issued by the employer. Common  stock which meets one of the following tests is ``no less favorable''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ten-percent shareholder test. The stock is part of, or identical  to, a class of outstanding stock of which at least 50 percent is not  owned by 10-percent shareholders. For this purpose, a 10-percent  shareholder is one who owns at least 10 percent of the outstanding  shares in a class, including shares constructively owned under section  318.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Substantial proportionality test. More than one class of common  stock is outstanding and an identical percentage of shares from each  class is transferred to the TRASOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Voting power test. The stock is part of, or identical to, the  existing class of stock having the greatest number of votes per unit of  fair market value. For example, assume there are only two classes of  common stock, Class A and Class B. Their fair market values per share  are $1 and $.50, respectively, and the owner of each share of each class  is entitled to one vote per share. Thus, Class B has two votes per $1  and Class A has one vote per $1. Accordingly, the Class B stock has the  greatest number of votes per unit of fair market value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Right of first refusal. TRASOP securities may, but need not, be  subject to a right of first refusal. However, whether or not the plan is  an ESOP, any such right must meet the requirements of Sec.  54.4975- 7(b)(9) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Put option. A TRASOP security that is transferred to a TRASOP  after September 30, 1976, must be subject to a put option if it is not  publicly traded when distributed or if it is subject to a trading  limitation when distributed. The provisions of Sec.  54.4975-7(b)(10)- (12) and Sec.  54.4975-11(a)(3) of this chapter apply to such securities  whether or not the plan is an ESOP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Change of employer security status. In general, a transaction  changing the status of a corporation as an employer, or as a member of a  controlled group of corporations including the employer, adversely  affects the status as employer securities of common stock and securities  held by a plan (``old employer securities''). However, to the extent  that the transaction causing the change in status of the old employer  securities does not result in a recapture under section 47 of any  investment   credit underlying the transfer to, or acquisition by, the plan of the  old employer securities, common stock and securities (``new employer  securities'') substituted for old employer securities are treated as if  they were the old employer securities if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The plan is not terminated,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The old employer securities and the new employer securities are  of equal value at the time of the transaction changing the status of the  old employer securities, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The new employer securities otherwise meet the requirements of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Failure to comply--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Effect of failure. If a  corporation elects under paragraphs (c)(2) through (5) of this section  to obtain an additional credit and fails to comply with respect to that  credit at any time, it is liable to the United States for a civil  penalty equal to the amount involved in the failure to comply. If the  corporation fails to comply with respect to an additional credit during  the 84-month period described in section 301(d)(4) of the 1975 TRA, the  credit is also recaptured. A separate failure to comply occurs for each  taxable year in which a failure continues to exist.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustration of continuing failure's effect. Assume that in  1975 an additional credit is allowed and a failure to comply occurs in  1975 with respect to that credit. Assume also that in 1976 the 1975  failure continues uncorrected, another additional credit is allowed, and  a failure to comply occurs with respect to the 1976 credit. Under these  circumstances, on the last day of 1976 three separate failures to comply  exist: (A) The 1975 failure with respect to the 1975 credit, (B) the  1976 failure with respect to the 1975 credit, and (C) the 1976 failure  with respect to the 1976 credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Assessment and collection. The civil penalty must be assessed  and collected in the same manner in which a deficiency in the payment of  federal income tax is assessed and collected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception. If a failure to comply is corrected within the  correction period described in paragraph (h)(5) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The corporation is not liable for a civil penalty; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the corporation establishes that at the time of the failure  a good faith effort to comply was made, its additional credit is not  disallowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Failure to comply (penalty classifications)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An  electing corporation fails to comply if a defect described in paragraphs  (h)(4) (ii) through (iv) of this section occurs with respect to an  additional credit allowed for a particular taxable year. The  characterization of the defect in this subparagraph (4) determines the  amount involved under paragraph (h)(8) of this section for the purpose  of assessing the civil penalty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Funding defect. A funding defect occurs if a corporation or its  TRASOP fails to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c) (8) or (9) of  this section, relating to funding a TRASOP and claiming an additional  credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special operational defect. A special operational defect  occurs if a TRASOP fails in operation to satisfy the requirements  described in paragraphs (d) (5) through (9) of this section, relating to  debts and expenses of a TRASOP, allocation of TRASOP securities,  nonforfeitability, voting rights, and distributions, or paragraph (e)(3)  of this section, relating to compliance with certain Code provisions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> may be formal or  operational in nature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Failure to comply (correction rules classifications)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. If for an electing corporation a defect described in paragraph  (h)(4) of this section occurs, the procedure for correcting the failure  to comply depends upon whether the failure is classified as a ``formal''  failure or an ``operational'' failure under this subparagraph (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Formal failure to comply. Formal failures are corrected by  retroactive amendment. If a formal plan requirement is not met, the plan  must be retroactively amended by no later than the expiration of the  correction period under paragraph (h)(6) of this section.   A plan fails to meet a formal plan requirement of paragraph (d) of this  section if, for example, it does not state, as required by paragraph  (d)(3) of this section, that it is designed to invest primarily in  employer securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Operational failure to comply. Operational failures are  corrected by undoing the defective transaction and by making the plan  and the participants whole. If the value of TRASOP securities  transferred to the TRASOP is less than the amount of the additional  credit, the corporation must make up any resulting funding deficiency  within the correction period. This is done, for example, by contributing  additional TRASOP securities plus an amount equal to the dividends or  interest that would have been paid between the time that the TRASOP  securities should have been transferred and the actual time for the  transfer. The contribution of additional TRASOP securities is based on  their value under paragraph (b)(7) of this section as of the date by  which they were required to be transferred to the plan. An electing  corporation fails to meet an obligation undertaken under this section  if, for example, it fails to comply with paragraph (c)(8) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Correction period--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of this  paragraph (h), the ``correction period'' begins when the failure to  comply occurs and ends 90 days after receipt by the corporation of a  notice of deficiency under section 6212 with respect to the civil  penalty and the investment credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, and (iv)  of this chapter (Foundation Excise Tax Regulations). For this purpose, a  failure to comply is treated as an act of self-dealing, the corporation  is treated as a foundation, and a civil penalty is treated as a tax  under section 4941(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em>, reasonable reliance on Technical  Information Release 1413 (1975-50 I.R.B. 16), questions and answers  relating to ESOP's, is a good faith effort to comply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Amount involved--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The amount involved in a  failure to comply is an amount described in this subparagraph (8). A  maximum amount and a minimum amount are determined with respect to an  additional credit allowed for a particular taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Maximum amount involved. Notwithstanding any other rule in this  paragraph (h), all amounts involved with respect to an additional credit  allowed for a particular taxable year may not exceed the amount of that  credit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Minimum amount involved. The minimum amount is \1/2\ of one  percent of the additional credit times the number of full months, or  parts of full months, during which the failure to comply exists. ``Full  month'' has the meaning assigned in Sec.  1.1250-1(d)(4) (realty  depreciation recapture).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Funding amount involved. The amount involved for a funding  defect is the greater of the minimum amount involved or the amount  required to place the plan in the position it would have been in if no  funding defect had occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Special operational amount involved. The amount involved for a  special operational defect is the maximum amount involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> De minimis amount involved. The amount involved for a de  minimis defect is the minimum amount involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Certain permissible actions--(i) Elections prior to January 19,  1979. A corporation does not fail to comply (within the meaning of this  paragraph (h)) merely because it revokes an election made prior to  January 19, 1979, under the general rule described in paragraph  (c)(1)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this section and with respect to which no additional credit  was claimed in the taxable year for which   the election was made. Such a revocation is permitted irrespective of  whether the carryover option described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) is  elected with respect to qualified investment made in a year for which a  general rule election is revoked.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pro rata use of credit. A corporation does not fail to comply  merely because, for an applicable year ending prior to January 19, 1979,  it provides for pro rata use of the regular 10-percent credit and the 1- percent additional credit to the extent that less than all of a  taxpayer's credit earned for a taxable year is allowable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transitional rule. The Commissioner, based on the particular  facts and circumstances of individual cases, may determine that a good  faith failure to comply before January 19, 1979, with a final or  temporary rule adopted under this section on or after that date does not  require retroactive correction under paragraph (h)(5)(ii) of this  section.
