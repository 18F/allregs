                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this standard is to reduce danger of injury and loss of life by providing, on a national basis, standard methods of testing and rating the flammability of textiles and textile products for clothing use, thereby prohibiting the use of any dangerously flammable clothing textiles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The Standard provides methods of testing the flammability of clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing, establishes three classes of flammability, sets forth the requirements which textiles shall meet to be classified, and warns against the use of those textiles which have burning characteristics unsuitable for clothing. Hereafter, ``clothing and textiles intended to be used for clothing'' shall be referred to as ``textiles.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specific exceptions. This standard shall not apply to: (1) Hats, provided they do not constitute or form part of a covering for the neck, face, or shoulders when worn by individuals;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Gloves, provided they are not more than 14 inches in length and are not affixed to or do not form an integral part of another garment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Footwear, provided it does not consist of hosiery in whole or part and is not affixed to or does not form an integral part of another garment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Interlining fabrics, when intended or sold for use as a layer between an outer shell and an inner lining in wearing apparel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Specific exemptions. Experience gained from years of testing in accordance with the Standard demonstrates that certain fabrics consistently yield acceptable results when tested in accordance with the Standard. Therefore, persons and firms issuing an initial guaranty of any of the following types of fabrics, or of products made entirely from one or more of these fabrics, are exempt from any requirement for testing to support guaranties of those fabrics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Plain surface fabrics, regardless of fiber content, weighing 2.6 ounces per square yard or more; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All fabrics, both plain surface and raised-fiber surface textiles, regardless of weight, made entirely from any of the following fibers or entirely from combination of the following fibers: acrylic, modacrylic, nylon, olefin, polyester, wool.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Applicability. The requirements of this part 1610 shall apply to textile fabric or related material in a form or state ready for use in an article of wearing apparel, including garments and costumes finished for consumer use.</p>
