                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Argentina and the Mexican States of Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Yucatan, which are declared in Sec. 94.6(a)(1) to be free of Newcastle disease, supplement their meat supply by the importation of fresh (chilled or frozen) poultry meat from regions designated in Sec. 94.6(a) as regions where Newcastle disease is considered to exist, have a common land border with regions where Newcastle disease is considered to

exist, or import live poultry from regions where Newcastle disease is considered to exist under conditions less restrictive than would be acceptable for importation into the United States. Thus, even though the Department has declared such regions to be free of Newcastle disease, live poultry originating in such free regions may be commingled with live poultry originating in an Newcastle disease-affected region and the meat and other animal products produced in such free regions may be commingled with the fresh (chilled or frozen) meat of animals from an Newcastle disease-affected region, resulting in an undue risk of introducing Newcastle disease into the United States. Therefore, live poultry, poultry meat and other poultry products, and ship stores, airplane meals, and baggage containing such meat or animal products originating in the free regions listed in this section may not be imported into the United States unless the following requirements, in addition to all other applicable requirements of part 93 of this chapter and of chapter III of this title, are met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Additional certification. Live poultry, poultry meat, and other poultry products from any region designated in this section must be accompanied by an additional certification by a full-time salaried veterinary officer of the national Government of the exporting region. Upon arrival of the live poultry, poultry meat, or other poultry product in the United States, the certification must be presented to an authorized inspector at the port of arrival.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Live poultry. The certification accompanying live poultry must identify the exporting region of the poultry as a region designated in Sec. 94.6(a) as free of Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza at the time the poultry were in the region and must state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The poultry have not been in contact with poultry or poultry products from any region where Newcastle disease is considered to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The poultry have not lived in a region where Newcastle disease is considered to exist; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The poultry have not transited through a region where Newcastle disease is considered to exist unless moved directly through the region in a sealed means of conveyance with the seal intact upon arrival at the point of destination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Poultry meat or other poultry products. The certification accompanying poultry meat or other poultry products must state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The poultry meat or other poultry products are derived from poultry that meet all requirements of this section and that have been slaughtered in a region designated in Sec. 94.6(a) as free of Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza at a federally inspected slaughter plant that is under the direct supervision of a full-time salaried veterinarian of the national Government of the exporting region and that is approved to export poultry meat and other poultry products to the United States in accordance with Sec. 381.196 of this title;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The poultry meat or other poultry products have not been in contact with poultry meat or other poultry products from any region where Newcastle disease is considered to exist;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The poultry meat or other poultry products have not transited through a region where Newcastle disease is considered to exist unless moved directly through the region in a sealed means of conveyance with the seal intact upon arrival at the point of destination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If processed, the poultry meat or other poultry products were processed in a region designated in Sec. 94.6(a) as free of Newcastle disease and highly pathogenic avian influenza in a federally inspected processing plant that is under the direct supervision of a full-time salaried veterinarian of the national Government of the exporting region.
