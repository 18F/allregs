                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Geographic location of listed activities. Each coastal State  intending to conduct a consistency review of federal activities  occurring in another State shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> List those Federal agency activities, federal license or permit  activities, and federal assistance activities that the State intends to  routinely review for consistency; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Generally describe the geographic location for each type of  listed activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In establishing the geographic location of interstate  consistency review, each State must notify and consult with the State in  which the listed activity will occur, as well as with relevant Federal  agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Demonstrate effects. In describing the geographic location for  interstate consistency reviews, the State agency shall provide  information to the Director that coastal effects from listed activities  occurring within the geographic area are reasonably foreseeable. Listed  activities may have different geographic location descriptions,  depending on the nature of the activity and its effects on any coastal  use or resource. For example, the geographic location for activities  affecting water resources or uses could be described by shared water  bodies, river basins, boundaries under the State's coastal nonpoint  pollution control program, or other ecologically identifiable areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Director approval. State agencies shall submit their lists and  geographic location descriptions developed under this section to the  Director for approval as a routine program change under subpart H of 15  CFR part 923. Each State submitting this program change shall include  evidence of consultation with States in which the activity will occur,  evidence of consultation with relevant Federal agencies, and any  agreements with other States and Federal agencies regarding coordination  of activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> State failure to list interstate activities. A coastal State  that fails to list federal activities subject to interstate review, or  to describe the geographic location for these activities, under  paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, may not exercise its right  to review activities occurring in other States, until the State meets  the listing requirements. The listing of activities subject to  interstate consistency review, and the description of the geographic  location for those listed activities, should ensure that coastal States  have the opportunity to review relevant activities occurring in other  States. States may amend their lists and geographic location  descriptions pursuant to the requirements of this subpart and subpart H  of 15 CFR part 923. States which have complied with paragraphs (a)  through (d) of this section may also use the procedure at Sec. 930.54  to review unlisted activities. States will have a transition period of  18 months from the date this rule takes effect. In that time a State may  review an interstate activity pursuant to Sec. 930.54 of this part.  After the transition period States must comply with this subpart in  order to review interstate activities.</p>
