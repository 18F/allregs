                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. (1) BIS may request the licensee to obtain verifications of delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate (DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimate destination after the export has taken place and the items have either entered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or are otherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government. Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> BIS may request the licensee to obtain verifications of delivery on a selective basis. A Delivery Verification Certificate (DV) is a document issued by the government of the country of ultimate destination after the export has taken place and the items have either entered the export jurisdiction of the recipient country or are otherwise accounted for by the importer to the issuing government. Governments that issue DVs are listed in Supplement No. 4 to this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If BIS decides to request verification of delivery, the request will appear as a condition on the face of the license. If the license is sent directly to a party other than the applicant authorized to receive the license (e.g., agent, forwarder, broker, etc.), such party is responsible for notifying the licensee immediately in writing that a DV is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exception to obtaining Delivery Verification. The DV requirement for a particular transaction does not apply if the item is no longer controlled for national security reasons following the issuance of a license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for obtaining Delivery Verification. When notified that a DV is required by BIS, the licensee must transmit to the importer a written request for a DV at the time of making each shipment under the license (whenever possible, this request should be submitted together with the related

bill of lading or air waybill). The request must include the number of the Import or End-User Certificate for the transaction referred to on the license, and notify the importer that this same Import or End-User Certificate number should be shown on the DV.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The importer must obtain the DV from the appropriate government ministry identified in Supplement No. 4 to this part, and forward the completed DV to the licensee. The DV must cover the items described on the license that have been shipped. Note that BIS must be able to relate the description provided in the DV to the approved license. In order to ensure the same terminology is used, the licensee should provide the importer with the description as it appears on the license.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The original copy of the DV must be sent to BIS within 90 days after the last shipment has been made against the license. If verification of delivery is required for items covered by a license against which partial shipments have been made, the licensee shall obtain the required DV for each partial shipment, and retain these on file until all shipments have been made against the license. Once all shipments against the license have been made (or the licensee has determined that none will be), the licensee must forward, in one package, all applicable DVs to Office of Exporter Services, Export Management and Compliance Division, Room 2099B, U.S. Department of Commerce, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The documents must be forwarded with a dated letter giving the license number, the name, title and signature of the authorized representative, and one of the following statements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total quantity authorized by license number ------ has been exported, and all delivery verification documents are attached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A part of the quantity authorized by license number ------ will not be exported. Delivery verification documents covering all items exported are attached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> No shipment has been made against this license, and none is contemplated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inability to obtain Delivery Verification Certificates. If a licensee is unable to obtain the required DV (within the time frame stated above, or at all) from the importer, the licensee must promptly notify BIS and, upon request, make available all information and records, including correspondence, regarding the attempt to obtain the DV.
