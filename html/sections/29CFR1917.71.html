Empty containers shall be  identified before loading or discharge in such a manner as will inform  every supervisor and foreman on the site and in charge of loading or  discharging, or every crane or other hoisting equipment operator and  signalman, if any, that such container is empty. Methods of  identification may include cargo plans, manifests or markings on the  container.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a loaded container:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual gross weight shall be plainly marked so as to be  visible to the crane or other hoisting equipment operator or signalman,  or to every supervisor and foreman on the site and in charge of the  operation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cargo stowage plan or equivalent permanently recorded  display serving the same purpose, containing the actual gross weight and  the serial number or other positive identification of that specific  container, shall be provided to the crane or other hoisting equipment  operator and signalman, if any, and to every supervisor and foreman on  the site and in charge of the operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Every outbound loaded container which is received at a marine  terminal ready to load aboard a vessel without further consolidation or  loading shall be weighed to obtain the actual gross weight, either at  the terminal or elsewhere, before being hoisted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When container weighing scales are located at a marine  terminal, any outbound container with a load consolidated at that  terminal shall be weighed to obtain an actual weight before being  hoisted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the terminal has no scales, the actual gross weight may be  calculated on the basis of the container's contents and the container's  empty weight.
