                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public notice of competitive bidding procedures. Detailed competitive bidding procedures shall be established by public notice prior to the commencement of the reverse auction, including without limitation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Sequencing. The sequencing with which the reverse auction and the related forward auction assigning new spectrum licenses will occur.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reserve price. Reserve prices, either disclosed or undisclosed, so that higher bids for various reverse auction bid options would not win in the reverse auction. Reserve prices may apply individually, in combination, or in the aggregate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Opening bids and bid increments. Maximum or minimum opening bids, and by announcement before or during the reverse auction, maximum or minimum bid increments in dollar or percentage terms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Activity rules. Activity rules that require a minimum amount of bidding activity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Binding obligation. A bid is an unconditional, irrevocable offer by the bidder to fulfill the terms of the bid. The Commission accepts the offer by identifying the bid as winning. A bidder has a binding obligation to fulfill the terms of a winning bid. A winning bidder will relinquish spectrum usage rights pursuant to the terms of any winning bid by the deadline set forth in Sec. 73.3700(b)(4) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Stopping procedures. Before or during the reverse auction, procedures may be established regarding when bidding will stop for a round, a stage, or an entire auction, in order to terminate the auction within a reasonable time and in accordance with public interest considerations and the goals, statutory requirements, rules, and procedures for the auction, including any reserve price or prices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Auction delay, suspension, or cancellation. By public notice or by announcement during the reverse auction, the auction may be delayed, suspended, or cancelled in the event of a natural disaster, technical obstacle, network disruption, evidence of an auction security breach or unlawful bidding activity, administrative or weather necessity, or for any other reason that affects the fair and efficient conduct of the competitive bidding. The Commission has the authority, at its sole discretion, to resume the competitive bidding starting from the beginning of the current or some previous round or cancel the competitive bidding in its entirety.</p>
