This application will include instructions to assist the retiree in estimating the amount of reduction in the annuity to provide the current spouse annuity and the amount of the required deposit. The application

form will include a notice to retirees that filing the application constitutes an official election which cannot be revoked after 30 days after the annuity check in which the annuity reduction first appears.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In response to a retiree's inquiry about providing a current spouse annuity under this section, OPM will send an application form.

If the application is made under paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section, the retiree must prove that he or she had attempted to elect a fully reduced annuity and that OPM rejected that application because it was filed too late. The proof must consist of a copy of OPM's letter rejecting the previous election as untimely filed or an affidavit swearing or affirming that he or she made an untimely application which OPM rejected. The affidavit is sufficient documentation to provide proof of the retiree's attempt to elect a reduced annuity, unless the record contains convincing evidence to rebut the certification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A retiree who elects to provide a current spouse annuity under this section must agree to pay a deposit equal to the difference between the amount of annuity actually paid to the retiree and the amount of annuity that would have been paid if a fully reduced annuity were being paid continuously since the time of retirement, plus 6 percent annual interest, computed under Sec. 831.105, from the date when each difference occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The rate of a survivor annuity under this section will be computed under the laws in effect at the time of the retiree's separation from the Federal service.
