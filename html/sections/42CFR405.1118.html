                            <p class="depth0">A party may request and receive a copy of all or part of the record  of the ALJ hearing, including the exhibits list, documentary evidence,  and a copy of the tape of the oral proceedings. However, the party may  be asked to pay the costs of providing these items. If a party requests  evidence from the MAC and an opportunity to comment   on that evidence, the time beginning with the MAC's receipt of the  request for evidence through the expiration of the time granted for the  party's response will not be counted toward the 90 calendar day  adjudication deadline.
