In conducting the archival processing of the tape recordings, the archivists will restrict segments of the tape recordings pursuant to Sec. Sec. 1275.50 and 1275.52. The tape segments which consist of abuses of governmental power information, as defined in Sec. 1275.16(c), will be given priority processing by the archivists and will be prepared for public access and released following review and resolution of objections from the Nixon estate and other interested parties as set forth in the Settlement Agreement (see Appendix A to this Part). After the tape segments which consist of abuses of governmental power information have been released, the archivists will conduct archival processing of those tape recordings which were taped in the Cabinet Room, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, Appendix A to this Part. Following release of the Cabinet Room tape recordings, the remaining tape recordings will be prepared for public access and released in five segments in accordance with the schedule set forth in the Settlement Agreement. In addition, NARA will identify and return any additional private or personal segments to the Nixon estate, at approximately the time that NARA proposes each segment for public release.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> At least 30 calendar days prior to the opening to public access of any integral file segment of the materials, the Archivist will publish notice in the Federal Register of the proposed opening. The notice will reasonably identify the material to be opened and will include a reference to the right of any interested person to file a claim or petition in accordance with Sec. 1275.44. Copies of the notice will be sent to the incumbent President of the United States or his designated agent and by first-class mail to the last known address of: Mr. Nixon, or his designated agent or heirs; any former staff member reasonably identifiable as the individual responsible for creating or maintaining the file segment proposed to be opened; any individual named in the material which the Archivist may not restrict in accordance with Sec. 1275.50(b) because the material is essential to an understanding of any abuse of governmental power; and any persons named in the materials who are registered with the National Archives and Records Administration in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Archivist will maintain a registry which shall contain the names and mailing addresses of persons who wish to receive personal notice of the proposed opening of integral file segments of the materials when those segments contain references about them. To be included in the registry, a person must submit his/her name and mailing address to the National Archives and Records Administration (NLN), Washington, DC 20408. Both the envelope and letter should be prominently marked, ``Nixon Materials Registry.'' By submitting his/her name for inclusion in the registry, a person agrees to reimburse the United States for the cost of first-class postage for each instance of personal notice received.
