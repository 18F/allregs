                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Whenever an overpayment is made under an Indian solid mineral lease, a payor may recoup the overpayment through a recoupment on Form ONRR-4430 against the current month's royalties or other revenues owed on the same lease. However, for any month a payor may not recoup more than 50 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under an individual allotted lease or more than 100 percent of the royalties or other revenues owed in that month under a tribal lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> With written permission authorized by tribal statute or resolution, a payor may recoup an overpayment against royalties or other revenues owed in that month under other leases for which that tribe is the lessor. A copy of the tribe's written permission must be furnished to ONRR for reporting recoupments. Call 1-888-201-6416 for instructions. Recouping overpayments on one allotted lease from royalties paid to another allotted lease is specifically prohibited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Overpayments subject to recoupment under this section include all payments made in excess of the required payment for royalty, rental, bonus, or other amounts owed as specified by statute, regulation, order, or terms of an Indian mineral lease.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The ONRR Director or his/her designee may order any payor to not recoup any amount for such reasonable period of time as may be necessary for ONRR to review the nature and amount of any claimed overpayment.
