                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirement. Before engaging in outside employment, an employee must obtain written approval from the employee's supervisor and the concurrence of the DAEO, except to the extent that the Bureau has issued an instruction or internal directive pursuant to paragraph (e) of this section exempting an activity or class of activities from this requirement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definition of employment. For purposes of this section, ``employment'' means any form of non-Federal employment, business relationship, or activity involving the provision of personal services by the employee, regardless of whether the services are compensated. It includes without limitation, personal services as an officer, director, employee, agent, advisor, attorney, consultant, contractor, general partner, trustee, teacher, speaker, or writer.</p><p class="depth2">Note to Sec. 9401.103(b):</p><p class="depth2">Both 18 U.S.C. 203(d) and 205(e) require special approval for certain representational activities in claims against and other matters affecting the interests of the Government. Thus, an employee who wishes to act as agent or attorney for or otherwise represent his or her parents, spouse, child, or a person for whom or for an estate for which he or she is serving as guardian, executor, administrator, trustee, or other personal fiduciary in such matters as described in those statutes shall obtain the approval of the Government official responsible for the employee's appointment in addition to the regulatory approval required in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Standard for approval. Approval will be granted only upon a determination that the outside employment is not expected to involve conduct prohibited by statute, the OGE Standards, or the CFPB Ethics Regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Renewed request for approval. Upon a significant change in either the nature, scope, or duties of the employee's outside employment or in the employee's official Bureau position, the employee shall submit a new request for approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> DAEO responsibilities. The DAEO may issue instructions or internal directives governing the submission of requests for approval of outside employment and designating appropriate officials to act on such requests. The instructions or internal directives may exempt categories of employment from the prior approval requirement of this section based on a determination that employment within those categories generally would be approved and is not likely to involve prohibited conduct or create an appearance of lack of impartiality.</p>
