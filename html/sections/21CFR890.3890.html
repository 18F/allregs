                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identification. A stair-climbing wheelchair is a device with wheels that is intended for medical purposes to provide mobility to persons restricted to a sitting position. The device is intended to climb stairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification. Class II (special controls). The special controls for this device are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The design characteristics of the device must ensure that the geometry and material composition are consistent with the intended use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Performance testing must demonstrate adequate mechanical performance under simulated use conditions and environments. Performance testing must include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fatigue testing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Resistance to dynamic loads (impact testing);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Effective use of the braking mechanism and how the device stops in case of an electrical brake failure;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Demonstration of adequate stability of the device on inclined planes (forward, backward, and lateral);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Demonstration of the ability of the device to safely ascend and descend obstacles (i.e., stairs, curb); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Demonstration of ability to effectively use the device during adverse temperatures and following storage in

adverse temperatures and humidity conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The skin-contacting components of the device must be demonstrated to be biocompatible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Software design, verification, and validation must demonstrate that the device controls, alarms, and user interfaces function as intended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appropriate analysis and performance testing must be conducted to verify electrical safety and electromagnetic compatibility of the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Performance testing must demonstrate battery safety and evaluate longevity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Performance testing must evaluate the flammability of device components.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Patient labeling must bear all information required for the safe and effective use of the device, specifically including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A clear description of the technological features of the device and the principles of how the device works;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A clear description of the appropriate use environments/conditions, including prohibited environments;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Preventive maintenance recommendations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Operating specifications for proper use of the device such as patient weight limitations, device width, and clearance for maneuverability; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A detailed summary of the device-related adverse events and how to report any complications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Clinician labeling must include all the information in the Patient labeling noted in paragraph (b)(8) of this section but must also include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of patients who can effectively operate the device; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Instructions on how to fit, modify, or calibrate the device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Usability studies of the device must demonstrate that the device can be used by the patient in the intended use environment with the instructions for use and user training.
