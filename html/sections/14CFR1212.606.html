                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> NASA officials may maintain and use, for official purposes,  duplicate copies of records or portions of records from a system of  records maintained by their own organizational unit. This practice  should occur only where there are justifiable organizational needs for  it, e.g., where geographic distances make use of the system of records  time consuming or inconvenient. These duplicate copies shall not be  considered a separate NASA system of records. For example, an office  head or designee may keep duplicate copies of personnel, training, or  similar records on employees within the organization for administrative  convenience purposes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No disclosure shall be made from duplicate copies outside of the  organizational unit. Any outside request for disclosure shall be  referred to the appropriate system manager for response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Duplicate copies are subject to the same safeguard requirements  applicable to the system of records.</p><p class="depth2">Subpart 1212.7_NASA Authority and Responsibilities</p>
