                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Statutory authorities. Power to dispose of real estate belonging to the United States is vested in Congress (paragraph 2, Section 3, Article IV, Constitution of the United States), and no real estate of the Department will be sold or otherwise disposed of without authority of Congress. By the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (Federal Property Act), (Pub. L. 152, 81st Congress; 63 Stat. 377) as amended, (40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.), Congress provided authority for utilization of excess property and the disposal of surplus Federal property, and established the General Services Administration (GSA) to administer the provisions of that Act. All excess and surplus Federal real estate and real property components will be disposed of under authority of the Federal Property Act, as amended, unless other statutory authority for such disposal is specifically withheld under the provisions of the Act or enacted subsequent thereto. In connection with disposals made under statutory authority other than the Federal Property Act, attention should be given to the purposes of the legislation and insofar as practicable, disposal of property should be in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the regulations issued thereunder, in order that the greatest overall efficiency and economy be effected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules and regulations--(1) Issued by the GSA. Rules and regulations issued by the GSA to effectuate its authority in respect to disposal of real estate and real property components are contained in FPMR, Section 101-47, as amended, including disposition of timber, embedded sand, gravel and stone, buildings and other structures, and leaseholds and other rights to use or occupy real estate. The DE will be governed by these rules and regulations. GSA also issues, from time to time, special delegations of authority to the Department of Defense with power of redelegation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Issued by the Departments. Policies and procedures of the departments with respect to the control, management, maintenance, and disposition of real estate and real property components located within the continental United States and its territories and possessions, placed in excess status or to be placed in excess status are contained in AR 405-90, AFR 87-4, and AR 405-5/AFR 87-15, except Army civil works property which is governed by ER 405-1-12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Authorities delegated to the Department of Defense. Under the publications and special delegations issued by GSA, the Department of Defense has been designated disposal agency categories enumerated in Sec. 644.314.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Authorities delegated to the Army and Air Force. Department of Defense Directive 4165.6, among other things, redelegates to the Secretaries of the Army, Navy and Air Force, and to such individuals as they may designate for the purpose of administering real estate actions within their respective departments, the authorities which were then, or may hereafter be, assigned and delegated to, or vested in the Secretary of Defense by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sections 401 and 402 of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 511 and 512) and regulations of the GSA promulgated thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Administrator of General Services, pursuant to Section 203 (a), (b) and (c) of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended (40 U.S.C. 484).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other specific delegations from the Administrator of General Services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Authorities (Special). In addition to the general authority cited in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, the Department derives authority from a number of special purpose statutes to transfer real property to other Federal agencies and to dispose of real property for special purposes, or to special classes or in a specific manner to achieve a specific objective. Some of these acts are utilized in conjunction with regulations of GSA and some are exercised independently thereof according to the nature of the particular law. These laws are described in subsequent sections of ER 405-1-12.</p>
