                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Computation. All time periods are computed using calendar days,  including Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal holidays. However, when the  time period expires on a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal holiday, the time  is extended to the end of the next Federal working day as stated in the  legal notice (11:59 p.m. in the time zone of the receiving office for  objections filed by electronic means such as email or facsimile).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Starting date. The day after publication of the legal notice  required by Sec. 218.7(c) is the first day of the objection-filing  period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Publication date. The publication date of the legal notice of  the EA or final EIS in the newspaper of record or, when the Chief is the  responsible official, the Federal Register, is the exclusive means for  calculating the time to file an objection. Objectors may not rely on  dates or timeframe information provided by any other source.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Extensions. Time extensions are not permitted except as provided  at paragraph (a) of this section, and Sec. 218.26(b).</p>
