                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section prescribes forms and instructions to be  used by governmental organizations (except hospitals and institutions of  higher education operated by a government) in applying for grants. This  section is not applicable, however, to formula grant programs which do  not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This section applies only to applications to Federal agencies  for grants, and is not required to be applied by grantees in dealing  with applicants for subgrants. However, grantees are encouraged to avoid  more detailed or burdensome application requirements for subgrants.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authorized forms and instructions for governmental  organizations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In applying for grants, applicants shall only use  standard application forms or those prescribed by the granting agency  with the approval of OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicants are not required to submit more than the original and  two copies of preapplications or applications.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Applicants must follow all applicable instructions that bear OMB  clearance numbers. Federal agencies may specify and describe the  programs, functions, or activities that will be used to plan, budget,  and evaluate the work under a grant. Other supplementary instructions  may be issued only with the approval of OMB to the extent required under  the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. For any standard form, except the  SF-424 facesheet, Federal agencies may shade out or instruct the  applicant to disregard any line item that is not needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a grantee applies for additional funding (such as a  continuation or supplemental award) or amends a previously submitted  application, only the affected pages need be submitted. Previously  submitted pages with information that is still current need not be  resubmitted.</p>
