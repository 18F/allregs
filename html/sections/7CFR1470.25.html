Payments for such modified contracts will be reduced to reflect the modified acreage and performance. Participants will not be subject to liquidated damages or refund of payments received for enrolling land in these programs. NRCS may also approve modification to a conservation stewardship contract to accommodate other limited changes on land that the participant has effective control in response to a participant's request made prior to implementing the change that would take land out of production or convert an area under contract to a different land use. Prior to approval, NRCS must determine that any modification under this section is authorized by the provisions of 16 U.S.C. 3838d-3838g.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A voluntary contract modification under this section will not increase the scheduled annual payments under the program, except to implement an appeal determination or correct an administrative error as approved by NRCS.
