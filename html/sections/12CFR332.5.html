                                Sec. 332.5  Annual privacy notice to customers required.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. You must provide a clear and conspicuous notice  to customers that accurately reflects your privacy policies and  practices not less than annually during the continuation of the customer  relationship. Annually means at least once in any period of 12  consecutive months during which that relationship exists. You may define  the 12-consecutive-month period, but you must apply it to the customer  on a consistent basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example. You provide a notice annually if you define the 12- consecutive-month period as a calendar year and provide the annual  notice to the customer once in each calendar year following the calendar  year in which you provided the initial notice. For example, if a  customer opens an account on any day of year 1, you must provide an  annual notice to that customer by December 31 of year 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Termination of customer relationship. You are not required to  provide an annual notice to a former customer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. Your customer becomes a former customer when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a deposit account, the account is inactive under  your policies;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a closed-end loan, the customer pays the loan in  full, you charge off the loan, or you sell the loan without retaining  servicing rights;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In the case of a credit card relationship or other open-end  credit relationship, you no longer provide any statements or notices to  the customer concerning that relationship or you sell the credit card  receivables without retaining servicing rights; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You have not communicated with the customer about the  relationship for a period of 12 consecutive months, other than to  provide annual privacy notices or promotional material.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)</em>, then you need not provide an annual notice to that  consumer under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delivery. When you are required to deliver an annual privacy  notice by this section, you must deliver it according to Sec. 332.9.</p>
