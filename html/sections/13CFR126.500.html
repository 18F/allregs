                                Sec. 126.500  How does a qualified HUBZone SBC maintain HUBZone
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Any qualified HUBZone SBC seeking to remain on the List must  recertify every three years to SBA that it remains a qualified HUBZone  SBC (See Sec. 126.501 for ongoing obligations). Concerns wishing to  remain in the program without any interruption must recertify their  continued eligibility to SBA within 30 calendar days after the third  anniversary of their date of certification and each subsequent three- year period. Failure to do so will result in SBA initiating  decertification proceedings. Once decertified, the concern then would  have to submit a new application for certification pursuant to  Sec. 126.309. The recertification to SBA must be in writing and must  represent that the circumstances relative to eligibility that existed on  the date of certification showing on the List have not materially  changed and that the concern meets any new eligibility requirements.
