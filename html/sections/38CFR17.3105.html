Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a  beneficiary's HISA benefit is limited to the lifetime amount established  in paragraph (b), (c), or (d) of this section, as applicable. A  beneficiary may use HISA benefits to pay for more than one home  alteration, until the beneficiary exhausts his or her lifetime benefit.  HISA benefits approved by VA for use in a particular home alteration but  unused by the beneficiary will remain available for future use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> HISA benefits for a service-connected disability, a disability  treated ``as if'' it were service connected, or for veterans with a  service-connected disability rated 50 percent or more. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If a veteran:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applies for HISA benefits to address a service-connected  disability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applies for HISA benefits to address a compensable disability  treated ``as if'' it is a service-connected disability and for which the  veteran is entitled to medical services under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a)(2)(C)  (e.g., a disability acquired through treatment or vocational  rehabilitation provided by VA); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Applies for HISA benefits to address a nonservice-connected  disability, if the beneficiary has a service-connected disability rated  at least 50 percent disabling; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The veteran first applies for HISA benefits:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Before May 5, 2010, then the veteran's lifetime HISA benefit  limit is $4,100.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> On or after May 5, 2010, then the veteran's lifetime HISA  benefit limit is $6,800.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> HISA benefits for any other disabilities. If a veteran who is  eligible for medical services under 38 U.S.C. 1710(a) applies for HISA  benefits to address a disability that is not covered under paragraph (b)  of this section, and the veteran first applies for HISA benefits:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before May 5, 2010, then the veteran's lifetime HISA benefit  limit is $1,200; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or after May 5, 2010, then the veteran's lifetime HISA  benefit limit is $2,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Servicemembers.

The increased amount that will be  available is $6,800 minus the amount of HISA benefits previously used by  the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A veteran who previously received HISA benefits as a  servicemember is not eligible for a new lifetime HISA benefit amount  based on his or her attaining veteran status, but the veteran   may file a HISA claim for any HISA benefit amounts not used prior to  discharge. The veteran's subsequent HISA award cannot exceed the  applicable award amount under paragraphs (b), (c), or (e)(1) of this  section, as applicable, minus the amount of HISA benefits awarded to the  veteran while the veteran was a servicemember.
