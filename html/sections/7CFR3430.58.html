                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Subcontracts. No more than 50 percent of the award may be  subcontracted to other parties without prior written approval of the ADO  except contracts to other Federal agencies. Any subcontract awarded to a  Federal agency under an award must have prior written approval of the  ADO. To request approval, a justification for the proposed  subcontractual arrangements, a performance statement, and a detailed  budget for the subcontract must be submitted to the ADO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No-cost extensions of time--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Awardees may initiate a  one-time no-cost extension of the expiration date of the award of up to  12 months unless one or more of the following conditions apply: the  terms and conditions of the award prohibit the extension; the extension  requires additional Federal funds; and the extension involves any change  in the approved objectives or scope of the project. For the first no- cost extension, the awardee must notify NIFA in writing with the  supporting reasons and revised expiration date at least 10 days before  the expiration date specified in the award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Additional requests for no-cost extensions of time before  expiration date. When more than one no-cost extension of time or an  extension of more than 12 months is required, the extension(s) must be  approved in writing by the ADO. The awardee should prepare and submit a  written request (which must be received no later than 10 days prior to  the expiration date of the award) to the ADO. The request must contain,  at   a minimum, the following information: the length of the additional time  required to complete the project objectives and a justification for the  extension; a summary of the progress to date; an estimate of the funds  expected to remain unobligated on the scheduled expiration date; a  projected timetable to complete the portion(s) of the project for which  the extension is being requested; and signature of the AR and the PD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Requests for no-cost extensions of time after expiration date.  NIFA may consider and approve requests for no-cost extensions of time up  to 120 days following the expiration of the award. These will be  approved only for extenuating circumstances, as determined by NIFA. The  awardee's AR must submit the requirements identified under paragraph  (b)(2) of this section as well as an ``extenuating circumstance''  justification and a description of the actions taken by the awardee to  minimize these requests in the future.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other requirements. No-cost extensions of time may not be  exercised merely for the purpose of using unobligated balances. All  extensions are subject to any statutory term limitations as well as any  expiring appropriation limitations under Sec. 3430.63.</p>
