The corporation shall also furnish, in duplicate, evidence which will establish the authority of the officer or other person who executes the application for permit to execute the same; the authority of persons to sign other documents, required by this part, for the corporation; and the identity of the officers and directors, and each person who holds more than ten percent of the stock of such corporation. Where a corporation has previously filed such documents or evidence with the appropriate TTB officer, a written statement by the corporation, in duplicate, to that effect will be sufficient for the purpose of this section.
