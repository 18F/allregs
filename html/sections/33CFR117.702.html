                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The draw of the Arthur Kill (AK) Railroad Bridge shall be  maintained in the full open position for navigation at all times, except  during periods when it is closed for the passage of rail traffic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The bridge owner/operator shall maintain a dedicated telephone  hot line for vessel operators to call the bridge in advance to  coordinate anticipated bridge closures. The telephone hot line number  shall be posted on signs at the bridge clearly visible from both the up  and downstream sides of the bridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tide constrained deep draft vessels shall notify the bridge  operator, daily, of their expected times of vessel transits through the  bridge, by calling the designated telephone hot line.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The bridge shall not be closed for the passage of rail traffic  during any predicted high tide period if a tide constrained deep draft  vessel has provided the bridge operator with an advance notice of their  intent to transit through the bridge. For the purposes of this  regulation, the predicted high tide period shall be considered to be  from two hours before each predicted high tide to a half-hour after each  predicted high tide taken at the Battery, New York.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The bridge operator shall issue a manual broadcast notice to  mariners of the intent to close the bridge for a period of up to 30  minutes for the passage of rail traffic, on VHF-FM channels 13 and 16  (minimum range of 15 miles) 90 minutes before and again at 75 minutes  before each bridge closure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Beginning at 60 minutes prior to each bridge closure, automated  or manual broadcast notice to mariners must be repeated at 15 minute  intervals and again at 10 and 5 minutes prior to each bridge closure and  once again as the bridge begins to close, at which point the appropriate  sound signal will be given.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Two 15 minute bridge closures may be provided each day for the  passage of multiple rail traffic movements across the bridge. Each 15  minute bridge closure shall be separated by at least a 30 minute period  when the bridge is returned to and remains in the full open position.  Notification of the two 15 minute closures shall follow the same  procedures outlined in paragraphs (e) and (f) above.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> A vessel operator may request up to a 30 minute delay for any  bridge closure in order to allow vessel traffic to meet tide or current  requirements; however, the request to delay the bridge closure must be  made within 30 minutes following the initial broadcast for the bridge  closure. Requests received after the initial 30 minute broadcast will  not be granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> In the event of a bridge operational failure, the bridge  operator shall immediately notify the Coast Guard Captain of the Port  New York. The bridge owner/operator must provide and dispatch a bridge  repair crew to be on scene at the bridge no later than 45 minutes after  the bridge fails to operate. A repair crew must remain on scene during  the operational failure until the bridge has been fully restored to  normal operations or until the bridge is raised and locked in the fully  open position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> When the bridge is not tended locally it must be operated from a  remote location. A sufficient number of closed circuit TV cameras,  approved by the Coast Guard, shall be operated and maintained at the  bridge site to enable the remotely located bridge tender to have full  view of both river traffic and the bridge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> VHF-FM channels 13 and 16 shall be maintained and monitored to  facilitate communication in both the remote and local control locations.  The bridge shall also be equipped with directional microphones and horns  to receive and deliver signals to vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Whenever the remote control system equipment is disabled or  fails to operate for any reason, the bridge operator shall immediately  notify the Captain of the Port New York. The bridge shall be physically  tended and operated by local control as soon as possible, but no more  than 45 minutes after malfunction or disability of the remote system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Mechanical bypass and override capability of the remote  operation system shall be provided and maintained at all times.
