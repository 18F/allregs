                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Identity. (1) The color additive D&C; Red No. 6 is principally the disodium salt of 3-hydroxy-4-[(4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CAS Reg. No. 5858-81-1). To manufacture the additive, 2-amino-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid is diazotized with hydrochloric acid and sodium nitrite. The diazo compound is coupled in alkaline medium with 3-hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid. The resulting dye precipitates as the disodium salt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The color additive D&C; Red No. 6 is principally the disodium salt of 3-hydroxy-4-[(4-methyl-2-sulfophenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid (CAS Reg.

The color additive D&C; Red No. 6 shall conform to the following specifications and shall be free from impurities other than those named to the extent that such impurities may be avoided by current good manufacturing practice:
Sum of volatile matter (at 135 [deg]C) and chlorides and sulfates (calculated as sodium salts), not more than 10 percent.1-[(4-methylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenol, not more than 0.015 percent.2-Amino-5-methylbenzenesulfonic acid, sodium salt, not more than 0.2 percent.3-Hydroxy-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid, sodium salt, not more than 0.4 percent.3-Hydroxy-4-[(4-methylphenyl)azo]-2-naphthalenecarboxylic acid, sodium salt, not more than 0.5 percent.p- Toluidine, not more than 15 parts per million.Lead (as Pb), not more than 20 parts per million.Arsenic (as As), not more than 3 parts per million.Mercury (as Hg), not more than 1 part per million.Total color, not less than 90 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Uses and restrictions. The color additive D&C; Red No. 6 may be safely used for coloring drugs such that the combined total of D&C; Red No. 6 and D&C; Red No. 7 does not exceed 5 milligrams per daily dose of the drug.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Labeling. The label of the color additive and any mixtures prepared therefrom intended solely or in part for coloring purposes shall conform to the requirements of Sec. 70.25 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certification. All batches of D&C; Red No. 6 shall be certified in accordance with regulations in part 80 of this chapter.
