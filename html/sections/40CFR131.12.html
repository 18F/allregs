The antidegradation policy and implementation methods  shall, at a minimum, be consistent with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existing instream water uses and the level of water quality  necessary to protect the existing uses shall be maintained and  protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where the quality of the waters exceed levels necessary to  support propagation of fish, shellfish, and wildlife and recreation in  and on the water, that quality shall be maintained and protected unless  the State finds, after full satisfaction of the intergovernmental  coordination and public participation provisions of the State's  continuing planning process, that allowing lower water quality is  necessary to accommodate important economic or social development in the  area in which the waters are located. In allowing such degradation or  lower water quality, the State shall assure water quality adequate to  protect existing uses fully. Further, the State shall assure that there  shall be achieved the highest statutory and regulatory requirements for  all new and existing point sources and all cost-effective and reasonable  best management practices for nonpoint source control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Where high quality waters constitute an outstanding National  resource, such as waters of National and State parks and wildlife  refuges and waters of exceptional recreational or ecological  significance, that water quality shall be maintained and protected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In those cases where potential water quality impairment  associated with a thermal discharge is involved, the antidegradation  policy and implementing method shall be consistent with section 316 of  the Act.</p>
