Household and personal effects of the character provided for in Chapter 98, Subchapter IV, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), which belong to persons who have not arrived in this country before the effects become subject to sale, are dutiable at the rates in effect when the effects become subject to sale, even though such persons arrive and make entry for the effects before they are sold.
