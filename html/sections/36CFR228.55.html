                            <p class="depth0">The authorized officer may cancel or suspend a contract, permit, or  prospecting permit if the purchaser or permittee fails to comply with  its terms and conditions. If the noncompliance is unnecessarily or  unreasonably causing injury, loss, or damage to surface resources, the  authorized officer may cancel or suspend the contract, permit, or  prospecting permit immediately. In cases where noncompliance is of a  less serious nature, the authorized officer may cancel or suspend a  contract, permit, or prospecting permit if such noncompliance continues  for 30 days after service of written notice by the authorized officer.  If the noncompliance is not corrected, the authorized officer may attach  the bond to ensure compliance with the provisions of the contract,  permit, or prospecting permit.</p>
