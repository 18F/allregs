                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Use in any taxable period, or part thereof, of any  bus of the transit type by any person who is engaged in the operation of  a transit system is exempt from the tax, if such person meets the 60- percent passenger fare revenue test provided for in paragraph (e) of  this section, for the applicable period prescribed in paragraph (c) of  this section as the test period for such person for such system for such  taxable period, or part thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Buses of the transit type. The term ``transit type'', when used  in the regulations in this part with reference to a bus, means the type  of bus which is designed for the mass transportation of persons within  an urban area, as distinguished from the intercity-type bus. A transit- type bus is ordinarily distinguishable from an intercity-type bus by  comparison of seats, doors, and baggage facilities. The transit-type bus  usually has straight-back seats of the bench type, while the intercity- type bus generally has seats which either can be reclined or are in fact  permanently fixed in a reclining position. The transit-type bus is more  likely to have an accordion or folding-type door at the front of the  bus, and often has a second door in the middle or at the rear for  passengers to leave the bus, as opposed to the emergency-type rear door  which may or may not be included in the intercity-type bus. The typical  transit-type bus does not have facilities for storing baggage whereas  the typical intercity-type bus has facilities for storing baggage in a  compartment underneath the floor of the bus or in overhead racks, or  both. Other characteristics which may be taken into account in  distinguishing a transit-type bus from an intercity-type bus include  gear ratios, acceleration and maximum speed, and aisle space for  standees. The transit-type bus ordinarily has a lower gear ratio to  provide for quick starts and because, in general, buses of this type are  operated at low speeds. The intercity-type bus ordinarily has a higher  gear ratio and can be operated at much higher speeds. The transit-type  bus usually has wider aisles, with overhead straps or bars to  accommodate standees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Test period. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of any person who is engaged in the  operation of a transit system at any time in the calendar quarter  immediately preceding July 1 of any taxable period, the test period for  such system for such taxable period shall be such calendar quarter.  However, if passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in  paragraph (e) of this section was derived on less than 30 days during  such calendar quarter from operation of such system, the test period for  such system for such taxable period shall be the last preceding test  period for such system. If such system has no preceding test period,  then the test period for such system for such taxable period shall be  the calendar quarter beginning with July 1 of such taxable period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (3) of this  paragraph, in the case of any person who commences operation of a  transit system at any time on or after July 1 of any taxable period the  test period for such system for that part of such taxable period  beginning with the first day on which such operation was commenced shall  be the calendar quarter in which falls such first day. However, if  passenger fare revenue from scheduled service described in paragraph (e)  of this section was derived on less than 30 days during such calendar  quarter from operation of such system, the test period for such system  for such taxable period shall be the following calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the case of any person who commences operation of a transit  system at any time in the last calendar quarter to which the tax imposed  by section 4481 applies, such last calendar quarter shall be the test  period for such transit system regardless of the number of days in which  passenger fare   revenue is derived in such calendar quarter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transit system. The term ``transit system'', as used in the  regulations in this part, means any system for furnishing scheduled  common carrier public passenger land transportation service along  regular routes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> 60-percent passenger fare revenue test. For purposes of this  section, a person engaged in the operation of a transit system meets the  60-percent passenger fare revenue test, for the applicable test period  prescribed in this section, if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> During such test period such person derived passenger fare  revenue from the operation of such system, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least 60 percent of the total of such passenger fare revenue  derived by such person during such test period was attributable to (i)  amounts paid for transportation which do not exceed 60 cents, (ii)  amounts paid for commutation or season tickets for single trips of less  than 30 miles, or (iii) amounts paid for commutation tickets for one  month or less. In determining the total of such passenger fare revenue,  revenue from sources such as charter fees, rentals of property,  advertising receipts, etc., is not taken into account.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Examples. Application of this section may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). The X Transit Company is engaged in the operation of a  transit system in the city of A and surrounding area throughout April,  May, and June of 1984 and the taxable period beginning July 1, 1984. It  derives passenger fare revenue from the operation of such system for 15  days in April and for the entire months of May and June of 1984. On July  1, 1984, the Company is using 60 buses of the transit type and 40 buses  of the intercity type. Each of 20 of the transit-type buses and each of  10 of the intercity-type buses has a taxable gross weight of less than  55,000 pounds. (No tax is imposed on the use of either a transit-type  bus or an intercity-type bus having a taxable gross weight of less than  55,000 pounds. See Sec. 41.4481-1.) Use of the 10 intercity-type buses  is subject to the tax for the taxable period beginning with July 1,  1984, since the exemption, if any, applies only to transit-type buses.  Use of the 20 transit-type buses is not subject to the tax for such  taxable period if at least 60 percent of the total passenger fare  revenue derived by the X Transit Company during April, May, and June of  1984 (the test period prescribed in paragraph (c) (1) of this section)  from operation of such system was from fares attributable to (i) amounts  paid for transportation which do not exceed 60 cents, (ii) amounts paid  for commutation or season tickets for single trips of less than 30  miles, or (iii) amounts paid for commutation tickets for one month or  less. If the X Transit Company does not meet the 60-percent passenger  fare revenue test for April, May, and June of 1984, the tax attaches for  the taxable period beginning with July 1, 1984, with respect to the use  of each of the 20 transit-type buses having a taxable gross weight of  more than less than 55,000 pounds.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). Assume the same facts as those stated in Example (1),  except that the X Transit Company commences operation of the transit  system on July 15, 1984, and derives passenger fare revenue from  operation of the system throughout the following August and September.  In such case, the test period is July, August, and September of 1984,  and if the test is met for this period, no tax is imposed on the use by  the Company of any bus of the transit type in the period July 15, 1984,  through June 30, 1985.</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). Assume the same facts as those stated in Example (1),  except that the X Transit Company commences operation of the transit  system on April 15, 1985, and derives passenger fare revenue from  operation of the system throughout the following May and June. In such  case the test period is April, May, and June of 1985, and if the test is  met for this period, no tax is imposed on the use by the Company of any  bus of the transit type in the period April 15 through June of 1985, or  in the taxable period beginning on July 1, 1985.
