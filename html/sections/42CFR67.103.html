(1) Members of peer review groups will be screened for potential conflicts of interest prior to appointment and will be required to follow Department policies and procedures consistent with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635) and Executive Order 12674 (as modified by Executive Order 12731).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Members of peer review groups will be screened for potential conflicts of interest prior to appointment and will be required to follow Department policies and procedures consistent with the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch (5 CFR part 2635) and Executive Order 12674 (as modified by Executive Order 12731).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition to any restrictions referenced under paragraph (e)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> No member of a peer review group may participate in or be present during any review by such group of a contract proposal in which, to the member's knowledge, any of the following has a financial interest:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The member or his or her spouse, minor child, or partner;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any organization in which the member is serving as an officer, director, trustee, general partner, or employee; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any organization with which the member is negotiating or has any arrangement concerning prospective employment or other similar association, and further;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the event any member of a peer review group or his or her spouse, parent, child, or partner is currently or expected to be the project director or member of the staff responsible for carrying out any contract requirements as specified in the contract proposal, that member is disqualified and will be replaced as appropriate.</p>
