                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon approval of an exploration plan or mining plan, the  operator shall be required to file a suitable performance bond of not  less than $2,000 with satisfactory surety, payable to the Secretary of  the Interior, and the bond shall be conditioned upon the faithful  compliance with applicable regulations, the terms and conditions of the  permit, lease, or contract, and the exploration or mining plan as  approved, amended or supplemented. The bond shall be in an amount  sufficient to satisfy the reclamation requirements established pursuant  to an approved exploration or mining plan, or an approved partial or  supplemental plan. In determining the amount of the bond consideration  shall be given to the character and nature of the reclamation  requirements and the estimated costs of reclamation in the event that  the operator forfeits his performance bond. In lieu of a surety bond an  operator may elect to deposit cash or negotiable bonds of the U.S.  government. The cash deposit or the market value of such securities  shall be equal at least to the required sum of the bond.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In a particular instance where the circumstances are such as to  warrant an exception, the amount of the bond for a particular operation  may be reduced to less than the required minimum of $2,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The superintendent shall set the amount of a bond and take the  necessary action for an increase or for a complete or partial release of  a bond. He shall take action with respect to bonds for leases or permits  only after consultation with the mining supervisor.</p>
