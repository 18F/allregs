                                Sec. 201.411  Commission consideration of initial decisions by hearing
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope of review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set  aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial  decision by a hearing officer and may make any findings or conclusions  that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Standards for granting review pursuant to a petition for  review--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory review. After a petition for review has been  filed, the Commission shall review any initial decision that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or  Section 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or  the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.  78l(d);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k) of the  Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551) not  required to be determined on the record after notice and opportunity for  hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter described in 5  U.S.C. 554(a) (1) through (6)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discretionary review. The Commission may decline to review any  other decision. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission  shall consider whether the petition for review makes a reasonable  showing that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the  proceeding; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The decision embodies:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A finding or conclusion of material fact that is clearly  erroneous; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A conclusion of law that is erroneous; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> An exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is  important and that the Commission should review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Commission review other than pursuant to a petition for review.  The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any initial  decision, or any portion of any initial decision, within 21 days after  the end of the period established for filing a petition for review  pursuant to Sec. 210.410(b). A party who does not intend to file a  petition for review, and who desires the Commission's determination  whether to order review on its own initiative to be made in a shorter  time, may make a motion for an expedited decision, accompanied by a  written statement that the party waives its right to file a petition for  review. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to the  Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission  for review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitations on matters reviewed. Review by the Commission of an  initial decision shall be limited to the issues specified in the  petition for review or the issues, if any, specified in the briefing  schedule order issued pursuant to Sec. 201.450(a). On notice to all  parties, however, the Commission may, at any time prior to issuance of  its decision, raise and determine any other matters that it deems  material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Summary affirmance. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At any time within 21 days after the  filing of a petition for review pursuant to Sec. 201.410(b), any party  may file a motion in accordance with Sec. 201.154 asking that the  Commission summarily affirm an initial decision. Any party may file an  opposition and reply to such motion in accordance with Sec. 201.154.  Pending determination of the motion for summary affirmance, the  Commission, in its discretion, may delay issuance of a briefing schedule  order pursuant to Sec. 201.450.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon consideration of the motion and any opposition or upon its  own initiative, the Commission may summarily affirm an initial decision.  The Commission may grant summary affirmance if it finds that no issue  raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the Commission  of further oral or written argument. The Commission will decline to  grant summary affirmance upon a reasonable showing that a prejudicial  error was committed in the conduct of the proceeding or that the  decision embodies an exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy  that is important and that the Commission should review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure to obtain a majority. In the event a majority of  participating Commissioners do not agree to a disposition on the merits,  the initial decision shall be of no effect, and an order will be issued  in accordance with this result.
