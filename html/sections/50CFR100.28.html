The Code is divided  into 50 titles which represent broad areas subject to Federal  regulation. Each title is divided into chapters which usually bear the  name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further subdivided into  parts covering specific regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year  and issued on a quarterly basis approximately as follows:  Title 1 through Title 16.................................as of January 1 Title 17 through Title 27..................................as of April 1 Title 28 through Title 41...................................as of July 1 Title 42 through Title 50................................as of October 1</p><p class="depth0">The appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each  volume.  LEGAL STATUS</p><p class="depth0">The contents of the Federal Register are required to be judicially  noticed (44 U.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie  evidence of the text of the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510).  HOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS</p><p class="depth0">The Code of Federal Regulations is kept up to date by the individual  issues of the Federal Register. These two publications must be used  together to determine the latest version of any given rule.</p><p class="depth0">To determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its  revision date (in this case, October 1, 2015), consult the ``List of CFR  Sections Affected (LSA),'' which is issued monthly, and the ``Cumulative  List of Parts Affected,'' which appears in the Reader Aids section of  the daily Federal Register. These two lists will identify the Federal  Register page number of the latest amendment of any given rule.  EFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES</p><p class="depth0">Each volume of the Code contains amendments published in the Federal  Register since the last revision of that volume of the Code. Source  citations for the regulations are referred to by volume number and page  number of the Federal Register and date of publication. Publication  dates and effective dates are usually not the same and care must be  exercised by the user in determining the actual effective date. In  instances where the effective date is beyond the cut-off date for the  Code a note has been inserted to reflect the future effective date. In  those instances where a regulation published in the Federal Register  states a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be  inserted following the text.  OMB CONTROL NUMBERS</p><p class="depth0">The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511) requires  Federal agencies to display an OMB control number with their information  collection request.   Many agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as  amendments to existing regulations in the CFR. These OMB numbers are  placed as close as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting  requirements.  PAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE</p><p class="depth0">Provisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of  the revision date stated on the cover of each volume are not carried.  Code users may find the text of provisions in effect on any given date  in the past by using the appropriate List of CFR Sections Affected  (LSA). For the convenience of the reader, a ``List of CFR Sections  Affected'' is published at the end of each CFR volume. For changes to  the Code prior to the LSA listings at the end of the volume, consult  previous annual editions of the LSA. For changes to the Code prior to  2001, consult the List of CFR Sections Affected compilations, published  for 1949-1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000.  ``[RESERVED]'' TERMINOLOGY</p><p class="depth0">The term ``[Reserved]'' is used as a place holder within the Code of  Federal Regulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a  ``[Reserved]'' location at any time. Occasionally ``[Reserved]'' is used  editorially to indicate that a portion of the CFR was left vacant and  not accidentally dropped due to a printing or computer error.  INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE</p><p class="depth0">What is incorporation by reference? Incorporation by reference was  established by statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the  requirement to publish regulations in the Federal Register by referring  to materials already published elsewhere. For an incorporation to be  valid, the Director of the Federal Register must approve it. The legal  effect of incorporation by reference is that the material is treated as  if it were published in full in the Federal Register (5 U.S.C. 552(a)).  This material, like any other properly issued regulation, has the force  of law.</p><p class="depth0">What is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the  Federal Register will approve an incorporation by reference only when  the requirements of 1 CFR part 51 are met. Some of the elements on which  approval is based are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The incorporation will substantially reduce the volume of  material published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The matter incorporated is in fact available to the extent  necessary to afford fairness and uniformity in the administrative  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The incorporating document is drafted and submitted for  publication in accordance with 1 CFR part 51.</p><p class="depth0">What if the material incorporated by reference cannot be found? If  you have any problem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as  an approved incorporation by reference, please contact the agency that  issued the regulation containing that incorporation. If, after  contacting the agency, you find the material is not available, please  notify the Director of the Federal Register, National Archives and  Records Administration, 8601 Adelphi Road, College Park, MD 20740-6001,  or call 202-741-6010.
