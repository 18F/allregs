                            <p class="depth0">In cooperation with the program official, the contracting officer  must assess the reasonableness of the total estimated budget to perform  the RD&D; that will be supported by the agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Labor. Much of the budget likely will involve direct labor and  associated indirect costs, which may be represented together as a  ``loaded'' labor rate. The program official is an essential advisor on  reasonableness of the overall level of effort and its composition by  labor category. The contracting officer also may rely on experience with  other awards as the basis for determining reasonableness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Real property and equipment. In almost all cases, the project  costs should normally include only depreciation or use charges for real  property and   equipment of for-profit participants, in accordance with Sec. 603.680.  Remember that the budget for an expenditure-based TIA may not include  depreciation of a participant's property as a direct cost of the project  if that participant's practice is to charge the depreciation of that  type of property as an indirect cost, as many organizations do.</p><p class="depth2">Cost Sharing</p>
