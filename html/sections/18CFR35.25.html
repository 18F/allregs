                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability. This section applies to any rate schedule filed  under this part by any public utility as defined in subsection 201(e) of  the Federal Power Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Constuction work in progress or CWIP means any expenditure for  public utility plant in process of construction that is properly  included in Accounts 107 (construction work in progress) and 120.1  (nuclear fuel in process of refinement, conversion, enrichment, and  fabrication) of part 101 of this chapter, the   Uniform System of Accounts Prescribed for Public Utilities and Licensees  Subject to the Provisions of the Federal Power Act (Major and Nonmajor),  that would otherwise be eligible for allowance for funds used during  construction (AFUDC) treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Double whammy means a situation which may arise when a wholesale  electric rate customer embarks upon its own or participates in a  construction program to supply itself with all or a portion of its  future power needs, thereby reducing its future dependence on the CWIP  of the rate applicant, but is simultaneously forced to pay to the CWIP  public utility rate applicant the CWIP portion of the wholesale rates  that reflects existing levels of service or a different anticipated  service level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fuel conversion facility means any addition to public utility  plant that enables a natural gas-burning plant to convert to the use of  other fuels, or that enables an oil-burning plant to convert to the use  of other fuels, other than natural gas. Such facilities include those  that alter internal plant workings, such as oil or coal burners, soot  blowers, bottom ash removal systems and concomitant air pollution  control facilities, and any facility needed for receiving and storing  the fuel to which the plant is being converted, which facility would not  be necessary if the plant continued to burn gas or oil.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pollution control facility means an identifiable structure or  portions of a structure that is designed to reduce the amount of  pollution produced by the power plant, but does not include any facility  that reduces pollution by substituting a different method of generation  or that generates the additional power necessitated by the operation of  a pollution control facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rule. For purposes of any initial rate schedule or any  rate schedule change filed under Sec. 35.12 or Sec. 35.13 of this  part, a public utility may include in its rate base any costs of  construction work in progress (CWIP), including allowance for funds used  during construction (AFUDC), as provided in this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pollution control facilities--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> General rule. Any CWIP for  pollution control facilities allocable to electric power sales for  resale may be included in the rate base of the public utility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Qualification as a pollution control facility. In determining  whether a facility is a pollution control facility for purposes of this  section, the Commission will consider:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Whether such facility is the type facility described in the  Internal Revenue Service laws, 26 U.S.C. 169(d)(1), as follows:</p><p class="depth5">``A new identifiable treatment facility which is used * * * to abate  or control water or atmospheric pollution or contamination by removing,  altering, disposing, storing, or preventing the creation or emission of  pollutants, contaminants, wastes or heat'';</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Whether such facility has been certified by a local, state, or  federal agency as being in conformity with, or required by, a program of  pollution control;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Other evidence showing that such facilities are for pollution  control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fuel conversion facilities. Any CWIP for fuel conversion  facilities allocable to electric power sales for resale may be included  in the rate base of the public utility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-pollution control of fuel conversion (non-PC/FC) CWIP. No  more than 50 percent of any CWIP allocable to electric power sales for  resale not otherwise included in rate base under paragraphs (c) (1) and  (2) of this section, may be included in the rate base of the public  utility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Forward looking allocation ratios. Every test period CWIP  project requested for wholesale rate base treatment pursuant to Sec.  35.26(c)(1), (2), and (3) of this part will be allocated to the customer  classes on the basis of forward looking allocation ratios reflecting the  anticipated average annual use the wholesale customers will make of the  system over the estimated service life of the project. Supporting  documentation, as required by Sec. Sec. 35.12 and 35.13 of this part,  must be in sufficient detail to permit examination and verification of  the forward looking allocation ratio's recognition of each wholesale  customer's plans, if any, for future alternative or supplementary power  supplies. For the purpose of preventing anticompetitive effects,  including CWIP-induced price squeeze   and double whammy, sufficient recognition of such plans may require the  public utility applicant to provide for separate customer groups or  provide for a rate design incorporating selected CWIP project credits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. If a public utility proposes in its filed rates  to include CWIP in rate base under this section, that portion of the  rate related to CWIP is collectible at the time the general rates become  effective pursuant to Commission order, whether or not subject to  refund, except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Discontinuance of AFUDC. On the date that any proposed rate that  includes CWIP in rate base becomes effective, a public utility that has  included CWIP in rate base must discontinue the capitalization of any  AFUDC related to those amounts of CWIP is rate base.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Accounting procedures. When a public utility files to include  CWIP in its rate base pursuant to this section, it must propose  accounting procedures in that rate schedule filing that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for both  capitalized AFUDC and corresponding amounts of CWIP proposed to be  included in rate base; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ensure that wholesale customers will not be charged for any  corresponding AFUDC capitalized as a result of different accounting or  ratemaking treatments accorded CWIP by state or local regulatory  authorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Anticompetitive procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Filing requirements. In order to  facilitate Commission review of the anticompetitive effects of  applications for CWIP pursuant to Sec. 35.26(c)(3), a public utility  applying for rates based upon inclusion of such CWIP in rate base must  include the following information in its filing:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The percentage of the proposed increase in the jurisdictional  rate level attributable to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP  and the percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP  supporting the proposed rate level;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The percentage of non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP  permitted by the state or local commission supporting the current retail  rates of the public utility against which the relevant wholesale  customers compete; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Individual earned rate of return analyses of each of the  competing retail rates developed on a basis fully consistent with the  wholesale cost of service for the same test period if the requested  percentage of wholesale non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP  exceeds that permitted by the relevant state or local authority to  support the currently competing retail rates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preliminary relief. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If an intervenor in its initial pleading  alleges that a price squeeze will occur as a direct result of the public  utility's request for CWIP pursuant to Sec. 35.26(c)(3), makes a  showing that it is likely to incur harm if such CWIP is allowed subject  to refund, and makes a showing of how the harm to the intervenor would  be mitigated or eliminated by the types of preliminary relief requested,  the Commission will consider preliminary relief at the suspension stage  of the case pursuant to paragraph (g)(4) of this section. In determining  whether to grant preliminary relief, the Commission will balance the  following public interest considerations:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The harm to the intervenor if it is not granted preliminary  relief from the requested CWIP;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The harm to the public utility if, during the interim period of  preliminary relief, the public utility is required to recover its  financing charges later through AFUDC rather than immediately through  CWIP; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Mitigating bias against investment in new plants, ensuring  accurate price signals, and fostering rate stability.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Whether or not preliminary relief is granted at the suspension  stage will not preclude consideration of further interim or final  remedies later in the proceedings, if warranted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Commission makes a final determination that a price  squeeze due solely to allowance of a lower percentage of non-pollution  control/fuel conversion CWIP in the public utility's retail rate base  than allowed by this Commission, the Commission will consider an  adjustment to non-pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP in order to  eliminate or mitigate the price squeeze.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If an intervenor meets the requirements of paragraph (g)(2) of  this section, the Commission, depending on the type of showing made  including the likelihood, immediacy, and severity of any anticompetitive  harm, may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Suspend the entire rate increase or all or a portion of the non- pollution control/fuel conversion CWIP component for up to five months;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Allow all or a portion of the non-pollution control/fuel  conversion CWIP only prospectively from the issuance of the Commission's  final order on rehearing on the matter; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Take such other action as is proper under the circumstances.
