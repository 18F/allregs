The Board may comply with the requirements of this  subpart H through such means as redesign of equipment, reassignment of  services to accessible buildings, assignment of aides to individuals  with a disability, home visits, delivery of service at alternate  accessible sites, alteration of existing facilities and construction of  new facilities, use of accessible rolling stock, or any other methods  that result in making its programs or activities readily accessible to  and usable by individuals with a disability. The Board is not required  to make structural changes in existing facilities where other methods  are effective in achieving compliance with this section. In choosing  among available methods for meeting the requirements of this section,  the Board shall give priority to those methods that offer programs and  activities to qualified individuals with a disability in the most  integrated setting appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Time period for compliance.
