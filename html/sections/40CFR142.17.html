Among the factors the Administrator intends to consider as relevant to this determination are the following, where appropriate: whether

the State has requested and has been granted, or is awaiting EPA's decision on, an extension under Sec.  142.12(b)(2) of the deadlines for meeting those requirements; and whether the State is taking corrective actions that may have been required by the Administrator.
