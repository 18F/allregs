                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the property has been damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or, for mortgages insured on or after January 1, 1977, the property has suffered damage because of the mortgagee's failure to take action as required by Sec. 203.377, the damage must be repaired before conveyance of the property or assignment of the mortgage to the Secretary, except under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the prior approval of the Secretary is obtained, there will be deducted from the insurance benefits the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repairing the damage or any insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the property has been damaged by fire and was not covered by fire insurance at the time of the damage, or the amount of insurance coverage was inadequate to repair fully the damage, only the amount of insurance recovery received by the mortgagee, if any, will be deducted from the insurance benefits, provided the mortgagee certifies, at the time that a claim is filed for insurance benefits, that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> At the time the mortgage was insured, the property was covered by fire insurance in an amount at least equal

to the lesser of 100 percent of the insurable value of the improvements, or the principal loan balance of the mortgage; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The insurer later cancelled this coverage or refused to renew it for reasons other than nonpayment of premium; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The mortgagee made diligent though unsuccessful efforts within 30 days of any cancellation or non-renewal of hazard insurance, and at least annually thereafter, to secure other coverage or coverage under a FAIR Plan, in an amount described in paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section, or if coverage to such an extent was unavailable at a reasonable rate, the greatest extent of coverage that was available at a reasonable rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent of coverage obtained by the mortgagee in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(iii) of this section was the greatest available at a reasonable rate, or if the mortgagee was unable to obtain insurance, none was available at a reasonable rate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The mortgagee took the actions required by Sec. 203.377 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The certification requirements set out in paragraph (a)(2) of this section apply to any mortgage insured by HUD on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has not been filed before September 30, 1986. Any mortgage insured on or after September 22, 1980, for which a claim has been filed before September 30, 1986, but the claim has not been settled before that date, will be governed by Sec. 203.379(b) (1986) Edition as it existed immediately before September 30, 1986.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> As used in this section, reasonable rate means a rate that is not in excess of the rate or advisory rate set by the principal State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, or if coverage is available under a FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As used in this section, reasonable rate means a rate that is not in excess of the rate or advisory rate set by the principal State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, or if coverage is available under a FAIR Plan, the FAIR Plan rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a State has neither a FAIR Plan nor a State-licensed rating organization for essential property insurance in the voluntary market, the mortgagee must provide to the HUD Field Office having jurisdiction, information concerning the lowest rates available from an insurer for the types of coverage involved, with a request for a determination of whether the rate is reasonable. HUD will determine the rate to be reasonable if it approximates the rate assessed for comparable insurance coverage applicable to similarly situated properties in a State that offers a FAIR Plan or maintains a State-licensed rating organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For mortgages insured under firm commitments issued on or after November 19, 1992, or under direct endorsement processing where the credit worksheet was signed by the mortgagee's underwriter on or after November 19, 1992, the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section apply and, in addition, if the property has been damaged during the time of the mortgagee's possession by events other than fire, flood, earthquake, hurricane, or tornado, or if it was damaged notwithstanding reasonable action by the mortgagee as required by Sec. 203.377 of this part, the mortgagee must provide notice of such damage to the Secretary and may not convey until directed to do so by the Secretary. The Secretary will either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Allow the mortgagee to convey the property damaged; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the mortgagee to repair the damage before conveyance, and the Secretary will reimburse the mortgagee for reasonable payments not in excess of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair, less any insurance recovery.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event the damaged property is conveyed to the Secretary without prior notice or approval as provided in paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section, the Secretary may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After notice, reconvey the property to the mortgagee and the mortgagee must reimburse the Secretary in accordance with Sec. Sec. 203.363 and 203.364 of this part, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the mortgagee to reimburse the Secretary for the greater of the Secretary's estimate of the cost of repair or any insurance recovery.
