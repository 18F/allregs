Individuals may request amendment of  records pertaining to them that are subject to amendment under the  Privacy Act and this part. The request should be sent by regular mail  addressed to: Privacy Act Officer, U.S.   Office of Special Counsel, 1730 M Street, N.W. (Suite 218), Washington,  DC 20036-4505. Such requests may also be faxed to the Privacy Act  Officer at the number provided on the FOIA/PA page of OSC's web site  (see 1830.1). For the quickest handling, both the request letter and  envelope or any fax cover sheet should be clearly marked ``Privacy Act  Amendment Request.'' Whether sent by mail or by fax, a Privacy Act  amendment request will not be considered to have been received by OSC  until it reaches the Privacy Act Officer. A Privacy Act amendment  request may also be delivered by person at OSC's headquarters office in  Washington, DC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Description of amendment sought. Requests for amendment should  include identification of records together with a statement of the basis  for the requested amendment and all available supporting documents and  materials.

Requests for amendment shall be  acknowledged by OSC not later than 10 days (excluding Saturdays,  Sundays, and legal holidays) after receipt by the Privacy Act Officer  and a determination on the request shall be made promptly.</p>
