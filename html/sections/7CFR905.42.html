Such reserve  funds may be used (1) to cover any expenses authorized by this part and  (2) to cover necessary expenses of liquidation in the event of  termination of this part. If any such excess is not retained in a  reserve, each handler entitled to a proportionate refund shall be  credited with such refund against the operations of the following fiscal  period unless he demands payment of the sum due him, in which case such  sum shall be paid to him. Upon termination of this part, any funds not  required to defray the necessary expenses of liquidation shall be  disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may determine to be  appropriate: Provided, That to the extent practical, such funds shall be  returned pro rata to the persons from whom such funds were collected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The committee may, with the approval of the Secretary, maintain  in its own name or in the name of its members a suit against any handler  for the collection of such handler's pro rata share of the said expense.
