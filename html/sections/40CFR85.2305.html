                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, a  certificate of conformity is deemed to be effective and cover the  vehicles or engines named in such certificate and produced during the  annual production period, as defined in Sec. 85.2304.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Section 203 of the Clean Air Act prohibits the sale, offering  for sale, delivery for introduction into commerce, and introduction into  commerce, of any new vehicle or engine not covered by a certificate of  conformity unless it is an imported vehicle exempted by the  Administrator or otherwise authorized   jointly by EPA and U.S. Customs Service regulations. However, the Act  does not prohibit the production of vehicles or engines without a  certificate of conformity. Vehicles or engines produced prior to the  effective date of a certificate of conformity, as defined in paragraph  (a) of this section, may also be covered by the certificate if the  following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The vehicles or engines conform in all material respects to the  vehicles or engines described in the application for the certificate of  conformity:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The vehicles or engines are not sold, offered for sale,  introduced into commerce, or delivered for introduction into commerce  prior to the effective date of the certificate of conformity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Agency is notified prior to the beginning of production when  such production will start, and the Agency is provided full opportunity  to inspect and/or test the vehicles during and after their production;  for example, the Agency must have the opportunity to conduct selective  enforcement auditing production line testing as if the vehicles had been  produced after the effective date of the certificate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> New vehicles or engines imported by an original equipment  manufacturer after December 31 of the calendar year for which the model  year was named are still covered by the certificate of conformity as  long as the production of the vehicle or engine was completed before  December 31 of that year. This paragraph does not apply to vehicles that  may be covered by certificates held by independent commercial importers  unless specifically approved by EPA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Vehicles or engines produced after December 31 of the calendar  year for which the model year is named are not covered by the  certificate of conformity for that model year. A new certificate of  conformity demonstrating compliance with currently applicable standards  must be obtained for these vehicles or engines even if they are  identical to vehicles or engines built before December 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The extended coverage period described here for a certificate of  conformity (i.e., up to one year plus 364 days) is primarily intended to  allow flexibility in the introduction of new models. Under no  circumstances should it be interpreted that existing models may ``skip''  yearly certification by pulling ahead the production of every other  model year.</p>
