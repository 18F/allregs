                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Role of EPA legal office. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate EPA legal office  (see paragraph (i) of this section) is responsible for making the final  administrative determination of whether or not business information  covered by a business confidentiality claim is entitled to confidential  treatment under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When a request for release of the information under 5 U.S.C. 552  is pending, the EPA legal office's determination shall serve as the  final determination on appeal from an initial denial of the request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the initial denial was issued under Sec. 2.204(b)(1), a final  determination by the EPA legal office is necessary only if the requestor  has actually filed an appeal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the initial denial was issued under Sec. 2.204(d)(1),  however, the EPA legal office shall issue a final determination in every  case, unless the request has been withdrawn. (Initial denials under  Sec. 2.204(d)(1) are of a procedural nature, to allow further inquiry  into the merits of the matter, and a requestor is entitled to a decision  on the merits.) If an appeal from such a denial has not been received by  the EPA Freedom of Information Officer on the tenth working day after  issuance of the denial, the matter shall be handled as if an appeal had  been received on that day, for purposes of establishing a schedule for  issuance of an appeal decision under Sec. 2.117 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comment period; extensions; untimeliness as waiver of claim. (1)  Each business which has been furnished the notice and opportunity to  comment prescribed by Sec. 2.204(d)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> and Sec. 2.204(e) shall furnish  its comments to the office specified in the notice in time to be  postmarked or hand delivered to that office not later than the date  specified in the notice (or the date established in lieu thereof under  this section).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The period for submission of comments may be extended if, before  the   comments are due, a request for an extension of the comment period is  made by the business and approved by the EPA legal office. Except in  extraordinary circumstances, the EPA legal office will not approve such  an extension without the consent of any person whose request for release  of the information under 5 U.S.C. 552 is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period for submission of comments by a business may be  shortened in the manner described in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a business's comments have not been received by the specified  EPA office by the date they are due (including any approved extension),  that office shall promptly inquire whether the business has complied  with paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If the business has complied with  paragraph (b)(1) but the comments have been lost in transmission,  duplicate comments shall be requested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Confidential treatment of comments from business. If information  submitted to EPA by a business as part of its comments under this  section pertains to the business's claim, is not otherwise possessed by  EPA, and is marked when received in accordance with Sec. 2.203(b), it  will be regarded by EPA as entitled to confidential treatment and will  not be disclosed by EPA without the business's consent, unless its  disclosure is duly ordered by a Federal court, notwithstanding other  provisions of this subpart to the contrary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Types of final determinations; matters to be considered. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If  the EPA legal office finds that a business has failed to furnish  comments under paragraph (b) of this section by the specified due date,  it shall determine that the business has waived its claim. If, after  application of the preceding sentence, no claim applies to the  information, the office shall determine that the information is not  entitled to confidential treatment under this subpart and, subject to  Sec. 2.210, is available to the public.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In all other cases, the EPA legal office shall consider each  business's claim and comments, the various provisions of this subpart,  any previously-issued determinations under this subpart which are  pertinent, the materials furnished it under Sec. 2.204(f), and such  other materials as it finds appropriate. With respect to each claim, the  office shall determine whether or not the information is entitled to  confidential treatment for the benefit of the business that asserted the  claim, and the period of any such entitlement (e.g., until a certain  date, until the occurrence of a specified event, or permanently), and  shall take further action under paragraph (e) or (f) of this section, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever the claims of two or more businesses apply to the same  information, the EPA legal office shall take action appropriate under  the particular circumstances to protect the interests of all persons  concerned (including any person whose request for the information is  pending under 5 U.S.C. 552).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination that information is entitled to confidential  treatment. If the EPA legal office determines that the information is  entitled to confidential treatment for the full period requested by the  business which made the claim, EPA shall maintain the information in  confidence for such period, subject to paragraph (h) of this section,  Sec. 2.209, and the other provisions of this subpart which authorize  disclosure in specified circumstances, and the office shall so inform  the business. If any person's request for the release of the information  is then pending under 5 U.S.C. 552, the EPA legal office shall issue a  final determination denying that request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination that information is not entitled to confidential  treatment; notice; waiting period; release of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of  denial (or partial denial) of a business confidentiality claim, in the  form prescribed by paragraph (f)(2) of this section, shall be  furnished--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By the EPA office taking action under Sec. 2.204, to each  business on behalf of which a claim has been made, whenever  Sec. 2.204(d)(2) requires such notice; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By the EPA legal office taking action under this section, to  each business which has asserted a claim applicable to the information  and which has furnished timely comments under paragraph (b) of this  section, whenever the EPA legal office determines that the information  is not entitled to confidential treatment under this subpart for   the benefit of the business, or determines that the period of any  entitlement to confidential treatment is shorter than that requested by  the business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The notice prescribed by paragraph (f)(1) of this section shall  be written, and shall be furnished by certified mail (return receipt  requested), by personal delivery, or by other means which allows  verification of the fact of receipt and the date of receipt. The notice  shall state the basis for the determination, that it constitutes final  agency action concerning the business confidentiality claim, and that  such final agency action may be subject to judicial review under Chapter  7 of Title 5, United States Code. With respect to EPA's implementation  of the determination, the notice shall state that (subject to  Sec. 2.210) EPA will make the information available to the public on the  tenth working day after the date of the business's receipt of the  written notice (or on such later date as is established in lieu thereof  by the EPA legal office under paragraph (f)(3) of this section), unless  the EPA legal office has first been notified of the business's  commencement of an action in a Federal court to obtain judicial review  of the determination, and to obtain preliminary injunctive relief  against disclosure. The notice shall further state that if such an  action is timely commenced, EPA may nonetheless make the information  available to the public (in the absence of an order by the court to the  contrary), once the court has denied a motion for a preliminary  injunction in the action or has otherwise upheld the EPA determination,  or whenever it appears to the EPA legal office, after reasonable notice  to the business, that the business is not taking appropriate measures to  obtain a speedy resolution of the action. If the information has been  found to be temporarily entitled to confidential treatment, the notice  shall further state that the information will not be disclosed prior to  the end of the period of such temporary entitlement to confidential  treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The period established in a notice under paragraph (f)(2) of  this section for commencement of an action to obtain judicial review may  be extended if, before the expiration of such period, a request for an  extension is made by the business and approved by the EPA legal office.  Except in extraordinary circumstances, the EPA legal office will not  approve such an extension without the consent of any person whose  request for release of the information under 5 U.S.C. 552 is pending.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> After the expiration of any period of temporary entitlement to  confidential treatment, a determination under this paragraph (f) shall  be implemented by the EPA legal office by making the information  available to the public (in the absence of a court order prohibiting  disclosure) whenever--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The period provided for commencement by a business of an action  to obtain judicial review of the determination has expired without  notice to the EPA legal office of commencement of such an action;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The court, in a timely-commenced action, has denied the  business' motion for a preliminary injunction, or has otherwise upheld  the EPA determination; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The EPA legal office, after reasonable notice has been  provided to the business, finds that the business is not taking  appropriate measures to obtain a speedy resolution of the timely- commenced action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any person whose request for release of the information under 5  U.S.C. 552 is pending at the time notice is given under paragraph (f)(2)  of this section shall be furnished a determination under 5 U.S.C. 552  stating the circumstances under which the information will be released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Emergency situations. If the General Counsel finds that  disclosure of information covered by a claim would be helpful in  alleviating a situation posing an imminent and substantial danger to  public health or safety, he may prescribe and make known to interested  persons such shorter comment period (paragraph (b) of this section),  post-determination waiting period (paragraph (f) of this section), or  both, as he finds necessary under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modification of prior determinations. A determination that  information is entitled to confidential treatment for the benefit of a  business,   made under this subpart by an EPA legal office, shall continue in effect  in accordance with its terms until an EPA legal office taking action  under this section, or under Sec. 2.206 or Sec. 2.207, issues a final  determination stating that the earlier determination no longer describes  correctly the information's entitlement to confidential treatment  because of change in the applicable law, newly-discovered or changed  facts, or because the earlier determination was clearly erroneous. If an  EPA legal office tentatively concludes that such an earlier  determination is of questionable validity, it shall so inform the  business, and shall afford the business an opportunity to furnish  comments on pertinent issues in the manner described by Sec. 2.204(e)  and paragraph (b) of this section. If, after consideration of any timely  comments submitted by the business, the EPA legal office makes a revised  final determination that the information is not entitled to confidential  treatment, or that the period of entitlement to such treatment will end  sooner than it would have ended under the earlier determination, the  office will follow the procedure described in paragraph (f) of this  section. Determinations under this section may be made only by, or with  the concurrence of, the General Counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Delegation and redelegation of authority. Unless the General  Counsel otherwise directs, or this subpart otherwise specifically  provides, determinations and actions required by this subpart to be made  or taken by an EPA legal office shall be made or taken by the  appropriate Regional counsel whenever the EPA office taking action under  Sec. 2.204 or Sec. 2.206(b) is under the supervision of a Regional  Administrator, and by the General Counsel in all other cases. The  General Counsel may redelegate any or all of his authority under this  subpart to any attorney employed by EPA on a full-time basis under the  General Counsel's supervision. A Regional Counsel may redelegate any or  all of his authority under this subpart to any attorney employed by EPA  on a full-time basis under the Regional counsel's supervision.
