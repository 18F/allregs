Neither the fact that the injury, illness, impairment or disease manifests itself after a diagnosis of a medical condition covered by the provisions of Sec. 30.225(a), nor the belief of the claimant that the injury, illness, impairment or disease was caused by such a condition, is sufficient in itself to prove a causal relationship.</p><p class="depth0">Eligibility Criteria for Other Claims Under Part E of EEOICPA</p>
