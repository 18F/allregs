                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conflict of interest in representation. No person shall appear  as counsel for another person in an adjudicatory proceeding if it  reasonably appears that such representation may be materially limited by  that counsel's responsibilities to a third person or by the counsel's  own interests. The administrative law judge may take corrective measures  at any stage of a proceeding to cure a conflict of interest in  representation, including the issuance of an order limiting the scope of  representation or disqualifying an individual from appearing in a  representative capacity for the duration of the proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Certification and waiver. If any person appearing as counsel  represents two or more parties to an adjudicatory proceeding or also  represents a non-party on a matter relevant to an issue in the  proceeding, counsel must certify in writing at the time of filing the  notice of appearance required by Sec. 19.6(a):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That the counsel has personally and fully discussed the  possibility of conflicts of interest with each such party and non-party;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That each such party and non-party waives any right it might  otherwise have had to assert any known conflicts of interest or to  assert any non-material conflicts of interest during the course of the  proceeding.
