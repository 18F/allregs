                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Which pipelines are covered by this section? This section  applies to each hazardous liquid pipeline and carbon dioxide pipeline  that could affect a high consequence area, including any pipeline  located in a high consequence area unless the operator effectively  demonstrates by risk assessment that the pipeline could not affect the  area. (Appendix C of this part provides guidance on determining if a  pipeline could affect a high consequence area.) Covered pipelines are  categorized as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Category 1 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that  were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated a total of  500 or more miles of pipeline subject to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Category 2 includes pipelines existing on May 29, 2001, that  were owned or operated by an operator who owned or operated less than  500 miles of pipeline subject to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Category 3 includes pipelines constructed or converted after May  29, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What program and practices must operators use to manage pipeline  integrity? Each operator of a pipeline covered by this section must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Develop a written integrity management program that addresses  the risks on each segment of pipeline in the first column of the  following table not later than the date in the second column:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Pipeline                               Date ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Category 1................................

(1) An operator  must include each of the following elements in its written baseline  assessment plan:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The methods selected to assess the integrity of the line pipe.  An operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe by any of the  following methods. The methods an operator selects to assess low  frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap welded pipe susceptible  to longitudinal seam failure must be capable of assessing seam integrity  and of detecting corrosion and deformation anomalies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion  and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this  part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with  Sec. 195.588; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an  equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe.

Date the pipeline   Not applicable.</p><p class="depth0">begins operation. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior assessment. To satisfy the requirements of paragraph  (c)(1)(i) of this section for pipelines in the first column of the  following table, operators may use integrity assessments conducted after  the date in the second column, if the integrity assessment method  complies with this section. However, if an operator uses this prior  assessment as its baseline assessment, the operator must reassess the  line pipe according to paragraph (j)(3) of this section. The table  follows:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Pipeline                               Date ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Category 1................................  January 1, 1996. Category 2................................  February 15, 1997. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Newly-identified areas. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> When information is available from  the information analysis (see paragraph (g) of this section), or from  Census Bureau maps, that the population density around a pipeline  segment has changed so as to fall within the definition in Sec. 195.450  of a high population area or other populated area, the operator must  incorporate the area into its baseline assessment plan as a high  consequence area within one year from the date the area is identified.  An operator must complete the baseline assessment of any line pipe that  could affect the newly-identified high consequence area within five  years from the date the area is identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An operator must incorporate a new unusually sensitive area  into its baseline assessment plan within one   year from the date the area is identified. An operator must complete the  baseline assessment of any line pipe that could affect the newly- identified high consequence area within five years from the date the  area is identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> What are the risk factors for establishing an assessment  schedule (for both the baseline and continual integrity assessments)?  (1) An operator must establish an integrity assessment schedule that  prioritizes pipeline segments for assessment (see paragraphs (d)(1) and  (j)(3) of this section). An operator must base the assessment schedule  on all risk factors that reflect the risk conditions on the pipeline  segment. The factors an operator must consider include, but are not  limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Results of the previous integrity assessment, defect type and  size that the assessment method can detect, and defect growth rate;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pipe size, material, manufacturing information, coating type  and condition, and seam type;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Leak history, repair history and cathodic protection history;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Product transported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Operating stress level;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Existing or projected activities in the area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Local environmental factors that could affect the pipeline  (e.g., corrosivity of soil, subsidence, climatic);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> geo-technical hazards; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Physical support of the segment such as by a cable suspension  bridge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Appendix C of this part provides further guidance on risk  factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> What are the elements of an integrity management program? An  integrity management program begins with the initial framework. An  operator must continually change the program to reflect operating  experience, conclusions drawn from results of the integrity assessments,  and other maintenance and surveillance data, and evaluation of  consequences of a failure on the high consequence area. An operator must  include, at minimum, each of the following elements in its written  integrity management program:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A process for identifying which pipeline segments could affect a  high consequence area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A baseline assessment plan meeting the requirements of paragraph  (c) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> An analysis that integrates all available information about the  integrity of the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure (see  paragraph (g) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Criteria for remedial actions to address integrity issues raised  by the assessment methods and information analysis (see paragraph (h) of  this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A continual process of assessment and evaluation to maintain a  pipeline's integrity (see paragraph (j) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Identification of preventive and mitigative measures to protect  the high consequence area (see paragraph (i) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Methods to measure the program's effectiveness (see paragraph  (k) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> A process for review of integrity assessment results and  information analysis by a person qualified to evaluate the results and  information (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> What is an information analysis? In periodically evaluating the  integrity of each pipeline segment (paragraph (j) of this section), an  operator must analyze all available information about the integrity of  the entire pipeline and the consequences of a failure. This information  includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information critical to determining the potential for, and  preventing, damage due to excavation, including current and planned  damage prevention activities, and development or planned development  along the pipeline segment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Data gathered through the integrity assessment required under  this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Data gathered in conjunction with other inspections, tests,  surveillance and patrols required by this Part, including, corrosion  control monitoring and cathodic protection surveys; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Information about how a failure would affect the high  consequence area, such as location of the water intake.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> What actions must an operator take to address integrity  issues?--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. An operator must take   prompt action to address all anomalous conditions the operator discovers  through the integrity assessment or information analysis. In addressing  all conditions, an operator must evaluate all anomalous conditions and  remediate those that could reduce a pipeline's integrity. An operator  must be able to demonstrate that the remediation of the condition will  ensure the condition is unlikely to pose a threat to the long-term  integrity of the pipeline. An operator must comply with Sec. 195.422  when making a repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Temporary pressure reduction. An operator must notify PHMSA, in  accordance with paragraph (m) of this section, if the operator cannot  meet the schedule for evaluation and remediation required under  paragraph (h)(3) of this section and cannot provide safety through a  temporary reduction in operating pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Long-term pressure reduction. When a pressure reduction exceeds  365 days, the operator must notify PHMSA in accordance with paragraph  (m) of this section and explain the reasons for the delay. An operator  must also take further remedial action to ensure the safety of the  pipeline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discovery of condition. Discovery of a condition occurs when an  operator has adequate information about the condition to determine that  the condition presents a potential threat to the integrity of the  pipeline. An operator must promptly, but no later than 180 days after an  integrity assessment, obtain sufficient information about a condition to  make that determination, unless the operator can demonstrate that the  180-day period is impracticable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Schedule for evaluation and remediation. An operator must  complete remediation of a condition according to a schedule prioritizing  the conditions for evaluation and remediation. If an operator cannot  meet the schedule for any condition, the operator must explain the  reasons why it cannot meet the schedule and how the changed schedule  will not jeopardize public safety or environmental protection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(B)</em> of this section.  If no suitable remaining strength calculation method can be identified,  an operator must implement a minimum 20 percent or greater operating  pressure reduction, based on actual operating pressure for two months  prior to the date of inspection, until the anomaly is repaired. An  operator must treat the following conditions as immediate repair  conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Metal loss greater than 80% of nominal wall regardless of  dimensions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows a  predicted burst pressure less than the established maximum operating  pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining strength  calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI B31G  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 195.3) and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG)  (incorporated by reference, see Sec. 195.3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8  o'clock positions) that has any indication of metal loss, cracking or a  stress riser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8  o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 6% of the nominal pipe  diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An anomaly that in the judgment of the person designated by the  operator to evaluate the assessment results requires immediate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 60-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph  (h)(4)(i) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation and  remediation of the following conditions within 60 days of discovery of  condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above the 4 and 8  o'clock positions) with a depth greater than 3% of the pipeline diameter  (greater than 0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than  Nominal Pipe Size (NPS) 12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline that has any  indication of metal loss, cracking or a stress riser.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 180-day conditions. Except for conditions listed in paragraph  (h)(4)(i) or (ii) of this section, an operator must schedule evaluation  and remediation of the following within 180 days of discovery of the  condition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A dent with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter  (0.250 inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12) that  affects pipe curvature at a girth weld or a longitudinal seam weld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A dent located on the top of the pipeline (above 4 and 8 o'clock  position) with a depth greater than 2% of the pipeline's diameter (0.250  inches in depth for a pipeline diameter less than NPS 12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A dent located on the bottom of the pipeline with a depth  greater than 6% of the pipeline's diameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> A calculation of the remaining strength of the pipe shows an  operating pressure that is less than the current established maximum  operating pressure at the location of the anomaly. Suitable remaining  strength calculation methods include, but are not limited to, ASME/ANSI  B31G and PRCI PR-3-805 (R-STRENG).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> An area of general corrosion with a predicted metal loss greater  than 50% of nominal wall.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Predicted metal loss greater than 50% of nominal wall that is  located at a crossing of another pipeline, or is in an area with  widespread circumferential corrosion, or is in an area that could affect  a girth weld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> A potential crack indication that when excavated is determined  to be a crack.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> Corrosion of or along a longitudinal seam weld.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(I)</em> A gouge or groove greater than 12.5% of nominal wall.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other conditions. In addition to the conditions listed in  paragraphs (h)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section, an operator must  evaluate any condition identified by an integrity assessment or  information analysis that could impair the integrity of the pipeline,  and as appropriate, schedule the condition for remediation. Appendix C  of this part contains guidance concerning other conditions that an  operator should evaluate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> What preventive and mitigative measures must an operator take to  protect the high consequence area?--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. An  operator must take measures to prevent and mitigate the consequences of  a pipeline failure that could affect a high consequence area. These  measures include conducting a risk analysis of the pipeline segment to  identify additional actions to enhance public safety or environmental  protection. Such actions may include, but are not limited to,  implementing damage prevention best practices, better monitoring of  cathodic protection where corrosion is a concern, establishing shorter  inspection intervals, installing EFRDs on the pipeline segment,  modifying the systems that monitor pressure and detect leaks, providing  additional training to personnel on response procedures, conducting  drills with local emergency responders and adopting other management  controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Risk analysis criteria. In identifying the need for additional  preventive and mitigative measures, an operator must evaluate the  likelihood of a pipeline release occurring and how a release could  affect the high consequence area. This determination must consider all  relevant risk factors, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Terrain surrounding the pipeline segment, including drainage  systems such as small streams and other smaller waterways that could act  as a conduit to the high consequence area;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Elevation profile;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Characteristics of the product transported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Amount of product that could be released;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Possibility of a spillage in a farm field following the drain  tile into a waterway;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Ditches along side a roadway the pipeline crosses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Physical support of the pipeline segment such as by a cable  suspension bridge;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Exposure of the pipeline to operating pressure exceeding  established maximum operating pressure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Leak detection. An operator must have a means to detect leaks on  its pipeline system. An operator must   evaluate the capability of its leak detection means and modify, as  necessary, to protect the high consequence area. An operator's  evaluation must, at least, consider, the following factors--length and  size of the pipeline, type of product carried, the pipeline's proximity  to the high consequence area, the swiftness of leak detection, location  of nearest response personnel, leak history, and risk assessment  results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Emergency Flow Restricting Devices (EFRD). If an operator  determines that an EFRD is needed on a pipeline segment to protect a  high consequence area in the event of a hazardous liquid pipeline  release, an operator must install the EFRD. In making this  determination, an operator must, at least, consider the following  factors--the swiftness of leak detection and pipeline shutdown  capabilities, the type of commodity carried, the rate of potential  leakage, the volume that can be released, topography or pipeline  profile, the potential for ignition, proximity to power sources,  location of nearest response personnel, specific terrain between the  pipeline segment and the high consequence area, and benefits expected by  reducing the spill size.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> What is a continual process of evaluation and assessment to  maintain a pipeline's integrity?--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General. After completing the  baseline integrity assessment, an operator must continue to assess the  line pipe at specified intervals and periodically evaluate the integrity  of each pipeline segment that could affect a high consequence area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as  frequently as needed to assure pipeline integrity. An operator must base  the frequency of evaluation on risk factors specific to its pipeline,  including the factors specified in paragraph (e) of this section. The  evaluation must consider the results of the baseline and periodic  integrity assessments, information analysis (paragraph (g) of this  section), and decisions about remediation, and preventive and mitigative  actions (paragraphs (h) and (i) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Assessment intervals. An operator must establish five-year  intervals, not to exceed 68 months, for continually assessing the line  pipe's integrity. An operator must base the assessment intervals on the  risk the line pipe poses to the high consequence area to determine the  priority for assessing the pipeline segments. An operator must establish  the assessment intervals based on the factors specified in paragraph (e)  of this section, the analysis of the results from the last integrity  assessment, and the information analysis required by paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Variance from the 5-year intervals in limited situations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Engineering basis. An operator may be able to justify an engineering  basis for a longer assessment interval on a segment of line pipe. The  justification must be supported by a reliable engineering evaluation  combined with the use of other technology, such as external monitoring  technology, that provides an understanding of the condition of the line  pipe equivalent to that which can be obtained from the assessment  methods allowed in paragraph (j)(5) of this section. An operator must  notify OPS 270 days before the end of the five-year (or less) interval  of the justification for a longer interval, and propose an alternative  interval. An operator must send the notice to the address specified in  paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Unavailable technology. An operator may require a longer  assessment period for a segment of line pipe (for example, because  sophisticated internal inspection technology is not available). An  operator must justify the reasons why it cannot comply with the required  assessment period and must also demonstrate the actions it is taking to  evaluate the integrity of the pipeline segment in the interim. An  operator must notify OPS 180 days before the end of the five-year (or  less) interval that the operator may require a longer assessment  interval, and provide an estimate of when the assessment can be  completed. An operator must send a notice to the address specified in  paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Assessment methods. An operator must assess the integrity of the  line pipe by any of the following methods. The methods an operator  selects to assess low frequency electric resistance welded pipe or lap  welded pipe susceptible to longitudinal seam failure must   be capable of assessing seam integrity and of detecting corrosion and  deformation anomalies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Internal inspection tool or tools capable of detecting corrosion  and deformation anomalies including dents, gouges and grooves;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Pressure test conducted in accordance with subpart E of this  part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> External corrosion direct assessment in accordance with  Sec. 195.588; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Other technology that the operator demonstrates can provide an  equivalent understanding of the condition of the line pipe. An operator  choosing this option must notify OPS 90 days before conducting the  assessment, by sending a notice to the address or facsimile number  specified in paragraph (m) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> What methods to measure program effectiveness must be used? An  operator's program must include methods to measure whether the program  is effective in assessing and evaluating the integrity of each pipeline  segment and in protecting the high consequence areas. See Appendix C of  this part for guidance on methods that can be used to evaluate a  program's effectiveness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> What records must an operator keep to demonstrate compliance?  (1) An operator must maintain, for the useful life of the pipeline,  records that demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this  subpart. At a minimum, an operator must maintain the following records  for review during an inspection:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A written integrity management program in accordance with  paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Documents to support the decisions and analyses, including any  modifications, justifications, deviations and determinations made,  variances, and actions taken, to implement and evaluate each element of  the integrity management program listed in paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> See Appendix C of this part for examples of records an operator  would be required to keep.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> How does an operator notify PHMSA? An operator must provide any  notification required by this section by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Sending the notification by electronic mail to  InformationResourcesManager@dot.gov; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Sending the notification by mail to ATTN: Information Resources  Manager, DOT/PHMSA/OPS, East Building, 2nd Floor, E22-321, 1200 New  Jersey Ave SE., Washington, DC 20590.
