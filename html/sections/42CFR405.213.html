A sponsor that does not agree with the FDA's categorization of its device may submit a written request to the FDA at any time requesting re-evaluation of its original categorization decision, together with any information and rationale that it believes support recategorization. The FDA notifies both CMS and the sponsor of its decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Request to CMS. If the FDA does not agree to recategorize the device, the sponsor may seek review from CMS. A device sponsor must submit its request in writing to CMS. CMS obtains copies of relevant portions of the application, the original categorization decision, and supplementary materials. CMS reviews all material submitted by the sponsor and the FDA's recommendation. CMS reviews only information in the FDA record to determine whether to change the categorization of the device. CMS issues a written decision and notifies the sponsor of the IDE and the FDA.
