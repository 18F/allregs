                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This part describes the various formal and informal adjudicative actions and non-adjudicative proceedings available to the National Credit Union Administration Board (``NCUA Board''), the grounds for those actions and proceedings, and the procedures used in formal and informal hearings related to each available action. As mandated by section 916 of the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (``FIRREA'') (12 U.S.C. 1818 note), this part incorporates uniform rules of practice and procedure governing formal adjudications generally, as well as proceedings involving cease-and-desist actions, assessment of civil money penalties, and removal, prohibition and suspension actions. In addition, the Uniform Rules are incorporated in other subparts of this part which provide for formal adjudications. The administrative actions and proceedings described herein, as well as the grounds and hearing procedures for each, are controlled by sections 120(b) (except where the Federal credit union is closed due to insolvency), 202(a)(3) and 206 of the Federal Credit Union Act (``the Act''), 12 U.S.C. 1766(b), 1782(a)(3), 1786. Should any provision of this part be inconsistent with these or any other provisions of the Act, as amended, the Act shall control. Judicial enforcement of any action or order described in this part, as well as judicial review thereof, shall be as prescribed under the Act (12 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.) and the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 500 et seq.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in this part, the term insured credit union means any Federal credit union or any state chartered credit union insured under subchapter II of the Act unless the context indicates otherwise.
