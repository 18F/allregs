                            <p class="depth0">When Table 148.10 of this part associates a material with a reference to a paragraph in this section, each vessel transporting the material, other than an unmanned barge, must have on board a gas analyzer appropriate for the toxic gas listed in that paragraph. At least two members of the crew must be knowledgeable in the use of the equipment. The equipment must be maintained in a condition ready for use and calibrated according to the instructions of its manufacturer. The atmosphere in the cargo hold and adjacent spaces must be tested before a person is allowed to enter these spaces. If toxic gases are detected, the space must be ventilated and retested before entry. The toxic gases for which the requirements of this section must be met are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Arsine;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Carbon monoxide;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Hydrogen cyanide;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hydrogen sulfide;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Phosphine; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Sulfur dioxide.</p>
