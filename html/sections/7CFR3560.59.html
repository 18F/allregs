                            <p class="depth0">Under the National Environmental Policy Act, the Agency is required  to assess the potential impact of the proposed action on protected  environmental resources. Measures to avoid or at least mitigate adverse  impacts to protected resources may require a change in the site or  project design. Therefore, a site cannot be approved until the Agency  has completed the environmental review in accordance with 7 CFR part  1940, subpart G, or any successor regulation. Likewise, the applicant  should be informed that the environmental review must be completed and  considered before the Agency can make a commitment of resources to the  project.</p>
