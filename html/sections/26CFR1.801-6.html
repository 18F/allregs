The provisions of section 801(d) and  this section may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth2">Example. The books of T, an insurance company, selling only life  insurance and cancellable accident and health insurance, reflect (after  adjustment under section 806 (a)) the following facts for the taxable  year 1958:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Mean of</p><p class="depth2">Jan. 1  Dec. 31    year ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.

Total reserves adjusted for policy loans    .......  .......    2,300</p><p class="depth2">(item 3 plus item 4)........................ ------------------------------------------------------------------------   As the rules provided by section 801 (a) and (d) require that the figure  in item 3 ($1,050) be more than 50 percent of the mean of the year  figure in item 5 ($2,300) for an insurance company to qualify as a life  insurance company, T would not qualify as a life insurance company for  the taxable year 1958.
