A flexible coated fabric (envelope) spans the annular space between the metal sheet and the floating roof.</p><p class="depth2">No detectable organic emissions means no escape of organics to the atmosphere as determined using the procedure specified in Sec.  63.694(k) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Off-site material means a material that meets all of the criteria specified in paragraph Sec.  63.680(b)(1) of this subpart but is not one of the materials specified in Sec.  63.680(b)(2) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Off-site material management unit means a tank, container, surface impoundment, oil-water separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system used to manage off-site material.</p><p class="depth2">Off-site material service means any time when a pump, compressor, agitator, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, or instrumentation system contains or contacts off-site material.</p><p class="depth2">Off-site material stream means an off-site material produced or generated by a particular process or source such that the composition and form of the material comprising the stream remain consistent. An off-site material stream may be delivered, transferred, or otherwise moved to the plant site in a continuous flow of material (e.g., wastewater flowing through a pipeline) or in a series of discrete batches of material (e.g., a truckload of drums all containing the same off-site material or multiple bulk truck loads of an off-site material produced by the same process).</p><p class="depth2">Oil-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate oil from water.</p><p class="depth2">Operating parameter value means a minimum or maximum value established for a control device or treatment process parameter which, if achieved

by itself or in combination with one or more other operating parameter values, determines that an owner or operator has complied with an applicable emission limitation or standard.</p><p class="depth2">Organic-water separator means a separator as defined for this subpart that is used to separate organics from water.</p><p class="depth2">Plant site means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under common control including properties that are separated only by a road or other public right-of-way. Common control includes properties that are owned, leased, or operated by the same entity, parent entity, subsidiary, or any combination thereof. A unit or group of units within a contiguous property that are not under common control (e.g., a wastewater treatment unit or solvent recovery unit located at the site but is sold to a different company) is a different plant site.</p><p class="depth2">Point-of-delivery means the point at the boundary or within the plant site where the owner or operator first accepts custody, takes possession, or assumes responsibility for the management of an off-site material stream managed in a waste management operation or recovery operation specified in Sec.  63.680 (a)(2)(i) through (a)(2)(vi) of this subpart. The characteristics of an off-site material stream are determined prior to combining the off-site material stream with other off-site material streams or with any other materials.</p><p class="depth2">Point-of-treatment means a point after the treated material exits the treatment process but before the first point downstream of the treatment process exit where the organic constituents in the treated material have the potential to volatilize and be released to the atmosphere. For the purpose of applying this definition to this subpart, the first point downstream of the treatment process exit is not a fugitive emission point due to an equipment leak from any of the following equipment components: Pumps, compressors, valves, connectors, instrumentation systems, or pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth2">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device. This release can be one release or a series of releases over a short time period.</p><p class="depth2">Pressure relief device or valve means a safety device used to prevent operating pressures from exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the process equipment. A common pressure relief device is a spring-loaded pressure relief valve. Devices that are actuated either by a pressure of less than or equal to 2.5 pounds per square inch gauge or by a vacuum are not pressure relief devices.</p><p class="depth2">Process heater means an enclosed combustion device that transfers heat released by burning fuel directly to process streams or to heat transfer liquids other than water.</p><p class="depth2">Process vent means an open-ended pipe, stack, or duct through which a gas stream containing HAP is continuously or intermittently discharged to the atmosphere from any of the processes listed in Sec.  63.680(c)(2)(i) through (vi). For the purpose of this subpart, a process vent is none of the following: a pressure relief device; an open-ended line or other vent that is subject to the equipment leak control requirements under Sec.  63.691; or a stack or other vent that is used to exhaust combustion products from a boiler, furnace, process heater, incinerator, or other combustion device.</p><p class="depth2">Recovery operation means the collection of off-site material management units, process vents, and equipment components used at a plant site to manage an off-site material stream from the point-of-delivery through the point where the material has been recycled, reprocessed, or re-refined to obtain the intended product or to remove the physical and chemical impurities of concern.</p><p class="depth2">Separator means a waste management unit, generally a tank, used to separate oil or organics from water. A separator consists of not only the separation unit but also the forebay and other separator basins, skimmers, weirs, grit chambers, sludge hoppers, and bar screens that are located directly after the individual drain system and prior to any additional treatment units such as an air flotation unit clarifier or biological treatment unit. Examples of a separator include, but are not limited

to, an API separator, parallel-plate interceptor, and corrugated-plate interceptor with the associated ancillary equipment.</p><p class="depth2">Single-seal system means a floating roof having one continuous seal. This seal may be vapor-mounted, liquid-mounted, or a metallic shoe seal.</p><p class="depth2">Surface impoundment means a unit that is a natural topographical depression, man-made excavation, or diked area formed primarily of earthen materials (although it may be lined with man-made materials), which is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids. Examples of surface impoundments include holding, storage, settling, and aeration pits, ponds, and lagoons.</p><p class="depth2">Tank means a stationary unit that is constructed primarily of nonearthen materials (such as wood, concrete, steel, fiberglass, or plastic) which provide structural support and is designed to hold an accumulation of liquids or other materials.</p><p class="depth2">Transfer system means a stationary system for which the predominant function is to convey liquids or solid materials from one point to another point within a waste management operation or recovery operation. For the purpose of this subpart, the conveyance of material using a container (as defined for this subpart) or a self-propelled vehicle (e.g., a front-end loader) is not a transfer system. Examples of a transfer system include but are not limited to a pipeline, an individual drain system, a gravity-operated conveyor (such as a chute), and a mechanically-powered conveyor (such as a belt or screw conveyor).</p><p class="depth2">Temperature monitoring device means a piece of equipment used to monitor temperature and having an accuracy of q1 percent of the temperature being monitored expressed in degrees Celsius (+C) or q1.2 degrees +C, whichever value is greater.</p><p class="depth2">Treatment process means a process in which an off-site material stream is physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated to destroy, degrade, or remove hazardous air pollutants contained in the off-site material. A treatment process can be composed of a single unit (e.g., a steam stripper) or a series of units (e.g., a wastewater treatment system). A treatment process can be used to treat one or more off-site material streams at the same time.</p><p class="depth2">Used oil means any oil refined from crude oil or any synthetic oil that has been used and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities. This definition is the same definition of ``used oil'' in 40 CFR 279.1.</p><p class="depth2">Used solvent means a mixture of aliphatic hydrocarbons or a mixture of one and two ring aromatic hydrocarbons that has been used as a solvent and as a result of such use is contaminated by physical or chemical impurities.</p><p class="depth2">Vapor-mounted seal means a continuous seal that is mounted such that there is a vapor space between the liquid in the unit and the bottom of the seal.</p><p class="depth2">Volatile organic hazardous air pollutant concentration or VOHAP concentration means the fraction by weight of those compounds listed in Table 1 of this subpart that are in an off-site material as measured using Method 305 in appendix A of this part and expressed in terms of parts per million (ppm). As an alternative to using Method 305, an owner or operator may determine the HAP concentration of an off-site material using any one of the other test methods specified in Sec.  63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart. When a test method specified in Sec.  63.694(b)(2)(ii) of this subpart other than Method 305 is used to determine the speciated HAP concentration of an off-site material, the individual compound concentration may be adjusted by the corresponding fm305 value listed in Table 1 of this subpart to determine a VOHAP concentration.</p><p class="depth2">Waste means a material generated from industrial, commercial, mining, or agricultural operations or from community activities that is discarded, discharged, or is being accumulated, stored, or physically, chemically, thermally, or biologically treated prior to being discarded or discharged.</p><p class="depth2">Waste management operation means the collection of off-site material management units, process vents, and equipment components used at a plant site to manage an off-site material stream from the point-of-delivery to the point where the waste exits or is

discharged from the plant site or the waste is placed for on-site disposal in a unit not subject to this subpart (e.g., a waste incinerator, a land disposal unit).</p><p class="depth2">Waste stabilization process means any physical or chemical process used to either reduce the mobility of hazardous constituents in a waste or eliminate free liquids as determined by Test Method 9095--Paint Filter Liquids Test in ``Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,'' EPA Publication No. SW-846, Third Edition, September 1986, as amended by Update I, November 15, 1992. (As an alternative, an owner or operator may use any more recent, updated version of Method 9095 approved by the EPA.) A waste stabilization process includes mixing the waste with binders or other materials and curing the resulting waste and binder mixture. Other synonymous terms used to refer to this process are ``waste fixation'' or ``waste solidification.'' A waste stabilization process does not include the adding of absorbent materials to the surface of a waste, without mixing, agitation, or subsequent curing, to absorb free liquid.
