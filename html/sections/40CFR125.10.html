EPA policy is to encourage such projects, while at the same time protecting other beneficial uses of the waters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Permits issued for discharges into aquaculture projects under this subpart are NPDES permits and are subject to the applicable requirements of parts 122, 123 and 124. Any permit shall include such conditions (including monitoring and reporting requirements) as are necessary to comply with those parts. Technology-based effluent limitations need not be applied to discharges into the approved project except with respect to toxic pollutants.</p>
