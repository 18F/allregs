coordinating its power flux density levels with adjacent licensed or permitted operators, only if there is no licensed 17/24 GHz BSS space station or prior-filed application at a location less than four degrees from the offset orbital location at which the applicant proposes to operate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, licensees and permittees will be allowed to apply for a license or authorization for a replacement satellite that will be operated at the same power level and interference protection as the satellite to be replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, licensees and permittees will be allowed to apply for a license or authorization for a replacement satellite that will be operated at the same power level and interference protection as the satellite to be replaced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In addition, applicants for licenses or authority for a satellite to be operated at an orbit location that was made available after a previous 17/24 GHz BSS license was cancelled or surrendered will be permitted to apply for authority to operate a satellite at the same power level and interference protection as the previous licensee at that orbit location, to the extent that their proposed operations are consistent with the provisions of this part. Such applications will be considered pursuant to the first-come, first-served procedures set forth in Sec. 25.158 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any U.S. licensee or permittee using a 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is located less than four degrees away from a prior-authorized 17/24 GHz BSS space station that is authorized to operate in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> may not cause any more interference to the adjacent satellite network than would be caused if the adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS space station were located four degrees away from the proposed space station; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> must accept any increased interference that results from the adjacent space station network operating at the offset orbital location less than four degrees away.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Any 17/24 GHz BSS U.S. licensee or permittee that is required to provide information in its application pursuant to Sec. 25.140(b)(4)(ii) or (b)(4)(iii) of this part must accept any increased interference that may result from adjacent 17/24 GHz BSS space stations that are operating in compliance with the rules for this service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any 17/24 GHz BSS U.S. licensee or permittee that does not comply with the power flux-density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future co-frequency licensees and permittees of a 17/24 GHz BSS network under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the operator's space-to-Earth power flux-density levels exceed the power flux-density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part by 3 dB or less, the operator shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future operators proposing a 17/24 GHz BSS space station in compliance with power flux-density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part and located within 6 degrees of the operator's 17/24 GHz BSS space station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the operator's space-to-Earth power flux-density levels exceed the power flux-density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part by more than 3 dB, the operator shall bear the burden of coordinating with any future operators proposing a 17/24 GHz BSS space station in compliance with power flux-density limits set forth in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part and located within 10 degrees of the operator's 17/24 GHz BSS space station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If no good faith agreement can be reached, the operator of the 17/24 GHz BSS satellite network that does not comply with Sec. 25.208(w) of this part shall reduce its space-to-Earth power flux-density levels to be compliant with those specified in Sec. 25.208(w) of this part.
