An impairment evaluation shall contain the physician's opinion on the extent of whole person impairment of all organs and body functions of the employee that are compromised or otherwise affected by the employee's covered illness or illnesses, which shall be referred to as a ``minimum impairment rating.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The minimum impairment rating shall be determined in accordance with the current edition of the American Medical Association's Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA's Guides). In making impairment

benefit determinations, OWCP will only consider medical reports from physicians who are certified by the relevant medical board and who satisfy any additional criteria determined by OWCP to be necessary to qualify to perform impairment evaluations under Part E, including any specific training in use of the AMA's Guides, specific training and experience related to particular conditions and other objective factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OWCP will establish criteria based upon objective factors such as training and certification that must be met by physicians preparing impairment evaluations in order for an impairment evaluation to be considered in determining an impairment award. Such criteria shall be made available to claimants and the public by OWCP.</p>
