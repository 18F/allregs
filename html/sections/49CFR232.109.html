                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (i) of this section, a  locomotive engineer shall be informed of the operational status of the  dynamic brakes on all locomotive units in the consist at the initial  terminal for a train and at other locations where a locomotive engineer  first begins operation of a train. The information required by this  paragraph may be provided to the locomotive engineer by any means  determined to be appropriate by the railroad; however, a written or  electronic record of the information shall be maintained in the cab of  the controlling locomotive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, all  inoperative dynamic brakes shall be repaired within 30 calendar days of  becoming inoperative or at the locomotive's next periodic inspection  pursuant to Sec. 229.23 of this chapter, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (e) of this section, a  locomotive discovered with inoperative dynamic brakes shall have a tag  bearing the words ``inoperative dynamic brake'' securely attached and  displayed in a conspicuous location in the cab of the locomotive. This  tag shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The locomotive number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The name of the discovering carrier;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The location and date where condition was discovered; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The signature of the person discovering the condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An electronic or written record of repairs made to a  locomotive's dynamic brakes shall be retained for 92 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A railroad may elect to declare the dynamic brakes on a  locomotive deactivated without removing the dynamic brake components  from the locomotive, only if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The locomotive is clearly marked with the words ``dynamic brake  deactivated'' in a conspicuous location in the cab of the locomotive;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The railroad has taken appropriate action to ensure that the  deactivated locomotive is incapable of utilizing dynamic brake effort to  retard or control train speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a locomotive consist is intended to have its dynamic brakes  used while in transit, a locomotive with inoperative or deactivated  dynamic brakes or a locomotive not equipped with dynamic brakes shall  not be placed in the controlling (lead) position of a consist unless the  locomotive has the capability of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Controlling the dynamic braking effort in trailing locomotives  in the consist that are so equipped; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Displaying to the locomotive engineer the deceleration rate of  the   train or the total train dynamic brake retarding force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> All locomotives equipped with dynamic brakes and ordered on or  after April 1, 2006, or placed in service for the first time on or after  October 1, 2007, shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct an electrical integrity test of the dynamic brake to  determine if electrical current is being received at the grids on the  system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display in real-time in the cab of the controlling (lead)  locomotive the total train dynamic brake retarding force available in  the train.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> All rebuilt locomotives equipped with dynamic brakes and placed  in service on or after April 1, 2004, shall be designed to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct an electrical integrity test of the dynamic brake to  determine if electrical current is being received at the grids on the  system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Display either the train deceleration rate or in real-time in  the cab of the controlling (lead) locomotive the total train dynamic  brake retarding force available in the train.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The information required by paragraph (a) of this section is not  required to be provided to the locomotive engineer if all of the  locomotives in the lead consist of a train are equipped in accordance  with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A railroad operating a train with a brake system that includes  dynamic brakes shall adopt and comply with written operating rules  governing safe train handling procedures using these dynamic brakes  under all operating conditions, which shall be tailored to the specific  equipment and territory of the railroad. The railroad's operating rules  shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that the friction brakes are sufficient by themselves,  without the aid of dynamic brakes, to stop the train safely under all  operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Include a ``miles-per-hour-overspeed-stop'' rule. At a minimum,  this rule shall require that any train when descending a section of  track with an average grade of one percent or greater over a distance of  three continuous miles shall be immediately brought to a stop, by an  emergency brake application if necessary, when the train's speed exceeds  the maximum authorized speed for that train by more than 5 miles per  hour. A railroad shall reduce the 5-miles-per-hour-overspeed-stop  restriction if validated research indicates the need for such a  reduction. A railroad may increase the 5-miles-per-hour-overspeed  restriction only with approval of FRA and based upon verifiable data and  research.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A railroad operating a train with a brake system that includes  dynamic brakes shall adopt and comply with specific knowledge, skill,  and ability criteria to ensure that its locomotive engineers are fully  trained in the operating rules prescribed by paragraph (j) of this  section. The railroad shall incorporate such criteria into its  locomotive engineer certification program pursuant to part 240 of this  chapter.
