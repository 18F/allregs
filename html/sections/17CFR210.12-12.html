For purposes of the</p><p class="depth0">list (including, in the case of short-term debt instruments, the first sentence of note 4), aggregate and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> short-term debt instruments (i.e., debt instruments whose</p><p class="depth0">maturities or expiration dates at the time of acquisition are one year or less) of the same issuer (indicating</p><p class="depth0">the range of interest rates and maturity dates); and (b) fully collateralized repurchase agreements (indicate</p><p class="depth0">in a footnote the range of dates of the repurchase agreements, the total purchase price of the securities, the</p><p class="depth0">total amount to be received upon repurchase, the range of repurchase dates, and description of securities</p><p class="depth0">subject to the repurchase agreements). Restricted and unrestricted securities of the same issue should be</p><p class="depth0">aggregated for purposes of determining whether the issue is among the 50 largest issues, but should not be</p><p class="depth0">combined in the schedule. For purposes of determining whether the value of an issue exceeds one percent of net</p><p class="depth0">asset value, aggregate and treat as a single issue all securities of any one issuer, except that all fully</p><p class="depth0">collateralized repurchase agreements shall be aggregated and treated as a single issue. The U.S. Treasury and</p><p class="depth0">each agency, instrumentality, or corporation, including each government-sponsored entity, that issues U.S.</p><p class="depth0">government securities is a separate issuer.\4\ If multiple securities of an issuer aggregate to greater than one percent of net asset value, list each</p><p class="depth0">issue of the issuer separately (including separate listing of restricted and unrestricted securities of the</p><p class="depth0">same issue) except that the following may be aggregated and listed as a single issue: (a) Fixed-income</p><p class="depth0">securities of the same issuer which are not among the 50 largest issues and whose value does not exceed one</p><p class="depth0">percent of net asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period (indicating the range of interest</p><p class="depth0">rates and maturity dates); and (b) U.S. government securities of a single agency, instrumentality, or</p><p class="depth0">corporation, which are not among the 50 largest issues and whose value does not exceed one percent of net</p><p class="depth0">asset value of the registrant as of the close of the period (indicating the range of interest rates and</p><p class="depth0">maturity dates). For each category identified pursuant to note 1, group all issues that are neither separately</p><p class="depth0">listed nor included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue in a sub-</p><p class="depth0">category labeled ``Other securities,'' and provide the information for Columns C and D.\5\ Any securities that would be required to be listed separately or included in a group of securities that is</p><p class="depth0">listed in the aggregate as a single issue may be listed in one amount as ``Miscellaneous securities,''</p><p class="depth0">provided the securities so listed are eligible to be, and are, categorized as ``Miscellaneous securities'' in</p><p class="depth0">the registrant's Schedule of Investments in Securities of Unaffiliated Issuers required under Sec. 210.12-</p><p class="depth0">12. However, if any security that is included in ``Miscellaneous securities'' would otherwise be required to</p><p class="depth0">be included in a group of securities that is listed in the aggregate as a single issue, the remaining</p><p class="depth0">securities of that group must nonetheless be listed as required by notes 3 and 4 even if the remaining</p><p class="depth0">securities alone would not otherwise be required to be listed in this manner (e.g., because the combined value</p><p class="depth0">of the security listed in ``Miscellaneous securities'' and the remaining securities of the same issuer exceeds</p><p class="depth0">one percent of net asset value, but the value of the remaining securities alone does not exceed one percent of</p><p class="depth0">net asset value).\6\ If any securities are listed as ``Miscellaneous securities'' pursuant to note 5 or ``Other securities''</p><p class="depth0">pursuant to note 4, briefly explain in a footnote what those terms represent.\7\ Total Column C.
