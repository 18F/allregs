                                Sec. 780.609  Workweek unit in applying the exemption.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The unit of time to be used in determining the application of the  exemption to an employee is the workweek. (See Overnight Transportation  Co. v. Missel, 316 U.S. 572.) A workweek is a fixed and regularly  recurring interval of seven consecutive 24-hour periods. It may begin at  any hour of any day set by the employer and need not coincide with the  calendar week. Once the workweek has been set it commences each  succeeding week on the same day and at the same hour. Changing of the  workweek for the purpose of escaping the requirements of the Act is not  permitted.</p>
