                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Consolidated compliance reviews shall be implemented to determine employment opportunities on an areawide rather than an individual project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach shall be adopted and directed by either Headquarters, region, division, or SHA, however, consolidated reviews shall at all times remain a cooperative effort.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OFCCP policy requires contracting agencies to ensure compliance, in hometown an imposed plan areas, on an areawide rather than a project basis. The consolidated compliance review approach facilitates implementation of this policy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Methodology--(1) Selection of a target area. In identifying the target area of a consolidated compliance review (e.g. SMSA, hometown or imposed plan area, a multicounty area, or an entire State), consideration shall at least be given to the following facts:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Selection of a target area. In identifying the target area of a consolidated compliance review (e.g. SMSA, hometown or imposed plan area, a multicounty area, or an entire State), consideration shall at least be given to the following facts:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minority and female work force concentrations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Suspected or alleged discrimination in union membership or referral practices by local unions involved in highway construction;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Present or potential problem areas;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The number of highway projects in the target area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Hometown or imposed plan reports that indicate underutilization of minorities or females.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determine the review period. After the target area has been selected, the dates for the actual onsite reviews shall be established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Obtain background information. EEO-3's Local Union Reports, should be obtained from regional offices of the EEOC. Target area civilian labor force statistics providing percent minorities and percent females in the target area shall be obtained from State employment security agencies or similar State agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identify contractors. Every nonexempt federally assisted or direct Federal contractor and subcontractor in the target area shall be identified. In order to establish areawide employment patterns in the target area, employment data is needed for all contractors and subcontractors in the area. However, only those contractors with significant work forces (working prior to peak and not recently reviewed) may need to be actually reviwed onsite. Accordingly, once all contractors are identified, those contractors which will actually be reviewed onsite shall be determined. Compliance determinations shall only reflect the status of crafts covered by part II of plan bid conditions. Employment data of crafts covered by part I of plan bid conditions shall be gathered and identified as such in the composite report, however, OFCCP has reserved the responsibility for compliance determinations on crafts covered by part I of the plan bid conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Contractor notification. Those contractors selected for onsite review shall be sent a notification letter as outlined in Sec. 230.409(c) along with a request for current workforce data \2\ for completion

and submission at the onsite review. Those contractors in the target area not selected for onsite review shall also be requested to supply current workforce data as of the onsite review period, and shall return the data within 15 days following the onsite review period.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\2\ The Consolidated Workforce Questionnaire is convenient for the purpose and appears as attachment 4 to volume 2, chapter 2, section 3 of the Federal-Aid Highway Program Manual, which is available at the offices listed in 49 CFR part 7, appendix D.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Onsite reviews. Compliance reviews shall then be conducted in accordance with the requirements set forth in Sec. 230.409. Reviewers may use Form FHWA-86, Compliance Data Report, if appropriate. It is of particular importance during the onsite reviews that the review team provide for adequate coordination of activities at every stage of the review process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Compliance determinations. Upon completion of the consolidated reviews, compliance determinations shall be made on each review by the reviewer. Individual show cause notices or compliance notifications shall be sent (as appropriate) to each reviewed contractor.
The compliance determination shall be based on the contractor's target area work force (Federal, Federal-aid and non-Federal), except when the target area is coincidental with hometown plan area, compliance determinations must not be based on that part of a contractor's work force covered by part I of the plan bid conditions, as previously set forth in this regulation. For example: ABC Contracting, Inc. employs carpenters, operating engineers, and cement masons. Carpenters and operating engineers are covered by part II of the plan bid conditions, however, cement masons are covered by part I of the plan bid conditions. The compliance determination must be based only on the contractor's utilization of carpenters and operating engineers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Reporting--(1) Composite report. A final composite report shall be submitted as a complete package to the Washington Headquarters, OCR, within 45 days after the review period and shall consist of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Composite report. A final composite report shall be submitted as a complete package to the Washington Headquarters, OCR, within 45 days after the review period and shall consist of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Compliance review report, for each contractor and subcontractor with accompanying show cause notice or compliance notification.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Work force data to show the aggregate employment of all contractors in the target area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A narrative summary of findings and recommendations to include the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A summary of highway construction employment in the target area by craft, race, and sex. This summary should explore possible patterns of discrimination or underutilization and possible causes, and should compare the utilization of minorities and females on contractor's work forces to the civilian labor force percent for minorities and females in the target area.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the target area is a plan area, a narrative summary of the plan's effectiveness with an identification of part I and part II crafts. This summary shall discuss possible differences in minority and female utilization between part I and part II crafts, documenting any inferences drawn from such comparisons.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If applicable, discuss local labor unions' membership and/or referral practices that impact on the utilization of minorities and females in the target area. Complete and current copies of all collective bargaining agreements and copies of EEO-3, Local Union Reports, for all appropriate unions shall accompany the composite report.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Any other appropriate data, analyses, or information deemed necessary for a complete picture of the areawide employment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Considering the information compiled from the summaries listed above, make concrete recommendations on possible avenues for correcting problems uncovered by the analyses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Annual planning report. The proper execution of consolidated compliance reviews necessitates scheduling, along with other fiscal program planning. The Washington Headquarters, OCR, shall be notified of all planned consolidated reviews by August 10 of each year and of any changes in the target area or review periods, as they become known. The annual consolidated planning report shall indicate:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selected target areas:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for selection of each area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The anticipated review period (dates) for each target area.</p><p class="depth4">Sec.

Section 60-1.20(b) of these regulations provides that when equal opportunity deficiencies exist, it is necessary that you make a commitment in writing to correct such deficiencies before you may be found in compliance. The commitment must include the specific action which you propose to take to correct each deficiency and the date of completion of such action. The time period allotted shall be no longer than the minimum period necessary to effect the necessary correction. In accordance with instructions issued by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), U.S. Department of Labor, your written commitment must also provide for the submission of monthly progress reports which shall include a head count of minority and female representation at each level of each trade and a list of minority employees.</p><p class="depth4">You are specifically advised that making the commitment discussed above will not preclude a further determination of noncompliance upon a finding that the commitment is not sufficient to achieve compliance.</p><p class="depth4">We will hold a compliance conference at ----------------(Address) at ---------------- (Time) on ----------------(Date) for you to submit and discuss your written commitment.

Such other sanctions as are authorized by Executive Order 11246, as amended, may also be imposed.</p><p class="depth4">We encourage you to take whatever action is necessary to resolve this matter and are anxious to assist you in achieving compliance.

In addition to this, as a minimum, we will contact the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), League of Latin American Citizens (LULAC), Urban League, and the Employment Security Office within 20 days to establish a referral system for minority group applicants and expand our recruitment base. We are in the process of identifying other community organizations and associations that may be able to provide minority applicants and will

submit an updated listing of recruitment sources and evidence of contact by ----------------(Date).</p><p class="depth4">Deficiency 2: There have been inadequate efforts to locate, qualify, and increase skills of minority and female employees and applicants for employment.</p><p class="depth4">Commitment: We will set up an individual file for each apprentice or trainee by ------------(Date) in order to carefully screen the progress, ensure that they are receiving the necessary training, and being promoted promptly upon completion of training requirements. We have established a goal of at least 50 percent of our apprentices and trainees will be minorities and 15 percent will be female. In addition to the commitment made to deficiency number 1, we will conduct a similar identification of organizations able to supply female applicants. Based on our projected personnel needs, we expect to have reached our 50 percent goal for apprentices and trainees by --------------(Date).</p><p class="depth4">Deficiency 3: Very little effort to assure subcontractors have meaningful minority group representation among their employees.</p><p class="depth4">Commitment: In cooperation with the Regional Office of Minority Business Enterprise, Department of Commerce, and the local NAACP, we have identified seven minority-owned contractors that may be able to work on future contracts we may receive. These contractors (identified in the attached list) will be contacted prior to our bidding on all future contracts. In addition, we have scheduled a meeting with all subcontractors currently working on our contracts. This meeting will be held to inform the subcontractors of our intention to monitor their reports and require meaningful minority representation. This meeting will be held on --------------------(Date) and we will summarize the discussions and current posture of each subcontractor for your review by --------------------(Date) Additionally, as requested, we will submit a PR-1391 on --------------------(Date), ----------------------------------------(Date), --------------------(Date).
