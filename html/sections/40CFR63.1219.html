You must calculate DRE for each POHC from the following equation:
DRE = [1 - (Wout / Win)] x 100%

You must demonstrate this DRE performance on POHCs that are more difficult to incinerate than tetra-, penta-, and hexachlorodibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans. You must use the equation in paragraph (c)(1) of this section to calculate DRE for each POHC.
