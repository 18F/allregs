Funds for immediate services may be provided  directly by the Regional Administrator to the State or local mental  health agency designated by the Governor, prior to and separate from the  regular program application process of crisis counseling assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Major disaster means any natural catastrophe (including any  hurricane, tornado, storm, high water, winddriven water, tidal wave,  tsunami, earthquake, volcanic eruption, landslide, mudslide, snowstorm  or drought), or, regardless of cause, any fire, flood, or explosion, in  any part of the United States, which in the determination of the  President causes damage of sufficient severity and magnitude to warrant  major disaster assistance under this Act to supplement the efforts and  available resources of States, local governments, and disaster relief  organizations in alleviating the damage, loss, hardship, or suffering  caused thereby.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Project Officer means the person assigned by the Secretary,  DHHS, to monitor a crisis counseling program, provide consultation,  technical assistance, and guidance, and be the contact point within the  DHHS for program matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Regional Administrator  means the director of a regional office  of FEMA, or the Disaster Recovery Manager, as the delegate of the  Regional Administrator.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Secretary means the Secretary of DHHS or his/her delegate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> State Coordinating Officer (SCO) means the person appointed by  the   Governor to act in cooperation with the FCO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Agency policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is agency policy to provide crisis  counseling services, when required, to victims of a major disaster for  the purpose of relieving mental health problems caused or aggravated by  a major disaster or its aftermath.

To obtain  assistance under this section, the Governor or his/her authorized  representative must initiate an assessment of the need for crisis  counseling services within 10 days of the date of the major disaster  declaration.
