                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recipients are encouraged to use existing financial management  systems to the extent that the systems comply with Generally Accepted  Accounting Principles (GAAP) and the minimum standards in this section.  At a minimum, a recipient's financial management system must provide:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Effective control of all funds. Control systems must be adequate  to ensure that costs charged to Federal funds and those counted as the  recipient's cost share or match are consistent with requirements for  cost reasonableness, allowability, and allocability in the applicable  cost principles (see Sec. 600.317) and in the terms and conditions of  the award.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Accurate, current and complete records that document, for each  project funded wholly or in part with Federal funds, the source and  application of the Federal funds and the recipient's required cost share  or match. These records must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contain information about receipts, authorizations, assets,  expenditures, program income, and interest.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Be adequate to make comparisons of outlays with amounts  budgeted for each award (as required for programmatic and financial  reporting under Sec. 600.341). Where appropriate, financial information  should be related to performance and unit cost data.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent that advance payments are authorized under  Sec. 600.312, procedures that minimize the time elapsing between the  transfer of funds to the recipient from the Government and the  recipient's disbursement of the funds for program purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A system to support charges to Federal awards for salaries and  wages, whether treated as direct or indirect costs. If employees work on  multiple activities or cost objectives, a distribution of their salaries  and wages must be supported by personnel activity reports which:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reflect an after the fact distribution of the actual activity of  each employee.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Account for the total activity for which each employee is  compensated.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Are prepared at least monthly, and coincide with one or more  pay periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Federal Government guarantees or insures the repayment of  money borrowed by the recipient, DOE, at its discretion, may require  adequate bonding and insurance if the bonding and insurance requirements  of the recipient are not deemed adequate to protect the interest of the  Federal Government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> DOE may require adequate fidelity bond coverage if the recipient  lacks sufficient coverage to protect the Federal Government's interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If bonds are required in the situations described in paragraphs  (b) and (c) of this section, the bonds must be obtained from companies  holding certificates of authority as acceptable sureties, as prescribed  in 31 CFR part 223, ``Surety Companies Doing Business with the United  States.''</p>
