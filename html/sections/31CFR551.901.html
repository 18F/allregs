Executive Order Blocking Property of Certain Persons Contributing to the</p><p class="depth0">Conflict In Somalia</p><p class="depth0">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c) (UNPA), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code,</p><p class="depth0">I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, find that the deterioration of the security situation and the persistence of violence in Somalia, and acts of piracy and armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia, which have repeatedly been the subject of United Nations Security Council resolutions (including Resolution 1844 of November 20, 2008; Resolution 1846 of December 2, 2008; Resolution 1851 of December 16, 2008; and Resolution 1897 of November 30, 2009), and violations of the arms embargo imposed by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 733 of January 23, 1992, and elaborated upon and amended by subsequent resolutions (including Resolution 1356 of June 19, 2001; Resolution 1725 of December 6, 2006; Resolution 1744 of February 20, 2007; Resolution 1772 of August 20, 2007; Resolution 1816 of June 2, 2008; and Resolution 1872 of May 26, 2009), constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States, and I hereby declare a national emergency to deal with that threat.</p><p class="depth0">I hereby order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> All property and interests in property that are in the United States, that hereafter come within the United States, or that are or hereafter come within the possession or control of any United States person, including any overseas branch, of the following persons are blocked and may not be transferred, paid, exported, withdrawn, or otherwise dealt in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the persons listed in the Annex to this order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> any person determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> to have engaged in acts that directly or indirectly threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, including but not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> acts that threaten the Djibouti Agreement of August 18, 2008, or the political process; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> acts that threaten the Transitional Federal Institutions, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), or other international peacekeeping operations related to Somalia;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance to Somalia, or access to, or distribution of, humanitarian assistance in Somalia;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> to have directly or indirectly supplied, sold, or transferred to Somalia, or to have been the recipient in the territory of Somalia of, arms or any related material, or any technical advice, training, or assistance, including financing and financial assistance, related to military activities;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, logistical, or technical support for, or goods or services in support of, the activities described in subsections (a)(ii)(A), (a)(ii)(B), or (a)(ii)(C) of this section or any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> I hereby determine that, among other threats to the peace, security, or stability of Somalia, acts of piracy or armed robbery at sea off the coast of Somalia threaten the peace, security, or stability of Somalia.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> I hereby determine that, to the extent section 203(b)(2) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1702(b)(2)) may apply, the making of donations of the type of articles specified in such section by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to subsection (a) of this section would seriously impair my ability to deal with the national emergency declared in this order, and I hereby prohibit such donations as provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> the making of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services by, to, or for the benefit of any person whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> the receipt of any contribution or provision of funds, goods, or services from any such person.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The prohibitions in subsection (a) of this section apply except to the extent provided by statutes, or in regulations, orders, directives, or licenses that may be issued pursuant to this order, and notwithstanding any contract entered into or any license or permit granted prior to the effective date of this order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any transaction by a United States person or within the United States that evades or avoids, has the purpose of evading or avoiding, causes a violation of, or attempts to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any conspiracy formed to violate any of the prohibitions set forth in this order is prohibited.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 3. For the purposes of this order:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> the term ``person'' means an individual or entity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> the term ``entity'' means a partnership, association, trust, joint venture, corporation, group, subgroup, or other organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> the term ``United States person'' means any United States citizen, permanent resident alien, entity organized under the laws of the United States or any 5 jurisdiction within the United States (including foreign branches), or any person in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> the term ``Transitional Federal Institutions'' means the Transitional Federal Charter of the Somali Republic adopted in February 2004 and the Somali federal institutions established pursuant to such charter, and includes their agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> the term ``African Union Mission in Somalia'' means the mission authorized by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 1744 of February 20, 2007, and reauthorized in subsequent resolutions, and includes its agencies, instrumentalities, and controlled entities.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 4. For those persons whose property and interests in property are blocked pursuant to this order who might have a constitutional presence in the United States, I find that because of the ability to transfer funds or other assets instantaneously, prior notice to such persons of measures to be taken pursuant to this order would render those measures ineffectual. I therefore determine that for these measures to be effective in addressing the national emergency declared in this order, there need be no prior notice of a listing or determination made pursuant to section 1(a) of this order.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 5. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to take such actions, including the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all powers granted to the President by IEEPA and the UNPA, as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this order. The Secretary of the Treasury may redelegate any of these functions to other officers and agencies of the United States Government consistent with applicable law. All 6 agencies of the United States Government are hereby directed to take all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the provisions of this order.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 6. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to submit the recurring and final reports to the Congress on the national emergency declared in this order, consistent with section 401(c) of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1641(c)) and section 204(c) of IEEPA (50 U.S.C. 1703(c)).</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 7. The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, is hereby authorized to determine that circumstances no longer warrant the blocking of the property and interests in property of a person listed in the Annex to this order, and to take necessary action to give effect to that determination.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 8. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. 9. This order is effective at 12:01 a.m. eastern standard time on April 13, 2010.
