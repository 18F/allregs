An employer seeking a labor certification for an occupation listed on Schedule A may apply for that labor certification under Sec. 656.15.</p><p class="depth0">Schedule A</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Group I:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Persons who will be employed as physical therapists, and who possess all the qualifications necessary to take the physical therapist licensing examination in the state in which they propose to practice physical therapy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aliens who will be employed as professional nurses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Who have received a Certificate from the Commission on Graduates of Foreign Nursing Schools (CGFNS);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Who hold a permanent, full and unrestricted license to practice professional nursing in the state of intended employment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Who have passed the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN), administered by the National Council of State Boards of Nursing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definitions of Group I occupations:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Physical therapist means a person who applies the art and science of physical therapy to the treatment of patients with disabilities, disorders and injuries to relieve pain, develop or restore function, and maintain performance, using physical means, such as exercise, massage, heat, water, light, and electricity, as prescribed by a physician (or a surgeon).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Professional nurse means a person who applies the art and science of nursing which reflects comprehension of principles derived from the physical, biological and behavioral sciences. Professional nursing generally includes making clinical judgments involving the observation, care and counsel of persons requiring nursing care; administering of medicines and treatments prescribed by the physician or dentist; and participation in the activities for the promotion of health and prevention of illness in others.
