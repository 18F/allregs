                            <p class="depth0">Class deviations affect more than one contract action. When an  agency knows that it will require a class deviation on a permanent  basis, it should propose a FAR revision, if appropriate. Civilian  agencies, other than NASA, must furnish a copy of each approved class  deviation to the FAR Secretariat.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For civilian agencies except NASA, class deviations may be  authorized by agency heads or their designees, unless 1.405(e) is  applicable.   Delegation of this authority shall not be made below the head of a  contracting activity. Authorization of class deviations by agency  officials is subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An agency official who may authorize a class deviation, before  doing so, shall consult with the chairperson of the Civilian Agency  Acquisition Council (CAA Council), unless that agency official  determines that urgency precludes such consultation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Recommended revisions to the FAR shall be transmitted to the FAR  Secretariat by agency heads or their designees for authorizing class  deviations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For DOD, class deviations shall be controlled, processed, and  approved in accordance with the Defense FAR Supplement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For NASA, class deviations shall be controlled and approved by  the Assistant Administrator for Procurement. Deviations shall be  processed in accordance with agency regulations.
