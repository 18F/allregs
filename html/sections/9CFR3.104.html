                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Marine mammals must be housed in primary enclosures that comply with the minimum space requirements prescribed by this part. These enclosures must be constructed and maintained so that the animals contained within are provided sufficient space, both horizontally and vertically, to be able to make normal postural and social adjustments with adequate freedom of movement, in or out of the water. (An exception to these requirements is provided in Sec. 3.110(b) for isolation or separation for medical treatment and/or medical training.) Enclosures smaller than required by the standards may be temporarily used for nonmedical training, breeding, holding, and transfer purposes. If maintenance in such enclosures for nonmedical training, breeding, or holding is to last longer than 2 weeks, such extension must be justified in writing by the attending veterinarian on a weekly basis. If maintenance in such enclosures for transfer is to last longer than 1 week, such extension must be justified in writing by the attending veterinarian on a weekly basis. Any enclosure that does not meet the minimum space requirement for primary enclosures (including, but not limited to, medical pools or enclosures, holding pools or enclosures, and gated side pools smaller than the minimum space requirements) may not be used for permanent housing purposes. Rotating animals between enclosures that meet the minimum space requirements and enclosures that do not is not an acceptable means of complying with the minimum space requirements for primary enclosures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Cetaceans. Primary enclosures housing cetaceans shall contain a pool of water and may consist entirely of a pool of water. In determining the minimum space required in a pool holding cetaceans, four factors must be satisfied. These are MHD, depth, volume, and surface area. For the purposes of this subpart, cetaceans are divided into Group I cetaceans and Group II cetaceans as shown in Table III in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> The required minimum horizontal dimension (MHD) of a pool for Group I cetaceans shall be 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or two times the average adult length of the longest species of Group I cetacean housed therein (as measured in a parallel or horizontal line, from the tip of its upper jaw, or from the most anterior portion of the head in bulbous headed animals, to the notch in the tail fluke \8\), whichever is greater; except that such MHD measurement may be reduced from the greater number by up to 20 percent if the amount of the reduction is added to the MHD at the 90-degree angle and if the minimum volume and surface area requirements

are met based on an MHD of 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or two times the average adult length of the longest species of Group I cetacean housed therein, whichever is greater.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The required minimum horizontal dimension (MHD) of a pool for Group I cetaceans shall be 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or two times the average adult length of the longest species of Group I cetacean housed therein (as measured in a parallel or horizontal line, from the tip of its upper jaw, or from the most anterior portion of the head in bulbous headed animals, to the notch in the tail fluke \8\), whichever is greater; except that such MHD measurement may be reduced from the greater number by up to 20 percent if the amount of the reduction is added to the MHD at the 90-degree angle and if the minimum volume and surface area requirements

are met based on an MHD of 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or two times the average adult length of the longest species of Group I cetacean housed therein, whichever is greater.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\8\ The body length of a Monodon monoceros (narwhale) is measured from the tip of the upper incisor tooth to the notch in the tail fluke. If the upper incisor is absent or does not extend beyond the front of the head, then it is measured like other cetaceans, from the tip of the upper jaw to the notch in the tail fluke. Immature males should be anticipated to develop the ``tusk'' (usually left incisor tooth) beginning at sexual maturity.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The MHD of a pool for Group II cetaceans shall be 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or four times the average adult length of the longest species of cetacean to be housed therein (as measured in a parallel or horizontal line from the tip of its upper jaw, or from the most anterior portion of the head in bulbous headed animals, to the notch in the tail fluke), whichever is greater; except that such MHD measurement may be reduced from the greater number by up to 20 percent if the amount of the reduction is added to the MHD at the 90-degree angle and if the minimum volume and surface area requirements are met based on an MHD of 7.32 meters (24.0 feet) or four times the average adult length of the longest species of Group II cetacean housed therein, whichever is greater.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In a pool housing a mixture of Group I and Group II cetaceans, the MHD shall be the largest required for any cetacean housed therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Once the required MHD has been satisfied, the pool size may be required to be adjusted to increase the surface area and volume when cetaceans are added. Examples of MHD and volume requirements for Group I cetaceans are shown in Table I, and for Group II cetaceans in Table II.</p><p class="depth0">Table I--Group I Cetaceans \1\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Representative average        Minimum horizontal       Minimum required depth    Volume of water required for</p><p class="depth0">adult lengths              dimension (MHD)      ----------------------------  each additional cetacean in-------------------------------------------------------                                     excess of two</p><p class="depth0">Meters         Feet     -----------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Meters         Feet         Meters         Feet                                 Cubic meters       feet----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">1.68           5.5          7.32           24          1.83          6             8.11          284.95</p><p class="depth0">2.29           7.5          7.32           24          1.83          6            15.07          529.87</p><p class="depth0">2.74           9.0          7.32           24          1.83          6            21.57          763.02</p><p class="depth0">3.05          10.0          7.32           24          1.83          6            26.73          942.00</p><p class="depth0">3.51          11.5          7.32           24          1.83          6            35.40        1,245.79</p><p class="depth0">3.66          12.0          7.32           24          1.83          6            38.49        1,356.48</p><p class="depth0">4.27          14.0          8.53           28          2.13          7            60.97        2,154.04</p><p class="depth0">5.49          18.0         10.97           36          2.74          9           129.65        4,578.12</p><p class="depth0">5.64          18.5         11.28           37          2.82          9.25        140.83        4,970.33</p><p class="depth0">5.79          19.0         11.58           38          2.90          9.50        152.64        5,384.32</p><p class="depth0">6.71          22.0         13.41           44          3.36         11           237.50        8,358.68</p><p class="depth0">6.86          22.5         13.72           45          3.43         11.25        253.42        8,941.64</p><p class="depth0">7.32          24.0         14.63           48          3.66         12           307.89       10,851.84</p><p class="depth0">8.53          28.0         17.07           56          4.27         14           487.78       17,232.32----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\1\ All calculations are rounded off to the nearest hundredth.
