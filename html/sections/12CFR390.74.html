In the event of consent, or if upon the record  developed at the hearing the Board of Directors finds that any of the  grounds specified in the notice issued pursuant to Sec. 390.47 have been  established, the Executive Secretary may serve an order of assessment of  civil money penalty upon the party concerned. The assessment order shall  be effective immediately upon service or upon such other date as may be  specified therein and shall remain effective and enforceable until it is  stayed, modified, terminated, or set aside by the Board of Directors or  by a reviewing court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Civil penalties assessed pursuant to Sec. Sec.  390.30 through 390.75 are payable and to be collected within 60 days  after the issuance of the notice of assessment, unless the Board of  Directors fixes a different time for payment where it determines that  the purpose of the civil money penalty   would be better served thereby; however, if a party has made a timely  request for a hearing to challenge the assessment of the penalty, the  party may not be required to pay such penalty until the Board of  Directors has issued a final order of assessment following the hearing.  In such instances, the penalty shall be paid within 60 days of service  of such order unless the Board of Directors fixes a different time for  payment. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the FDIC may seek to attach the  party's assets or to have a receiver appointed to secure payment of the  potential civil money penalty or other obligation in advance of the  hearing in accordance with section 8(i)(4) of the FDIA (12 U.S.C.  1818(i)(4)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]  [76 FR 47655, Aug. 5, 2011, as amended at 77 FR 75479, Dec. 17, 2012]</p>
