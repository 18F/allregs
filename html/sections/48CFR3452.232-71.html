However, it is the Government's intention to negotiate and award a contract using the incremental funding concepts described in the clause titled ``Limitation of Funds'' in FAR 52.232-22. Under that clause, which will be included in the resultant contract, initial funds will be obligated under the contract to cover an estimated base performance period. Additional funds are intended to be allotted to the contract by contract modification, up to and including the full estimated cost of the entire period of performance. This intent notwithstanding, the Government will not be obligated to reimburse the contractor for costs incurred in excess of the periodic allotments, nor will the contractor be obligated to perform in excess of the amount allotted.</p><p class="depth0">(End of provision)</p>
