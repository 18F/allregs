                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Computation of foreign personal holding company income--(1) In general. Foreign personal holding company income consists of the following categories of income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Foreign personal holding company income consists of the following categories of income:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends, interest, rents, royalties, and annuities as defined in paragraph (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Gain from certain property transactions as defined in paragraph (e) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gain from commodities transactions as defined in paragraph (f) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Foreign currency gain as defined in paragraph (g) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Income equivalent to interest as defined in paragraph (h) of this section.
Paragraph (a)(3) of this section provides rules for determining the use or purpose for which property is held, if a change in use or purpose would affect the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section. Paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section provide rules for determining certain rents and royalties that are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Coordination of overlapping definitions. If a particular portion of income from a transaction in substance falls within more than one of the definitional rules of section 954(c) and this section, its character is determined under the rules of subdivision (i) through (iii) of this paragraph (a)(2).

The character of loss from a transaction must be similarly determined under the rules of this paragraph (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of income equivalent to interest under paragraph (h) of this section and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), or foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction), that portion of income is treated as income equivalent to interest for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of foreign currency gain under paragraph (g) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified business transaction or a qualified hedging transaction) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, or gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales), that portion of income is treated as foreign currency gain for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If a portion of the income from a transaction falls within the definition of gain from a commodities transaction under paragraph (f) of this section (whether or not derived from a qualified hedging transaction or qualified active sales) and the definition of gain from certain property transactions under paragraph (e) of this section, that portion of income is treated as gain from a commodities transaction for purposes of section 954(c) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Changes in the use or purpose with which property is held--(i) In general. Under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, transactions in certain property give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation holds that property for a particular use or purpose. For purposes of this section, in determining the purpose or use for which property is held, the period shortly before disposition is the most significant period. However, if a controlled foreign corporation held property with a purpose that would have caused its disposition to give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this section, and prior to disposition the controlled foreign corporation changed the purpose or use for which it held the property to one that would cause its disposition to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, then the later purpose or use shall be ignored unless it was continuously present for a predominant portion of the period during which the controlled foreign corporation held the property. Under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, a currency hedging transaction may be treated as two or more separate hedging transactions, such that each portion is separately considered in applying this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Under paragraphs (e), (f), and (g) of this section, transactions in certain property give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income if the controlled foreign corporation holds that property for a particular use or purpose. For purposes of this section, in determining the purpose or use for which property is held, the period shortly before disposition is the most significant period. However, if a controlled foreign corporation held property with a purpose that would have caused its disposition to give rise to gain or loss included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this section, and prior to disposition the controlled foreign corporation changed the purpose or use for which it held the property to one that would cause its disposition to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, then the later purpose or use shall be ignored unless it was continuously present for a predominant portion of the period during which the controlled foreign corporation held the property. Under paragraph (g)(4)(iii) of this section, a currency hedging transaction may be treated as two or more separate hedging transactions, such that each portion is separately considered in applying this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Illustrations. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (a)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. At the beginning of taxable year 1, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases a building for investment. During taxable years 1 and 2, CFC derives rents from this building that are included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section. At the beginning of taxable year 3, CFC changes the use of the building by terminating all leases, and using it in an active trade or business. At the beginning of taxable year 4, CFC sells the building at a gain. For purposes of paragraph (e) of this section (gains from the sale or exchange of certain property) the building is considered to be property that gives rise to rents, as described in paragraph (e)(2). Because there was a change of use at the beginning of year 3 that would cause the disposition of the building to give rise to gain or loss excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income, the characterization of the gain derived at the beginning of year 4 is determined according to the property's use during the predominant portion of the period from purchase to date of sale. Therefore, gain from the sale of that building is included in the computation of foreign

personal holding company income under paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For taxable years 1, 2, and 3, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is engaged in the active conduct of a commodity business as a handler of gold, as defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iii), and substantially all of its business is as an active handler of gold, as defined in paragraph (f)(3)(iv). At the beginning of taxable year 1, CFC purchases 1000 ounces of gold for investment. At the beginning of taxable year 3, CFC begins holding that gold in physical form for sale to customers. During taxable year 3, CFC sells the entire 1000 ounces of gold in transactions described in paragraph (f)(3)(ii) at a gain. For purposes of paragraph (f), CFC is considered to hold the gold for investment, and not in its capacity as an active handler of gold. Thus, under paragraph (f)(3)(i), the gold is not considered to be sold in the active trade or business of the CFC as a handler of gold, and gain from the sale is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a regular dealer in unimproved land. The functional currency (as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder) of CFC is country X currency. On day 1 of its current taxable year, CFC enters into an agreement with A to pay $100 for certain real property to be held by CFC for investment. On day 10, under its method of accounting, CFC accrues the value of $100 in country X currency, but payment will not be made until the first day of the next taxable year (day 366). On day 190, CFC determines to hold the property for sale to customers in a transaction that would be a qualified business transaction under paragraph (g)(3) of this section. For purposes of this section, the land is considered to be held for investment, and the foreign currency gain attributable to that transaction is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, is a regular dealer in widgets. The functional currency (as defined in section 985 and the regulations thereunder) of CFC is country X currency. On day 1 of its current taxable year, CFC sells widgets held in inventory to A for delivery on day 60. The sales price is denominated in U.S. dollars, and payment is to be made by A on the same day the widgets are to be delivered to A. The remaining facts and circumstances are such that this sale would meet the definition of a qualified business transaction under paragraph (g)(4), the foreign currency gain from which would be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). On day 1, CFC sells U.S. dollars forward for delivery in 60 days in a transaction that would be a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g)(5). On day 25 the sale of widgets to A is cancelled in a transaction that does not result in CFC realizing any foreign currency gain or loss with respect to the sale of widgets. However, CFC holds the dollar forward contract to maturity. Because the forward contract does not hedge a qualified business transaction during the period shortly before its maturity, it is not to be considered a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g), and any foreign currency gain or loss recognized therefrom is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). However, if CFC identifies the portion of the foreign currency gain or loss derived from the forward contract that is attributable to days 1 through 25, and the portion that is attributable to days 25 through 60, the forward contract may be considered two separate transactions in accordance with the rules provided by paragraph (g)(4)(ii) of this section. Thus, the forward sale may be separately considered a qualified hedging transaction for day 1 through day 25, and the foreign currency gain or loss attributable to day 1 through day 25 may be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, has country X currency as its functional currency under section 985 and the regulations thereunder. On day 1 of the current taxable year, CFC, speculating on exchange rates, sells dollars forward for delivery in 120 days. On day 65, CFC sells widgets held in inventory at a price denominated in dollars to be paid on day 120 in a transaction that is a qualified business transaction. CFC had not made any other dollar sales between day 1 and day 65 and does not anticipate making any other dollar sales during the taxable year. On day 65, CFC accrues the value of $100 in country X currency. On day 120, CFC receives $100 payment for the widgets and recognizes foreign currency loss pursuant to that transaction. On day 120 CFC also delivers dollars in connection with the forward sale, and recognizes foreign currency gain pursuant to the delivery. Under this paragraph (a)(3) the currency transaction is considered to have been entered into for speculation, and any currency gain recognized by CFC on the forward sale of dollars must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (g). However, if CFC identifies the portion of the forward sale, and the foreign currency gain or therefrom, that is attributable to day 1 through day 64, and the portion that is attributable to day 65 through day 120, the forward sale may be considered two separate transactions in accordance with the rules provided by paragraph

(g)(4)(ii) of this section. Thus, the transaction for day 65 through day 120 may be considered a separate transaction that is a qualified hedging transaction, and the foreign currency gain attributable to day 65 through day 120 may be excluded from the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (g) if all the other requirements for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction under paragraph (g) are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of computing foreign personal holding company income under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Interest. The term ``interest'' includes amounts that are treated as ordinary income, original issue discount or interest income (including original issue discount and interest on a tax-exempt obligation) by reason of sections 482, 483, 864(d), 1273, 1274, 1276, 1281, 1286, 1288, 7872 and the regulations thereunder, or as interest or original issue discount income by reason of any other provision of law. For special rules concerning interest exempt from U.S. tax pursuant to section 103, see paragraph (b)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inventory and similar property. The term ``inventory and similar property'' (or ``inventory or similar property'') means property that is stock in trade of the controlled foreign corporation or other property of a kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the controlled corporation if on hand at the close of the taxable year (were the controlled foreign corporation a domestic corporation), or property held by the controlled foreign corporation primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its trade or business. Rights to property held in bona fide hedging transactions that reduce the risk of price changes in the cost of ``inventory and similar property'' are included in the definition of that term if they are an integral part of the system by which a controlled foreign corporation purchases such property, and they are so identified by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedging transaction is entered into.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Regular dealer. The term ``regular dealer'' means a merchant with an established place of business that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Regularly and actively engages as a merchant in purchasing property and selling it to customers in the ordinary course of business with a view to the gains and profits that may be derived therefrom, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Makes a market in derivative financial products of property (such as forward contracts to buy or sell property, option contracts to buy or sell property, interest rate and currency swap contracts or other national principal contracts) by regularly and actively offering to enter into positions in such products to the public in the ordinary course of business.
Purchasing and selling property through a regulated exchange or established off-exchange market (for example, engaging in futures transactions) is not actively engaging as a merchant for purposes of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Dealer property. Property held by a controlled foreign corporation is ``dealer property'' if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The controlled foreign corporation is a regular dealer in property of such kind, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The property is held by the controlled foreign corporation in its capacity as a dealer.
Property which is held by the controlled foreign corporation for investment or speculation is not such property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Debt instrument. The term ``debt instrument'' includes bonds, debentures, notes, certificates, accounts receivable, and other evidences of indebtedness.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Dividends, etc.--(1) In general. Foreign personal holding company includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Foreign personal holding company includes:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Dividends, except certain dividends from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and distributions of previously taxed income under section 959(b) and the regulations thereunder;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest, except export financing interest as defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and certain interest received from related persons as described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rents and royalties, except certain rents and royalties received from related persons as described in (b)(4) of this section and rents and royalties derived in the active conduct of a trade or business as defined in paragraph (b)(5); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Annuities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exclusion of certain export financing--(i) In general. Pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(B), foreign personal holding company income computed under section 954(c)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b) does not include interest that is export financing interest. For purposes of section 954(c)(2)(B) and this section, the term ``export financing interest'' means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder. Pursuant to section 864(d)(5)(A)(iii), it does not include income from related party factoring that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Pursuant to section 954(c)(2)(B), foreign personal holding company income computed under section 954(c)(1)(A) and this paragraph (b) does not include interest that is export financing interest. For purposes of section 954(c)(2)(B) and this section, the term ``export financing interest'' means interest that is derived in the conduct of a banking business and is export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder. Pursuant to section 864(d)(5)(A)(iii), it does not include income from related party factoring that is treated as interest under section 864(d)(1) or interest described in section 864(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct of a banking business. For purposes of this section, export financing interest as defined in section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder is considered derived in the conduct of a banking business if, in connection with the financing from which the interest is derived, the corporation, through its own officers or staff of employees, engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing a loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Illustration. The following example illustrates the application of this provision:</p><p class="depth0">Example. DS, a domestic corporation, manufactures property in the United States. In addition to selling inventory (property described in section 1221(1)), DS occasionally sells depreciable equipment it manufactures for use in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2). Less than 50 percent of the fair market value, determined in accordance with section 904(d)(2)(G) and the regulations thereunder, of each item of inventory or equipment sold by DS is attributable to products imported into the United States. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation related (as defined in section 954(d)) to DS, provides loans for the purchase of property from DS, if the property is purchased exclusively for use of consumption outside the United States.</p><p class="depth0">If, in issuing and servicing loans made with respect to purchases from DS of depreciable equipment used in its trade or business, which is property described in section 1221(2) in the hands of DS, CFC engages in all the activities in which banks customarily engage in issuing and servicing loans, the interest accrued from these loans would be export financing interest meeting the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section, which would not be included in foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c) and paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. However, interest from the loans made with respect to purchases from DS of property which is inventory in the hands of DS cannot be export financing interest because it is treated as income from a trade or service receivable under section 864(d)(6) and the regulations thereunder, and thus is included in foreign personal holding company income under paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section. See Sec. 1.864-8T(d) for rules concerning certain income from trade and service receivables qualifying under the same country exception of section 864(d)(7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exclusion of dividends and interest from related persons--(i) Excluded dividends and interest. Foreign personal holding company income does not include dividends and interest if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Excluded dividends and interest. Foreign personal holding company income does not include dividends and interest if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The payor is a corporation that is a related person as defined in section 954(a)(3),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The payor is created or organized (``incorporated'') under the laws of the same foreign country as the controlled foreign corporation, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A substantial part of the payor's assets are used in a trade or business in the payor's country of incorporation as determined under subdivision (iv) of this paragraph (b)(3).
Except as otherwise provided under this paragraph (b)(3), the principles of section 367(a) and regulations thereunder shall apply in determining whether the payor has a trade or business in its country of incorporation, and whether its assets are used in that trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Interest paid out of adjusted foreign base company income or insurance income. Interest may not be excluded from the foreign personal holding company income of the recipient under this paragraph (b)(3) to the extent that the deduction for the interest is allocated under Sec. 1.954-1T(c) to the payor's adjusted gross foreign base company income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-1T(a)(3)), adjusted gross insurance income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or other categories of income included in the computation of subpart F income under section 952(a), for purposes of computing the payor's net foreign base company income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-

1T(a)(4), net insurance income (as defined in Sec. 1.954-1T(a)(6)), or income described in sections 952(a) (3), (4), and (5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dividends paid out of prior years' earnings. Dividends are excluded from foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (b)(3) only to the extent they are paid out of earnings and profits which were earned or accumulated during a period in which the requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) were satisfied or, to the extent earned or accumulated during a taxable year of the related foreign corporation ending on or before December 31, 1962, during a period in which the payor was a related corporation as to be controlled foreign corporation and the other requirements of subdivision (i) of this paragraph (b)(3) are substantially satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Fifty percent substantial assets test. A substantial part of the assets of the payor will be considered used in a trade or business located in its country of incorporation only if, for each quarter during such taxable year, the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of its assets which are used in the trade or business and are located in such country constitutes over 50 percent of the average value (as of the beginning and end of the quarter) of all the assets of the payor (including assets not used in a trade or business). For such purposes the value of assets shall be determined under subdivision (v) of this paragraph (b)(3), and the location of assets used in a trade or business of the payor shall be determined under subdivisions (vi) through (xi) of this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Value of assets. For purposes of determining whether a substantial part of the assets of the payor are used in a trade or business in its country of incorporation, the value of assets shall be their actual value (not reduced by liabilities), which, in the absence of affirmative evidence to the contrary, shall be deemed to be their adjusted basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Location of tangible property used in a trade or business--(A) In general. Tangible property (other than inventory and similar property) used in a trade or business is considered located in the country in which it is physically located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Tangible property (other than inventory and similar property) used in a trade or business is considered located in the country in which it is physically located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Exception. If tangible personal property used in a trade or business is intended for use in the payor's country of incorporation, but is temporarily located elsewhere, it will be considered located within payor's country of incorporation if the reason for its location elsewhere is for inspection or repair, and it is not currently in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation and is not to be placed in service in a country other than the payor's country of incorporation following the inspection or repair.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Location of intangible property used in a trade or business--(A) In general. The location of intangible property (other than inventory or similar property and debt instruments) used in a trade or business is determined based on the site of the activities conducted by the payor during the current year in connection with using or exploiting that property. An item of intangible property is located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the current taxable year if the activities connected with its use or exploitation are conducted during the entire current taxable year by the payor in its country of incorporation. For this purpose, the determination of the country in which services are performed shall be made under the principles of section 954(e) and Sec. 1.954-4(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The location of intangible property (other than inventory or similar property and debt instruments) used in a trade or business is determined based on the site of the activities conducted by the payor during the current year in connection with using or exploiting that property. An item of intangible property is located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the current taxable year if the activities connected with its use or exploitation are conducted during the entire current taxable year by the payor in its country of incorporation. For this purpose, the determination of the country in which services are performed shall be made under the principles of section 954(e) and Sec. 1.954-4(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Property located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in part in other countries. If the activities connected with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are conducted during the current taxable year by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and in other countries, then a percentage of the intangible (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to the expenses of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of all

such activities worldwide. Expenses incurred in connection with the use or exploitation of an item of intangible property are included in the computation provided by this paragraph (b)(3) if they are deductible under section 162 or includible in inventory costs or the costs of goods sold (were the payor a domestic corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Location of property held for sale to customers--(A) In general. Inventory or similar property is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the taxable year if the activities of the payor in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and release, of such property and conducted in the payor's country of incorporation during the entire taxable year. If the payor conducts such activities through an independent contractor, then the location of such activities shall be the place in which they are conducted by the independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Inventory or similar property is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation during each quarter of the taxable year if the activities of the payor in connection with the production and sale, or purchase and release, of such property and conducted in the payor's country of incorporation during the entire taxable year. If the payor conducts such activities through an independent contractor, then the location of such activities shall be the place in which they are conducted by the independent contractor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Inventory located in part in the payor's country of incorporation and in part in other countries. If the activities connected with the production and sales, or purchase and resale, of inventory or similar property are conducted by the payor in the payor's country of incorporation and other countries, then a percentage of the inventory or similar property (measured by the average value of the item as of the beginning and end of the quarter) is considered located in the payor's country of incorporation each quarter. That percentage equals the ratio that the costs of the payor incurred during the entire taxable year by reason of such activities that are conducted in the payor's country of incorporation bear to all such costs incurred by reason of such activities worldwide. A cost incurred in connection with the production and sale or purchase and resale of inventory or similar property is included in this computation if it--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Must be included in inventory costs or otherwise capitalized with respect to inventory or similar property under section 61, 263A, 471, or 472 and the regulations thereunder (whichever would be applicable were the payor a domestic corporation), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Would be deductible under section 162 (were the payor a domestic corporation) and is definitely related to gross income derived from such property (but not to all classes of gross income derived by the payor) under the principles of Sec. 1.861-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Location of debt instruments. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(3), debt instruments are considered to be used in a trade or business only if they arise from the sale of inventory or similar property by the payor or from the rendition of services by the payor in the ordinary course of a trade or business of the payor, but only until such time as interest is required to be charged under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Debt instruments that arise from the sale of inventory or similar property are treated as having the same location, proportionately, as inventory or similar property that is held during the same calendar quarter.

The dates during which depreciable property is determined to

be in use must be consistent with the determination of depreciation under sections 167 and 168 and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> Treatment of banks and insurance companies.

By the maintenance in country X of office, sales, and service facilities and its complete staff of administrative, sales, and service personnel, Corporation D maintains and operates an organization therein which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing and servicing the motor vehicles which are leased. The deductions incurred by such organization satisfy the 25-percent test of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section; thus, such organization is substantial in relation to the rents Corporation D receives from leasing the motor vehicles.

Controlled foreign corporation A, through its own staff of employees, owns and operates a research facility in foreign country X. At the research facility employees of Corporation A who are full time scientists, engineers, and technicians regularly perform experiments, tests, and other technical activities, which ultimately result in the issuance of patents that it sells or licenses.

Assume that Corporation A in example 1, in addition to receiving royalties for the use of patents which it develops, receives royalties for the use of patents which it acquires by purchase and licenses to others without adding any value thereto.

Corporation A does not, however, maintain and operate an organization in a foreign country which is regularly engaged in the business of marketing the purchased patents.

Controlled foreign corporation B receives royalties for the use of patents which it acquires by purchase. The primary business of Corporation B, operated on a regular basis, consists of licensing patents which it has purchased ``raw'' from inventors and, through the efforts of a substantial staff of employees consisting of scientists, engineers, and technicians, made susceptible to commercial application. For example, Corporation B, after purchasing patent rights covering a chemical process, designs specialized production equipment required for the commercial adaptation of the process and, by so doing, substantially increases the value of the patent.

If losses from the sale or exchange of such property exceed gains, the net loss is not within the definition of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e), and may not be allocated to, or otherwise reduce, other foreign personal holding company income under section 954(b)(5) and Sec. 1.954-1T(c). Gain or loss from a transaction that is treated as capital gain or loss under section 988(a)(1)(B) is not foreign currency gain or loss as defined in paragraph (g), but is gain or loss from the sale or exchange of property which is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1). Paragraphs (e) (4) and (5) of this section provide specific rules for determining whether gain or loss from dispositions of debt instruments and dispositions of options or similar property must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1).

In such cases, the property must be treated as two separate properties for purposes of this paragraph (e). Accordingly, the sale or exchange of such dual character property will give rise to gain or loss that in part must be included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e), and in part is excluded from such computation. Gain or loss from the disposition of dual character property must be bifurcated for purposes of this paragraph (e)(1)(i) pursuant to the method that most reasonably reflects the relative uses of the property. Reasonable methods may include comparisons in terms of gross income generated or the physical division of the property. In the case of real property, the physical division of the property will in most cases be the most reasonable method available. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation owns an office building, uses 60 percent of the building in its business, and rents out the other 40 percent, then 40 percent of the gain recognized on the disposition of the property would reasonably be treated as gain which is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (e)(1).

For purposes of this paragraph (f), a corporation is not engaged in a commodities business as a producer, processor, merchant, or handler of commodities if its business is primarily financial. In general, the business of a controlled foreign corporation is financial if it primarily engages in commodities transactions for investment or speculation, or if it primarily provides products or services to customers for investment or speculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Substantially all.

The term ``qualified business transaction'' means a transaction (other than a ``qualified hedging transaction'' as described in paragraph (g)(4) of this section) that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Does not have investment or speculation as a significant purpose;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Is not attributable to property or an activity of the kind that gives rise to subpart F income (other than foreign currency gain under this paragraph (g)), or could reasonably be expected to give rise to subpart F income (including upon disposition); for example, the transaction may not be attributable to stock or debt of another corporation (including related corporations organized and operating in the same country), or property likely to give rise to foreign base company sales or services income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Is attributable to business transactions described in subdivision (ii) of this paragraph (g)(3).
A qualified business transaction includes the disposition of a debt instrument that constitutes inventory property under paragraph (a)(4)(ii) or dealer property under paragraph (a)(4)(iv) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(3) do not apply to the foreign currency gain or loss of a qualified business unit (as determined under Sec. 1.985-3T(d)(2)) included in the computation of gain or loss under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section. The provisions of this paragraph (g)(3) do, however, apply to other currency transactions of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency under section 985(b)(3) and Sec. 1.985-2T. Qualified business transactions and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss derived therefrom must be clearly identified on its records by the controlled foreign corporation. If the controlled foreign corporation is unable to specifically identify the qualified business transactions and the foreign currency gain or loss derived therefrom, the district director in his sole discretion may determine which transactions of the corporation giving rise to the foreign currency gains or losses are attributable to qualified business transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specific business transactions.

The provisions of this paragraph (g)(4) do apply, however, to other currency transactions of a qualified business unit that elects (or is deemed to elect) the U.S. dollar as its functional currency under section 985(b)(3) and Sec. 1.985-3T. If the controlled foreign corporation does not specifically identify the qualified business transactions (or category of qualified business transactions) to which a hedging transaction relates or is unable to specifically identify the amount of foreign currency gain or loss derived from the hedging transactions, the district director in his sole discretion may make the identifications required of the controlled foreign corporation and determine which hedging transactions (if any) are related to qualified business transactions, and the amount of foreign currency gain or loss attributable to the qualified hedging transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in purpose of hedging transaction. If a hedging transaction is entered into for one purpose, and the purpose for that transaction subsequently changes, the transaction may be treated as two separate hedging transactions for purposes of this paragraph (g)(4). In such a case, the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction is considered a qualified hedging transaction if it separately meets all the other requirements of this paragraph (g)(4) for treatment as a qualified hedging transaction. For purposes of paragraph (g)(4)(i)(C), the foreign corporation must identify on its records the portion of the transaction that relates to a qualified business transaction by the close of the fifth day after the day on which the hedge becomes so related (i.e., either the day on which the hedge is first entered into or on the day on which it first relates to a qualified business transaction due to a change in its purpose).

Income equivalent to interest includes, but is not limited to, income derived from the following categories of transactions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Foreign personal holding company income includes income that is equivalent to interest. Income equivalent to interest includes, but is not limited to, income derived from the following categories of transactions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An investment, or series of integrated transactions which include an investment, in which the payments, net payments, cash flows, or return predominantly reflect the time value of money, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transactions in which the payments or a predominant portion thereof are in substance for the use or forebearance of money, but are not generally treated as interest.
However, amounts treated as interest under section 954(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section are not income equivalent to interest under this paragraph (h). Income from the sale of property will not be treated as income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h), subject to the rule of paragraph (h)(4) of this section, unless the sale is part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to interest or income equivalent to interest. See sections 482, 483 and 1274 for the extent to which such income may be characterized as interest income subject to paragraph (b) of this section. Income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h) includes all income attributable to a transfer of securities subject to section 1058. Income equivalent to interest also includes a portion of certain deferred payments received for the purpose of services, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (h)(5) of this section. Income equivalent to interest does not include income attributable to notional principal contracts such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, interest rate floor agreements, or similar contracts except to the extent that such contracts are part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to income equivalent to interest. Income derived from notional contracts by a person acting in its capacity as a regular dealer in such contracts will be presumed not to be integrated with an investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Illustrations. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, promises that A, an unrelated person, may borrow up to $500 in principal for one year beginning at any time during the next three months at an interest rate of 10 percent. In exchange, A pays CFC a commitment fee of $2.00. Pursuant to this loan commitment, CFC lends $80 to A. As a result, the entire $2.00 fee is included in the computation of foreign personal holding company income under this paragraph (h)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the beginning of its current taxable year, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases at face value a one-year debt instrument issued by A having a $100 principal amount and bearing a floating rate of interest set at the London Interbank Offered Rate (``LIBOR'') plus one percentage point. Contemporaneously, CFC borrows $100 from B for one year at a fixed interest rate of 10 percent, using the debt instrument as security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During its current taxable year, CFC accrues $11 of interest from A on the bond. That interest is foreign personal holding company income under section 954(c)(1) and

Sec. 1.954-2T(b), and thus is not income equivalent to interest. During its current taxable year, CFC incurs $10 of interest expense with respect to the borrowing from B. That expense is allocated and apportioned to, and reduces, foreign base company income or insurance income to the extent provided in sections 954(b)(5), 863(e), and 864(e) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the beginning of its 1988 taxable year, CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, purchases at face value a one-year debt instrument issued by A having a $100 principal amount and bearing a floating rate of interest set at the London Interbank Offered Rate (``LIBOR'') plus one percentage point payable on the last day of CFC's current taxable year. CFC subsequently determines that it would prefer receiving interest at a fixed rate, and, on January 1, 1989, enters into an agreement with B, an unrelated person, whereby B promises to pay CFC on the last day of CFC's 1989 taxable year an amount equal to 10 percent on a notional principal amount of $100. In exchange, CFC promises to pay B on the last day of CFC's 1989 taxable year an amount equal to LIBOR plus one percentage point on the notional principal amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CFC receives a total of $10 from B, and pays $9 to B. CFC also receives $9 from A. The $9 paid to B is directly allocated to, or is otherwise an adjustment to, the $10 received from B. The transactions are considered an intergrated transaction giving rise to $9 of interest income (paid by A) and, under paragraph (h)(1)(i), $1 of income equivalent to interest (paid by B).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that CFC does not hold any debt obligations. Since the transaction with B is not integrated with an investment giving rise to interest or income equivalent to interest, the net $1 of income realized by CFC does not constitute income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC, a controlled foreign corporation, enters into an agreement with A whereby CFC purchases commodity X from A at a price of $100, and A contemporaneously repurchases commodity X from CFC for payment and delivery in 3 months at a price of $104 set by the forward market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The transaction is in substance a loan from CFC to A secured by commodity X. Thus, CFC accrues $4 of gross income which is included in foreign personal holding company income as interest under section 954(c)(1)(A) and paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CFC purchases commodity Y on the spot market for $100 and contemporaneously, sells commodity Y forward for delivery and payment in 3 months at a price of $104 set by the forward market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The $100 paid on the spot purchase of commodity Y offsets any market risk on the forward sale so that the $4 of income to be derived predominantly reflects time value of money. Thus, under paragraph (h)(1)(i), the spot purchase of commodity Y and the offsetting forward sale will be treated as an integrated transaction giving rise to $4 of income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Income equivalent to interest from factoring--(i) General rule.

The rules of this paragraph (h)(3) apply only with respect to the tax treatment of factoring income derived from the acquisition and collection or disposition of a factored receivable and shall not affect the characterization of an expense or loss of either the person whose goods or services gave rise to a factored receivable or the obligor under a receivable.

For purposes of this paragraph (h)(3), it is immaterial whether the person providing the property or services agrees to transfer the receivable at the time of sale (as by accepting a third-party charge or credit card) or at a later time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Illustrations. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (h)(3).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. DP, a domestic corporation, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. FS acquires accounts receivable arising from the sale of property by unrelated corporation X. The receivables have a face amount of $100, and after 30 days bear stated interest equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable short term Federal rate (determined as of the date the receivable is acquired). FS purchases the receivables from X for $95 on Day 1 and collects $100 from the obligor under the receivable on Day 40. Income (other than stated interest) derived by FS from the factored receivables is factoring income within the meaning or paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and, therefore, is income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that FS does not pay X for the receivables until Day 30. Income derived by FS from the factored receivables is not factoring income by reason of paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in example 2, except that it is anticipated that all principal will be paid by the obligor of the receivables by Day 30. Income derived by FS from this ``maturity factoring'' of the receivables is not factoring income by reason of paragraph (h)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, and therefore does not give rise to income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The facts are the same as in example 1, except that, rather than collecting $100 from the obligor under the factored receivable on Day 40, FS sells the receivable to controlled foreign corporation Y on Day 15 for $97. Both the income derived by FS on the factored receivable and the income derived by Y (other than stated interest) on the receivable are factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section, and therefore, constitute income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. The facts are the same as in example 4, except that FS sells the factored receivable to Y for $99 on Day 45, at which time interest is accruing on the unpaid balance of $100. FS has $4 of net factoring income that is income equivalent to interest. Because interest was accruing at the time Y acquired the receivable at a rate equal to at least 120 percent of the applicable short term Federal rate, income derived by Y from the factored receivable is not factoring income by reason of pargraph (h)(3)(ii)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. DP, a domestic corporation engaged in an integrated credit card business, owns all of the outstanding stock of FS, a controlled foreign corporation. On Day 1 individual A uses a credit card issued by DP to purchase shoes priced at $100 from X, a foreign corporation unrelated to DP, FS, or A. By prearrangement with DP, on Day 7, X transfers the receivable arising from A's purchase to FS in exchange for $95. FS collects $100 from A on Day 45. Income derived by FS on the factored receivable is factoring income within the meaning of paragraph (h)(3)(i) of this section and, therefore, is income equivalent to interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determination of sales income. Income equivalent to interest for purposes of this paragraph (h) does not include income from the sale of property unless the sale is part of an integrated transaction that gives rise to interest or income equivalent to interest. Income derived by a controlled foreign corporation will be treated as arising from the sale of property only if the corporation in substance carries out sales activities. Accordingly, an arrangement that is designed to lend the form of a sales transaction to a transaction that in substance constitutes and advance of funds will be disregarded. For example, if a controlled foreign corporation acquires property on 30-day payment terms from one person and sells that property to another person on 90 day payment terms and at prearranged prices and terms such that

the foreign corporation bears no substantial economic risk with respect to the purchase and sale other than the risk of non-payment, the foreign corporation has not in substance derived income from the sale of property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Receivables arising from performance of services. If payment for services performed by a controlled foreign corporation is not made until more than 120 days after the date on which such services are performed, then the income derived by the foreign corporation constitutes income equivalent to interest to the extent that interest income would be imputed under the principles of section 483 or the original issue discount provisions (section 1271 et seq.), if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Such provisions applied to contracts for the performance of services,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The time period referred to in sections 483(c)(1) and 1274(c)(1)(B) were 120 days rather than six months, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The time period referred to in section 483(c)(1)(A) were 120 days rather than one year.
