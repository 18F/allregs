In the  case of a trust subject to the tax imposed by section 511(b)(1), the  fiduciaries for such trust are subject to the same provisions, including  penalties, as are applicable to fiduciaries in the case of the income  tax of other trusts. See section 6151, et seq., and the regulations  prescribed thereunder, for provisions relating to payment of tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Returns. For requirements of filing annual returns with respect  to unrelated business taxable income by organizations subject to the tax  on such income, see section 6012, paragraph (e) of Sec. 1.6012-2, and  paragraph (a)(5) of Sec. 1.6012-3.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Taxable years, method of accounting, etc. The taxable year  (fiscal year or calendar year, as the case may be) of an organization  shall be determined without regard to the fact that such organization  may have been exempt from tax during any prior period. See sections 441  and 446, and the regulations thereunder in this part, and section 7701  and the regulations in part 301 of this chapter (Regulations on  Procedure and Administration). Similarly, in computing unrelated  business taxable income, the determination of the taxable year for which  an item of income or expense is taken into account shall be made under  the provisions of sections 441, 446, 451, and 461, and the regulations  thereunder, whether or not the item arose during a taxable year  beginning before, on, or after the effective date of the provisions  imposing a tax upon unrelated business taxable income. If a method for  treating bad debts was selected in a return of income (other than an  information return) for a previous taxable year, the taxpayer must  follow such method in its returns under section 511, unless such method  is changed in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.166-1. A taxpayer  which has not previously selected a method for treating bad debts may,  in its first return under section 511, exercise the option granted in  Sec. 1.166-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Foreign tax credit.
