                            <p class="depth0">When no law specifically requiring or prohibiting disclosure applies  to a question of whether to disclose information, we follow FOIA  principles to resolve that question. We do this to insure uniform  treatment in all situations. The FOIA principle which most often applies  to SSA disclosure questions is whether the disclosure would result in a  ``clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.'' To decide whether  a disclosure would be a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy  we consider--</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The sensitivity of the information (e.g., whether individuals  would suffer harm or embarrassment as a result of the disclosure);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The public interest in the disclosure;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The rights and expectations of individuals to have their  personal information kept confidential;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The public's interest in maintaining general standards of  confidentiality of personal information; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The existence of safeguards against unauthorized redisclosure or  use.</p>
