                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Certain statutes are expressly made applicable to activities assisted under the Act by the Act itself, while other laws not referred to in the Act may be applicable to such activities by their own terms. Certain statutes or executive orders that may be applicable to activities assisted under the Act by their own terms are administered or enforced by governmental officials, departments or agencies other than HUD. Paragraphs (d) and (c) of this section contain two of the requirements expressly made applicable to CDBG activities by the Act itself.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Affirmatively furthering fair housing. The Act requires the state to certify to the satisfaction of HUD that it will affirmatively further fair housing. The act also requires each unit of general local government to certify that it will affirmatively further fair housing. The certification that the State will affirmatively further fair housing shall specifically require the State to assume the responsibility of fair housing planning by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conducting an analysis to identify impediments to fair housing choice within the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taking appropriate actions to overcome the effects of any impediments identified through that analysis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintaining records reflecting the analysis and actions in this regard; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Assuring that units of local government funded by the State comply with their certifications to affirmatively further fair housing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. States shall devise, adopt and carry out procedures with respect to CDBG assistance that fulfill the objectives and requirements of the Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act (42 U.S.C. 4821-4846), the Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 (42 U.S.C. 4851-4856), and implementing regulations at part 35, subparts A, B, J, K, and R of this title.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> States shall comply with section 3 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 (12 U.S.C. 1701u) and the implementing regulations in 24 CFR part 135. Section 3 requires that employment and other economic opportunities arising in connection with housing rehabilitation, housing construction, or other public construction projects shall, to the greatest extent feasible, and consistent with existing Federal, State, and local laws and regulations, be given to low- and very low-income persons.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Architectural Barriers Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4151-4157) requires certain Federal and Federally-funded buildings and other facilities to be designed, constructed, or altered in accordance with standards that ensure accessibility to, and use by, physically handicapped people. A building or facility designed, constructed, or altered with funds allocated or reallocated under this subpart after November 21, 1996 and that meets the definition of residential structure as defined in 24 CFR 40.2, or the definition of building as defined in 41 CFR 101-19.602(a), is subject to the requirements of the Architectural Barriers Act of 1968 and shall comply with the Uniform Federal Accessibility Standards.
