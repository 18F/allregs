A statistically valid sampling technique at a 90-percent or

greater statistical confidence level shall be used as approved by the regulatory authority in consultation with the U.S. Soil Conservation Service.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measurement period for determining average annual crop production (yield) shall be a minimum of 3 crop years prior to release of the operator's performance bond.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The level of management applied during the measurement period shall be the same as the level of management used on nonmined prime farmland in the surrounding area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Restoration of soil productivity shall be considered achieved when the average yield during the measurement period equals or exceeds the average yield of the reference crop established for the same period for nonmined soils of the same or similar texture or slope phase of the soil series in the surrounding area under equivalent management practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The reference crop on which restoration of soil productivity is proven shall be selected from the crops most commonly produced on the surrounding prime farmland.
