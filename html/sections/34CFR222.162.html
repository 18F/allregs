revenues per pupil measured?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Percentage disparity limitation. The Secretary considers that a State aid program equalizes expenditures if the disparity in the amount of current expenditures or revenues per pupil for free public education among LEAs in the State is no more than 25 percent. In determining the disparity percentage, the Secretary disregards LEAs with per pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th or below the 5th percentile of those expenditures or revenues in the State. The method for calculating the percentage of disparity in a State is in the appendix to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Weighted average disparity for different grade level groups. If a State requests it, the Secretary will make separate disparity computations for different groups of LEAs in the State that have similar grade levels of instruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Weighted average disparity for different grade level groups. If a State requests it, the Secretary will make separate disparity computations for different groups of LEAs in the State that have similar grade levels of instruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those cases, the weighted average disparity for all groups, based on the proportionate number of pupils in each group, may not be more than the percentage provided in paragraph (a) of this section. The method for calculating the weighted average disparity percentage is set out in the appendix to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Per pupil figure computations. In calculating the current expenditures or revenue disparities under this section, computations of per pupil figures are made on one of the following bases:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The per pupil amount of current expenditures or revenue for an LEA is computed on the basis of the total number of pupils receiving free public education in the schools of the agency. The total number of pupils is determined in accordance with whatever standard measurement of pupil count is used in the State.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a State aid program uses ``weighted pupil,'' ``classroom,'' ``instructional unit,'' or another designated measure of need in determining allocations of State aid to take account of special cost differentials, the computation of per pupil revenue or current expenditures may be made on those bases. The two allowable categories of special cost differentials are--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Those associated with pupils having special educational needs, such as children with disabilities, economically disadvantaged children, non-English speaking children, and gifted and talented children; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Those associated with particular types of LEAs such as those affected by geographical isolation, sparsity or density of population, high cost of living, or special socioeconomic characteristics within the area served by an LEA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Revenues and current expenditures included in determinations. All revenues or current expenditures must be included for each LEA in the State in determining the percentage of disparity under paragraph (a) of this section.
