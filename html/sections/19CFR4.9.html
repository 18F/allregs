                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Section 4.3 provides which vessels are subject to formal entry and where and when entry must be made. The formal entry of an American vessel is governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). The term ``American vessel'' means a vessel of the United States (see Sec. 4.0(b)) as well as, when arriving by sea, a vessel entitled to be documented except for its size (see Sec. 4.0(c)). The formal entry of a foreign vessel arriving within the limits of any CBP port is also governed by section 434, Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1434). Alternatively, information necessary for formal entry may be transmitted electronically pursuant to a system authorized by CBP.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures for American vessels. Under certain circumstances, American vessels arriving in ports of the United States directly from other United States ports must make entry. Entry of such vessels is required when they have unentered foreign merchandise aboard. Report of arrival as provided in Sec. 4.2 of this part, together with presenting a completed CBP Form 1300

(Vessel Entrance or Clearance Statement), satisfies all entry requirements for the subject vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Delivery of foreign vessel document. The master of any foreign vessel will exhibit the vessel's document to the port director on or before the entry of the vessel. After the net tonnage has been noted, the document may be delivered to the consul of the nation to which such vessel belongs, in which event the vessel master will certify to the port director the fact of such delivery (see section 434, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1434), as applied through section 438, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1438)). If not delivered to the consul, the document will be deposited in the customhouse. Whether delivered to the foreign consul or deposited at the customhouse, the document will not be delivered to the master of the foreign vessel until clearance is granted under Sec. 4.61. It will not be lawful for any foreign consul to deliver to the master of any foreign vessel the register, or document in lieu thereof, deposited with him in accordance with the provisions of 19 U.S.C. 1434 until such master will produce to him a clearance in due form from the director of the port where such vessel has been entered. Any consul violating the provisions of this section is liable to a fine of not more than $5,000 (section 438, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended; 19 U.S.C. 1438).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Failure to make required entry; penalties. Any master who fails to make entry as required by this section or who presents or transmits electronically any document required by this section that is forged, altered, or false, may be liable for certain civil penalties as provided under 19 U.S.C. 1436, in addition to penalties applicable under other provisions of law. Further, any vessel used in connection with any such violation is subject to seizure and forfeiture.
