                            <p class="depth0">If a pleading (including a complaint, counterclaim, crossclaim, or  third-party complaint filed pursuant to Sec. 502.62) to which a  responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party  cannot reasonably prepare a response, the party may move for a more  definite statement before filing a responsive pleading. The motion must  be filed within 15 days of the pleading and must point out the defects  complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted and the  order of the presiding officer is not obeyed within 10 days after  service of the order or within such time as the presiding officer sets,  the presiding officer may strike the pleading to which the motion was  directed or issue any other appropriate order. If the motion is denied,  the time for responding to the pleading must be extended to a date 10  days after service of the notice of denial. [Rule 67.]</p>
