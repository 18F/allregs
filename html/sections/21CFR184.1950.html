No. 50-14-6), also known as ergocalciferol, is the chemical 9,10-seco(5Z,7E,22E)-5,7,10(19),22-ergostatetraen-3-ol. The ingredient is produced by ultraviolet irradiation of ergosterol isolated from yeast and related fungi and is purified by crystallization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Crystalline vitamin D3 (C27H44O, CAS Reg. No. 67-97-0), also known as cholecalciferol, is the chemical 9,10-seco(5Z,7E,)-5,7,10(19)-cholestatrien-3-ol. Vitamin D3 occurs in, and is isolated from, fish liver oils. It is also manufactured by ultraviolet irradiation of 7-dehydrocholesterol produced from cholesterol. It is purified by crystallization. Vitamin D3 is the vitamin D form that is produced endogenously in humans through sunlight activation of 7-dehydrocholesterol in the skin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vitamin D2 resin and vitamin D3 resin are the concentrated forms of irradiated ergosterol (D2) and irradiated 7-dehydrocholesterol (D3) that are separated from the reacting materials in paragraphs (a) (1) and (2) of this section.
