                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application for authority. Any financial institution qualified  as a paying agent of savings bonds and notes under the provisions of  Department of the Treasury Circular No. 750, current revision, may  establish its eligibility   to employ the special endorsement procedure by executing and submitting  the appropriate application-agreement form to the designated Federal  Reserve Bank. In executing the form, the agent certifies that, by duly  executed resolution of its governing board or committee, it has been  authorized to apply for the privilege of paying and processing  securities in accordance with the provisions and conditions of this part  (Circular No. 888, including all supplements, amendments, and revisions,  and any related instructions). If the application is approved, the  designated Federal Reserve Bank will issue a certificate of  qualification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agents previously qualified. Paying agents qualified under  previous revisions of this part are authorized to continue to act  without requalification. They shall, however, be subject to the terms  and conditions of the previously executed application and these  regulations in the same manner and to the same extent as though they had  requalified hereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of qualification. The Secretary of the Treasury  reserves the right to withdraw the special endorsement authority from  any paying agent at any time. Such authority will also be terminated at  any time at the request of the paying agent. In either event, formal  notice of the termination shall be given to the agent in writing by the  designated Federal Reserve Bank.
