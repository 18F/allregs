                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of Debt Collection Standards. The provisions of 31  CFR parts 285, 900-904, as amended by the Secretary of the Treasury and  the Attorney General, are applicable to debts and debt procedures within  the jurisdiction of the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Authority. The Chief Financial Officer of the Department of  Homeland Security is delegated authority to administer this subpart and  to redelegate authority under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application to DHS. This subpart provides procedures for the  collection of DHS debts, and for collection of other debts owed to the  United States when a request for offset of a DHS payment is received by  the DHS from another federal agency. This subpart applies to all of DHS,  including all of its components. It applies to the DHS when collecting a  DHS debt, to persons who owe DHS debts, and to Federal agencies  requesting offset of a payment issued by the DHS as a payment agency  (including salary payments to DHS employees).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exclusions. This subpart does not apply to debt arising from  taxation under the Internal Revenue Act of 1986, as amended, or to any  debt excepted from the FCCS, 31 CFR parts 900 through 904.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-exclusive procedure or remedy. Nothing in this subpart  precludes collection or disposition of any debt under statutes and  regulations other than those described in this subpart. To the extent  that the provisions of laws or other regulations apply, including the  remission or mitigation of fines, penalties, forfeitures and debts  arising under the tariff laws of the United States, DHS components are  authorized to collect debts under those laws and regulations. DHS  components and other Federal agencies may simultaneously use multiple  collection remedies to collect a debt, except as prohibited by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Additional policies and procedures. DHS components may, but are  not required to, promulgate additional policies and procedures  consistent with this subpart and other applicable Federal law, policies,  and procedures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Duplication not required. Nothing in this subpart requires DHS  to duplicate notices or administrative proceedings required by contract,  this subpart, or other laws or regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> No private rights created. This subpart does not create any  right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in  equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers,  or any other person, nor shall the failure of any DHS component to  comply with any of the provisions of this subpart or 31 CFR parts 285,  900-904 be a defense to the collection of any debt or enforcement of any  other law.</p>
