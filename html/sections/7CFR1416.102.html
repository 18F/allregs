This synthesis of indices is reported by the National Drought Mitigation Center at http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu. Should an eligible area not be covered by the U.S. Drought Monitor, the Deputy Administrator, in consultation with appropriate weather-related agencies and experts, will establish procedures for rating drought intensity using the same range of categories as the U.S. Drought Monitor and use this information in place of the missing data for eligibility purposes.</p><p class="depth2">Verifiable record means a document provided by the producer that can be verified by the County Committee (COC) through an independent source and is used to substantiate the claimed loss.
