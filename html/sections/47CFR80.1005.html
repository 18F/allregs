                            <p class="depth0">The bridge-to-bridge radiotelephone station will be inspected on  vessels subject to regular inspections pursuant to the requirements of  Parts II and III of Title II of the Communications Act, the Safety  Convention or the Great Lakes Agreement at the time of the regular  inspection. If after such inspection, the Commission determines that the  Bridge-to-Bridge Act, the rules of the Commission and the station  license are met, an endorsement will be made on the appropriate  document. The validity of the endorsement will run concurrently with the  period of the regular inspection. Each vessel must carry a certificate  with a valid endorsement while subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act. All  other bridge-to-bridge stations will be inspected from time to time. An  inspection of the bridge-to-bridge station on a Great Lakes Agreement  vessel must normally be made at the same   time as the Great Lakes Agreement inspection is conducted by a  technician holding one of the following: a General Radiotelephone  Operator License, a GMDSS Radio Maintainer's License, a Radiotelegraph  Operator License, a Second Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate,  or a First Class Radiotelegraph Operator's Certificate. Additionally,  the technician must not be the owner, operator, master, or an employee  of any of them. Ships subject to the Bridge-to-Bridge Act may, in lieu  of an endorsed certificate, certify compliance in the station log  required by Sec. 80.409(f).  [78 FR 23157, Apr. 18, 2013]</p>
