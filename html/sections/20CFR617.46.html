meals) payable under Sec. 617.45(a)(1) shall be 90 percent of the total costs of each of the following allowable transportation and subsistence items:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transportation. The more cost effective mode of transportation reasonably available shall be approved by using:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual cost of transportation for the individual and family, if any, by the most economical public transportation the individual and family reasonably can be expected to take from the individual's old residence to the individual's new residence in the area of relocation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost per mile at the prevailing mileage rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations (see 41 CFR part 101-7) for the usually traveled route from the individual's old residence to the individual's new residence in the area of relocation. No additional mileage shall be payable for family members traveling on the same trip in the same vehicle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Lodging and meals. The cost allowable for lodging and meals for an individual or each member of the individual's family shall not exceed the lesser of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The actual cost to the individual for lodging and meals while in travel status; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 50 percent of the prevailing per diem allowance rate authorized under the Federal travel regulations (see 41 CFR part 101-7) for the locality to which the relocation is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Separate travel. If, for good cause, a member or members of an individual's family must travel separately to the individual's new residence, 90 percent of the total costs of such separate travel, computed in accordance with paragraph (a) of this section, shall be included in calculating the total amount the individual is entitled to be paid under this subpart E. For purposes of this paragraph (b), good cause means such reasons as would justify the family member's inability to relocate with the other members of the individual's family, including but not limited to reasons related to the family member's health, schooling or economic circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation. In no case may the individual be paid a travel allowance for the individual or a member of the individual's family more than once in connection with a single relocation.
