The term  ``organizational conflict of interest'' means that because of other  activities or relationships with other persons, a person is unable to  render impartial assistance or advice to the Government, or the person's  objectivity in performing the contract work is or might be otherwise  impaired, or the person has an unfair competitive advantage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The offeror shall provide a statement with its offer which  describes, in a concise manner, all relevant facts concerning any past,  present, or currently planned interest (financial, contractual,  organizational, or otherwise) or actual or potential organizational  conflicts of interest relating to the services to be provided under this  solicitation. The offeror shall also provide statements with its offer  containing the same information for any consultants and subcontractors  identified in its proposal and which will provide services under the  solicitation. The offeror may also provide relevant facts that show how  its organizational and/or management system or other actions would avoid  or mitigate any actual or potential organizational conflicts of  interest.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Based on this information and any other information solicited or  obtained by the contracting officer, the contracting officer may  determine that an organizational conflict of interest exists which would  warrant disqualifying the contractor for award of the contract unless  the organizational conflict of interest can be mitigated to the  contracting officer's satisfaction by negotiating terms and conditions  of the contract to that effect. If the conflict of interest cannot be  mitigated and if the contracting officer finds that it is in the best  interest of the United States to award the contract, the contracting  officer shall request a waiver in accordance with FAR 9.503 and 48 CFR  809.503.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Nondisclosure or misrepresentation of actual or potential  organizational conflicts of interest at the time of the offer, or  arising as a result of a modification to the contract, may result in the  termination of the contract at no expense to the Government.</p><p class="depth2">(End of provision)</p>
