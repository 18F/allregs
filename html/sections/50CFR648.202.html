Vessels fishing for Atlantic  herring may not use, deploy, or fish with midwater trawl gear in Area 1A  from June 1 September 30 of each fishing year. A limited access herring  vessel with midwater trawl gear on board may transit Area 1A from June  1-September 30, provided such midwater trawl gear is stowed and not  available for immediate use as defined in Sec. 648.2. Vessels may use  any authorized gear type to harvest herring in Area 1A from October 1 -  May 31.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fishing in Northeast Multispecies Closed Areas. (1) No vessel  issued an Atlantic herring permit and fishing with midwater trawl gear,  may fish for, possess or land fish in or from the Closed Areas,  including Closed Area I, Closed Area II, Nantucket Lightship Closed  Area, Cashes Ledge Closure Area, Western GOM Closure Area, as defined in  Sec. 648.81(a) through (e), respectively, unless it has declared first  its intent to fish in the Closed Areas as required by Sec. 648.11(m)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>,  and is carrying onboard a NMFS-approved observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No vessel issued an Atlantic herring permit and fishing with  midwater trawl gear, when fishing any part of a midwater trawl tow in  the Closed Areas, may release fish from the codend of the net, transfer  fish to another vessel that is not carrying a NMFS-approved observer, or  otherwise discard fish at sea, unless the fish has first been brought  aboard the vessel and made available for sampling and inspection by the  observer, except in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The vessel operator has determined, and the preponderance of  available evidence indicates that, there is a compelling safety reason;  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A mechanical failure precludes bringing some or all of the  catch on board the vessel for inspection; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The vessel operator determines that pumping becomes impossible  as a result of spiny dogfish clogging the pump intake. The vessel  operator shall take reasonable measures, such as strapping and splitting  the net, to remove all fish which can be pumped from the net prior to  release.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Vessels may make test tows without pumping catch on board if the  net is re-set without releasing its contents provided that all catch  from test tows is available to the observer to sample when the next tow  is brought on board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If fish are released prior to being brought aboard the vessel  due to any of the above exceptions, the vessel operator must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Stop fishing and immediately exit the Closed Areas. Once the  vessel has exited the Closed Areas, it may continue to fish, but may not  fish inside the Closed Areas for the remainder of that trip.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complete and sign a Released Catch Affidavit detailing the  vessel name and permit number; the VTR serial number; where, when, and  for what reason the catch was released; the estimated weight of each  species brought on board or released on that tow. A completed affidavit  must be submitted to NMFS within 48 hr of the end of the trip.  [72 FR 11277, Mar. 12, 2007, as amended at 79 FR 8816, Feb. 13, 2014; 79  FR 52580, Sept. 4, 2014]</p>
