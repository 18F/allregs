Exceptions are only granted upon the approval of an application made under Public Law 97-458. See 25 CFR 1.2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tribal per capita funds: access to these funds will be determined by tribal resolution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other trust funds: You may be able to have supervised access to some or all of your funds, but the BIA must approve all requests for withdrawals from your account. You must work with the BIA to develop a distribution

plan to access the funds in your account. In no instance will the BIA allow an emancipated minor to make unsupervised withdrawals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For funds from other federal agencies (e.g., SSA, SSI, VA), you may be able to receive funds directly, but you must contact and make arrangements with the other federal agency. Direct receipt of funds from another federal agency will not change the supervised status of an emancipated minor's trust account.</p>
