                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General information on preparation and issue of DD Form 1805.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The U.S. Magistrate system is based on use of a four-ply ticket  designed to provide legal notice to violators and records required by  the court, law enforcement authorities, and, if appropriate, the state  motor vehicle departments. The DD Form 1805 is printed on chemically   carbonized paper and prenumbered in series for accounting control. Heads  of DLA primary level field activities are responsible for maintaining  accountability for each ticket issued and stocks on hand.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DLA field activity Counsels will coordinate with the U.S.  Magistrate of the judicial district in which the activity is located and  maintain the information listed below:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> List of petty offenses for which mail-in procedure is authorized  and the amount of the fine for each specific offense. The District Court  address will be prestamped on the violator's copy of the DD Form 1805 by  the applicable issuing authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> List of minor offenses requiring mandatory appearance of the  violator before the magistrate. The name and location of the magistrate  before whom violators will appear. Schedule will be coordinated with  nearest Military Service activity and appearance will be conducted  jointly whenever possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Issue procedures for DD Form 1805. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Information entered on  the DD Form 1805 is dependent upon two considerations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The type of violation, i.e., parking, (such as blocking a fire  lane) moving traffic violation, or nontraffic offenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether the offense cited requires the mandatory appearance of  the violator before a U.S. Magistrate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Preparation and disposition of DD Form 1805:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> See illustration in appendix B for petty offenses where the  mail-in fine procedures are authorized.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of the fine for a specific offense must be recorded  in the lower right corner of the DD Form 1805. This amount will always  be predetermined by the U.S. Magistrate and provided to on duty  enforcement personnel by the activity security officer or equivalent  authority. When violation notices are issued for an offense (e.g.,  parking violation) and the offender is absent, all entries concerning  the violator will be left blank.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator or  placed on the vehicle of the violator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink  copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security  Officer will forward copies one and two, by letter of transmittal, to  the appropriate U.S. District Court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Copy three will be filed at the Security Office or equivalent  issuing authority. DLA Form 1454, Vehicle Registration/Driver Record,  will be annotated with each traffic offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mail-in type  violations, the appropriate supervisor will be provided an information  copy of DLA Form 635, Security/Criminal Incident Report, denoting the  date, time, place, and type of violation, and the amount of fine  assessed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Heads of DLA primary level field activities or their  representative will not accept or otherwise collect any fines or keep  records of fines paid or not paid. They also will take no action  concerning nonpayment delinquencies except where warrants are  subsequently issued for the violator concerned by the appropriate court  authorities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> See illustrations in appendices C and D for minor offenses  requiring the mandatory appearance of violators before the U.S.  Magistrate:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Mail-in fine procedures will not apply in mandatory appearance  cases. The law enforcement authority issuing a violation notice for an  offense requiring mandatory appearance of the violator, will place a  check mark in ``Box A'', DD Form 1805. The name and location of the U.S.  Magistrate before whom the violator must appear will be inserted on the  line below ``United States District Court'' as shown in appendix C. The  date and time of the initial appearance will be entered in the space  provided in ``Box A''. It is the violator's responsibility to verify the  date, time, and place of required court appearances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Disposition of DD Form 1805 will be as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The fourth copy (envelope) will be issued to the violator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Copies one (white copy), two (yellow copy), and three (pink  copy) will be returned to the Security Officer's office. The Security  Officer will forward   copies one and two, by transmittal as soon as possible, to the  magistrate before whom the violator is scheduled to appear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Copy three will be filed in the office of the Security Officer  or equivalent issuing authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When DD Form 1805 is used to cite personnel for mandatory  appearance type offenses, the individual's supervisor will be provided  an information copy of DLA Form 635, denoting the date, time, place, and  type of violation, and the date the violator is scheduled to appear  before the U.S. Magistrate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Additional information governing preparation of DD Form 1805 is  provided as appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 1290--Preparation Guide for DD Form 1805,</p><p class="depth0">Violation Notice</p><p class="depth0">All violations will require:</p><p class="depth0">Last four digits of the Social Security Number of the Issuing guard/ police officer (placed in space marked ``Officer No.'').
