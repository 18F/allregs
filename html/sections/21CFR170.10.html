                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The inclusion of food ingredients in parts 170 through 189 of  this chapter does not imply that these ingredients may be used in  standardized foods unless they are recognized as optional ingredients in  applicable food standards. Where a petition is received for the issuance  or amendment of a regulation establishing a definition and standard of  identity for a food under section 401 of the Act, which proposes the  inclusion of a food additive in such definition and standard of  identity, the provisions of the regulations in this part shall apply  with respect to the information that must be submitted with respect to  the food additive. Since section 409(b)(5) of the Act requires that the  Secretary publish notice of a petition for the establishment of a food- additive regulation within 30 days after filing, notice of a petition  relating to a definition and standard of identity shall also be  published within that time limitation if it includes a request, so  designated, for the establishment of a regulation pertaining to a food  additive.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a petition for a definition and standard of identity contains  a proposal for a food-additive regulation,   and the petitioner fails to designate it as such, the Commissioner, upon  determining that the petition includes a proposal for a food-additive  regulation, shall so notify the petitioner and shall thereafter proceed  in accordance with the regulations in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A regulation will not be issued allowing the use of a food  additive in a food for which a definition and standard of identity is  established, unless its issuance is in conformity with section 401 of  the Act or with the terms of a temporary permit issued under Sec. 130.17  of this chapter. When the contemplated use of such additive complies  with the terms of a temporary permit, the food additive regulation will  be conditioned on such compliance and will expire with the expiration of  the temporary permit.</p>
