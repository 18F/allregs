                                Sec.  304-2.1  What definitions apply to this chapter?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The following definitions apply to this chapter:</p><p class="depth0">Employee means an appointed officer or employee of an executive  agency as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105, including a special Government  employee as defined in 18 U.S.C. 202, or an expert or consultant  appointed under the authority of 5 U.S.C. 3109.</p><p class="depth0">Meeting(s) or similar functions (meeting) means a conference,  seminar, speaking engagement, symposium, training course, or similar  event that takes place away from the employee's official station.  ``Meeting'' as defined in this chapter does not include a meeting or  other event required to carry out an agency's statutory or regulatory  functions (i.e., a function that is essential to an agency's mission)  such as investigations, inspections, audits, site visits, negotiations  or litigation. ``Meeting'' also does not include promotional vendor  training or other meetings held for the primary purpose of marketing the  non-Federal sources products or services, or long term TDY or training  travel. A meeting need not be widely attended for purposes of this  definition and includes but is not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> An event where the employee will participate as a speaker or  panel participant focusing on his/her official duties or on the  policies, programs or operations of the agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> A conference, convention, seminar, symposium or similar event  where the primary purpose is to receive training other than promotional  vendor training, or to present or exchange substantive information of  mutual interest to a number of parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> An event where the employee will receive an award or honorary  degree, which is in recognition of meritorious public service that is  related to the employee's official duties, and which may be accepted by  the employee consistent with the applicable standards of conduct  regulations.</p><p class="depth2">Non-Federal source means any person or entity other than the  Government of the United States. The term includes any individual,  private or commercial entity, nonprofit organization or association,  international or multinational organization (irrespective of whether an  agency holds membership in the organization or association), or foreign,  State or local government (including the government of the District of  Columbia).</p><p class="depth2">Payment means a monetary payment from a non-Federal source to a  Federal agency for travel, subsistence, related expenses by check or  other monetary   instrument payable to the Federal agency (i.e., electronic fund transfer  (EFT), money order, charge card, etc.) or payment in kind.</p><p class="depth2">Payment in kind means transportation, food, lodging, or other  travel-related services provided by a non-Federal source instead of  monetary payments to the Federal agency for these services. Payment in  kind also includes waiver of any fees that a non-Federal source normally  collects from meeting attendees (e.g., registration fees).</p><p class="depth2">Travel, subsistence, and related expenses (travel expenses) means  the same types of expenses payable under chapter 301 of this title, the  Foreign Affairs Manual (FAM), and the Joint Travel Regulations (JTR) for  transportation, food, lodging or other travel-related services for  official travel (e.g., baggage expenses, services of guides, drivers,  interpreters, communication services, hire of conference rooms, lodging  taxes, laundry/dry cleaning, taxi fares, etc). These expenses also  include conference or training fees (in whole or in part), as well as  benefits that cannot be paid under the applicable travel regulations,  but which are incident to the meeting, provided in kind, and made  available by the meeting sponsor(s) to all attendees. For example, this  definition as applied to this chapter would allow an employee or spouse  to attend a sporting event hosted by the sponsor(s) in connection with  the meeting that is available to all participants. However, it would not  allow the employee to accept tickets to a professional sporting event,  concert or similar event, for use at a later date even if such tickets  were given to all other participants.
