                            <p class="depth0">Methods in appendix A of this part, except as provided under Sec. 60.8(b), shall be used to determine compliance as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method 24 is used to determine the VOC content in coatings. If it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Administrator that coating formulation data are equivalent to Method 24 results, formulation data may be used. In the event of any inconsistency between a Method 24 test and a facility's formulation data, the Method 24 test will govern. For Method 24, the coating sample must be a 1-liter sample collected in a 1-liter container at a point in the process where the sample will be representative of the coating applied to the substrate (i.e., the sample shall include any dilution solvent or other VOC added during the manufacturing process). The container must be tightly sealed immediately after the sample is collected. Any solvent or other VOC added after the sample is taken must be measured and accounted for in the calculations that use Method 24 results.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Method 25 shall be used to determine VOC concentrations from incinerator gas streams. Alternative Methods (18 or 25A), may be used as explained in the applicability section of Method 25 in cases where use of Method 25 is demonstrated to be technically infeasible. The owner or operator shall submit notice of the intended test method to the Administrator for approval along with the notification of the performance test required under Sec. 60.8(d) of the General Provisions. Except as indicated in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the test shall consist of three separate runs, each lasting a minimum of 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with a common exhaust stack for all the individual adsorber vessels pursuant to Sec. 60.743 (a)(1), (b), or (c), the test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete system rotations through the adsorption cycles of all the individual adsorber vessels.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When the method is to be used in the determination of the efficiency of a fixed-bed carbon adsorption system with individual exhaust stacks for each adsorber vessel pursuant to Sec. 60.743 (a)(2), (b), or (c), each adsorber vessel shall be tested individually. Each test shall consist of three separate runs, each coinciding with one or more complete adsorption cycles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Method 1 or 1A is used for sample and velocity traverses;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Method 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D is used for velocity and volumetric flow rates;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Method 3 is used for gas analysis;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Method 4 is used for stack gas moisture;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D; 3; and 4 shall be performed, as applicable, at least twice during each test run.</p>
