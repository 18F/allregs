                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When the agency appeals and the case involves removal,  separation, or suspension continuing beyond the date of the appeal, and  when the administrative judge's decision orders retroactive restoration,  the agency shall comply with the decision to the extent of the temporary  or conditional restoration of the employee to duty status in the  position specified in the decision, pending the outcome of the agency  appeal. The employee may decline the offer of interim relief.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service under the temporary or conditional restoration  provisions of paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be credited toward  the completion of a probationary or trial period, eligibility for a  within-grade increase, or the completion of the service requirement for  career tenure, if the Commission upholds the decision on appeal. Such  service shall not be credited toward the completion of any applicable  probationary or trial period or the completion of the service  requirement for career tenure if the Commission reverses the decision on  appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When the agency appeals, it may delay the payment of any amount,  other than prospective pay and benefits, ordered to be paid to the  complainant until after the appeal is resolved. If the agency delays  payment of any amount pending the outcome of the appeal and the  resolution of the appeal requires the agency to make the payment, then  the agency shall pay interest from the date of the original decision  until payment is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The agency shall notify the Commission and the employee in  writing at the same time it appeals that the relief it provides is  temporary or conditional and, if applicable, that it will delay the  payment of any amounts owed but will pay interest as specified in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section. Failure of the agency to provide  notification will result in the dismissal of the agency's appeal.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The agency may, by notice to the complainant, decline to return  the complainant to his or her place of employment if it determines that  the return or presence of the complainant will be unduly disruptive to  the work environment. However, prospective pay and benefits must be  provided. The determination not to return the complainant to his or her  place of employment is not reviewable. A grant of interim relief does  not insulate a complainant from subsequent disciplinary or adverse  action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the agency files an appeal and has not provided required  interim relief, the complainant may request dismissal of the agency's  appeal. Any such request must be filed with the Office of Federal  Operations within 25 days of the date of service of the agency's appeal.  A copy of the request must be served on the agency at the same time it  is filed with EEOC. The agency may respond with evidence and argument to  the complainant's request to dismiss within 15 days of the date of  service of the request.  [64 FR 37660, July 12, 1999]</p>
