For purposes of part 4 of this chapter,  ``Yamhill-Carlton'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundary  of the Yamhill-Carlton viticultural area are eight 1:24,000 scale United  States Geological Survey topography maps.
