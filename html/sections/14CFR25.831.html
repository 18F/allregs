For normal operating conditions, the ventilation system must be designed to provide each occupant with an airflow containing at least 0.55 pounds of fresh air per minute.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Crew and passenger compartment air must be free from harmful or hazardous concentrations of gases or vapors. In meeting this requirement, the following apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Carbon monoxide concentrations in excess of 1 part in 20,000 parts of air are considered hazardous. For test purposes, any acceptable carbon monoxide detection method may be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Carbon dioxide concentration during flight must be shown not to exceed 0.5 percent by volume (sea level equivalent) in compartments normally occupied by passengers or crewmembers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> There must be provisions made to ensure that the conditions prescribed in paragraph (b) of this section are met after reasonably probable failures or malfunctioning of the ventilating, heating, pressurization, or other systems and equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If accumulation of hazardous quantities of smoke in the cockpit area is reasonably probable, smoke evacuation must be readily accomplished, starting with full pressurization and without depressurizing beyond safe limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section, means must be provided to enable the occupants of the following compartments and areas to control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to their compartment or area independently of the temperature and quantity of air supplied to other compartments and areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The flight crew compartment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Crewmember compartments and areas other than the flight crew compartment unless the crewmember compartment or area is ventilated by air interchange with other compartments or areas under all operating conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Means to enable the flight crew to control the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to the flight crew compartment independently of the temperature and quantity of ventilating air supplied to other compartments are not required if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The total volume of the flight crew and passenger compartments is 800 cubic feet or less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The air inlets and passages for air to flow between flight crew and passenger compartments are arranged to provide compartment temperatures within 5 degrees F. of each other and adequate ventilation to occupants in both compartments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The temperature and ventilation controls are accessible to the flight crew.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The exposure time at any given temperature must not exceed the values shown in the following graph after any improbable failure condition.
