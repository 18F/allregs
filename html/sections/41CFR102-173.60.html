However, the use of  the State postal code should not be embedded within a single word in a  way that obscures the postal code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The preferred format for county or parish governments is to  denote the State postal code after the county or parish, optionally  separated by a dash. Examples of preferred domain names include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Richmondcounty-ga.gov;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pwc-county-va.gov; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Countyofdorchestor-sc.gov.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If third-level domain naming is available from the State  government, counties or parishes are encouraged to register for a domain  name under a State's registered second-level (e.g.,  richmondcounty.ga.gov).</p>
