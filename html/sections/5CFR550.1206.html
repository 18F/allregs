                                Sec. 550.1206  Refunding a lump-sum payment.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When an employee who received a lump-sum payment for accumulated and accrued annual leave under 5 U.S.C. 5551 is reemployed in the Federal service prior to the end of the period covered by the lump-sum payment, the employee must refund to the employing agency an amount equal to the pay included in the lump-sum payment under Sec. 550.1205(b) that covers the period between the date of reemployment and the expiration of the lump-sum leave period, except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. The agency must compute the refund based on the pay used to compute the lump-sum payment under Sec. 550.1205(b). However, annual leave restored under 5 U.S.C. 6304(d) that was included in a lump-sum payment is not subject to refund if an agency reemploys the employee prior to the expiration of the lump-sum leave period. The agency must subtract such restored annual leave from the lump-sum leave period before calculating the refund. An agency may permit an employee to refund the lump-sum payment for annual leave in installments, but may not waive collection. If an agency permits the lump-sum refund to be paid in installments, the employee must refund the lump-sum payment in full within 1 year after the date of reemployment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An employee who is reemployed in a position listed in 5 U.S.C. 6301(2)(ii), (iii), (vi), or (vii) is not required to refund a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee who is reemployed in a position that has no leave system to which annual leave can be recredited is not required to refund a lump-sum payment under paragraph (a) of this section, except that individuals reemployed as Presidential appointees must refund a lump-sum payment and the annual leave will be held in abeyance, as provided in Sec. 550.1207(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An individual first hired by the District of Columbia government on or after October 1, 1987, who received a lump-sum payment upon separation from the District of Columbia government and who is employed by the Federal Government prior to the expiration of the lump-sum leave period must refund the lump-sum payment, and the agency must recredit the annual leave under Sec. 550.1207.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An employee who retired from the Federal Government and received a lump-sum payment under Sec. 550.1203 of this chapter, and who is reemployed under a temporary appointment of less than 90 days prior to the expiration of the lump-sum leave period, is required to refund the lump-sum payment, and the agency must recredit the annual leave under Sec. 550.1207. The employee may use the recredited annual leave during the temporary appointment.</p>
