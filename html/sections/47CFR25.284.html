                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Providers of Mobile-Satellite Service to end-user customers (part 25, subparts A-D) must provide Emergency Call Center service to the extent that

they offer real-time, two way switched voice service that is interconnected with the public switched network and utilize an in-network switching facility which enables the provider to reuse frequencies and/or accomplish seamless hand-offs of subscriber calls. Emergency Call Center personnel must determine the emergency caller's phone number and location and then transfer or otherwise redirect the call to an appropriate public safety answering point. Providers of Mobile-Satellite Services that utilize earth terminals that are not capable of use while in motion are exempt from providing Emergency Call Center service for such terminals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Beginning February 11, 2005, each Mobile-Satellite Service carrier that is subject to the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section must maintain records of all 911 calls received at its emergency call center. Beginning October 15, 2005, and on each following October 15, Mobile-Satellite Service carriers providing service in the 1.6/2.4 GHz and 2 GHz bands must submit a report to the Commission regarding their call center data, current as of September 30 of that year. Beginning June 30, 2006, and on each following June 30, Mobile-Satellite Service carriers providing service in bands other than 1.6/2.4 GHz and 2 GHz must submit a report to the Commission regarding their call center data, current as of May 31 of that year. These reports must include, at a minimum, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the carrier, the address of the carrier's emergency call center, and emergency call center contact information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The aggregate number of calls received by the call center each month during the relevant reporting period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An indication of how many calls received by the call center each month during the relevant reporting period required forwarding to a public safety answering point and how many did not require forwarding to a public safety answering point.
