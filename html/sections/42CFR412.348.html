                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this section--</p><p class="depth0">Annual operating expenses. Annual operating expenses means the sum of net expenses for all reimbursable cost centers for a 12 month cost reporting period. Annual operating expenses are obtained from the Medicare cost report.</p><p class="depth0">Average age of fixed assets. The average age of fixed assets is the ratio of accumulated depreciation for buildings and fixed equipment to current depreciation expense for buildings and fixed equipment. The average age of fixed assets is determined from information on the Medicare cost report.</p><p class="depth0">Fixed assets. Fixed assets mean buildings and fixed equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Criterion for additional payment during the transition period. An additional payment is made to a hospital paid under either the fully prospective payment methodology or the hold-harmless payment methodology as determined under paragraph (c) of this section for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1991 and before October 1, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Minimum payment level by class of hospital. (1) CMS establishes a minimum payment level by class of hospital. The minimum payment level for a hospital will equal a fixed percentage of the hospital's capital-related costs. The minimum payment levels may be no greater than the percentages of allowable capital-related costs that follow:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 90 percent for sole community hospitals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 80 percent for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of Sec. 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under Sec. 412.105(b), that have a disproportionate share patient percentage of at least 20.2 percent as determined under Sec. 412.106(b), and for hospitals located in an urban area for purposes of Sec. 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds that qualify for disproportionate share payments under Sec. 412.106(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 70 percent for all other hospitals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When it is necessary to adjust the minimum payment levels set by class of hospitals specified in paragraphs (c)(1)(i) and (g)(6) of this section, CMS will adjust those levels for each class of hospitals in one percentage point increments as necessary to satisfy the requirement specified in paragraph (h) of this section that total estimated payments under the exception process not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for old capital) for the same fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Additional payments. A hospital is entitled to an additional payment if its capital payments for the cost reporting period would otherwise be less than the applicable minimum payment level. The additional payment equals the difference between the applicable minimum payment level and the capital payments that the hospital would otherwise receive minus any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Determining a hospital's exception payment amount--(1) Cumulative comparison. For each cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Offsetting amounts. Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional payment exception for extraordinary circumstances. (1) A hospital may request an additional payment if the hospital incurs unanticipated capital expenditures in excess of $5 million (net of proceeds from other payment sources such as insurance, litigation decisions and other State, local or Federal government funding programs) due to extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control. Extraordinary circumstances include, but are not limited to, a flood, fire, or earthquake.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A hospital must apply to its CMS Regional Office by the later of October 1, 1992 or 180 days after the extraordinary circumstance causing the unanticipated expenditures for a determination by CMS of whether the hospital is eligible for an additional payment based on the nature of the circumstances and the amount of financial loss documented by the hospital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Except for sole community hospitals, the additional payment is based on a minimum payment amount of 85 percent for Medicare's share of allowable capital-related costs attributable to the extraordinary circumstances. For sole community hospitals, the minimum payment amount is 100 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The minimum payment level applicable under paragraph (c)(1) of this section is adjusted to take into account the 85 percent minimum payment level (100 percent for sole community hospitals) under paragraph (f)(3) of this section for the unanticipated capital-related costs. The additional payment for the cost reporting period equals the difference between the adjusted minimum payment level and the capital payments the hospital would otherwise receive less any offset amount determined under paragraph (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special exceptions process. For eligible hospitals that meet a project need requirement, a project size requirement, and, in the case of certain urban hospitals, meet an excess capacity test, an additional payment may be made for up to 10 years beyond the end of the capital prospective payment system transition period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligible hospitals. The following classes of hospitals are eligible to receive exceptions payments under this special exceptions provision:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sole community hospitals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Hospitals located in an urban area under Sec. 412.63(a) with at least 100 beds, as determined under Sec. 412.105(b), that either have a disproportionate share of at least 20.2 percent as determined under Sec. 412.106(b) or qualify for disproportionate share payments under Sec. 412.106(c)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Hospitals with a combined inpatient Medicare and Medicaid utilization of at least 70 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Project need requirement. A hospital must show that it has obtained any required approval from a State or local planning authority. If a hospital is not required to obtain approval from a planning authority, it must satisfy the age of asset test specified in paragraph (g)(3) of this section and, in the case of an urban hospital, the excess capacity test under paragraph (g)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Age of assets test. A hospital must show that its average age of fixed assets is at or above the 75th percentile for the hospital's first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Excess capacity test for urban hospitals. Urban hospitals that are not required to receive approval from a State or local planning authority must demonstrate that either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The overall average occupancy rate in its metropolitan statistical area is at least 80 percent; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After completion of the project, its capacity is no more than 80 percent of its prior capacity (in terms of bed size).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Project size requirement. A hospital must complete, during the period from the beginning of its first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991 to the end of its last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, a project whose costs for replacement and/or renovation of fixed assets related to patient care are at least:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> $200 million; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 100 percent of its operating cost during the first 12 month cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1991.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Minimum payment level. (i) The minimum payment level for qualifying hospitals will be 70 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> CMS will adjust the minimum payment level in one percentage point increments as necessary to satisfy the requirement specified in paragraph (h) of this section that total estimated payments under the exceptions process not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payment system payments for the same fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Limitation on the period for exception payments. A qualifying hospital may receive an exceptions payment for

up to 10 years from the year in which it completes a project for replacement or renovation of capital assets that meets project need and project size requirements (and, if applicable, excess capacity test), provided that it completes the project no later than the end of the hospital's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001. A project is considered to be completed when the assets are put into use for patient care.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Determining a hospital's exception payment amount--(i) Cumulative comparison. For each cost reporting period, the hospital's exception payment is determined by comparing the cumulative payments made to the hospital under the capital prospective payment system to the cumulative minimum payment levels applicable to the hospital for each cost reporting period subject to the prospective payment system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Offsetting amounts. Offsetting amounts are applied in the following order--(A) Any amount by which the hospital's cumulative payments exceed its cumulative minimum payment levels is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for a cost reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any amount by which the hospital's current year Medicare inpatient operating and capital prospective payment system payments (excluding, if applicable, 75 percent of the hospital's operating prospective payment system disproportionate share payments) exceed its Medicare inpatient operating and capital costs is deducted from the additional payment that would otherwise be payable for the cost reporting period. For purposes of calculating the offset, the costs and payments for services that are not subject to the hospital inpatient prospective payment system are excluded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Notification requirement. Eligible hospitals must submit documentation to the intermediary indicating the completion date of a project that meets the project need requirement under paragraph (g)(2) of this section, the project size requirement under paragraph (g)(5) of this section, and, in the case of certain urban hospitals, an excess capacity test under paragraph (g)(4) of this section, by the later of October 1, 2001 or within 3 months of the end of the hospital's last cost reporting period beginning before October 1, 2001, during which a qualifying project was completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Limit on exception payments. Total estimated payments under the exception process may not exceed 10 percent of the total estimated capital prospective payments (exclusive of hold-harmless payments for old capital) for the same fiscal year.
