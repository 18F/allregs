                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Section 104 is applicable only to projects specificially  authorized by the Congress (not to projects authorized by the Chief of  Engineers under continuing authorities), and only to ``flood control''  projects except in instances where the Congress may provide, by specific  language in the authorization, that a project of other characterization  is eligible for section 104 credit consideration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Section 104 provisions will be applied only at locations where  Federal construction of a congressionally authorized project, or  separable element thereof, is initiated after April 30, 1986; a  congressionally authorized study is underway; or where the feasibility  report has been forwarded for Executive Branch review or for  consideration by Congress.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The crediting provisions of section 104 are applicable only to  non-Federal work started after the reconnaissance phase of Corps  preauthorization studies but prior to project authorization. No credit  is available under section 104 for non-Federal work started after  project authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A credit recommendation will be in response to a specific  request from a State, city, municipality or public agency that is the  prospective local sponsoring agency for the contemplated Federal plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Work eligible for crediting shall be limited to that part of the  local improvement directly related to a flood control purpose. (These  guidelines, although they generally make reference to flood control  ``projects,'' should be understood to have equivalent application to  allocated flood control costs in a multiple purpose project.) Measures  (structural or nonstructural) undertaken for channel alignment,  navigation, recreation, fish and wildlife, land reclamation, drainage,  or to protect against land erosion, and which, in conjunction with the  project, do not produce appreciable and dependable effects in preventing  damage by irregular and unusual rises in water levels, are not classed  as flood control works and are ineligible for credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Future work proposed for crediting should be separately useful  for flood control or other purposes even if the Federal Government does  not construct the contemplated project, and must not create a potential  hazard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For local work initiated before 17 November 1986, but after 17  November 1981, the local sponsoring agency must have requested  consideration by letter dated on or before 31 March 1987. For new local  work commenced after 17 November 1986, only work for which the sponsor  receives notification of compatibility and extent of potential credit  pursuant to Sec. 240.9(c) of this regulation shall be eligible for  credit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The maximum amount creditable shall equal the actual  expenditures made by non-Federal entities (not limited solely to the  project sponsor's specific efforts and expenditures) for work that meets  the criteria set forth above and in Sec. 240.7 or 240.8. Expenditures  eligible for inclusion in the amount creditable include the costs of all  efforts actually required for the non-Federal implementation of the  compatible flood control works including, but not necessarily limited  to, costs for permits, environmental, cultural or archeological  investigations, engineering and design, land acquisition expense, other  LERRD, and construction of the flood control works including any  required mitigation measure. For construction efforts accomplished by  non-Federal interests using their own forces and other resources, for  which ``costs'' may not be recorded, consideration will be given to  inclusion of a reasonable estimate of the value thereof (as if  accomplished by contract). Regardless of the total amount creditable on  this basis, however, the amount actually credited will not exceed the  amount that is a reasonable estimate of the reduction in Federal project  expenditures resulting from substitution of the local work for  authorized project elements or, in the case of compatible work outside  the scope of the project   as originally authorized, a reasonable estimate of what Federal  expenditures would have been if that work had been Federally  constructed. Costs of subsequent maintenance of the creditable non- Federal flood control work will not be credited. In the event that the  local construction work is financed by a Federal non-reimbursable grant  or other Federal funds, the amount creditable against future local  cooperation requirements shall be reduced by a commensurate amount,  unless the law governing the grant permits grant funds to be used to  meet the non-Federal share of Corps of Engineers cost sharing  requirements. However, there will be no corresponding reduction in the  costs or benefits considered in the project's economic evaluation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Regardless of the total amount creditable for compatible work at  the time of construction, the local sponsor will be required to  contribute 5 percent of the total project cost in cash during  construction of the project by the Corps. The credit can only be applied  toward the value of needed lands, easements, rights-of-way, relocations,  and disposal areas (LERRD) the sponsor would otherwise have to provide  plus any additional required cash contribution needed to make the total  sponsor contribution equal at least 25 percent of total project costs.  As a consequence of crediting non-Federal construction costs against  LERRD requirements some costs for LERRD may become a Federal  responsibility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Reimbursement to non-Federal interests will not be made for any  excess of costs for compatible works beyond that which can be credited  in accordance with Sec. 240.6(f). In this regard, reimbursements  pursuant to section 103(a)(3) of Pub. L. 99-662 will not be made should  the non-Federal share of project-related costs exceed 50 percent of  total project-related costs by virtue of such excess of costs for  compatible work.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Local interests are responsible for developing all necessary  engineering plans and specifications for the work they propose to  undertake. However, those costs, including engineering and overhead,  directly attributable to the creditable part of local work may be  included in the amount credited.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Non-Federal costs in connection with LERRD required for the  Federal project, regardless of when incurred, will be recognized in  computation of the LERRD component of project costs (the credit  provisions of section 104, Pub. L. 99-662, have no direct bearing on  this).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Non-Federal construction and LERRD costs in connection with  compatible work for which credit can be given will, when those costs are  incorporated in project costs, be included in their related categories,  and total project cost sharing responsibilities will be adjusted  accordingly.</p>
