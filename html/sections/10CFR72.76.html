Copies  of these instructions may be obtained either by writing to the U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Division of Fuel Cycle Safety Safeguards,  and Environmental Review, Washington, DC 20555-0001, or by e-mail to  RidsNmssFcss@nrc.gov. These reports, as specified by Sec. 74.13 or  40.64 of this chapter, provide information concerning the special  nuclear material and/or source material possessed, received,  transferred, disposed of, or lost by the licensee. Each report must be  submitted within 60 days of the beginning of the physical inventory  required by Sec. 72.72(b). The Commission may, when good cause is  shown, permit a licensee to submit Material Balance Reports and Physical  Inventory Listing Reports at other times. Each licensee required to  report material balance and inventory information as described in this  part, shall resolve any discrepancies identified during the report  review and reconciliation process within 30 calendar days of  notification of a discrepancy identified by NRC. The Commission's copy  of this report must be submitted to the address specified in the  instructions. These prescribed, computer-readable forms replace the DOE/ NRC Forms 742 and 742C previously submitted in paper form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any licensee who is required to submit routine material status  reports pursuant to Sec. 75.35 of this chapter (pertaining to  implementation of the US/IAEA Safeguards Agreement) shall prepare and  submit such reports only as provided in that section instead of as  provided in paragraph (a) of this section.
