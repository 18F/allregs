                                Sec. 50.40  Fee structure for statistics for city blocks in the 1980
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As part of the regular program of the 1980 census, the Census  Bureau will publish printed reports containing certain summary  population and housing statistics for each city block, drawn from the  subjects which are being covered on a 100-percent basis. For these  subjects, a substantial amount of additional data by block will be  available on computer tape.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The 1980 block data under the regular program will be prepared  for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each urbanized area in the United States. An urbanized area is  delineated by the Census Bureau in each standard metropolitan  statistical area and generally consists of a city or group of contiguous  cities with a 1970 population of 50,000 or more, together with adjacent  densely populated land (i.e., land having a population density of at  least 1,000 persons per square mile).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> And, outside urbanized areas, for each incorporated place (such  as a city or village) that was reported as having 10,000 or more  inhabitants in:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The 1970 census, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 1973, 1975, or 1976 official population estimates published  by the Bureau, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A special census conducted by the Bureau on or before December  31, 1977.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Outside the above-mentioned urbanized areas and places, State  and local government authorities will be able to contract with the  Bureau of the Census to produce block data for their areas. In  undertaking this contract, the requesting authority will be required to  pay a fee, supply certain maps, and meet certain time deadlines as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fee: (i) Population size:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Fee per</p><p class="depth0">area ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Under 2,500..................................................       $500 2,500 to 4,999...............................................        600 5,000 to 9,999...............................................        700 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The final fee will be based upon the 1980 census population  counts. A refund or additional charge will be made if the contracting  area is in a different population size group as a result of the census.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The cost for an area with a population of 10,000 or more will  be determined on an individual basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Multiple area contracts may be negotiated at a savings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The fee is based on estimated 1980 costs. If the 1980 cost  exceeds the estimated cost, an additional fee may be requested from the  contracting area. If actual costs are less than the estimated cost, a  refund may be made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Any incorporated place which contracts for block statistics and  which reaches a population of 10,000 or more in the 1980 census will  have the fee completely refunded, as the place will then be considered  to be part of the regular block statistics program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> If the area submits maps which are not adequate for the  Bureau's purposes (see Maps, below) and therefore have to be redrafted  by the Bureau, a surcharge of $300 per map sheet requiring revision will  be applied to the fee for the particular area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maps: (i) In order for the Bureau to provide data on a block-by- block basis, it must have a map which clearly delineates each block. The  contracting government authority must supply such maps. A copy of the  specifications for preparing the block maps will be provided upon  request and, in any event, will accompany the copy of the contract which  is sent to the government authority for signature.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The maps must be furnished to the Census Bureau within 30  calendar days after the government authority signs the contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Bureau will review the maps and, if revision is necessary,  return them within 30 calendar days to the government authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Within 30 calendar days thereafter, the revised maps must be  transmitted to the Bureau and, if they are still inadequate and must  therefore be redrafted by the Bureau, the above-mentioned surcharge of  $300 per map sheet requiring revision will be imposed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Timing: (i) The contract must be signed, and a downpayment of  $250 per area made, by April 1, 1978. A check or money order should be  made payable to ``Commerce--Census.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an area decides to withdraw after signing a contract and  making a downpayment, the cost of work performed to date will be  deducted from the refund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The balance of the fee must be mailed to the Bureau by January  1, 1980.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In consideration of the fees paid and maps supplied, the Bureau  will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identify the individual blocks in its records and tabulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Make available the block data for the particular area in the  same manner as for areas in the regular block statistics program (i.e.,  both in terms of printed reports and computer summary tapes). Two copies  of the printed report (including the printed maps) which contain the  block statistics for the particular area will be furnished to the  contracting government authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Requests for participation in the contract block statistics  program or for further information should be addressed to the Director,  Bureau of the Census, Washington, DC 20233.  [43 FR 3903, Jan. 30, 1978; 43 FR 59835, Dec. 22, 1978]</p>
