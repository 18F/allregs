                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Pension is subject to reduction as specified below when a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent is hospitalized, unless the veteran is hospitalized for Hansen's disease. The provisions of this section apply to initial periods of hospitalization and to readmissions following discharge from a prior period of hospitalization. If the veteran is hospitalized for observation and examination, the date treatment began is considered the date of admission. Special rules governing discontinuance of aid and attendance allowance are contained in Sec.  3.552. Except as otherwise indicated the terms ``hospitalized'' and ``hospitalization'' in Sec. Sec.  3.551 through 3.556 mean:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Hospital treatment in a Department of Veterans Affairs hospital or in any hospital at Department of Veterans Affairs expense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Institutional, domiciliary or nursing home care in a Department of Veterans Affairs institution or domiciliary or at Department of Veterans Affairs expense.

(Authority: 38 U.S.C. 5503(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Old-law pension. (1) Old law pension in excess of $30 monthly for a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent shall continue at the full monthly rate until the end of the sixth calendar month following the month of admission for hospitalization. The rate payable will be reduced effective the first of the seventh calendar month to $30 monthly or 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable, whichever is greater. The reduced rate will be effective the first day of the seventh calendar month following admission. Payment of the amount withheld may be made on termination of hospitalization, as provided in Sec.  3.556. (Sec. 306(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Old law pension in excess of $30 monthly for a veteran who has neither spouse, child nor dependent parent shall continue at the full monthly rate until the end of the sixth calendar month following the month of admission for hospitalization. The rate payable will be reduced effective the first of the seventh calendar month to $30 monthly or 50 percent of the amount otherwise payable, whichever is greater. The reduced rate will be effective the first day of the seventh calendar month following admission. Payment of the amount withheld may be made on termination of hospitalization, as provided in Sec.  3.556. (Sec. 306(b))</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Readmission following regular discharge. Where a veteran has been given an approved discharge or release, readmission the next day to the same or any other VA institution begins a new period of hospitalization, unless the veteran was released for purposes of admission to another VA institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Readmission following irregular discharge. When a veteran whose award is subject to reduction under this paragraph has been discharged or released from a VA institution against medical advice or as a result of disciplinary action, reentry within 6 months from the date of previous admission constitutes a continuation of that period of hospitalization and the award will not be reduced prior to the first day of the seventh calendar month following the month of original admission, exclusive of authorized absences. Reentry 6 months or more after such discharge or release shall be considered a new admission.

A veteran or surviving spouse is not liable for any pension paid in excess of the $90 per month by reason of the Secretary's inability or failure to reduce payments, unless that inability or failure is the result of willful concealment by the veteran or surviving spouse of information necessary to make that reduction.
