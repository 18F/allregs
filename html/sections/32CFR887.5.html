                            <p class="depth0">The issuing authority makes sure that the proper CIL form is issued, particularly if the service member has had service in both the Army and Air Force. The assignment status as of September 26, 1947 determines if the person was in the Army or Air Force at the time of discharge or release from active duty. Separations that took place on or before September 25, 1947 are considered Army separations. Those that took place on or after September 26, 1947 are considered Air Force separations, unless the records clearly show the person actually served as a member of the Army during the period of service for which the CIL is requested. Individuals indicated in Sec. 887.3 may be issued CILs prepared on one of the following forms:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> DD Form 303AF, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Discharge, is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of discharge from the Air Force.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> DD Form 363AF, Certificate of Retirement, is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of retirement from the Air Force (issued only to service members).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> AF Form 386, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Discharge (AUS), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of discharge from the Army.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> AF Form 681, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Certificate of Service (AUS), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of service, or like form, issued on release from extended active duty (EAD) in the Army.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> AF Form 682, Certificate in Lieu of Lost or Destroyed Certificate of Service (USAF), is used to replace any lost or destroyed certificate of service, or like form, issued on release from EAD in the Air Force.</p>
