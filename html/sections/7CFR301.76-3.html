                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Administrator will designate an area as a quarantined area  for citrus greening or as a quarantined area for Asian citrus psyllid in  accordance with the criteria listed in paragraph (c) of this section.  The Administrator will publish a description of all areas quarantined  for citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid on the Plant Protection and  Quarantine (PPQ) Web site: (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/plant_health/ plant_pest_info/citrus_greening/index.shtml). The description of each  quarantined area will include the date the description was last updated  and a description of any changes that have been made to the quarantined  area. Lists of all quarantined areas may also be obtained by request  from any local office of PPQ; local offices are listed in telephone  directories and on the Internet at (http://www.aphis.usda.gov/services/ report_pest_disease/report_pest_disease.shtml). After a change is made  to the description of quarantined areas, we will publish a notice in the  Federal Register informing the public that the change has occurred and  describing the change to the quarantined areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of an area less than an entire State as a  quarantined area. Less than an entire State will be designated as a  quarantined area for citrus greening or the Asian citrus psyllid only if  the Administrator determines that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State has adopted and is enforcing restrictions on the  intrastate movement of regulated articles that are equivalent to those  imposed by this subpart on the interstate movement of regulated  articles; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State as a quarantined  area will prevent the interstate spread of citrus greening or Asian  citrus psyllid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Criteria for designation of a State, or a portion of a State, as  a quarantined area for citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a  quarantined area for citrus greening when the presence of citrus  greening is confirmed within the area by an APHIS-administered test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a  quarantined area for Asian citrus psyllid in which an established  population of Asian citrus psyllids has been detected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A State, or portion of a State, will be designated as a  quarantined area for either citrus greening or Asian citrus psyllid if  the Administrator considers it necessary to quarantine the area because  of its inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from  localities in which citrus greening or an established population of  Asian citrus psyllids has been found.</p>
