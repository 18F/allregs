                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport  category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than  that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the  airport and for the ambient temperature existing at take- off.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport  category airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August  30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater  than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distance  required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after  September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a  clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater  than one-half of the takeoff run.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport  category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take  off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane  Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The accelerate-stop distance, as defined in Sec. 25.109 of this  chapter, must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any  stopway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway  plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway  included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the  runway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport  category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than  that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before  October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all  obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01 D) feet vertically (D is the  distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in  feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport  boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the  boundaries; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A,  422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles  either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200  feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet  horizontally after passing the boundaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight  paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must  be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the  effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at  the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum  distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface  condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or  porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight  Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a  porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines  are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the  airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by  the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the  Airplane Flight Manual, and after that the maximum bank is not more than  15 degrees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> For the purposes of this section, the terms, takeoff distance,  takeoff run, net takeoff flight path, have the same meanings as set  forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.
