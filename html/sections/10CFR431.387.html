                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Under sections 333(d) and 345 of the Act, before issuing an  order assessing a civil penalty against any person, the Secretary must  provide to such a person a notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice  must inform the person that such person can choose (in writing within 30  days after receipt of the notice) to have the procedures of paragraph  (c) of this section (in lieu of those in paragraph (b) of this section)  apply with respect to such assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless a person elects, within 30 calendar days after receipt  of a notice under paragraph (a) of this section, to have paragraph (c)  of this section apply with respect to the civil penalty under paragraph  (a), the Secretary will assess the penalty, by order, after providing an  opportunity for an agency hearing under 5 U.S.C. 554, before an  administrative law judge appointed   under 5 U.S.C. 3105, and making a determination of violation on the  record. Such assessment order will include the administrative law  judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any person against whom the Secretary assesses a penalty under  this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order  assessing such penalty, initiate action in the United States Court of  Appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such  order in accordance with 5 U.S.C. chapter 7. The court will have  jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside  in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand  the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may  direct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the  procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary will  promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of  the notice under paragraph (a) of this section of the proposed penalty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the person has not paid the civil penalty within 60 calendar  days after the assessment has been made under paragraph (c)(1) of this  section, the Secretary will institute an action in the appropriate  District Court of the United States for an order affirming the  assessment of the civil penalty. The court will have authority to review  de novo the law and the facts involved and jurisdiction to enter a  judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting  aside in whole or in part, such assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any election to have this paragraph apply can only be revoked  with the consent of the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty  after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (b)  of this section, or after the appropriate District Court has entered  final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (c) of this  section, the Secretary will institute an action to recover the amount of  such penalty in any appropriate District Court of the United States. In  such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment  order or judgment will not be subject to review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with the provisions of sections 333(d)(5)(A)  and 345 of the Act and notwithstanding the provisions of title 28,  United States Code, or Section 502(c) of the Department of Energy  Organization Act, the General Counsel of the Department of Energy (or  any attorney or attorneys within DOE designated by the Secretary) will  represent the Secretary, and will supervise, conduct, and argue any  civil litigation to which paragraph (c) of this section applies  (including any related collection action under paragraph (d) of this  section) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except  the Supreme Court of the United States. However, the Secretary or the  General Counsel will consult with the Attorney General concerning such  litigation and the Attorney General will provide, on request, such  assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with the provisions of sections 333(d)(5)(B) and  345 of the Act, and subject to the provisions of Section 502(c) of the  Department of Energy Organization Act, the Secretary will be represented  by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in  actions under this section, except to the extent provided in paragraph  (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with the provisions of Section 333(d)(5)(c) and  345 of the Act, Section 402(d) of the Department of Energy Organization  Act will not apply with respect to the function of the Secretary under  this section.    Sec. Appendix A to Subpart U of Part 431--Sampling Plan for Enforcement</p><p class="depth3">Testing of Electric Motors</p><p class="depth3">Step 1. The first sample size (n1) must be five or more  units.</p><p class="depth3">Step 2. Compute the mean (XX1 of the measured energy  performance of the n1 units in the first sample as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.005  where Xi is the measured full-load efficiency of unit i.</p><p class="depth3">Step 3. Compute the sample standard deviation (S1) of the  measured full-load efficiency of the n1 units in the first  sample as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.006</p><p class="depth3">Step 4. Compute the standard error (SE(XX1)) of the mean  full-load efficiency of the first sample as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.007</p><p class="depth3">Step 5. Compute the lower control limit (LCL1) for the  mean of the first sample using RE as the desired mean as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.008  where: RE is the applicable EPCA nominal full-load efficiency when the  test is to determine compliance with the applicable statutory standard,  or is the labeled nominal full-load efficiency when the test is to  determine compliance with the labeled efficiency value, and t is the  2.5th percentile of a t-distribution for a sample size of n1,  which yields a 97.5 percent confidence level for a one-tailed t-test.</p><p class="depth3">Step 6. Compare the mean of the first sample (XX1) with  the lower control limit (LCL1) to determine one of the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> If the mean of the first sample is below the lower control  limit, then the basic model is in non-compliance and testing is at an  end.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> If the mean is equal to or greater than the lower control  limit, no final determination of compliance or non-compliance can be  made; proceed to Step 7.</p><p class="depth3">Step 7. Determine the recommended sample size (n) as follows:</p><p class="depth3">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.009</p><p class="depth3">where S1, RE and t have the values used in Steps 3 and 5,  respectively. The factor [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.010  is based on a 20 percent tolerance in the total power loss at full-load  and fixed output power.</p><p class="depth3">Given the value of n, determine one of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> If the value of n is less than or equal to n1 and if  the mean energy efficiency of the first sample (XX1) is equal  to or greater than the lower control limit (LCL1), the basic  model is in compliance and testing is at an end.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> If the value of n is greater than n1, the basic model is in  non-compliance. The size of a second sample n2 is determined  to be the smallest integer equal to or greater than the difference n- n1. If the value of n2 so calculated is greater  than 20-n1, set n2 equal to 20-n1.</p><p class="depth3">Step 8. Compute the combined (XX2) mean of the measured  energy performance of the n1 and n2 units of the  combined first and second samples as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.011</p><p class="depth3">Step 9. Compute the standard error (SE(XX2)) of the mean  full-load efficiency of the n1 and n2 units in the  combined first and second samples as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.012  (Note that S1 is the value obtained above in Step 3.)</p><p class="depth3">Step 10. Set the lower control limit (LCL2) to,</p><p class="depth3">[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR83AD04.013</p><p class="depth3">where t has the value obtained in Step 5, and compare the combined  sample mean (XX2) to the lower control limit  (LCL2) to find one of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(i)</em> If the mean of the combined sample (XX2) is less than  the lower control limit (LCL2), the basic model is in non- compliance and testing is at an end.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(ii)</em> If the mean of the combined sample (XX2) is equal to  or greater than the lower control limit (LCL2), the basic  model is in compliance and testing is at an end.</p><p class="depth0">Manufacturer-Option Testing</p><p class="depth0">If a determination of non-compliance is made in Steps 6, 7 or 10, of  this appendix A, the manufacturer may request that additional testing be  conducted, in accordance with the following procedures.</p><p class="depth0">Step A. The manufacturer requests that an additional number,  n3, of units be tested, with n3 chosen such that  n1 + n2 + n3 does not exceed 20.</p><p class="depth0">Step B. Compute the mean full-load efficiency, standard error, and  lower control limit of the new combined sample in accordance with the  procedures prescribed in Steps 8, 9, and 10, of this appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Step C. Compare the mean performance of the new combined sample to  the lower control limit (LCL2) to determine one of the  following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the new combined sample mean is equal to or greater than the  lower control   limit, the basic model is in compliance and testing is at an end.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the new combined sample mean is less than the lower control  limit and the value of n1 + n2 + n3 is  less than 20, the manufacturer may request that additional units be  tested. The total of all units tested may not exceed 20. Steps A, B, and  C are then repeated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Otherwise, the basic model is determined to be in non- compliance.</p>
