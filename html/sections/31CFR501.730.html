                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness  by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why  such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the  party believes the witness may be unable to attend or testify at the  hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the matters  concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned;  and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required finding when ordering a deposition. In the discretion  of the Administrative Law Judge, an order for deposition may be issued  upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give testimony  material to the proceeding, that it is likely the prospective witness  will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age,  sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability, and that the  taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of order. An order for deposition shall designate by  name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the  Administrative Law Judge or any other person authorized to administer  oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the  deposition is to be held. An order for deposition also shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of the testimony to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time and place of the deposition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to  be filed upon completion of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure at depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by  deposition shall swear or affirm before any questions are put to him or  her. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed as  permitted at a hearing. A witness being deposed may have counsel or a  representative present during the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Objections to questions or evidence. Objections to questions or  evidence   shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon.  Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the deposition  officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer (other than an  Administrative Law Judge) shall not have the power to decide on the  competency, materiality or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to  questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be deemed  a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been  obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Filing of depositions. The questions asked and all answers or  objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a transcript  shall be prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her  direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and  certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition transcript  and exhibits shall be filed with the Administrative Law Judge. A copy of  the deposition transcript and exhibits shall be served on the opposing  party or parties. The cost of the transcript (including copies) shall be  paid by the party requesting the deposition.</p>
