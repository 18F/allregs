                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Activities with no significant impact. NOAA believes that  exploration activities of the type listed below are very similar or  identical to activities considered in section 6(c)(3) of NOAA Directives  Manual 02-10, and therefore have no potential for significant  environmental impact, and will require no further environmental  assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Gravity and magnetometric observations and measurements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bottom and sub-bottom acoustic profiling or imaging without the  use of explosives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Mineral sampling of a limited nature such as those using either  core, grab or basket samplers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Water and biotic sampling, if the sampling does not adversely  affect shellfish beds, marine mammals, or an endangered species, or if  permitted by the National Marine Fisheries Service or another Federal  agency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Meteorological observations and measurements, including the  setting of instruments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Hydrographic and oceanographic observations and measurements,  including the setting of instruments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Sampling by box core, small diameter core or grab sampler, to  determine seabed geological or geotechnical properties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Television and still photographic observation and measurements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Shipboard mineral assaying and analysis; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Positioning systems, including bottom transponders and surface  and subsurface buoys filed in Notices to Mariners.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Activities with potential impact. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NOAA research has  identified at-sea testing of recovery equipment and the operation of  processing test facilities as activities which have some potential for  significant environmental impacts during exploration. However, the  research has revealed that only the following limited effects are  expected to have potential for significant adverse environmental impact.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The programmatic EIS's documents three at-sea effects of deep  seabed mining which cumulatively during commercial recovery have the  potential for significant effect. These three effects also occur during  mining system tests that may be conducted under a license, but are  expected to be insignificant. These include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Destruction of benthos in and near the collector track. Present  information reflects that the impact from this effect during mining  tests under exploration licenses will be extremely small.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Blanketing of benthic fauna and dilution of food supply away  from mine site subareas. The settling of fine sediments disturbed by  tests under a license of scale-model mining systems which simulate  commercial recovery could adversely affect benthic fauna by blanketing,  diluation of their food supply, or both. Because of the anticipated slow  settling rate of the sediments, the affected area could be quite large.  However, research results are insufficient to conclude that this will  indeed be a problem.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Surface plume effect on fish larvae. The impact of  demonstration-scale   mining tests during exploration is expected to be insignificant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If processing facilities in the United States are planned to be  used for testing during exploration, NOAA also will assess their impacts  in the site-specific EIS developed for each license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NOAA approach. In making determinations on significant adverse  environmental effects, the Administrator will draw on the above  conclusions and other findings in NOAA's programmatic environmental  statement and site-specific statements issued in accordance with the  Act. He will issue licenses with terms, conditions and restrictions  containing, as appropriate, environmental protection or mitigation  requirements (pursuant to Sec. 970.518) and monitoring requirements  (pursuant to Sec. 970.522). The focus of NOAA's environmental efforts  will be on environmental research and on monitoring during mining tests  to acquire more information on the environmental effects of deep seabed  mining. If these efforts reveal that modification is required to protect  the quality of the environment, NOAA then may modify terms, conditions  and restrictions pursuant to Sec. 970.512.</p>
