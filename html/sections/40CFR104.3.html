                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notice of hearing. Whenever the Administrator publishes any  proposed effluent standard, he shall simultaneously publish a notice of  a public hearing to be held within thirty days following the date of  publication of the proposed standard. Any person who has any objection  to a proposed standard may file with the hearing clerk a concise  statement of any such objection. No person may participate in the  hearing on the proposed toxic pollutant effluent standards unless the  hearing clerk has received within 25 days of the publication of the  notice of the proposed standards a statement of objection as herein  described. In exceptional circumstances and for good cause shown the  Presiding Officer may allow an objection to be filed after the filing  deadline prescribed in the preceding sentence, which good cause must  include at a minimum lack of actual notice on the part of the objector  or any   representative of such objector of the proposed standards despite his  exercise of due diligence, so long as such later filing will not cause  undue delay in the proceedings or prejudice to any of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objections. Any objection to a proposed standard which is filed  pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section shall meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It shall be filed in triplicate with the hearing clerk within  the time prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It shall state concisely and with particularity each portion of  the proposed standard to which objection is taken; to the greatest  extent feasible it shall state the basis for such objection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the greatest extent feasible it shall (i) state specifically  the objector's proposed modification to any such standard proposed by  the Agency to which objection is taken, (ii) set forth the reasons why  such modification is sought, and (iii) identify and describe the  scientific or other basis for such proposed modification, including  reference to any pertinent scientific data or authority in support  thereof.  Any objection which fails to comply with the foregoing provisions shall  not be accepted for filing. The Presiding Officer shall promptly notify  any person whose objection is not accepted for any of the reasons set  forth in this section, stating the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>. The supplemental data herein described  shall be filed not later than 40 days following publication of the  proposed effluent standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Public comment. The notice required under paragraph (a) of this  section shall also provide for the submission to the Agency of written  comments on the proposed rulemaking by interested persons not filing  objections pursuant to this section as hereinabove described, and hence  not participating in the hearing as parties. The notice shall fix a time  deadline for the submission of such comments which shall be not later  than the date set for commencement of the hearing. Such comments shall  be received in evidence at the commencement of the hearing. The  Administrator in making any decision based upon the record shall take  into account the unavailability of cross-examination in determining the  weight to be accorded such comments.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Promulgation in absence of objection. If no objection is filed  pursuant to this section, then the Administrator shall promulgate the  final standards on the basis of the Agency's statement of basis and  purpose and any public comments received pursuant to paragraph (d) of  this section.</p>
