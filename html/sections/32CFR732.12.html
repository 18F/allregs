                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Regular members. To be eligible for non-Federal medical, dental, or emergency maternity care at Government expense, Regular active duty United States naval members and Canadian Navy and Marine Corps members must be in a duty status when care is provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reservists. (1) Reservists on active duty for training and inactive duty training, including leave and liberty therefrom, are considered to be in a duty status while participating in training. Accordingly, they are entitled to care for illnesses and injuries occurring while in that status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reservists on active duty for training and inactive duty training, including leave and liberty therefrom, are considered to be in a duty status while participating in training. Accordingly, they are entitled to care for illnesses and injuries occurring while in that status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reservists are entitled to care for injuries and illnesses occurring during direct travel enroute to and from active duty training (ACDUTRA) and to and from inactive duty training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> NATO naval members. Naval members of the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA) nations of Belgium, Denmark, Federal Republic of Germany, France, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, and the United Kingdom, are authorized outpatient care only under the provisions of this part when stationed in or passing through the United States in connection with official duties. Public Law 99-591 prohibits inpatient care of these foreign military members in the United States at the expense of the United States Government. The other NATO SOFA Nation, Canada, entered into a comparable care agreement with the United States requiring the United States to provide inpatient and outpatient care under the provisions of this part to members of the Department of National Defence of Canada receiving care in the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Absent without authority. Naval members absent without authority during an entire episode of treatment are not eligible for non-Federal medical, dental, or emergency maternity care at Government expense. The only exception occurs when a member's illness or injury is determined to have been the direct cause of the unauthorized absentee status. In such an instance, eligibility will be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determined to have existed from the day and hour of such injury or illness provided the member was not in an unauthorized absentee status prior to the onset of the illness or injury and initiation of treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Retained when the member is returned directly to military control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terminated should the member return to an unauthorized absentee status immediately after completion of treatment. Departmental level (MEDCOM-333 for medical and MEDCOM-06 for dental) review is required before benefits may be extended.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Constructive return. When constructive return, defined in Sec. 732.11(c), is effected, entitlement will be determined to have existed from 0001 hours of the day of constructive return, not necessarily the day and hour care was initiated.</p>
