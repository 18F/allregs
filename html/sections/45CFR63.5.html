The effective date of the project will be set forth in  the notification of grant award. Grantees may be reimbursed for costs  resulting from obligations incurred before the effective date of the  grant award if such costs are authorized by the Assistant Secretary in  the notification of grant award or subsequently in writing, and  otherwise would be allowable as costs of the grant under the applicable  regulations and grant terms and conditions.</p>
