                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As stated in Sec. 779.215 ``common control'' may exist with or without ownership. The actual control of the performance of the related activities is sufficient to establish the ``control'' referred to in the definition. In some cases an owner may actually relinquish his control to another, or by agreement or other arrangement, he may so restrict his right to exercise control as to abandon the control or to share the control of his business activities with other persons or corporations. In such a case, the activities may be performed under ``common control.'' In other cases, the power to control may be reserved through agreement or arrangement between the parties so as to vest the control of the activities of one business in the hands of another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Activities are considered to be performed under ``common control'' even if, because of the particular methods of operation, the power to control is only seldom used, as where the business has been in operation for a long time without change in methods of operation and practically no actual direction is necessary; also common control may exist where the control, although rarely visibly exercised, is evidenced by the fact that mere suggestions are adopted readily by the business being controlled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the retail industry, particularly, there are many instances where, for business reasons, related activities performed by separate companies are so unified or controlled as to constitute a single enterprise. A common example, specifically named in the definition, is the leased department. This and other examples are discussed in Sec. Sec. 779.225 through 779.235.</p><p class="depth2">Leased Departments, Franchise and Other Business Arrangements</p>
