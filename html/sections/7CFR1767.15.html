Changes in estimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic  life or of the residual value of the leased property) or changes in  circumstances (for example, default by the lessee) shall not give rise  to a new classification of a lease for accounting purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(t)</em> Accounting for leases. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> All leases shall be classified as  either capital or operating leases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The utility shall record a capital lease as an asset in Account  101.1, Property Under Capital Leases, Account 120.6, Nuclear Fuel Under  Capital Leases or Account 121, Nonutility Property;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The utility, as a lessee, shall recognize an asset retirement  obligation arising from the plant under a capital lease unless the  obligation is recorded as an asset and liability under a capital lease.

Utilities owning allowances, other than those  acquired for speculative purposes, shall account for such allowances at  cost in Account 158.1, Allowance Inventory, or Account 158.2, Allowances  Withheld, as appropriate.

The interest rate used in the present-value measurement shall be the  utility's incremental borrowing rate, in the month in which the  allowances are acquired, for a loan with a term similar to the period  that it will hold the allowances and in an amount equal to the purchase  price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The underlying records supporting Account 158.1 and Account  158.2 shall be maintained in sufficient detail so as to provide the  number of allowances and the related cost by vintage year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Issuances from inventory included in Account 158.1 and Account  158.2 shall be accounted for on a vintage basis using a monthly  weighted-average method of cost determination. The cost of eligible  allowances not used in the current year shall be transferred to the  vintage for the immediately following year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Account 158.1 shall be credited and Account 509, Allowances,  debited so that the cost of the allowances to be remitted for the year  is charged to expense monthly based on each month's emissions. This may,  in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost of an allowance  between months on a fractional basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In any period in which actual emissions exceed the amount  allowable based on eligible allowances owned, the utility shall estimate  the cost to acquire the additional allowances needed and charge Account  158.1 with the estimated cost. This estimated cost of future allowance  acquisitions shall be credited to Account 158.1 and charged to Account  509 in the same accounting period as the related charge to Account  158.1. Should the actual cost of these   allowances differ from the estimated cost, the differences shall be  recognized in the then-current period's inventory issuance cost.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Any penalties assessed by the Environmental Protection Agency  for the emission of excess pollutants shall be charged to Account 426.3,  Penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Gains on dispositions of allowances, other than allowances held  for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as follows. First, if  there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain shall be  deferred in Account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending  resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the  existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to  Account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in  charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied.  Third, all other gains will be credited to Account 411.8, Gains from  Disposition of Allowances. Losses on disposition of allowances, other  than allowances held for speculative purposes, shall be accounted for as  follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets shall be charged  directly to Account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses  shall be charged to Account 411.9, Losses from Disposition of  Allowances. (See the definition of regulatory assets and liabilities.)  Gains or losses on disposition of allowances held for speculative  purposes shall be recognized in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating  Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures  contracts used to protect the utility from the risk of unfavorable price  changes (``hedging transactions'') shall be deferred in Account 186,  Miscellaneous Deferred Debits, or Account 253, Other Deferred Credits,  as appropriate. Such deferred amounts shall be included in Account  158.1, Allowance Inventory, in the month in which the related allowances  are acquired, sold or otherwise disposed of. Where the costs or benefits  of hedging transactions are not identifiable with specific allowances,  the amounts shall be included in Account 158.1 when the futures contract  is closed. The costs and benefits of exchange-traded allowance futures  contracts entered into as a speculating activity shall be charged or  credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account  426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Depreciation accounting--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Method. Utilities must use a method  of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and rational manner the  service value of depreciable property over the service life of the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Service lives. Estimated useful service lives of depreciable  property must be supported by engineering, economic, and other  depreciation studies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Rate. Utilities must use percentage rates of depreciation that  are based on a method of depreciation that allocates in a systematic and  rational manner the service value of depreciable property to the service  life of the property. Where composite depreciation rates are used, they  should be based on the weighted average estimated useful service lives  of the depreciable property comprising the composite group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(w)</em> Accounting for other comprehensive income. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Utilities shall  record items of other comprehensive income in Account 209, Accumulated  Other Comprehensive Income. Amounts included in this account shall be  maintained by each category of other comprehensive income. Examples of  categories of other comprehensive income include foreign currency items,  minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on  available-for-sale type securities and cash flow hedge amounts.  Supporting records shall be maintained for Account 209 so that the  cumulative amount of other comprehensive income for each item included  in this account can be readily identified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> When an item of other comprehensive income enters into the  determination of net income in the current or subsequent periods, a  reclassification adjustment shall be recorded in Account 209 to avoid  double counting of that amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> When it is probable that an item of other comprehensive income  will be included in the development of cost-of-service rates in  subsequent periods, that amount of unrealized losses or gains will be  recorded in Accounts   182.3, Other Regulatory Assets or 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Utilities shall recognize derivative instruments as either assets or  liabilities in the financial statements and measure those instruments at  fair value, except those falling within recognized exceptions. Normal  purchases or sales are contracts that provide for the purchase or sale  of goods that will be delivered in quantities expected to be used or  sold by the utility over a reasonable period in the normal course of  business. A derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other  contract with all of the following characteristics:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> It has one or more underlyings and a notional amount or payment  provision. Those terms determine the amount of the settlement or  settlements, and, in some cases, whether or not a settlement is  required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> It requires no initial net investment or an initial net  investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of  contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes  in market factors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Its terms require or permit net settlement, can readily be  settled net by a means outside the contract, or provide for delivery of  an asset that puts the recipient in a position not substantially  different from net settlement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The accounting for the changes in the fair value of derivative  instruments depends upon its intended use and designation. Changes in  the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as fair value or  cash flow hedges shall be recorded in Account 175, Derivative instrument  assets, or Account 244, Derivative Instrument Liabilities, as  appropriate, with the gains recorded in Account 421, Miscellaneous  Nonoperating Income, and losses recorded in Account 426.5, Other  Deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A derivative instrument may be specifically designated as a fair  value or cash flow hedge. A hedge is used to manage risk to price,  interest rates, or foreign currency transactions. A company shall  maintain documentation of the hedge relationship at the inception of the  hedge that details the risk management objective and strategy for  undertaking the hedge, the nature of the risk being hedged, and how  hedge effectiveness will be determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a fair  value hedge against exposure to changes in the fair value of a  recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment, it shall record the  change in fair value of the derivative instrument to Account 176,  Derivatives in Instrument Assets--Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative  Instrument Liabilities--Hedges, as appropriate, with a corresponding  adjustment to the subaccount of the item being hedged. The ineffective  portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the same income  or expense account that will be used when the hedged item enters into  the determination of net income. In the case of a fair value hedge of a  firm commitment a new asset or liability is created. As a result of the  hedge relationship, the new asset or liability will become part of the  carrying amount of the item being hedged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the utility designates the derivative instrument as a cash  flow hedge against exposure to variable cash flows of a probable  forecasted transaction, it shall record changes in the fair value of the  derivative instrument in Account 176, Derivative Instrument Assets-- Hedges, or Account 245, Derivative Instrument Liabilities--Hedges, as  appropriate, with a corresponding amount in Account 209, Accumulated  Other Comprehensive Income, for the effective portion of the hedge. The  ineffective portion of the hedge transaction shall be reflected in the  same account or expense account that will be used when the hedged item  enters into the determination of net income. Amounts recorded in other  comprehensive income shall be reclassified into earning in the same  period or periods that the hedged forecasted item enters into the  determination of net income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(y)</em> Accounting for asset retirement obligations. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An asset  retirement obligation represents a liability for the legal obligation  associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset that   a company is required to settle as a result of an existing or enacted  law, statute, ordinance, or written or oral contract or by legal  construction of a contract under the doctrine of promissory estoppel. An  asset retirement cost represents the amount capitalized when the  liability is recognized for the long-lived asset that gives rise to the  legal obligation. The amount recognized for the liability and an  associated asset retirement cost shall be stated at the fair value of  the asset retirement obligation in the period in which the obligation is  incurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The utility shall initially record a liability for an asset  retirement obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and  charge the associated asset retirement costs to electric utility plant  (including Accounts 101.1 and 120.6), and nonutility plant, as  appropriate, related to the plant that gives rise to the legal  obligation. The asset retirement cost shall be depreciated over the  useful life of the related asset that gives rise to the obligation. For  periods subsequent to the initial recording of the asset retirement  obligation, a utility shall recognize the period to period changes of  the asset retirement obligation that result from the passage of time due  to the accretion of the liability and any subsequent measurement changes  to the initial liability for the legal obligation recorded in Account  230, Asset retirement obligations, as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The utility shall record the accretion of the liability by  debiting Account 411.10, Accretion Expense, for electric utility plant,  Account 413, Expenses of Electric Plant Leased to Others, for electric  plant leased to others, and Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating  Income, for nonutility plant and crediting Account 230, Asset Retirement  Obligations; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The utility shall recognize any subsequent measurement changes  of the liability initially recorded in Account 230, Asset Retirement  Obligation, for each specific asset retirement obligation as an  adjustment of that liability in Account 230 with the corresponding  adjustment to electric utility plant, electric plant leased to others,  and nonutility plant, as appropriate. The utility shall on a timely  basis monitor any measurement changes of the asset retirement  obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Gains or losses resulting from the settlement of asset  retirement obligations associated with utility plant resulting from the  difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement  obligation included in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and  the actual amount paid to settle the obligation shall be accounted for  as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gains shall be credited to Account 411.6, Gains from Disposition  of Utility Plant, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Losses shall be charged to Account 411.7, Losses from  Disposition of Utility Plant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Gains or losses on the settlement of asset retirement  obligations associated with nonutility plant resulting from the  difference between the amount of the liability for the asset retirement  obligation in Account 230, Asset Retirement Obligations, and the amount  paid to settle the obligation, shall be accounted for as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Gains shall be credited to Account 421, Miscellaneous  Nonoperating Income, and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Losses shall be charged to Account 426.5, Other Deductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For purposes of analyses a utility shall maintain supporting  documentation so as to be able to furnish accurately and expeditiously  with respect to each asset retirement obligation the full details of the  identity and nature of the legal obligation, the year incurred, the  identity of the plant giving rise to the obligation, the full  particulars relating to each component and supporting computations  related to the measurement of the asset retirement obligation.
