                                Sec. 25.2503-6  Exclusion for certain qualified transfer for tuition or
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 2503(e) provides that any qualified transfer  after December 31, 1981, shall not be treated as a transfer of property  by gift for purposes of Chapter 12 of Subtitle B of the Code. Thus, a  qualified transfer on behalf of any individual is excluded in  determining the total amount of gifts in calendar year 1982 and  subsequent years. This exclusion is available in addition to the $10,000  annual gift tax exclusion. Furthermore, an exclusion for a qualified  transfer is permitted without regard to the relationship between the  donor and the donee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualified transfers--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Definition. For purposes of this  paragraph, the term ``qualified transfer'' means any amount paid on  behalf of an individual--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As tuition to a qualifying educational organization for the  education or training of that individual, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To any person who provides medical care with respect to that  individual as payment for the qualifying medical expenses arising from  such medical care.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tuition expenses. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this  section, a qualifying educational organization is one which normally  maintains a regular faculty and curriculum and normally has a regularly  enrolled body of pupils or students in attendance at the place where its  educational activities are regularly carried on. See section  170(b)(1)(A)(ii) and the regulations thereunder. The unlimited exclusion  is permitted for tuition expenses of full-time or part-time students  paid directly to the qualifying educational organization providing the  education. No unlimited exclusion is permitted for amounts paid for  books, supplies, dormitory fees, board, or other similar expenses which  do not constitute direct tuition costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Medical expenses. For purposes of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this  section, qualifying medical expenses are limited to those expenses  defined in section 213(d) (section 213(e) prior to January 1, 1984) and  include expenses incurred for the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment  or prevention of disease, or for the purpose of affecting any structure  or function of the body or for transportation primarily for and  essential to medical care. In addition, the unlimited exclusion from the  gift tax   includes amounts paid for medical insurance on behalf of any individual.  The unlimited exclusion from the gift tax does not apply to amounts paid  for medical care that are reimbursed by the donee's insurance. Thus, if  payment for a medical expense is reimbursed by the donee's insurance  company, the donor's payment for that expense, to the extent of the  reimbursed amount, is not eligible for the unlimited exclusion from the  gift tax and the gift is treated as having been made on the date the  reimbursement is received by the donee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth2">Example (1). In 1982, A made a tuition payment directly to a foreign  university on behalf of B. A had no legal obligation to make this  payment. The foreign university is described in section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii)  of the Code. A's tuition payment is exempt from the gift tax under  section 2503(e) of the Code.</p><p class="depth2">Example (2). A transfers $100,000 to a trust the provisions of which  state that the funds are to be used for tuition expenses incurred by A's  grandchildren. A's transfer to the trust is a completed gift for Federal  gift tax purposes and is not a direct transfer to an educational  organization as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of this section and does  not qualify for the unlimited exclusion from gift tax under section  2503(e).</p><p class="depth2">Example (3). C was seriously injured in an automobile accident in  1982. D, who is unrelated to C, paid C's various medical expenses by  checks made payable to the physician. D also paid the hospital for C's  hospital bills. These medical and hospital expenses were types described  in section 213 of the Code and were not reimbursed by insurance or  otherwise. Because the medical and hospital bills paid in 1982 for C  were medical expenses within the meaning of section 213 of the Code, and  since they were paid directly by D to the person rendering the medical  care, they are not treated as transfers subject to the gift tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example (4). Assume the same facts as in example (2) except that  instead of making the payments directly to the medical service provider,  D reimbursed C for the medical expenses which C had previously paid. The  payments made by D to C do not qualify for the exclusion under section  2503(e) of the Code and are subject to the gift tax on the date the  reimbursement is received by C to the extent the reimbursement and all  other gifts from D to C during the year of the reimbursement exceed the  $10,000 annual exclusion provided in section 2503(b).
