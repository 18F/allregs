Service agreements may not  contain any supplements, but may contain exhibits which may be  separately superseded. The exhibits may show, among other things,  contract demand delivery points, delivery pressures, names of industrial  customers of the distributor-customer, or names of distributors (with  one distributor named as agent where delivery to several distributors is  effected at the same delivery points).</p>
