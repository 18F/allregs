                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Imposition of tax. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This section applies for purposes of  determining the tax of a foreign corporation which at no time during the  taxable year is engaged in trade or business in the United States.  However, see also Sec. 1.882-2 where such corporation has an election  in effect for the taxable year in respect to real property income or  receives interest on obligations of the United States. Except as  otherwise provided in Sec. 1.871-12, a foreign corporation to which  this section applies is not subject to the tax imposed by section 11 or  section 1201(a) but, pursuant to the provisions of section 881(a), is  liable to a flat tax of 30 percent upon the aggregate of the amounts  determined under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section which are  received during the taxable year from sources within the United States.  Except as specifically provided in such paragraphs, such amounts do not  include gains from the sale or exchange of property. To determine the  source of such amounts, see sections 861 through 863, and the  regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The tax of 30 percent is imposed by section 881(a) upon an  amount only to the extent the amount constitutes gross income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deductions shall not be allowed in determining the amount  subject to tax under this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 1.882-2, a foreign corporation which  at no time during the taxable year is engaged in trade or business in  the United States has no income, gain, or loss for the taxable year  which is effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of  a trade or business in the   United States. See section 864(c)(1)(B) and Sec. 1.864-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Gains and losses which, by reason of section 882(d) and Sec.  1.882-2, are treated as gains or losses which are effectively connected  for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade or business in the  United States by such a foreign corporation shall not be taken into  account in determining the tax under this section. See, for example,  paragraph (c)(2) of Sec. 1.871-10.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Interest received by a foreign corporation pursuant to certain  portfolio debt instruments is not subject to the flat tax of 30 percent  described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. For rules applicable to a  foreign corporation's receipt of interest on certain portfolio debt  instruments, see sections 871(h), 881(c), and Sec. 1.871-14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fixed or determinable annual or periodical income--(1) General  rule. The tax of 30 percent imposed by section 881(a) applies to the  gross amount received from sources within the United States as fixed or  determinable annual or periodical gains, profits, or income. Specific  items of fixed or determinable annual or periodical income are  enumerated in section 881(a)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> as interest, dividends, rents, salaries,  wages, premiums, annuities, compensations, remunerations, and  emoluments, but other items of fixed or determinable annual or  periodical gains, profits, or income are also subject to the tax as, for  instance, royalties, including royalties for the use of patents,  copyrights, secret processes and formulas, and other like property. As  to the determination of fixed or determinable annual or periodical  income, see paragraph (a) of Sec. 1.1441-2. For special rules treating  gain on the disposition of section 306 stock as fixed or determinable  annual or periodical income for purposes of section 881(a), see section  306(f) and paragraph (h) of Sec. 1.306-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and 1.894-1(c).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Dividend Equivalents. For rules applicable to a foreign  corporation's receipt of a dividend equivalent, see section 871(m) and  the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other income and gains--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Items subject to tax. The tax of 30  percent imposed by section 881(a) also applies to the following gains  received during the taxable year from sources within the United States:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Gains described in section 631 (b) or (c), relating to the  treatment of gain on the disposal of timber, coal, or iron ore with a  retained economic interest;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Gains from the sale or exchange after October 4, 1966, of  patents, copyrights, secret processes and formulas, goodwill,  trademarks, trade brands, franchises, or other like property, or of any  interest in any such property, to the extent the gains are from payments  (whether in a lump sum or in installments) which are contingent on the  productivity, use, or disposition of the property or interest sold or  exchanged, or from payments which are treated under section 871(e) and  Sec. 1.871-11 as being so contingent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination of amount of gain. The tax of 30 percent imposed  upon the gains described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph applies  to the full amount of the gains and is determined (i) without regard to  the alternative tax imposed by section 1201(a) upon the excess of net  long-term capital gain over the net short-term capital loss; (ii)  without regard to section 1231, relating to property used in the trade  or business and involuntary conversions; and (iii) except in the case of  gains described in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this paragraph, whether or  not the gains are considered to be gains from the sale or exchange of  property which is a capital asset.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Credits against tax. The credits allowed by section 32 (relating  to tax withheld at source on foreign corporations), by section 39  (relating to certain uses of gasoline and lubricating oil), and by  section 6402 (relating to overpayments of tax) shall be allowed against  the tax of a foreign corporation determined in accordance with this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effective/applicability date.
