                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Notification of final fee calculation. No later than August 31st  of each fee year, the IRS will send each covered entity its final fee  calculation for that year. In any fee year, the IRS will base its final  fee calculation on data provided to it by the Agencies as adjusted  pursuant to the dispute resolution process. The notification to a  covered entity of its final fee calculation will include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The covered entity's allocated fee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The covered entity's adjustment amount calculated as described  in Sec. 51.5;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The covered entity's branded prescription drug sales, by NDC, by  Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The aggregate branded prescription drug sales taken into account  for all covered entities; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The final determination with respect to error reports.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Differences in preliminary fee calculation and final fee  calculation. A covered entity's final fee calculation may differ from  the covered entity's preliminary fee calculation because of changes made  pursuant to the dispute resolution process described in Sec. 51.7. Even  if a covered entity did not file an error report described in Sec.  51.7, a covered entity's final fee may differ from a covered entity's  preliminary fee because of a change in data reported by the Agencies  after resolution of error reports, including a change in the aggregate  prescription drug sales figure. A change in aggregate prescription drug  sales data can affect each covered entity's fee because each covered  entity's fee is a fraction of the aggregate fee collected from all  covered entities. A covered entity's final fee may also differ from its  preliminary fee calculation because the data used in the preliminary fee  calculation may have contained inaccurate branded prescription drug  sales information that was corrected or updated at the conclusion of the  dispute resolution process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment of final fee. Each covered entity must pay its final fee  by September 30th of the fee year. For a controlled group, the payment  must be made using the designated entity's EIN as reported on Form 8947.  The fee must be paid by electronic funds transfer as required by Sec.  51.6302-1. There is no tax return to be filed for the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Joint and several liability. In the case of a controlled group  that is liable for the fee, all members of the controlled group are  jointly and severally liable for the fee. Accordingly, if a controlled  group's fee is not paid, the IRS will separately assess each member of  the group for the full amount of the controlled group's fee.
