                            <p class="depth0">Upon receipt of a written request to have lands taken in trust, the Secretary will notify the state and local governments having regulatory jurisdiction over the land to be acquired, unless the acquisition is mandated by legislation. The notice will inform the state or local government that each will be given 30 days in which to provide written comments as to the acquisition's potential impacts on regulatory jurisdiction, real property taxes and special assessments. If the state or local government responds within a 30-day period, a copy of the comments will be provided to the applicant, who will be given a reasonable time in which to reply and/or request that the Secretary issue a decision. The Secretary will consider the following criteria in evaluating requests for the acquisition of land in trust status when the land is located within or contiguous to an Indian reservation, and the acquisition is not mandated:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The existence of statutory authority for the acquisition and any limitations contained in such authority;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The need of the individual Indian or the tribe for additional land;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The purposes for which the land will be used;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the land is to be acquired for an individual Indian, the amount of trust or restricted land already owned by or for that individual and the degree to which he needs assistance in handling his affairs;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the land to be acquired is in unrestricted fee status, the impact on the State and its political subdivisions resulting from the removal of the land from the tax rolls;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Jurisdictional problems and potential conflicts of land use which may arise; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the land to be acquired is in fee status, whether the Bureau of Indian Affairs is equipped to discharge the additional responsibilities resulting from the acquisition of the land in trust status.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The extent to which the applicant has provided information that allows the Secretary to comply with 516 DM 6, appendix 4, National Environmental Policy Act Revised Implementing Procedures, and 602 DM 2, Land Acquisitions: Hazardous Substances Determinations.
