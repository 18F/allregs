                            <p class="depth0">The goal of an air conditioning test facility is to simulate the impact of an ambient heat load on the power requirements of the vehicle's air conditioning compressor while operating on a specific driving cycle. The environmental facility control elements that are discussed are ambient air temperature and humidity, minimum test cell size, solar heating, and vehicle frontal air flow.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ambient air temperature. (1) Ambient air temperature is controlled, within the test cell, during all phases of the air conditioning test sequence to 95 [2 F on average and 95 [5 F as an instantaneous measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ambient air temperature is controlled, within the test cell, during all phases of the air conditioning test sequence to 95 [2 F on average and 95 [5 F as an instantaneous measurement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Air temperature is recorded continuously at a minimum of 30 second

intervals. Records of cell air temperatures and values of average test temperatures are maintained by the manufacturer for all certification related programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ambient humidity. (1) Ambient humidity is controlled, within the test cell, during all phases of the air conditioning test sequence to an average of 100 [5 grains of water/pound of dry air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ambient humidity is controlled, within the test cell, during all phases of the air conditioning test sequence to an average of 100 [5 grains of water/pound of dry air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Humidity is recorded continuously at a minimum of 30 second intervals. Records of cell humidity and values of average test humidity are maintained by the manufacturer for all certification related programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Minimum test cell size.

The Administrator will approve frontal air flow based on ``blower in box'' technology as an acceptable simulation of environmental air flow cooling for the air conditioning compressor and engine, provided the following requirements are satisfied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum air flow nozzle discharge area must be equal or exceed the vehicle frontal inlet area. Optimum discharge area is 18 square feet (4.25x4.25), however, other sizes can be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Air flow volumes must be proportional to vehicle speed. With the above

optimum discharge size, the fan volume would vary from 0 cubic feet/minute (cfm) at 0 mph to approximately 95,000 cfm at 60 mph. If this fan is also the only source of cell air circulation or if fan operational mechanics make the 0 mph air flow requirement impractical, air flow of 2 mph or less will be allowed at 0 mph vehicle speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The fan air flow velocity vector perpendicular to the axial flow velocity vector shall be less than 10 percent of the mean velocity measured at fan speeds corresponding to vehicle speeds of 20 and 40 mph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> Fan axial air flow velocity is measured two feet from nozzle outlet at each point of a one foot grid over the entire discharge area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Fan axial air flow velocity is measured two feet from nozzle outlet at each point of a one foot grid over the entire discharge area.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The uniformity of axial flow tolerance is 20 percent of the fan speeds corresponding to vehicle speeds of 20 and 40 mph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The instrument used to verify the air velocity must have an accuracy of 2 percent of the measured air flow speed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The fan discharge nozzle must be located 2 to 3 feet from the vehicle and 0 to 6 inches above the test cell floor during air conditioning testing. This applies to non-wind tunnel environmental test cells only.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The design specifications discussed in paragraphs (e)(1) through (e)(5) of this section must be verified by the manufacturer prior to conducting certification air conditioning tests.
