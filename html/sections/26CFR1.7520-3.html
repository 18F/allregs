(See Sec. Sec. 601.201 and 601.601 of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other limitations on the application of section 7520--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ordinary beneficial interests. For purposes of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> An ordinary annuity interest is the right to receive a fixed  dollar amount at the end of each year during one or more measuring lives  or for some other defined period. A standard section 7520 annuity factor  for an ordinary annuity interest represents the present worth of the  right to receive $1.00 per year for a defined period, using the interest  rate prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month. If an  annuity interest is payable more often than annually or is payable at  the beginning of each period, a special adjustment must be made in any  computation with a standard section 7520 annuity factor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> An ordinary income interest is the right to receive the income  from, or the use of, property during one or more measuring lives or for  some other defined period. A standard section 7520 income factor for an  ordinary income interest represents the present worth of the right to  receive the use of $1.00 for a defined period, using the interest rate  prescribed under section 7520 for the appropriate month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> An ordinary remainder or reversionary interest is the right to  receive an interest in property at the end of one or more measuring  lives or some other defined period. A standard section 7520 remainder  factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary interest represents the  present worth of the right to receive $1.00 at the end of a defined  period, using the interest rate prescribed under section 7520 for the  appropriate month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain restricted beneficial interests. A restricted  beneficial interest is an annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary  interest that is subject to a contingency, power, or other restriction,  whether the restriction is provided for by the terms of the trust, will,  or other governing instrument or is caused by other circumstances. In  general, a standard section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor  may not be used to value a restricted beneficial interest. However, a  special section 7520 annuity, income, or remainder factor may be used to  value a restricted beneficial interest under some circumstances. See  paragraph (b)(4) Example 2 of this section, which illustrates a  situation where a special section 7520 actuarial factor is needed to  take into account the shorter life expectancy of the terminally ill  measuring life. See Sec. 1.7520-1(c) for requesting a special factor  from the Internal Revenue Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Other beneficial interests. If, under the provisions of this  paragraph (b), the interest rate and mortality components prescribed  under section 7520 are not applicable in determining the value of any  annuity, income, remainder, or reversionary interest, the actual fair  market value of the interest (determined without regard to section 7520)  is based on all of the facts and circumstances if and to the extent  permitted by the Internal Revenue Code provision applicable to the  property interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provisions of governing instrument and other limitations on  source of payment--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Annuities. A standard section 7520 annuity factor  may not be used to determine the present value of an annuity for a  specified term of years or the life of one or more individuals unless  the effect of the trust, will, or other governing instrument is to  ensure that the annuity will be paid for the entire defined period. In  the case of an annuity payable from a trust or other limited fund, the  annuity is not considered payable for the entire defined period if,  considering the applicable section 7520 interest rate at the valuation  date of the transfer, the annuity is expected to exhaust the fund before  the last possible annuity payment is made in full. For this purpose, it  must be assumed that it is possible for each measuring life to survive  until age 110. For example, for a fixed annuity payable annually at the  end of each year, if the amount of the annuity payment (expressed as a  percentage of the initial corpus) is less than or equal to the  applicable section 7520 interest rate at the date of the transfer, the  corpus is assumed to be sufficient to make all payments. If the  percentage exceeds the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the  annuity is for a definite term of years, multiply the annual annuity   amount by the Table B term certain annuity factor, as described in Sec.  1.7520-1(c)(1), for the number of years of the defined period. If the  percentage exceeds the applicable section 7520 interest rate and the  annuity is payable for the life of one or more individuals, multiply the  annual annuity amount by the Table B annuity factor for 110 years minus  the age of the youngest individual. If the result exceeds the limited  fund, the annuity may exhaust the fund, and it will be necessary to  calculate a special section 7520 annuity factor that takes into account  the exhaustion of the trust or fund. This computation would be modified,  if appropriate, to take into account annuities with different payment  terms. See Sec. 25.7520-3(b)(2)(v) Example 5 of this chapter, which  provides an illustration involving an annuity trust that is subject to  exhaustion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Income and similar interests--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Beneficial enjoyment. A  standard section 7520 income factor for an ordinary income interest may  not be used to determine the present value of an income or similar  interest in trust for a term of years or for the life of one or more  individuals unless the effect of the trust, will, or other governing  instrument is to provide the income beneficiary with that degree of  beneficial enjoyment of the property during the term of the income  interest that the principles of the law of trusts accord to a person who  is unqualifiedly designated as the income beneficiary of a trust for a  similar period of time. This degree of beneficial enjoyment is provided  only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the provisions  of the governing instrument and the surrounding circumstances, that the  trust provide an income interest for the income beneficiary during the  specified period of time that is consistent with the value of the trust  corpus and with its preservation. In determining whether a trust  arrangement evidences that intention, the treatment required or  permitted with respect to individual items must be considered in  relation to the entire system provided for in the administration of the  subject trust. Similarly, in determining the present value of the right  to use tangible property (whether or not in trust) for one or more  measuring lives or for some other specified period of time, the interest  rate component prescribed under section 7520 and Sec. 1.7520-1 may not  be used unless, during the specified period, the effect of the trust,  will or other governing instrument is to provide the beneficiary with  that degree of use, possession, and enjoyment of the property during the  term of interest that applicable state law accords to a person who is  unqualifiedly designated as a life tenant or term holder for a similar  period of time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Diversions of income and corpus. A standard section 7520 income  factor for an ordinary income interest may not be used to value an  income interest or similar interest in property for a term of years or  for one or more measuring lives if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The trust, will, or other governing instrument requires or  permits the beneficiary's income or other enjoyment to be withheld,  diverted, or accumulated for another person's benefit without the  consent of the income beneficiary; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The governing instrument requires or permits trust corpus to be  withdrawn from the trust for another person's benefit during the income  beneficiary's term of enjoyment without the consent of and  accountability to the income beneficiary for such diversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Remainder and reversionary interests. A standard section 7520  remainder interest factor for an ordinary remainder or reversionary  interest may not be used to determine the present value of a remainder  or reversionary interest (whether in trust or otherwise) unless,  consistent with the preservation and protection that the law of trusts  would provide for a person who is unqualifiedly designated as the  remainder beneficiary of a trust for a similar duration, the effect of  the administrative and dispositive provisions for the interest or  interests that precede the remainder or reversionary interest is to  assure that the property will be adequately preserved and protected  (e.g., from erosion, invasion, depletion, or damage) until the remainder  or reversionary interest takes effect in possession and enjoyment. This  degree of preservation and protection   is provided only if it was the transferor's intent, as manifested by the  provisions of the arrangement and the surrounding circumstances, that  the entire disposition provide the remainder or reversionary beneficiary  with an undiminished interest in the property transferred at the time of  the termination of the prior interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Pooled income fund interests. In general, pooled income funds  are created and administered to achieve a special rate of return. A  beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is not ordinarily valued  using a standard section 7520 income or remainder interest factor. The  present value of a beneficial interest in a pooled income fund is  determined according to rules and special remainder factors prescribed  in Sec. 1.642(c)-6 and, when applicable, the rules set forth in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section, if the individual who is the measuring  life is terminally ill at the time of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, an individual  who is known to have an incurable illness or other deteriorating  physical condition is considered terminally ill if there is at least a  50 percent probability that the individual will die within 1 year.  However, if the individual survives for eighteen months or longer after  the date of the transaction, that individual shall be presumed to have  not been terminally ill at the time of the transaction unless the  contrary is established by clear and convincing evidence.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (b) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Annuity funded with unproductive property. The taxpayer  transfers corporation stock worth $1,000,000 to a trust. The trust  provides for a 6 percent ($60,000 per year) annuity in cash or other  property to be paid to a charitable organization for 25 years and for  the remainder to be distributed to the donor's child. The trust  specifically authorizes, but does not require, the trustee to retain the  shares of stock. The section 7520 interest rate for the month of the  transfer is 8.2 percent. The corporation has paid no dividends on this  stock during the past 5 years, and there is no indication that this  policy will change in the near future. Under applicable state law, the  corporation is considered to be a sound investment that satisfies  fiduciary standards. Therefore, the trust's sole investment in this  corporation is not expected to adversely affect the interest of either  the annuitant or the remainder beneficiary. Considering the 6 percent  annuity payout rate and the 8.2 percent section 7520 interest rate, the  trust corpus is considered sufficient to pay this annuity for the entire  25-year term of the trust, or even indefinitely. Although it appears  that neither beneficiary would be able to compel the trustee to make the  trust corpus produce investment income, the annuity interest in this  case is considered to be an ordinary annuity interest, and the standard  section 7520 annuity factor may be used to determine the present value  of the annuity. In this case, the section 7520 annuity factor would  represent the right to receive $1.00 per year for a term of 25 years.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Terminal illness. The taxpayer transfers property worth  $1,000,000 to a charitable remainder unitrust described in section  664(d)(2) and Sec. 1.664-3. The trust provides for a fixed-percentage 7  percent unitrust benefit (each annual payment is equal to 7 percent of  the trust assets as valued at the beginning of each year) to be paid  quarterly to an individual beneficiary for life and for the remainder to  be distributed to a charitable organization. At the time the trust is  created, the individual beneficiary is age 60 and has been diagnosed  with an incurable illness and there is at least a 50 percent probability  of the individual dying within 1 year. Assuming the presumption in  paragraph (b)(3) of this section does not apply, because there is at  least a 50 percent probability that this beneficiary will die within 1  year, the standard section 7520 unitrust remainder factor for a person  age 60 from the valuation tables may not be used to determine the  present value of the charitable remainder interest. Instead, a special  unitrust remainder factor must be computed that is based on the section  7520 interest rate and that takes into account the projection of the  individual beneficiary's actual life expectancy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional limitations. Section 7520 does not apply to the  extent as may otherwise be provided by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Effective date. Section 1.7520-3(a) is effective as of May 1,  1989. The provisions of paragraph (b) of this section   are effective with respect to transactions after December 13, 1995.
