Sec. 10.8(f) and 10.9(e), if they do not change the number or cultural affiliation of the cultural items listed in the previous notice.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A museum or Federal agency that receives a new holding or collection for which a summary or inventory was previously prepared, as required by Sec. Sec. 10.8 or 10.9, may rely upon the previously prepared documents.

Any museum that has made a good faith effort to complete its inventory, but which will be unable to complete the process by this deadline, may request an extension of the time requirements under Sec. 10.9(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The list of Indian Entities Recognized and Eligible to Receive Services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs is published in the Federal Register as required by section 104 of the Federally Recognized Indian Tribe List Act of 1994 (25 U.S.C. 479a-1 (2006)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> New Federal funds.
