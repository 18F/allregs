Packer shall be run on the tubing and set inside the  casing within 75 feet of the top of the injection interval. For existing  Class II, wells, injection shall be through adequate tubing and packer,  or according to alternative operating requirements approved by the  Regional Administrator, as necessary to prevent the movement of fluid  into a USDW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> (1) and  (2) of this section must be met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is no significant leak in the casing, tubing or packer.  This may be shown by the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Performance of a pressure test of the casing/tubing annulus to  at least 200 psi, or the pressure specified by the Regional  Administrator, to be repeated thereafter, at five year intervals, for  the life of the well (Pressure tests conducted during well operation  shall maintain an injection/annulus pressure differential of at least  100 psi throughout the tubing length); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Maintaining a positive gauge pressure on the casing/tubing  annulus (filled with liquid) and monitoring the pressure monthly and  reporting of the pressure information annually; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Radioactive tracer survey; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For enhanced recovery wells, record of monitoring showing the  absence of significant changes in the relationship between injection  pressure and injection flow rate at the wellhead, following an initial  pressure test as described by paragraph (b)(1) (i) or (v) of this  section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Testing or monitoring programs approved by the Administrator on  a case-by-case basis, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is no significant fluid movement into a USDW through  vertical channels adjacent to the well bore. This may be shown by any of  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cementing records (need not be reviewed every five years);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Tracer survey (in appropriate hydrogelogic settings; must be  used in conjunction with at least one of the other alternatives);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Temperature log;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Noise log; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other tests deemed acceptable by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Injection pressure at the wellhead shall be limited so that it  does not initiate new fractures or propagate existing fractures in the  confining zone adjacent to any UDSW.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Injection wells or projects which have exhibited failure to  confine injected fluids to the authorized injection zone or zones may be  subject to restriction of injected volume and pressure or shut-in, until  the failure has been identified and corrected.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Operation shall not commence until proof has been submitted to  the Regional Administrator, or an EPA representative has witnessed that  any corrective action specified in the permit has been completed.</p>
