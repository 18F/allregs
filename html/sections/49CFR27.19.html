                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Recipients subject to this part (whether public or private  entities as defined in 49 CFR part 37) shall comply with all applicable  requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990 (42  U.S.C. 12101-12213) including the Department's ADA regulations (49 CFR  parts 37 and 38), the regulations of the Department of Justice  implementing titles II and III of the ADA (28 CFR parts 35 and 36), and  the regulations of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)  implementing title I of the ADA (29 CFR part 1630). Compliance with the  EEOC title I regulations is required as a condition of compliance with  section 504 for DOT recipients even for organizations which, because  they have fewer than 25 or 15 employees, would not be subject to the  EEOC regulation in its own right. Compliance with all these regulations  is a condition of receiving Federal financial assistance from the  Department of Transportation. Any recipient not in compliance with this  requirement shall be subject to enforcement action under subpart C of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Consistent with FTA policy, any recipient of Federal financial  assistance from the Federal Transit Administration whose solicitation  was made before August 26, 1990, and is for one or more inaccessible  vehicles, shall provide written notice to the Secretary (e.g., in the  case of a solicitation made in the past under which the recipient can  order additional new buses after the effective date of this section).  The Secretary shall review each case individually, and determine whether  the Department will continue to participate in the Federal grant,  consistent with the provisions in the grant agreement between the  Department and the recipient.
