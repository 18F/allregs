                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. The contract type risk factor focuses on the degree of cost risk accepted by the contractor under varying contract types. The working capital adjustment is an adjustment added to the profit objective for contract type risk. It only applies to fixed-price contracts that provide for progress payments. Though it uses a formula approach, it is not intended to be an exact calculation of the cost of working capital. Its purpose is to give general recognition to the contractor's cost of working capital under varying contract circumstances, financing policies, and the economic environment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination. The following extract from the DD 1547 is annotated to explain the process.
