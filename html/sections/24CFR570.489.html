Any state whose matching cost contributions toward state administrative expense matching requirements are in arrears must bring matching cost contributions up to the level of CDBG funds expended for such costs. A state grant may not be closed out if the state's matching cost contribution is not at least equal to the amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 expended for administration. Funds from any year's grant may be used to pay administrative costs associated with any other year's grant. The two approaches for demonstrating compliance with this paragraph (a)(1) of this section are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Cumulative accounting of administrative costs incurred by the state since its

assumption of the CDBG program. Under this approach, the state will identify, for each grant it has received, the CDBG funds eligible to be used for state administrative expenses, as well as the minimum amount of matching funds that the state is required to contribute. The amounts will then be aggregated for all grants received. The state must keep records demonstrating the actual amount of CDBG funds from each grant received that were used for state administrative expenses, as well as matching amounts that were contributed by the state. The state will be considered to be in compliance with the applicable requirements if the aggregate of the actual amounts of CDBG funds spent on state administrative expenses does not exceed the aggregate maximum allowable amount and if the aggregate amount of matching funds that the state has expended is equal to or greater than the aggregate amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 (for each annual grant within the subject period) spent on administrative expenses during its 3- to 5-year Consolidated Planning period. If the state grant for any grant year within the 3- to 5-year period has been closed out, the aggregate amount of CDBG funds spent on state administrative expenses, the aggregate maximum allowable amount, the aggregate matching funds expended, and the aggregate amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 (for each annual grant within the subject period) will be reduced by amounts attributable to the grant year for which the state grant has been closed out.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Year-to-year tracking and limitation on drawdown of funds. For each grant year, the state will calculate the maximum allowable amount of CDBG funds that may be used for state administrative expenses, and will draw down amounts of those funds only upon its own expenditure of an equal or greater amount of matching funds from its own resources after the expenditure of the initial $100,000 for state administrative expenses. The state will be considered to be in compliance with the applicable requirements if the actual amount of CDBG funds spent on state administrative expenses does not exceed the maximum allowable amount, and if the amount of matching funds that the state has expended for that grant year is equal to or greater than the amount of CDBG funds in excess of $100,000 spent during that same grant year. Under this approach, the state must demonstrate that it has paid from its own funds at least 50 percent of its administrative expenses in excess of $100,000 by the end of each grant year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The state may not charge fees of any entity for processing or considering any application for CDBG fund, or for carrying out its responsibilities under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The state and its funded units of general local government shall not expend for planning, management and administrative costs more than 20 percent of the aggregate amount of the annual grant, plus program income and funds reallocated by HUD to the State which are distributed during the time the final Statement for the annual grant is in effect. Administrative costs are those described at Sec.  570.489(a)(1) for states, and for units of general local government those described at sections 105(a)(12) and (a)(13) of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reimbursement of pre-agreement costs. The state may permit, in accordance with such procedures as the state may establish, a unit of general local government to incur costs for CDBG activities before the establishment of a formal grant relationship between the state and the unit of general local government and to charge these pre-agreement costs to the grant, provided that the activities are eligible and undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this part and 24 CFR part 58. A state may incur costs prior to entering into a grant agreement with HUD and charge those pre-agreement costs to the grant, provided that the activities are eligible and are undertaken in accordance with the requirements of this part, part 58 of this title, and the citizen participation requirements of part 91 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federal grant payments. The state's requests for payment, and the Federal Government's payments upon such requests, must comply with 31 CFR part 205. The state must use procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of grant funds and disbursement of funds by the state to

units of general local government. States must also have procedures in place, and units of general local government must use these procedures to minimize the time elapsing between the transfer of funds by the state and disbursement for CDBG activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Fiscal controls and accounting procedures.

(1) For the purposes of this subpart, ``program income'' is defined as gross income received by a state, a unit of general local government, or a subgrantee of the unit of general local government that was generated from the use of CDBG funds, regardless of when the CDBG funds were appropriated and whether the activity has been closed out, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. When income is generated by an activity that is only partially assisted with CDBG funds, the income must be prorated to reflect the percentage of CDBG funds used (e.g., a single loan supported by CDBG funds and other funds; or a single parcel of land purchased with CDBG funds and other funds). Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> For the purposes of this subpart, ``program income'' is defined as gross income received by a state, a unit of general local government, or a subgrantee of the unit of general local government that was generated from the use of CDBG funds, regardless of when the CDBG funds were appropriated and whether the activity has been closed out, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section. When income is generated by an activity that is only partially assisted with CDBG funds, the income must be prorated to reflect the percentage of CDBG funds used (e.g., a single loan supported by CDBG funds and other funds; or a single parcel of land purchased with CDBG funds and other funds). Program income includes, but is not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Proceeds from the disposition by sale or long-term lease of real property purchased or improved with CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(v) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proceeds from the disposition of equipment purchased with CDBG funds;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gross income from the use or rental of real or personal property acquired by the unit of general local government or subgrantee of the unit of general local government with CDBG funds, less the costs incidental to the generation of the income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Gross income from the use or rental of real property, owned by the unit of general local government or other entity carrying out a CDBG activity that was constructed or improved with CDBG funds, less the costs incidental to the generation of the income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Payments of principal and interest on loans made using CDBG funds, except as provided in paragraph (e)(2)(iii) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Proceeds from the sale of loans made with CDBG funds, less reasonable legal and other costs incurred in the course of such sale that are not otherwise eligible costs under sections 105(a)(13) or 106(d)(3)(A) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Proceeds from the sale of obligations secured by loans made with CDBG funds, less reasonable legal and other costs incurred in the course of such sale that are not otherwise eligible costs under sections 105(a)(13) or 106(d)(3)(A) of the Act;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Interest earned on funds held in a revolving fund account;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Interest earned on program income pending disposition of the income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Funds collected through special assessments made against nonresidential properties and properties owned and occupied by households not of low and moderate income, if the special assessments are used to recover all or part of the CDBG portion of a public improvement;

and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Interest income received by units of general local government on deposits of grant funds before disbursement of the funds for activities, except that the unit of general local government may keep interest payments of up to $100 per year for administrative expenses otherwise permitted to be paid with CDBG funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Proceeds from the sale of real property purchased or improved with CDBG funds, if the proceeds are received more than 5 years after expiration of the grant agreement between the state and the unit of general local government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The state may permit the unit of general local government which receives or will receive program income to retain the program income, subject to the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, or the state may require the unit of general local government to pay the program income to the state. The state, however, must permit the unit of general local government to retain the program income if the program income will be used to continue the activity from which the program income was derived. The state will determine when an activity will be considered to be continued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Program income paid to the state. Except as described in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, the state may require the unit of general local government that receives or will receive program income to return the program income to the state. Program income that is paid to the state is treated as additional CDBG funds subject to the requirements of this subpart. Except for program income retained and used by the state for administrative costs or technical assistance under paragraph (a) of this section, program income paid to the state must be distributed to units of general local government in accordance with the method of distribution in the action plan under Sec.  91.320(k)(1)(i) of this title that is in effect at the time the program income is distributed. To the maximum extent feasible, the state

must distribute program income before it makes additional withdrawals from the Department of the Treasury, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Program income retained by a unit of general local government. A state may permit a unit of general local government that receives or will receive program income to retain the program income. Alternatively, subject to the exception in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section, a state may require that the unit of general local government pay any such income to the state.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A state must permit the unit of general local government to retain the program income if the program income will be used to continue the activity from which it was derived. A state will determine when an activity will be considered to be continued, and HUD will give maximum feasible deference to a state's determination, in accordance with Sec.  570.480(c). In making such a determination, a state may consider whether the unit of general local government is or will be unable to comply with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(B) of this section or other requirements of this part, and the extent to which the program income is unlikely to be applied to continue the activity within the reasonably near future. When a state determines that the program income will be applied to continue the activity from which it was derived, but that the amount of program income held by the unit of general local government exceeds projected cash needs for the reasonably near future, the state may require the local government to return all or part of the program income to the state until such time as the program income is needed by the unit of general local government. When a state determines that a unit of local government is not likely to apply any significant amount of program income to continue the activity within a reasonable amount of time, or that it will not likely apply the program income in accordance with applicable requirements, the state may require the unit of general local government to return all of the program income to the state for disbursement to other units of local government. A state that intends to require units of general local government to return program income in accordance with this paragraph (e)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must describe its approach in the state's action plan required under Sec.  91.320 of this title or in a substantial amendment if the state intends to implement this option after the action plan is submitted to and approved by HUD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Program income that is received and retained by the unit of general local government is treated as additional CDBG funds and is subject to all applicable requirements of this subpart, regardless of whether the activity that generated the program income has been closed out. If the grant that generated the program income is still open when the program income is generated, program income permitted to be retained will be considered part of the unit of general local government's grant that generated the program income. If the grant is closed, program income permitted to be retained will be considered to be part of the unit of general local government's most recently awarded open grant. If the unit of general local government has no open grants, the program income retained by the unit of general local government will be counted as part of the state's grant year in which the program income was generated. A state must employ one or more of the following methods to ensure that units of general local government comply with applicable program income requirements:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintaining contractual relationships with units of general local government for the duration of the existence of the program income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Closing out the underlying activity, but requiring as a condition of closeout that the unit of general local government obtain advance state approval of either a unit of general local government's plan for the use of program income, or of each use of program income by grant recipients via regularly occurring reports and requests for approval;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Closing out the underlying activity, but requiring as a condition of closeout that the unit of general local government notify the state when new program income is received; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> With prior HUD approval, other approaches that demonstrate that the state will ensure compliance with the requirements of this subpart by units of general local government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The state must require units of general local government, to the maximum extent feasible, to disburse program income that is subject to the requirements of this subpart before requesting additional funds from the state for activities, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Transfer of program income to Entitlement program. A unit of general local government that becomes eligible to be an Entitlement grantee may request the state's approval to transfer State CDBG grant-generated program income to the unit of general local government's Entitlement program. A state may approve the transfer, provided that the unit of general local government:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Has officially elected to participate in the Entitlement grant program;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Agrees to use such program income in accordance with Entitlement program requirements; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Has set up Integrated Disbursement Information System (IDIS) access and agrees to enter receipt of program income into IDIS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transfer of program income of grantees losing Entitlement status. Upon entry into the State CDBG program, a unit of general local government that has lost or relinquished its Entitlement status must, with respect to program income that a unit of general local government would otherwise be permitted to retain, either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Retain program income generated under Entitlement grants and continue to comply with Entitlement program requirements for program income; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Retain the program income and transfer it to the State CDBG program, in which case the unit of general local government must comply with the state's rules for program income and the requirements of this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The state must report on the receipt and use of all program income (whether retained by units of general local government or paid to the state) in its annual performance and evaluation report.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Revolving funds. (1) The state may permit units of general local government to establish revolving funds to carry out specific, identified activities. A revolving fund, for this purpose, is a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established to carry out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out such activities. These payments to the revolving fund are program income and must be substantially disbursed from the revolving fund before additional grant funds are drawn from the Treasury for revolving fund activities. Such program income is not required to be disbursed for non-revolving fund activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The state may permit units of general local government to establish revolving funds to carry out specific, identified activities. A revolving fund, for this purpose, is a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established to carry out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for use in carrying out such activities. These payments to the revolving fund are program income and must be substantially disbursed from the revolving fund before additional grant funds are drawn from the Treasury for revolving fund activities. Such program income is not required to be disbursed for non-revolving fund activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The state may establish one or more state revolving funds to distribute grants to units of general local government throughout a state or a region of the state to carry out specific, identified activities. A revolving fund, for this purpose, is a separate fund (with a set of accounts that are independent of other program accounts) established to fund grants to units of general local government to carry out specific activities which, in turn, generate payments to the fund for additional grants to units of general local government to carry out such activities. Program income in the revolving fund must be disbursed from the fund before additional grant funds are drawn from the Treasury for payments to units of general local government which could be funded from the revolving fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A revolving fund established by either the State or unit of general local government shall not be directly funded or capitalized with grant funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Procurement. When procuring property or services to be paid for in whole or in part with CDBG funds, the state shall follow its procurement policies and procedures. The state shall establish requirements for procurement policies and procedures for units of general local government, based on full and open competition. Methods of procurement (e.g., small purchase, sealed bids/formal advertising, competitive proposals, and noncompetitive proposals) and their applicability shall be

specified by the state. Cost plus a percentage of cost and percentage of construction costs methods of contracting shall not be used. The policies and procedures shall also include standards of conduct governing employees engaged in the award or administration of contracts. (Other conflicts of interest are covered by Sec.  570.489(h).) The state shall ensure that all purchase orders and contracts include any clauses required by Federal statutes, executive orders and implementing regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Conflict of interest--(1) Applicability. (i) In the procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services by the States, units of local general governments, and subrecipients, the conflict of interest provisions in paragraph (g) of this section shall apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Applicability.

Such cases include the acquisition and disposition of real property and the provision of assistance with CDBG funds by the unit of general local government or its subrecipients, to individuals, businesses and other private entities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Conflicts prohibited. Except for eligible administrative or personnel costs, the general rule is that no persons described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section who exercise or have exercised any functions or responsibilities with respect to CDBG activities assisted under this subpart or who are in a position to participate in a decisionmaking process or gain inside information with regard to such activities, may obtain a financial interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest or benefit from the activity, or have an interest in any contract, subcontract or agreement with respect thereto, or the proceeds thereunder, either for themselves or those with whom they have family or business ties, during their tenure or for one year thereafter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Persons covered. The conflict of interest provisions for paragraph (h)(2) of this section apply to any person who is an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the state, or of a unit of general local government, or of any designated public agencies, or subrecipients which are receiving CDBG funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exceptions: Thresholds requirements. Upon written request by the State, an exception to the provisions of paragraph (h)(2) of this section involving an employee, agent, consultant, officer, or elected official or appointed official of the state may be granted by HUD on a case-by-case basis. In all other cases, the state may grant such an exception upon written request of the unit of general local government provided the state shall fully document its determination in compliance with all requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section including the state's position with respect to each factor at paragraph (h)(5) of this section and such documentation shall be available for review by the public and by HUD. An exception may be granted after it is determined that such an exception will serve to further the purpose of the Act and the effective and efficient administration of the program or project of the state or unit of general local government as appropriate. An exception may be considered only after the state or unit of general local government, as appropriate, has provided the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A disclosure of the nature of the conflict, accompanied by an assurance that there has been public disclosure of the conflict and a description of how the public disclosure was made; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An opinion of the attorney for the state or the unit of general local government, as appropriate, that the interest for which the exception is sought would not violate state or local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Factors to be considered for exceptions. In determining whether to grant a requested exception after the requirements of paragraph (h)(4) of this section have been satisfactorily met, the cumulative effect of the following factors, where applicable, shall be considered:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Whether the exception would provide a significant cost benefit or an essential degree of expertise to the program or project which would otherwise not be available;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether an opportunity was provided for open competitive bidding or negotiation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the person affected is a member of a group or class of low or moderate income persons intended to be the beneficiaries of the assisted activity, and the exception will permit such person to receive generally the same interests or benefits as are being made available or provided to the group or class;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Whether the affected person has withdrawn from his or her functions or responsibilities, or the decisionmaking process with respect to the specific assisted activity in question;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Whether the interest or benefit was present before the affected person was in a position as described in paragraph (h)(3) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Whether undue hardship will result either to the State or the unit of general local government or the person affected when weighed against the public interest served by avoiding the prohibited conflict; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Any other relevant considerations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Closeout of grants to units of general local government. The State shall establish requirements for timely closeout of grants to units of general local government and shall take action to ensure the timely closeout of such grants.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Change of use of real property. The standards described in this section apply to real property within the unit of general local government's control (including activities undertaken by subrecipients) which was acquired or improved in whole or in part using CDBG funds in excess of the threshold for small purchase procurement (24 CFR 85.36, ``Administrative Requirements for Grants and Cooperative Agreements to State, Local and Federally Recognized Indian Tribal Governments''). These standards shall apply from the date CDBG funds are first spent for the property until five years after closeout of the unit of general local government's grant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A unit of general local governments may not change the use or planned use of any such property (including the beneficiaries of such use) from that for which the acquisition or improvement was made, unless the unit of general local government provides affected citizens with reasonable notice of and opportunity to comment on any proposed change, and either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The new use of the property qualifies as meeting one of the national objectives and is not a building for the general conduct of government; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirements in paragraph (j)(2) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the unit of general local government determines, after consultation with affected citizens, that it is appropriate to change the use of the property to a use which does not qualify under paragraph (j)(1) of this section, it may retain or dispose of the property for the changed use if the unit of general local government's CDBG program is reimbursed or the state's CDBG program is reimbursed, at the discretion of the state. The reimbursement shall be in the amount of the current fair market value of the property, less any portion of the value attributable to expenditures of non-CDBG funds for acquisition of, and improvements to, the property, except that if the change in use occurs after grant closeout but within 5 years of such closeout, the unit of general local government shall make the reimbursement to the State's CDBG program account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Following the reimbursement of the CDBG program in accordance with paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the property no longer will be subject to any CDBG requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Accountability for real and personal property. The State shall establish and implement requirements, consistent with State law and the purposes and requirements of this subpart (including paragraph (j) of this section) governing the use, management, and disposition of real and personal property acquired with CDBG funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Debarment and suspension. The requirements in 2 CFR part 2424 are applicable. CDBG funds may not be provided to excluded or disqualified persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Audits. Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, audits of a state and units of general local government shall be conducted in accordance with Sec.  85.26 of this title, which implements the Single Audit Act (31 U.S.C. 7501-07) and incorporates OMB Circular A-133. States shall develop and administer an audits management system to

ensure that audits of units of general local government are conducted in accordance with OMB Circular A-133, if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Cost principles and prior approval. (1) A state must ensure that costs incurred by the state and by its recipients are in conformance with the following cost principles, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A state must ensure that costs incurred by the state and by its recipients are in conformance with the following cost principles, as applicable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> ``Cost Principles for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments (OMB Circular A-87),'' which is codified at 2 CFR part 225;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> ``Cost Principles for Non-Profit Organizations (OMB Circular A-122),'' which is codified at 2 CFR part 230; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``Cost Principles for Educational Institutions (OMB Circular A-21),'' which is codified at 2 CFR part 220.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All cost items described in Appendix B of 2 CFR part 225 that require federal agency approval are allowable without prior approval of HUD, to the extent that they otherwise comply with the requirements of 2 CFR part 225 and are otherwise eligible under this subpart I, except for the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Depreciation methods for fixed assets shall not be changed without the express approval of HUD or, if charged through a cost allocation plan, of the cognizant federal agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fines and penalties (including punitive damages) are unallowable costs to the CDBG program.
