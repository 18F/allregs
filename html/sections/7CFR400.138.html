                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A debt will be collected by deductions at officially- established pay intervals from an employee's current pay account, unless  the employee and the hearing official agree to alternative arrangements  for repayment under Sec. 400.135.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Installment deductions. Installment deductions will be made over  a period not greater than the anticipated period of employment. The size  and frequency of the installment deductions will bear a reasonable  relation to the size of the debt and the employee's ability to pay. If  possible, the installment payment will be sufficient in size and  frequency to liquidate the debt in no more than three years. Installment  payments of less than $25.00 per pay period, or $50.00 per month, will  be accepted only in the most unusual circumstances.  [53 FR 5, Jan. 4, 1988]</p>
