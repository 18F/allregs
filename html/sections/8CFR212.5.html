                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The authority of the Secretary to continue an alien in custody or grant parole under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act shall be exercised by the Assistant Commissioner, Office of Field Operations; Director, Detention and Removal; directors of field operations; port directors; special agents in charge; deputy special agents in charge; associate special agents in charge; assistant special agents in charge; resident agents in charge; field office directors; deputy field office directors; chief patrol agents; district directors for services; and those other officials as may be designated in writing, subject to the parole and detention authority of the Secretary or his designees. The Secretary or his designees may invoke, in the exercise of discretion, the authority under section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The parole of aliens within the following groups who have been or are detained in accordance with Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter would generally be justified only on a case-by-case basis for ``urgent humanitarian reasons'' or ``significant public benefit,'' provided the aliens present neither a security risk nor a risk of absconding:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Aliens who have serious medical conditions in which continued detention would not be appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Women who have been medically certified as pregnant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aliens who are defined as juveniles in Sec. 236.3(a) of this chapter. The Director, Detention and Removal; directors of field operations; field office directors; deputy field office directors; or chief patrol agents shall follow the guidelines set forth in Sec. 236.3(a) of this chapter and paragraphs (b)(3)(i) through (iii) of this section in determining under what conditions a juvenile should be paroled from detention:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Juveniles may be released to a relative (brother, sister, aunt, uncle, or grandparent) not in Service detention who is willing to sponsor a minor and the minor may be released to that relative notwithstanding that the juvenile has a relative who is in detention.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a relative who is not in detention cannot be located to sponsor the minor, the minor may be released with an accompanying relative who is in detention.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the Service cannot locate a relative in or out of detention to sponsor the minor, but the minor has identified a non-relative in detention who accompanied him or her on arrival, the question of releasing the minor and the accompanying non-relative adult shall be addressed on a case-by-case basis;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Aliens who will be witnesses in proceedings being, or to be, conducted by judicial, administrative, or legislative bodies in the United States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Aliens whose continued detention is not in the public interest as determined by those officials identified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the case of all other arriving aliens, except those detained under Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter and paragraph (b) of this section, those officials listed in paragraph (a) of this section may, after review of the individual case, parole into the United States temporarily in accordance with section 212(d)(5)(A) of the Act, any alien applicant for admission, under such terms and conditions, including those set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, as he or she may deem appropriate. An alien who arrives at a port-of-entry and applies for parole into the United States for the sole purpose of seeking adjustment of status under section 245A of the Act, without benefit of advance authorization as described in paragraph (f) of this section shall be denied parole and detained for removal in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter. An alien seeking to enter the United States for the sole purpose of applying for adjustment of status under section 210 of the Act shall be denied parole and detained for removal under Sec. 235.3(b) or (c) of this chapter, unless the alien has been recommended for approval of such application for adjustment by a consular officer at an Overseas Processing Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions. In any case where an alien is paroled under paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, those officials listed in paragraph (a) of this section may require reasonable assurances that the alien will appear at all hearings and/or depart the United States when required to do so. Not all factors listed need be present for parole to be exercised. Those officials should apply reasonable discretion. The consideration of all relevant factors includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The giving of an undertaking by the applicant, counsel, or a sponsor to ensure appearances or departure, and a bond may be required on Form I-352 in such amount as may be deemed appropriate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Community ties such as close relatives with known addresses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Agreement to reasonable conditions (such as periodic reporting of whereabouts).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Termination of parole--(1) Automatic. Parole shall be automatically terminated without written notice (i) upon the departure from the United States of the alien, or, (ii) if not departed, at the expiration of the time for which parole was authorized, and in the latter case the alien shall be processed in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section except that no written notice shall be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic. Parole shall be automatically terminated without written notice (i) upon the departure from the United States of the alien, or, (ii) if not departed, at the expiration of the time for which parole was authorized, and in the latter case the alien shall be processed in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section except that no written notice shall be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> On notice. In cases not covered by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, upon accomplishment of the purpose for which parole was authorized or when in the opinion of one of the officials listed in paragraph (a) of this section, neither humanitarian reasons nor public benefit warrants the continued presence of the alien in the United States, parole shall be terminated upon written notice to the alien and he or she shall be restored to the status that he or she had at the time of parole. When a charging document is served on the alien, the charging document will constitute written notice of termination of parole, unless otherwise specified. Any further inspection or hearing shall be conducted under section 235 or 240 of the Act and this chapter, or any order of exclusion, deportation, or removal previously entered shall be executed. If the exclusion, deportation, or removal order cannot be executed within a reasonable time, the alien shall again be released on parole unless in the opinion of the official listed in paragraph (a) of this section the public interest requires that the alien be continued in custody.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> On notice.

Failure to abide by this provision through making such an application will subject the alien to termination of parole status and institution of proceedings under sections 235 and 236 of the Act without the written

notice of termination required by Sec. 212.5(e)(2)(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Any alien granted parole into the United States so that he or she may transit through the United States in the course of removal from Canada shall have his or her parole status terminated upon notice, as specified in 8 CFR 212.5(e)(2)(i), if he or she makes known to an immigration officer of the United States a fear of persecution or an intention to apply for asylum. Upon termination of parole, any such alien shall be regarded as an arriving alien, and processed accordingly by the Department of Homeland Security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Advance authorization.
