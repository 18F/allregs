                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Appraisal of certain seized property. If the appropriate TTB  officer determines that any property seized by levy is liable to perish  or become greatly reduced in price or value by keeping, or that such  property cannot be kept without great expense, the appropriate TTB  officer shall appraise the value of such property and return it to the  owner if the owner complies with the conditions prescribed in paragraph  (b) of this section or, if the owner does not comply with such  conditions, dispose of the property in accordance with paragraph (c) of  this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Return to owner. If the owner of the property can be readily  found, the appropriate TTB officer shall give the owner written notice  of the appropriate TTB officer's determination of the appraised value of  the property. However, if the appropriate TTB officer determines that  the circumstances require immediate action, the appropriate TTB officer  may give the owner an oral notice of the determination of the appraised  value of the property, which notice shall be confirmed in writing prior  to sale. The property shall be returned to the owner if, within the time  specified in the notice, the owner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pays to the appropriate TTB officer an amount equal to the  appraised value, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Gives an acceptable bond as prescribed by 26 U.S.C. 7101 and  Sec. 70.281 of this part. Such bond shall be in an amount not less than  the appraised value of the property and shall be conditioned upon the  payment of such amount at such time as the appropriate TTB officer  determines to be appropriate in the circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Immediate sale. If the owner does not pay the amount of the  appraised value of the seized property within the time specified in the  notice, or furnish bond as provided in paragraph (b) of this section  within such time, the appropriate TTB officer shall as soon as  practicable make public sale of the property in accordance with the  following terms and conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice of sale. If the owner can readily be found, a notice  shall be given to the owner. A notice of sale also shall be posted in  two public places in the county which the property is to be sold. The  notice shall specify the time and place of sale, the property to be  sold, and the manner and conditions of sale. The appropriate TTB officer  may give such other notice and in such other manner as the appropriate  TTB officer deems advisable under the circumstances.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Sale. The property shall be sold at public auction to the higher  bidder.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Terms. The purchase price shall be paid in full upon acceptance  of the highest bid. The payment shall be made by cash, or by a  certified, cashier's or treasurer's check drawn on any bank or trust  company incorporated   under the laws of the United States or under the laws of any State,  Territory, or possession of the United States, or by a U.S. postal,  bank, express, or telegraph money order.
