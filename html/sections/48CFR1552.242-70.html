EPA's procedures require a Contracting  Officer determination of indirect cost rates for its contracts. In those  cases where EPA is the cognizant agency (see FAR 42.705-1), the final  rate proposal shall be submitted to the cognizant audit activity and to  the following designated Contracting Officer: Environmental Protection  Agency, Chief, Cost Policy and Rate Negotiation Branch (3804F), Cost  Advisory and Financial Analysis Division, Washington, DC 20460.  Where EPA is not the cognizant agency, the final rate proposal shall be  submitted to the above-cited address, to the cognizant audit agency, and  to the designated Contracting Officer of the cognizant agency. Upon  establishment of the final indirect cost rates, the Contractor shall  submit an executed Certificate of Current Cost or Pricing Data (see FAR  15.406-2) applicable to the data furnished in connection with the final  rates to the cognizant audit agency. The final rates shall be contained  in a written understanding between the Contractor and the appropriate  Government representative. Pursuant to the ``Allowable Cost and  Payment'' clause, the allowable indirect costs under this contract shall  be obtained by applying the final agreed upon rate(s) to the appropriate  bases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Until final annual indirect cost rates are established for any  period, the Government shall reimburse the contractor at billing rates  established by the appropriate Government representative in accordance  with FAR 42.704, subject to adjustment when the final rates are  established.
