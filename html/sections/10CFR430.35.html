                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any person may petition the Secretary for an exemption for a  type of general service lamp from the requirements of this subpart. The  Secretary may grant an exemption only to the extent that the Secretary  finds, after a hearing and opportunity for public comment, that it is  not technically feasible to serve a specialized lighting application  (such as a military, medical, public safety or certified historic  lighting application) using a lamp that meets the requirements of this  subpart. To grant an exemption for a product under this paragraph, the  Secretary shall include, as an additional criterion, that the exempted  product is unlikely to be used in a general service lighting  application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Any person may petition the Secretary to establish standards for  lamp shapes or bases that are excluded from the definition of general  service lamps. The petition shall include evidence that the availability  or sales of exempted lamps have increased significantly since December  19, 2007. The Secretary shall grant a petition if the Secretary finds  that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The petition presents evidence that demonstrates that commercial  availability or sales of exempted incandescent lamp types have increased  significantly since December 19, 2007 and are being widely used in  general lighting applications; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Significant energy savings could be achieved by covering  exempted products, as determined by the Secretary based on sales data  provided to the Secretary from manufacturers and importers.

Objectives</p><p class="depth0">This appendix establishes procedures, interpretations and policies  to guide the DOE in the consideration and promulgation of new or revised  appliance efficiency standards under the Energy Policy and Conservation  Act (EPCA). The Department's objectives in establishing these guidelines  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Provide for early input from stakeholders. The Department seeks  to provide opportunities for public input early in the rulemaking  process so that the initiation and direction of rulemakings is informed  by comment from interested parties. Under the guidelines   established by this appendix, DOE will seek early input from interested  parties in setting rulemaking priorities and structuring the analyses  for particular products. Interested parties will be invited to provide  input for the selection of design options and will help DOE identify  analysis, data, and modeling needs. DOE will gather input from  interested parties through a variety of mechanisms, including public  workshops.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Increase predictability of the rulemaking timetable. The  Department seeks to make informed, strategic decisions about how to  deploy its resources on the range of possible standards development  activities, and to announce these prioritization decisions so that all  interested parties have a common expectation about the timing of  different rulemaking activities. The guidelines in this appendix provide  for setting priorities and timetables for standards development and test  procedure modification and reflect these priorities in the Regulatory  Agenda.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Increase use of outside technical expertise. The Department  seeks to expand its use of outside technical experts in evaluating  product-specific engineering issues to ensure that decisions on  technical issues are fully informed. The guidelines in this appendix  provide for increased use of outside technical experts in developing,  performing and reviewing the analyses. Draft analytical results will be  distributed for peer and stakeholder review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Eliminate problematic design options early in the process. The  Department seeks to eliminate from consideration, early in the process,  any design options that present unacceptable problems with respect to  manufacturability, consumer utility, or safety, so that the detailed  analysis can focus only on viable design options. Under the guidelines  in this appendix, DOE will eliminate from consideration design options  if it concludes that manufacture, installation or service of the design  will be impractical, or that the design option will adversely affect the  utility of the product, or if the design has adverse safety or health  impacts. This screening will be done at the outset of a rulemaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Fully consider non-regulatory approaches. The Department seeks  to understand the effects of market forces and voluntary programs on  encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products so that the  incremental impacts of a new or revised standard can be accurately  assessed and the Department can make informed decisions about where  standards and voluntary ``market pull'' programs can be used most  effectively. Under the guidelines in this appendix, DOE will solicit  information on the effectiveness of market forces and non-regulatory  approaches for encouraging the purchase of energy efficient products,  and will carefully consider this information in assessing the benefits  of standards. In addition, DOE will continue to support voluntary  efforts by manufacturers, retailers, utilities and others to increase  product efficiency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Conduct thorough analysis of impacts. In addition to  understanding the aggregate costs and benefits of standards, the  Department seeks to understand the distribution of those costs and  benefits among consumers, manufacturers and others, and the uncertainty  associated with these analyses of costs and benefits, so that any  adverse impacts on significant subgroups and uncertainty concerning any  adverse impacts can be fully considered in selecting a standard. Under  the guidelines in this appendix, the analyses will consider the  variability of impacts on significant groups of manufacturers and  consumers in addition to aggregate costs and benefits, report the range  of uncertainty associated with these impacts, and take into account  cumulative impacts of regulation on manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Use transparent and robust analytical methods. The Department  seeks to use qualitative and quantitative analytical methods that are  fully documented for the public and that produce results that can be  explained and reproduced, so that the analytical underpinnings for  policy decisions on standards are as sound and well-accepted as  possible. Under the guidelines in this appendix, DOE will solicit input  from interested parties in identifying analysis, data, and modeling  needs with respect to measurement of impacts on manufacturers and  consumers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Articulate policies to guide selection of standards. The  Department seeks to adopt policies elaborating on the statutory criteria  for selecting standards, so that interested parties are aware of the  policies that will guide these decisions. Under the guidelines in this  appendix, policies for screening design options, selecting candidate  standard levels, selecting a proposed standard level, and establishing  the final standard are established.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Support efforts to build consensus on standards. The Department  seeks to encourage development of consensus proposals for new or revised  standards because standards with such broad-based support are likely to  balance effectively the economic, energy, and environmental interests  affected by standards. Under the guidelines in this appendix, DOE will  support the development and submission of consensus recommendations for  standards by representative groups of interested parties to the fullest  extent possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Reduce time and cost of developing standards. The Department  seeks to establish a clear protocol for initiating and conducting  standards rulemakings in order to eliminate time-consuming and costly  missteps. Under the guidelines in this appendix, increased   and earlier involvement by interested parties and increased use of  technical experts should minimize the need for re-analysis. This process  should reduce the period between the publication of an Advance Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking (ANOPR) and the publication of a final rule to not  more than 18 months, and should decrease the government and private  sector resources required to complete the standard development process.</p><p class="depth0">2. Scope</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The procedures, interpretations and policies described in this  appendix will be fully applicable to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy  conservation standards for consumer products initiated after August 14,  1996, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rulemakings concerning new or revised Federal energy  conservation standards for consumer products that have been initiated  but for which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NOPR) has not been  published as of August 14, 1996.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For rulemakings described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section,  to the extent analytical work has already been done or public comment on  an ANOPR has already been provided, such analyses and comment will be  considered, as appropriate, in proceeding under the new process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> With respect to incomplete rulemakings concerning new or revised  Federal energy conservation standards for consumer products for which a  NOPR was published prior to August 14, 1996, the Department will conduct  a case-by-case review to decide whether any of the analytical or  procedural steps already completed should be repeated. In any case, the  approach described in this appendix will be used to the extent possible  to conduct any analytical or procedural steps that have not been  completed.</p><p class="depth0">3. Setting Priorities for Rulemaking Activity</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Priority-setting analysis and development of list of priorities.  At least once a year, the Department will prepare an analysis of each of  the factors identified in paragraph (d) of this section based on  existing literature, direct communications with interested parties and  other experts, and other available information. The results of this  analysis will be used to develop rulemaking priorities and proposed  schedules for the development and issuance of all rulemakings. The DOE  analysis, priorities and proposed rulemaking schedules will be  documented and distributed for review and comment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Public review and comment. Each year, DOE will invite public  input to review and comment on the priority analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Issuance of final listing of rulemaking priorities. Each fall,  the Department will issue, simultaneously with the issuance of the  Administration's Regulatory Agenda, a final set of rulemaking  priorities, the accompanying analysis, and the schedules for all  priority rulemakings that it anticipates within the next two years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Factors for priority-setting. The factors to be considered by  DOE in developing priorities and establishing schedules for conducting  rulemakings will include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Potential energy savings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Potential economic benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Potential environmental or energy security benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Applicable deadlines for rulemakings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Incremental DOE resources required to complete rulemaking  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Other relevant regulatory actions affecting products.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Stakeholder recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Evidence of energy efficiency gains in the market absent new or  revised standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Status of required changes to test procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Other relevant factors.</p><p class="depth0">4. Process for Developing Efficiency Standards and Factors to be</p><p class="depth0">Considered</p><p class="depth0">This section describes the process to be used in developing  efficiency standards and the factors to be considered in the process.  The policies of the Department to guide the selection of standards and  the decisions preliminary thereto are described in section 5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identifying and screening design options. Once the Department  has initiated a rulemaking for a specific product but before publishing  an ANOPR, DOE will identify the product categories and design options to  be analyzed in detail, and identify those design options eliminated from  further consideration. Interested parties will be consulted to identify  key issues, develop a list of design options, and to help the Department  identify the expertise necessary to conduct the analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in  consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be  examined in the standards development process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification of experts and other interested parties for peer  review. DOE, in consultation with interested parties, will identify a  group of independent experts and other interested parties who can  provide expert review of the results of the engineering analysis and the  subsequent impact analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Identification and screening of design options. In consultation  with interested parties, the Department will develop a list of design  options for consideration. Initially, the candidate design options will  encompass all those technologies considered to be technologically  feasible. Following the development of this initial list of design  options, DOE will review each design option based on   the factors described in paragraph (a)(4) of this section and the  policies stated in section 5(b). The reasons for eliminating any design  option at this stage of the process will be fully documented and  published as part of the ANOPR. The technologically feasible design  options that are not eliminated in this screening will be considered  further in the Engineering Analysis described in paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Factors for screening of design options. The factors for  screening design options include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Technological feasibility. Technologies incorporated in  commercial products or in working prototypes will be considered  technologically feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If mass  production of a technology in commercial products and reliable  installation and servicing of the technology could be achieved on the  scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time of the  effective date of the standard, then that technology will be considered  practicable to manufacture, install and service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Adverse Impacts on Product Utility or Product Availability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Adverse Impacts on Health or Safety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Selection of contractors. Using the specifications of necessary  contractor expertise developed in consultation with interested parties,  DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors, and as  necessary, expert consultants to perform the engineering analysis and  the impact analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Engineering analysis of design options and selection of  candidate standard levels. After design options are identified and  screened, DOE will perform the engineering analysis and the benefit/cost  analysis and select the candidate standard levels based on these  analyses. The results of the analyses will be published in a Technical  Support Document (TSD) to accompany the ANOPR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identification of engineering analytical methods and tools. DOE,  in consultation with outside experts, will select the specific  engineering analysis tools (or multiple tools, if necessary to address  uncertainty) to be used in the analysis of the design options identified  as a result of the screening analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options. The  DOE and its contractor will perform engineering and life-cycle cost  analyses of the design options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the  engineering and life-cycle cost analyses will be distributed for review  by experts and interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop  will be conducted to review these results. The analyses will be revised  as appropriate on the basis of this input.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> New information relating to the factors used for screening  design options. If further information or analysis leads to a  determination that a design option, or a combination of design options,  has unacceptable impacts based on the policies stated in section 5(b),  that design option or combination of design options will not be included  in a candidate standard level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Selection of candidate standard levels. Based on the results of  the engineering and life-cycle cost analysis of design options and the  policies stated in section 5(c), DOE will select the candidate standard  levels for further analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Documentation of  decisions on candidate standard selection. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the screening analysis  indicates that continued development of a standard is appropriate, the  Department will publish an ANOPR in the Federal Register and will  distribute a draft TSD containing the analyses performed to this point.  The ANOPR will specify candidate standard levels but will not propose a  particular standard. The ANOPR will also include the preliminary  analysis of consumer life-cycle costs, national net present value, and  energy impacts for the candidate standard levels based on the  engineering analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the preliminary analysis indicates that no candidate  standard level is likely to meet the criteria specified in law, that  conclusion will be announced. In such cases, the Department may decide  to proceed with a rulemaking that proposes not to adopt new or amended  standards, or it may suspend the rulemaking and conclude that further  action on such standards should be assigned a low priority under section  3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public  comment on the ANOPR with at least one public hearing or workshop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revisions based on comments. Based on consideration of the  comments received, any necessary changes to the engineering analysis or  the candidate standard levels will be made.</p><p class="depth0">If major changes are required at this stage, interested parties and  experts will be given an opportunity to review the revised analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Analysis of impacts and selection of proposed standard level.  After the ANOPR, economic analyses of the impacts of the candidate  standard levels will be conducted. The Department will propose updated  standards based on the results of the impact analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Identification of issues for analysis. The Department, in  consultation with interested parties, will identify issues that will be  examined in the impacts analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Identification of analytical methods and tools. DOE, in  consultation with outside experts, will select the specific economic  analysis tools (or multiple tools if necessary to address uncertainty)  to be used in the analysis of the candidate standard levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Analysis of impacts. DOE will conduct the analysis of the  impacts of candidate standard levels including analysis of the factors  described in paragraphs (d)(7)(ii)-(viii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Review by expert group and stakeholders. The results of the  analysis of impacts will be distributed for review by experts and  interested parties. If appropriate, a public workshop will be conducted  to review these results. The analysis will be revised as appropriate on  the basis of this input.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Efforts to develop consensus among stakeholders. If a  representative group of interested parties undertakes to develop joint  recommendations to the Department on standards, DOE will consider  deferring its impact analysis until these discussions are completed or  until participants in the efforts indicate that they are unable to reach  a timely agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Selection of proposed standard level based on analysis of  impacts. On the basis of the analysis of the factors described in  paragraph (d)(7) of this section and the policies stated in section  5(e), DOE will select a proposed standard level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Factors to be considered in selecting a proposed standard. The  factors to be considered in selection of a proposed standard include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consensus stakeholder recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Impacts on manufacturers. The analysis of manufacturer impacts  will include: Estimated impacts on cash flow; assessment of impacts on  manufacturers of specific categories of products and small  manufacturers; assessment of impacts on manufacturers of multiple  product-specific Federal regulatory requirements, including efficiency  standards for other products and regulations of other agencies; and  impact on manufacturing capacity, plant closures, and loss of capital  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Impacts on consumers. The analysis of consumer impacts will  include: Estimated impacts on consumers based on national average energy  prices and energy usage; assessments of impacts on subgroups of  consumers based on major regional differences in usage or energy prices  and significant variations in installation costs or performance;  sensitivity analyses using high and low discount rates and high and low  energy price forecasts; consideration of changes to product utility and  other impacts of likely concern to all or some consumers, based to the  extent practicable on direct input from consumers; estimated life-cycle  cost with sensitivity analysis; and consideration of the increased first  cost to consumers and the time required for energy cost savings to pay  back these first costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Impacts on competition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Impacts on utilities. The analysis of utility impacts will  include estimated marginal impacts on electric and gas utility costs and  revenues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> National energy, economic and employment impacts. The analysis  of national energy, economic and employment impacts will include:  Estimated energy savings by fuel type; estimated net present value of  benefits to all consumers; and estimates of the direct and indirect  impacts on employment by appliance manufacturers, relevant service  industries, energy suppliers and the economy in general.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Impacts on the environment and energy security. The analysis  of environmental and energy security impacts will include estimated  impacts on emissions of carbon and relevant criteria pollutants, impacts  on pollution control costs, and impacts on oil use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Impacts of non-regulatory approaches. The analysis of energy  savings and consumer impacts will incorporate an assessment of the  impacts of market forces and existing voluntary programs in promoting  product efficiency, usage and related characteristics in the absence of  updated efficiency standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> New information relating to the factors used for screening  design options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice of Proposed Rulemaking--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Documentation of decisions on  proposed standard selection. The Department will publish a NOPR in the  Federal Register that proposes standard levels and explains the basis  for the selection of those proposed levels, and will distribute a draft  TSD documenting the analysis of impacts. As required by Sec. 325(p)(2)  of EPCA, the NOPR also will describe the maximum improvement in energy  efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically  feasible and, if the proposed standards would not achieve these levels,  the reasons for proposing different standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Public comment and hearing. There will be 75 days for public  comment on the NOPR, with at least one public hearing or workshop.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Revisions to impact analyses and selection of final standard.  Based on the public comments received and the policies stated in section  5(f), DOE will review the proposed standard and impact analyses, and  make modifications as necessary. If major changes to the analyses are  required at this stage, interested parties and experts will be given an  opportunity to review the revised analyses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Notice of Final Rulemaking. The Department will publish a Notice  of Final Rulemaking in the Federal Register that promulgates standard  levels and explains the basis for the selection of those standards,  accompanied by a final TSD.</p><p class="depth0">5. Policies on Selection of Standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. (1) Section 4 describes the process that will be used  to consider new or revised energy efficiency standards and lists a  number of factors and analyses that will be   considered at specified points in the process. Department policies  co12467ncerning the selection of new or revised standards, and decisions  preliminary thereto, are described in this section.</p><p class="depth0">These policies are intended to elaborate on the statutory criteria  provided in section 325 of the EPCA, 42 U.S.C. 6295.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The policies described below are intended to provide guidance  for making the determinations required by EPCA. This statement of policy  is not intended to preclude consideration of any information pertinent  to the statutory criteria. The Department will consider all pertinent  information in determining whether a new or revised standard is  consistent with the statutory criteria. Moreover, the Department will  not be guided by a policy in this section if, in the particular  circumstances presented, such a policy would lead to a result  inconsistent with the criteria in section 325 of EPCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Screening design options. Section 4(a)(4) lists factors to be  considered in screening design options. These factors will be considered  as follows in determining whether a design option will receive any  further consideration:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Technological feasibility. Technologies that are not  incorporated in commercial products or in working prototypes will not be  considered further.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Practicability to manufacture, install and service. If it is  determined that mass production of a technology in commercial products  and reliable installation and servicing of the technology could not be  achieved on the scale necessary to serve the relevant market at the time  of the effective date of the standard, then that technology will not be  considered further.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Impacts on product utility to consumers. If a technology is  determined to have significant adverse impact on the utility of the  product to significant subgroups of consumers, or result in the  unavailability of any covered product type with performance  characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities,  and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally  available in the U.S. at the time, it will not be considered further.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Safety of technologies. If it is determined that a technology  will have significant adverse impacts on health or safety, it will not  be considered further.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Identification of candidate standard levels. Based on the  results of the engineering and cost and benefit analyses of design  options, DOE will identify the candidate standard levels for further  analysis. Candidate standard levels will be selected as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs and savings of design options. Design options which have  payback periods that exceed the average life of the product or which  cause life-cycle cost increases relative to the base case, using typical  fuel costs, usage and discount rates, will not be used as the basis for  candidate standard levels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Further information on factors used for screening design  options. If further information or analysis leads to a determination  that a design option, or a combination of design options, has  unacceptable impacts under the policies stated in paragraph (b) of this  section, that design option or combination of design options will not be  included in a candidate standard level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Selection of candidate standard levels. Candidate standard  levels, which will be identified in the ANOPR and on which impact  analyses will be conducted, will be based on the remaining design  options.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The range of candidate standard levels will typically include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The most energy efficient combination of design options;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The combination of design options with the lowest life-cycle  cost; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A combination of design options with a payback period of not  more than three years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Candidate standard levels that incorporate noteworthy  technologies or fill in large gaps between efficiency levels of other  candidate standard levels also may be selected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Advance notice of proposed rulemaking. New information provided  in public comments on the ANOPR will be considered to determine whether  any changes to the candidate standard levels are needed before  proceeding to the analysis of impacts. This review, and any appropriate  adjustments, will be based on the policies in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Selection of proposed standard. Based on the results of the  analysis of impacts, DOE will select a standard level to be proposed for  public comment in the NOPR. Section 4(d)(7) lists the factors to be  considered in selecting a proposed standard level. Section 325(o)(2)(A)  of EPCA provides that any new or revised standard must be designed to  achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency that is determined  to be technologically feasible and economically justified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Statutory policies. The fundamental policies concerning  selection of standards are established in the EPCA, including the  following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>. A standard level is rebuttably presumed to be  economically justified if the payback period is three years or less. See  EPCA section 325(o)(2)(B)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the Department determines that a standard level is likely to  result in the unavailability of any covered product type with  performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes,  capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as products  generally available in the U.S. at the time, that standard level will  not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the Department determines that a standard level would not  result in significant conservation of energy, that standard level will  not be proposed. See EPCA section 325(o)(3)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Selection of proposed standard on the basis of consensus  stakeholder recommendations. Development of consensus proposals for new  or revised standards is an effective mechanism for balancing the  economic, energy, and environmental interests affected by standards.  Thus, notwithstanding any other policy on selection of proposed  standards, a consensus recommendation on an updated efficiency level  submitted by a group that represents all interested parties will be  proposed by the Department if it is determined to meet the statutory  criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Considerations in assessing economic justification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The following policies will guide the application of the  economic justification criterion in selecting a proposed standard:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level  would result in a negative return on investment for the industry, would  significantly reduce the value of the industry, or would cause  significant adverse impacts to a significant subgroup of manufacturers  (including small manufacturing businesses), that standard level will be  presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department  determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the  standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level  would be the direct cause of plant closures, significant losses in  domestic manufacturer employment, or significant losses of capital  investment by domestic manufacturers, that standard level will be  presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department  determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the  standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level  would have a significant adverse impact on the environment or energy  security, that standard level will be presumed not to be economically  justified unless the Department determines that specifically identified  expected benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other  expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level  would not result in significant energy conservation relative to non- regulatory approaches, that standard level will be presumed not to be  economically justified unless the Department determines that other  specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh  the expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is  not consistent with the policies relating to practicability to  manufacture, consumer utility, or safety in paragraphs (b) (2), (3) and  (4) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be  economically justified unless the Department determines that  specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh  this and any other expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level is  not consistent with the policies relating to consumer costs in paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, that standard level will be presumed not to be  economically justified unless the Department determines that  specifically identified expected benefits of the standard would outweigh  this and any other expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> If the Department determines that a candidate standard level  will have significant adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of  consumers (including low-income consumers), that standard level will be  presumed not to be economically justified unless the Department  determines that specifically identified expected benefits of the  standard would outweigh this and any other expected adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> If the Department or the Department of Justice determines that a  candidate standard level would have significant anticompetitive effects,  that standard level will be presumed not to be economically justified  unless the Department determines that specifically identified expected  benefits of the standard would outweigh this and any other expected  adverse effects.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The basis for a determination that triggers any presumption in  paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section and the basis for a determination  that an applicable presumption has been rebutted will be supported by  substantial evidence in the record and the evidence and rationale for  making these determinations will be explained in the NOPR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If none of the policies in paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this section  is found to be dispositive, the Department will determine whether the  benefits of a candidate standard level exceed the burdens considering  all the pertinent information in the record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Selection of a final standard. New information provided in the  public comments on the NOPR and any analysis by the Department of  Justice concerning impacts on competition of the proposed standard will  be considered to determine whether any change to   the proposed standard level is needed before proceeding to the final  rule. The same policies used to select the proposed standard level, as  described in section 5(e) above, will be used to guide the selection of  the final standard level.</p><p class="depth0">6. Effective Date of a Standard</p><p class="depth0">The effective date for new or revised standards will be established  so that the period between the publication of the final rule and the  effective date is not less than any period between the dates for  publication and effective date provided for in EPCA. The effective date  of any revised standard will be established so that the period between  the effective date of the prior standard and the effective date of such  revised standard is not less than period between the two effective dates  provided for in EPCA.</p><p class="depth0">7. Test Procedures</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Identifying the need to modify test procedures. DOE, in  consultation with interested parties, experts, and the National  Institute of Standards and Technology, will attempt to identify any  necessary modifications to established test procedures when initiating  the standards development process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Developing and proposing revised test procedures. Needed  modifications to test procedures will be identified in consultation with  experts and interested parties early in the screening stage of the  standards development process. Any necessary modifications will be  proposed before issuance of an ANOPR in the standards development  process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Issuing final test procedure modification. Final, modified test  procedures will be issued prior to the NOPR on proposed standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date of modified test procedures. If required only for  the evaluation and issuance of updated efficiency standards, modified  test procedures typically will not go into effect until the effective  date of updated standards.</p><p class="depth0">8. Joint Stakeholder Recommendations</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Joint recommendations. Consensus recommendations, and supporting  analyses, submitted by a representative group of interested parties will  be given substantial weight by DOE in the development of a proposed  rule. See section 5(e)(2). If the supporting analyses provided by the  group addresses all of the statutory criteria and uses valid economic  assumptions and analytical methods, DOE expects to use this supporting  analyses as the basis of a proposed rule. The proposed rule will explain  any deviations from the consensus recommendations from interested  parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Breadth of participation. Joint recommendations will be of most  value to the Department if the participants are reasonably  representative of those interested in the outcome of the standards  development process, including manufacturers, consumers, utilities,  states and representatives of environmental or energy efficiency  interest groups.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> DOE support of consensus development, including impact analyses.  In order to facilitate such consensus development, DOE will make  available, upon request, appropriate technical and legal support to the  group and will provide copies of all relevant public documents and  analyses. The Department also will consider any requests for its active  participation in such discussions, recognizing that the procedural  requirements of the Federal Advisory Committee Act may apply to such  participation.</p><p class="depth0">9. Principles for the Conduct of Engineering Analysis</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the engineering analysis is to develop the  relationship between efficiency and cost of the subject product. The  Department will use the most appropriate means available to determine  the efficiency/cost relationship, including an overall system approach  or engineering modeling to predict the improvement in efficiency that  can be expected from individual design options as discussed in the  paragraphs below. From this efficiency/cost relationship, measures such  as payback, life cycle cost, and energy savings can be developed. The  Department, in consultation with interested parties, will identify  issues that will be examined in the engineering analysis and the types  of specialized expertise that may be required. With these  specifications, DOE will select appropriate contractors, subcontractors,  and expert consultants, as necessary, to perform the engineering  analysis and the impact analysis. Also, the Department will consider  data, information and analyses received from interested parties for use  in the analysis wherever feasible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The engineering analysis begins with the list of design options  developed in consultation with the interested parties as a result of the  screening process. In consultation with the technology/industry expert  peer review group, the Department will establish the likely cost and  performance improvement of each design option. Ranges and uncertainties  of cost and performance will be established, although efforts will be  made to minimize uncertainties by using measures such as test data or  component or material supplier information where available. Estimated  uncertainties will be carried forward in subsequent analyses. The use of  quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative assessments as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The next step includes identifying, modifying or developing any  engineering models necessary to predict the efficiency impact of any one  or combination of design   options on the product. A base case configuration or starting point will  be established as well as the order and combination/blending of the  design options to be evaluated. The DOE, utilizing expert consultants,  will then perform the engineering analysis and develop the cost  efficiency curve for the product. The cost efficiency curve and any  necessary models will be subject to peer review before being issued with  the ANOPR.</p><p class="depth0">10. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Manufacturers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of the manufacturer analysis is to identify  the likely impacts of efficiency standards on manufacturers. The  Department will analyze the impact of standards on manufacturers with  substantial input from manufacturers and other interested parties. The  use of quantitative models will be supplemented by qualitative  assessments by industry experts. This section describes the principles  that will be used in conducting future manufacturing impact analysis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Issue identification. In the impact analysis stage (section  4(d)), the Department, in consultation with interested parties, will  identify issues that will require greater consideration in the detailed  manufacturer impact analysis. Possible issues may include identification  of specific types or groups of manufacturers and concerns over access to  technology. Specialized contractor expertise, empirical data  requirements, and analytical tools required to perform the manufacturer  impact analysis also would be identified at this stage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Industry characterization. Prior to initiating detailed impact  studies, the Department will seek input on the present and past industry  structure and market characteristics. Input on the following issues will  be sought:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Manufacturers and their relative market shares;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Manufacturer characteristics, such as whether manufacturers make  a full line of models or serve a niche market;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Trends in the number of manufacturers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Financial situation of manufacturers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Trends in product characteristics and retail markets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Identification of other relevant regulatory actions and a  description of the nature and timing of any likely impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Cost impacts on manufacturers. The costs of labor, material,  engineering, tooling, and capital are difficult to estimate,  manufacturer-specific, and usually proprietary. The Department will seek  input from interested parties on the treatment of cost issues.  Manufacturers will be encouraged to offer suggestions as to possible  sources of data and appropriate data collection methodologies. Costing  issues to be addressed include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Estimates of total cost impacts, including product-specific  costs (based on cost impacts estimated for the engineering analysis) and  front-end investment/conversion costs for the full range of product  models.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Range of uncertainties in estimates of average cost, considering  alternative designs and technologies which may vary cost impacts and  changes in costs of material, labor and other inputs which may vary  costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Variable cost impacts on particular types of manufacturers,  considering factors such as atypical sunk costs or characteristics of  specific models which may increase or decrease costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Impacts on product sales, features, prices and cost recovery. In  order to make manufacturer cash flow calculations, it is necessary to  predict the number of products sold and their sale price. This requires  an assessment of the likely impacts of price changes on the number of  products sold and on typical features of models sold. Past analyses have  relied on price and shipment data generated by economic models. The  Department will develop additional estimates of prices and shipments by  drawing on multiple sources of data and experience including: actual  shipment and pricing experience, data from manufacturers, retailers and  other market experts, financial models, and sensitivity analyses. The  possible impacts of candidate standard levels on consumer choices among  competing fuels will be explicitly considered where relevant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Measures of impact. The manufacturer impact analysis will  estimate the impacts of candidate standard levels on the net cash flow  of manufacturers. Computations will be performed for the industry as a  whole and for typical and atypical manufacturers. The exact nature and  the process by which the analysis will be conducted will be determined  by DOE, in conjunction with interested parties. Impacts to be analyzed  include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Industry net present value, with sensitivity analyses based on  uncertainty of costs, sales prices and sales volumes;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Cash flows, by year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other measures of impact, such as revenue, net income and return  on equity, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth0">The characteristics of atypical manufacturers worthy of special  consideration will be determined in consultation with manufacturers and  other interested parties and may include: manufacturers incurring higher  or lower than average costs; and manufacturers experiencing greater or  fewer adverse impacts on sales. Alternative scenarios based on other  methods of estimating cost or sales impacts also will be performed, as  needed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Cumulative impacts of other Federal regulatory actions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The  Department will recognize and seek to mitigate the overlapping effects  on manufacturers of new or revised   DOE standards and other regulatory actions affecting the same products.  DOE will analyze and consider the impact on manufacturers of multiple  product-specific regulatory actions. These factors will be considered in  setting rulemaking priorities, assessing manufacturer impacts of a  particular standard, and establishing the effective date for a new or  revised standard. In particular, DOE will seek to propose effective  dates for new or revised standards that are appropriately coordinated  with other regulatory actions to mitigate any cumulative burden.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the Department determines that a proposed standard would  impose a significant impact on product manufacturers within three years  of the effective date of another DOE standard that imposes significant  impacts on the same manufacturers (or divisions thereof, as  appropriate), the Department will, in addition to evaluating the impact  on manufacturers of the proposed standard, assess the joint impacts of  both standards on manufacturers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the Department is directed to establish or revise standards  for products that are components of other products subject to standards,  the Department will consider the interaction between such standards in  setting rulemaking priorities and assessing manufacturer impacts of a  particular standard. The Department will assess, as part of the  engineering and impact analyses, the cost of components subject to  efficiency standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Summary of quantitative and qualitative assessments. The summary  of quantitative and qualitative assessments will contain a description  and discussion of uncertainties. Alternative estimates of impacts,  resulting from the different potential scenarios developed throughout  the analysis, will be explicitly presented in the final analysis  results.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Key modeling and analytical tools. In its assessment of the  likely impacts of standards on manufacturers, the Department will use  models which are clear and understandable, feature accessible  calculations, and have assumptions that are clearly explained. As a  starting point, the Department will use the Government Regulatory Impact  Model (GRIM). The Department will consider any enhancements to the GRIM  that are suggested by interested parties. If changes are made to the  GRIM methodology, DOE will provide notice and seek public input. The  Department will also support the development of economic models for  price and volume forecasting. Research required to update key economic  data will be considered.</p><p class="depth0">11. Principles for the Analysis of Impacts on Consumers</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Impacts on product availability. The Department will determine,  based on consideration of information submitted during the standard  development process, whether a proposed standard is likely to result in  the unavailability of any covered product type with performance  characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities,  and volumes that are substantially the same as products generally  available in the U.S. at the time. DOE will not promulgate a standard if  it concludes that it would result in such unavailability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Department of justice review. As required by law, the Department  will solicit the views of the Justice Department on any lessening of  competition that is likely to result from the imposition of a proposed  standard and will give the views provided full consideration in  assessing economic justification of a proposed standard. In addition,  DOE may consult with the Department of Justice at earlier stages in the  standards development process to seek to obtain preliminary views on  competitive impacts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Variation in consumer impacts. The Department will use regional  analysis and sensitivity analysis tools, as appropriate, to evaluate the  potential distribution of impacts of candidate standards levels among  different subgroups of consumers. The Department will consider impacts  on significant segments of consumers in determining standards levels.  Where there are significant negative impacts on identifiable subgroups,  DOE will consider the efficacy of voluntary approaches as a means to  achieve potential energy savings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Payback period and first cost. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the assessment of consumer  impacts of standards, the Department will consider Life-Cycle Cost,  Payback Period and Cost of Conserved Energy to evaluate the savings in  operating expenses relative to increases in purchase price. The  Department intends to increase the level of sensitivity analysis and  scenario analysis for future rulemakings. The results of these analyses  will be carried throughout the analysis and the ensuing uncertainty  described.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If, in the analysis of consumer impacts, the Department  determines that a candidate standard level would result in a substantial  increase in the product first costs to consumers or would not pay back  such additional first costs through energy cost savings in less than  three years, Department will specifically assess the likely impacts of  such a standard on low-income households, product sales and fuel  switching.</p><p class="depth0">12. Consideration of Non-Regulatory Approaches</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The Department recognizes that voluntary or other non-regulatory  efforts by   manufacturers, utilities and other interested parties can result in  substantial efficiency improvements. The Department intends to consider  fully the likely effects of non-regulatory initiatives on product energy  use, consumer utility and life cycle costs, manufacturers, competition,  utilities and the environment, as well as the distribution of these  impacts among different regions, consumers, manufacturers and utilities.  DOE will attempt to base its assessment on the actual impacts of such  initiatives to date, but also will consider information presented  regarding the impacts that any existing initiative might have in the  future. Such information is likely to include a demonstration of the  strong commitment of manufacturers, distribution channels, utilities or  others to such voluntary efficiency improvements. This information will  be used in assessing the likely incremental impacts of establishing or  revising standards, in assessing appropriate effective dates for new or  revised standards and in considering DOE support of non-regulatory  initiatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> DOE believes that non-regulatory approaches are valuable  complements to the standards program. In particular, DOE will consider  pursuing voluntary programs where it appears that highly efficient  products can obtain a significant market share but less efficient  products cannot be eliminated altogether because, for instance, of  unacceptable adverse impacts on a significant subgroup of consumers. In  making this assessment, the Department will consider the success more  efficient designs have had in the market, their acceptance to date, and  their potential market penetration.</p><p class="depth0">13. Crosscutting Analytical Assumptions</p><p class="depth0">In selecting values for certain crosscutting analytical assumptions,  DOE expects to continue relying upon the following sources and general  principles:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Underlying economic assumptions. The appliance standards  analyses will generally use the same economic growth and development  assumptions that underlie the most current Annual Energy Outlook (AEO)  published by the Energy Information Administration (EIA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Energy price and demand trends. Analyses of the likely impact of  appliance standards on typical users will generally adopt the mid-range  energy price and demand scenario of the EIA's most current AEO. The  sensitivity of such estimated impacts to possible variations in future  energy prices are likely to be examined using the EIA's high and low  energy price scenarios.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Product-specific energy-efficiency trends, without updated  standards. Product specific energy-efficiency trends will be based on a  combination of the efficiency trends forecast by the EIA's residential  and commercial demand model of the National Energy Modeling System  (NEMS) and product-specific assessments by DOE and its contractors with  input from interested parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Discount rates. For residential and commercial consumers, ranges  of three different real discount rates will be used. For residential  consumers, the mid-range discount rate will represent DOE's  approximation of the average financing cost (or opportunity costs of  reduced savings) experienced by typical consumers. Sensitivity analyses  will be performed using discount rates reflecting the costs more likely  to be experienced by residential consumers with little or no savings and  credit card financing and consumers with substantial savings. For  commercial users, a mid-range discount rate reflecting the DOE's  approximation of the average real rate of return on commercial  investment will be used, with sensitivity analyses being performed using  values indicative of the range of real rates of return likely to be  experienced by typical commercial businesses. For national net present  value calculations, DOE would use the Administration's approximation of  the average real rate of return on private investment in the U.S.  economy. For manufacturer impacts, DOE plans to use a range of real  discount rates which are representative of the real rates of return  experienced by typical U.S. manufacturers affected by the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Environmental impacts. The emission rates of carbon, sulfur  oxides and nitrogen oxides used by DOE to calculate the physical  quantities of emissions likely to be avoided by candidate standard  levels will be based on the current average carbon emissions of the U.S.  electric utilities and on the projected rates of emissions of sulfur and  nitrogen oxides. Projected rates of emissions, if available, will be  used for the estimation of any other environmental impacts. The  Department will consider the effects of the proposed standards on these  emissions in reaching a decision about whether the benefits of the  proposed standards exceed their burdens but will not determine the  monetary value of these environmental externalities.</p><p class="depth0">14. Deviations, Revisions, and Judicial Review</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Deviations. This appendix specifies procedures, interpretations  and policies for the development of new or revised energy efficiency  standards in considerable detail. As the approach described in this  appendix is applied to the development of particular standards, the  Department may find it necessary or appropriate to deviate from these  procedures, interpretations or policies. If the Department concludes  that such deviations are necessary or appropriate in a particular  situation, DOE will provide interested parties with notice of the  deviation and an explanation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Revisions. If the Department concludes that changes to the  procedures, interpretations or policies in this appendix are necessary  or appropriate, DOE will provide notice in the Federal Register of  modifications to this appendix with an accompanying explanation. DOE  expects to consult with interested parties prior to any such  modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Judicial review. The procedures, interpretations, and policies  stated in this appendix are not intended to establish any new cause of  action or right to judicial review.  [61 FR 36981, July 15, 1996]</p>
