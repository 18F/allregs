                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope and purpose. This section sets forth the rules for grouping a taxpayer's trade or business activities and rental activities for purposes of applying the passive activity loss and credit limitation rules of section 469. A taxpayer's activities include those conducted through C corporations that are subject to section 469, S corporations, and partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Trade or business activities. Trade or business activities are activities, other than rental activities or activities that are treated under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)(B) as incidental to an activity of holding property for investment, that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Involve the conduct of a trade or business (within the meaning of section 162);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Are conducted in anticipation of the commencement of a trade or business; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Involve research or experimental expenditures that are deductible under section 174 (or would be deductible if the taxpayer adopted the method described in section 174(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rental activities. Rental activities are activities that constitute rental activities within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> General rules for grouping activities--(1) Appropriate economic unit. One or more trade or business activities or rental activities may be treated as a single activity if the activities constitute an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Appropriate economic unit. One or more trade or business activities or rental activities may be treated as a single activity if the activities constitute an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Facts and circumstances test. Except as otherwise provided in this section, whether activities constitute an appropriate economic unit and, therefore, may be treated as a single activity depends upon all the relevant facts and circumstances. A taxpayer may use any reasonable method of applying the relevant facts and circumstances in grouping activities. The factors listed below, not all of which are necessary for a taxpayer to treat more than one activity as a single activity, are given the greatest weight in determining whether activities constitute an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Similarities and differences in types of trades or businesses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The extent of common control;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The extent of common ownership;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Geographical location; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Interdependencies between or among the activities (for example, the extent to which the activities purchase or sell goods between or among themselves, involve products or services that are normally provided together, have the same customers, have the same employees, or are accounted for with a single set of books and records).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Taxpayer C has a significant ownership interest in a bakery and a movie theater at a shopping mall in Baltimore and in a bakery and a movie theater in Philadelphia. In this case, after taking into account all the relevant facts and circumstances, there may be more than one reasonable method for grouping C's activities. For instance, depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, the following groupings may

or may not be permissible: a single activity; a movie theater activity and a bakery activity; a Baltimore activity and a Philadelphia activity; or four separate activities. Moreover, once C groups these activities into appropriate economic units, paragraph (e) of this section requires C to continue using that grouping in subsequent taxable years unless a material change in the facts and circumstances makes it clearly inappropriate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Taxpayer B, an individual, is a partner in a business that sells non-food items to grocery stores (partnership L). B also is a partner in a partnership that owns and operates a trucking business (partnership Q). The two partnerships are under common control. The predominant portion of Q's business is transporting goods for L, and Q is the only trucking business in which B is involved. Under this section, B appropriately treats L's wholesale activity and Q's trucking activity as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Limitation on grouping certain activities. The grouping of activities under this section is subject to the following limitations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Grouping rental activities with other trade or business activities--(i) Rule. A rental activity may not be grouped with a trade or business activity unless the activities being grouped together constitute an appropriate economic unit under paragraph (c) of this section and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rule. A rental activity may not be grouped with a trade or business activity unless the activities being grouped together constitute an appropriate economic unit under paragraph (c) of this section and--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rental activity is insubstantial in relation to the trade or business activity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The trade or business activity is insubstantial in relation to the rental activity; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Each owner of the trade or business activity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the rental activity, in which case the portion of the rental activity that involves the rental of items of property for use in the trade or business activity may be grouped with the trade or business activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> H and W are married and file a joint return. H is the sole shareholder of an S corporation that conducts a grocery store trade or business activity. W is the sole shareholder of an S corporation that owns and rents out a building. Part of the building is rented to H's grocery store trade or business activity (the grocery store rental). The grocery store rental and the grocery store trade or business are not insubstantial in relation to each other.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because they file a joint return, H and W are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of section 469. See Sec. 1.469-1T(j). Therefore, the sole owner of the trade or business activity (taxpayer H-W) is also the sole owner of the rental activity. Consequently, each owner of the trade or business activity has the same proportionate ownership interest in the rental activity. Accordingly, the grocery store rental and the grocery store trade or business activity may be grouped together (under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) into a single trade or business activity, if the grouping is appropriate under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Attorney D is a sole practitioner in town X. D also wholly owns residential real estate in town X that D rents to third parties. D's law practice is a trade or business activity within the meaning of paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The residential real estate is a rental activity within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3) and is insubstantial in relation to D's law practice. Under the facts and circumstances, the law practice and the residential real estate do not constitute an appropriate economic unit under paragraph (c) of this section. Therefore, D may not treat the law practice and the residential real estate as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grouping real property rentals and personal property rentals prohibited. An activity involving the rental of real property and an activity involving the rental of personal property (other than personal property provided in connection with the real property or real property provided in connection with the personal property) may not be treated as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain activities of limited partners and limited entrepreneurs--(i) In general. Except as provided in this paragraph, a taxpayer that owns an interest, as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur (as defined in section 464(e)(2)), in an activity described in section 465(c)(1), may not group that activity with any other activity. A taxpayer that owns an interest as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur in an activity described in the preceding sentence may group that activity with another activity in the same type of business if the grouping is appropriate under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as provided in this paragraph, a taxpayer that owns an interest, as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur (as defined in section 464(e)(2)), in an activity described in section 465(c)(1), may not group that activity with any other activity. A taxpayer that owns an interest as a limited partner or a limited entrepreneur in an activity described in the preceding sentence may group that activity with another activity in the same type of business if the grouping is appropriate under the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (d)(3):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayer A, an individual, owns and operates a farm. A is also a member of M, a limited liability company that conducts a cattle-feeding business. A does not actively participate in the management of M (within the meaning of section 464(e)(2)(B)). In addition, A is a limited partner in N, a limited partnership engaged in oil and gas production.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because A does not actively participate in the management of M, A is a limited entrepreneur in M's activity. M's cattle-feeding business is described in section 465(c)(1)(B) (relating to farming) and may not be grouped with any other activity that does not involve farming. Moreover, A's farm may not be grouped with the cattle-feeding activity unless the grouping constitutes an appropriate economic unit for the measurement of gain or loss for purposes of section 469.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Because A is a limited partner in N and N's activity is described in section 465(c)(1)(D) (relating to exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources), A may not group N's oil and gas activity with any other activity that does not involve exploring for, or exploiting, oil and gas resources. Thus, N's activity may not be grouped with A's farm or with M's cattle-feeding business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other activities identified by the Commissioner. A taxpayer that owns an interest in an activity identified in guidance issued by the Commissioner as an activity covered by this paragraph (d)(4) may not group that activity with any other activity, except as provided in the guidance issued by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Activities conducted through section 469 entities--(i) In general. A C corporation subject to section 469, an S corporation, or a partnership (a section 469 entity) must group its activities under the rules of this section. Once the section 469 entity groups its activities, a shareholder or partner may group those activities with each other, with activities conducted directly by the shareholder or partner, and with activities conducted through other section 469 entities, in accordance with the rules of this section. A shareholder or partner may not treat activities grouped together by a section 469 entity as separate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A C corporation subject to section 469, an S corporation, or a partnership (a section 469 entity) must group its activities under the rules of this section. Once the section 469 entity groups its activities, a shareholder or partner may group those activities with each other, with activities conducted directly by the shareholder or partner, and with activities conducted through other section 469 entities, in accordance with the rules of this section. A shareholder or partner may not treat activities grouped together by a section 469 entity as separate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Cross reference. An activity that a taxpayer conducts through a C corporation subject to section 469 may be grouped with another activity of the taxpayer, but only for purposes of determining whether the taxpayer materially or significantly participates in the other activity. See Sec. 1.469-2T(c)(3)(i)(A) and (c)(4)(i) for the rules regarding dividends on C corporation stock and compensation paid for personal services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Disclosure and consistency requirements--(1) Original groupings. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and Sec. 1.469-11, once a taxpayer has grouped activities under this section, the taxpayer may not regroup those activities in subsequent taxable years. Taxpayers must comply with disclosure requirements that the Commissioner may prescribe with respect to both their original groupings and the addition and disposition of specific activities within those chosen groupings in subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Original groupings. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section and Sec. 1.469-11, once a taxpayer has grouped activities under this section, the taxpayer may not regroup those activities in subsequent taxable years. Taxpayers must comply with disclosure requirements that the Commissioner may prescribe with respect to both their original groupings and the addition and disposition of specific activities within those chosen groupings in subsequent taxable years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Regroupings. If it is determined that a taxpayer's original grouping was clearly inappropriate or a material change in the facts and circumstances has occurred that makes the original grouping clearly inappropriate, the taxpayer must regroup the activities and must comply with disclosure requirements that the Commissioner may prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Grouping by Commissioner to prevent tax avoidance--(1) Rule. The Commissioner may regroup a taxpayer's activities if any of the activities resulting from the taxpayer's grouping is not an appropriate economic unit and a principal purpose of the taxpayer's grouping (or failure to regroup under paragraph (e) of this section) is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rule. The Commissioner may regroup a taxpayer's activities if any of the activities resulting from the taxpayer's grouping is not an appropriate economic unit and a principal purpose of the taxpayer's grouping (or failure to regroup under paragraph (e) of this section) is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Taxpayers D, E, F, G, and H are doctors who operate separate medical practices. D invested in a tax shelter several years ago that generates passive losses and the other doctors intend to invest in real estate that will generate passive losses. The taxpayers form a partnership to engage in the trade or business of acquiring and operating X-ray equipment. In exchange for equipment contributed to the partnership, the taxpayers receive limited partnership interests. The partnership is managed by a general partner selected by the taxpayers; the taxpayers do not materially participate in its operations. Substantially all of the partnership's services are provided to the

taxpayers or their patients, roughly in proportion to the doctors' interests in the partnership. Fees for the partnership's services are set at a level equal to the amounts that would be charged if the partnership were dealing with the taxpayers at arm's length and are expected to assure the partnership a profit. The taxpayers treat the partnership's services as a separate activity from their medical practices and offset the income generated by the partnership against their passive losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each of the taxpayers, the taxpayer's own medical practice and the services provided by the partnership constitute an appropriate economic unit, but the services provided by the partnership do not separately constitute an appropriate economic unit. Moreover, a principal purpose of treating the medical practices and the partnership's services as separate activities is to circumvent the underlying purposes of section 469. Accordingly, the Commissioner may require the taxpayers to treat their medical practices and their interests in the partnership as a single activity, regardless of whether the separate medical practices are conducted through C corporations subject to section 469, S corporations, partnerships, or sole proprietorships. The Commissioner may assert penalties under section 6662 against the taxpayers in appropriate circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Treatment of partial dispositions. A taxpayer may, for the taxable year in which there is a disposition of substantially all of an activity, treat the part disposed of as a separate activity, but only if the taxpayer can establish with reasonable certainty--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of deductions and credits allocable to that part of the activity for the taxable year under Sec. 1.469-1(f)(4) (relating to carryover of disallowed deductions and credits); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The amount of gross income and of any other deductions and credits allocable to that part of the activity for the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Rules for grouping rental real estate activities for taxpayers qualifying under section 469(c)(7). See Sec. 1.469-9 for rules for certain rental real estate activities.

Sec. 1.469-4T  Definition of activity (temporary).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Overview--(1) Purpose and effect of overview. This paragraph (a) contains a general description of the rules contained in this section and is intended solely as an aid to readers. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are not a substitute for the more detailed rules contained in the remainder of this section and cannot be relied upon in cases in which those rules qualify the general description contained in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Purpose and effect of overview. This paragraph (a) contains a general description of the rules contained in this section and is intended solely as an aid to readers. The provisions of this paragraph (a) are not a substitute for the more detailed rules contained in the remainder of this section and cannot be relied upon in cases in which those rules qualify the general description contained in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scope and structure of Sec. 1.469-4T. This section provides rules under which a taxpayer's business and rental operations are treated as one or more activities for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder. (See paragraph (b)(2)(ii) of this section for the definition of business and rental operations.) In general, these rules are divided into three groups:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Rules that identify the business and rental operations that constitute an undertaking (the undertaking rules).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Rules that identify the undertaking or undertakings that constitute an activity (the activity rules).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rules that apply only under certain special circumstances (the special rules).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Undertaking rules--(i) In general. The undertaking is generally the smallest unit that can constitute an activity. (See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the general rule and paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section for a special rule that permits taxpayers to treat a single rental real estate undertaking as multiple activities.) An undertaking may include diverse business and rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The undertaking is generally the smallest unit that can constitute an activity. (See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the general rule and paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section for a special rule that permits taxpayers to treat a single rental real estate undertaking as multiple activities.) An undertaking may include diverse business and rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Basic undertaking rule. The basic undertaking rule identifies the business and rental operations that constitute an undertaking by reference to their location and ownership. Under this rule, business and rental operations that are conducted at the same location and are owned by the same person are generally treated as part of the same undertaking. Conversely, business and rental operations generally constitute separate undertakings to the extent that they are conducted at different locations or are not owned by the same person. (See paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Circumstances in which location is disregarded. In some circumstances, the undertaking in which business and rental operations are included does not

depend on the location at which the operations are conducted. Operations that are not conducted at any fixed place of business or that are conducted at the customer's place of business are treated as part of the undertaking with which the operations are most closely associated (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(C) of this section). In addition, operations that are conducted at a location but do not relate to the production of property at that location or to the transaction of business with customers at that location are treated, in effect, as part of the undertaking or undertakings that the operations support (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rental undertakings. The basic undertaking rule is also modified if the undertaking determined under that rule includes both rental and nonrental operations. In such cases, the rental operations and the nonrental operations generally must be treated as separate undertakings (see paragraph (d)(1) of this section). This rule does not apply if more than 80 percent of the income of the undertaking determined under the basic rule is attributable to one class of operations (i.e., rental or nonrental) or if the rental operations would not be treated as part of a rental activity because of the exceptions contained in Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii) (see paragraph (d)(2) of this section). In applying the rental undertaking rules, short-term rentals of real property (e.g., hotel-room rentals) are generally treated as nonrental operations (see paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Oil and gas wells. Another exception to the basic undertaking rule treats oil and gas wells that are subject to the working-interest exception in Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4) as separate undertakings (see paragraph (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Activity rules--(i) In general. The basic activity rule treats each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest as a separate activity of the taxpayer (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section). In the case of trade or business undertakings, professional service undertakings, and rental real estate undertakings, additional rules may either require or permit the aggregation of two or more undertakings into a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The basic activity rule treats each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest as a separate activity of the taxpayer (see paragraph (b)(1) of this section). In the case of trade or business undertakings, professional service undertakings, and rental real estate undertakings, additional rules may either require or permit the aggregation of two or more undertakings into a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Aggregation of trade or business undertakings--(A) Trade or business undertakings. Trade or business undertakings include all nonrental undertakings other than oil and gas undertakings described in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section and professional service undertakings described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Trade or business undertakings. Trade or business undertakings include all nonrental undertakings other than oil and gas undertakings described in paragraph (a)(3)(v) of this section and professional service undertakings described in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Similar, commonly-controlled undertakings treated as a single activity. An aggregation rule treats trade or business undertakings that are both similar and controlled by the same interests as part of the same activity. This rule is, however, generally inapplicable to small interests held by passive investors in such undertakings, except to the extent such interests are held through the same passthrough entity. (See paragraph (f)(2) of this section.) Undertakings are similar for purposes of this rule if more than half (by value) of their operations are in the same line of business (as defined in a revenue procedure issued pursuant to paragraph (f)(4)(iv) of this section) or if the undertakings are vertically integrated (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section). All the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining whether undertakings are controlled by the same interests for purposes of the aggregation rule (see paragraph (j)(1) of this section). If, however, each member of a group of five or fewer persons owns a substantial interest in each of the undertakings, the undertakings may be rebuttably presumed to be controlled by the same interests (see paragraph (j) (2) and (3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Integrated businesses treated as a single activity. Trade or business undertakings (including undertakings that have been aggregated because of their similarity and common control) are subject to a second aggregation rule. Under this rule undertakings that constitute an integrated business and are controlled by the same interests must be treated as part of the same activity. (See paragraph (g) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Aggregation of professional service undertakings. Professional service undertakings are nonrental undertakings that predominantly involve the provision of services in the fields of health,

law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting (see paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section). In general, professional service undertakings that are either similar, related, or controlled by the same interests must be treated as part of the same activity (see paragraph (h)(2) of this section). The rules for determining whether trade or business undertakings are controlled by the same interests also apply with respect to professional service undertakings. Professional service undertakings are similar, however, if more than 20 percent (by value) of their operations are in the same field, and two professional service undertakings are related if one of the undertakings derives more than 20 percent of its gross income from persons who are customers of the other undertaking (see paragraph (h)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rules for rental real estate--(A) Taxpayers permitted to determine rental real estate activities. The rules for aggregating rental real estate undertakings are generally elective. They permit taxpayers to treat any combination of rental real estate undertakings as a single activity. Taxpayers may also divide their rental real estate undertakings and then treat portions of the undertakings as separate activities or recombine the portions into activities that include parts of different undertakings. (See paragraph (k)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Taxpayers permitted to determine rental real estate activities. The rules for aggregating rental real estate undertakings are generally elective. They permit taxpayers to treat any combination of rental real estate undertakings as a single activity. Taxpayers may also divide their rental real estate undertakings and then treat portions of the undertakings as separate activities or recombine the portions into activities that include parts of different undertakings. (See paragraph (k)(2) (i) and (iii) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limitations on fragmentation and aggregation of rental real estate. Taxpayers may not fragment their rental real estate in a manner that is inconsistent with their treatment of such property in prior taxable years or with the treatment of such property by the passthrough entity through which it is held (see paragraph (k) (2)(ii) and (3) of this section). There are no comparable limitations on the aggregation of rental real estate into a single activity. If however, the income or gain from a rental real estate undertaking is subject to recharacterization under Sec. 1.469-2T(f)(3) (relating to the rental of nondepreciable property), a coordination rule provides that the undertaking must be treated as a separate activity (see paragraph (k)(6) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Election to treat nonrental undertakings as separate activities. Another elective rule permits taxpayers to treat a nonrental undertaking as a separate activity even if the undertaking would be treated as part of a larger activity under the aggregation rules applicable to the undertaking (see paragraph (o)(2) of this section). This elective rule is limited by consistency requirements similar to those that apply to rental real estate operations (see paragraph (o) (3) and (4) of this section). Moreover, in cases in which a taxpayer elects to treat a nonrental undertaking as a separate activity, the taxpayer's level of participation (i.e., material, significant, or otherwise) in the separate activity is the same as the taxpayer's level of participation in the larger activity in which the undertaking would be included but for the election (see paragraph (o)(6) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Special rules--(i) Consolidated groups and publicly traded partnerships. Special rules apply to the business and rental operations of consolidated groups of corporations and publicly traded partnerships. Under these rules, a consolidated group is treated as one taxpayer in determining its activities and those of its members (see paragraph (m) of this section), and business and rental operations owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be aggregated with operations that are not owned through the partnership (see paragraph (n) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consolidated groups and publicly traded partnerships. Special rules apply to the business and rental operations of consolidated groups of corporations and publicly traded partnerships. Under these rules, a consolidated group is treated as one taxpayer in determining its activities and those of its members (see paragraph (m) of this section), and business and rental operations owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be aggregated with operations that are not owned through the partnership (see paragraph (n) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional rule. A special rule applies for taxable years ending before August 10, 1989. In those years, taxpayers may organize business and rental operations into activities under any reasonable method (see paragraph (p)(1) of this section). A taxpayer will also be permitted to use any reasonable method to allocate disallowed deductions and credits among activities for the first taxable year in which the taxpayer's activities are determined under the general rules of Sec. 1.469-4T (see paragraph (p)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule and definitions of general application--(1) General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest shall be treated as a separate activity of the taxpayer. See

paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section for rules requiring certain nonrental undertakings to be treated as part of the same activity and paragraph (k) of this section for rules identifying the rental real estate undertakings (or portions thereof) that are included in an activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as otherwise provided in this section, each undertaking in which a taxpayer owns an interest shall be treated as a separate activity of the taxpayer. See

paragraphs (f), (g), and (h) of this section for rules requiring certain nonrental undertakings to be treated as part of the same activity and paragraph (k) of this section for rules identifying the rental real estate undertakings (or portions thereof) that are included in an activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definitions of general application. The following definitions set forth the meaning of certain terms for purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Passthrough entity. The term ``passthrough entity'' means a partnership, S corporation, estate, or trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Business and rental operations--(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the term ``business and rental operations'' means all endeavors that are engaged in for profit or the production of income and satisfy one or more of the following conditions for the taxable year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such endeavors involve the conduct of a trade or business (within the meaning of section 162) or are conducted in anticipation of such endeavors becoming a trade or business;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such endeavors involve making tangible property available for use by customers; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Research or experimental expenditures paid or incurred with respect to such endeavors are deductible under section 174 (or would be deductible if the taxpayer adopted the method described in section 174(a)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Operations conducted through nonpassthrough entities. For purposes of applying section 469 and the regulations thereunder, a taxpayer's activities do not include operations that a taxpayer conducts through one or more entities (other than passthrough entities). The following example illustrates the operation of this paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(B):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A, an individual, owns stock of X, a closely held corporation (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii) that is directly engaged in the conduct of a real estate development business. A participates in X's real estate development business, but does not own any interest in the business other than through ownership of the stock of X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X is subject to section 469 (see Sec. 1.469-1T(b)(5)) and does not hold the real estate development business through another entity. Accordingly, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, the operations of X's real estate development business are treated as part of X's activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A is also subject to section 469 (see Sec. 1.469-1T(b)(1)), but A's only interest in the real estate development business is held through X. X is a C corporation and therefore is not a passthrough entity. Thus, for purposes of section 469 and the regulations thereunder, A's activities do not include the operations of X's real estate development business. Accordingly, A's participation in X's busines is not participation in an activity of A, and is not taken into account in determining whether A materially participates (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-5T) or significantly participates (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(c)(2)) in any activity. (See, however, Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(3) for rules under which a shareholder's participation is taken into account for purposes of determining whether a corporation materially or significantly participates in an activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Undertaking--(1) In general.

activities that include such undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Support operations. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the business and rental operations conducted at a location are treated as support operations to the extent that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Such operations and an undertaking that is conducted at a different location are owned by the same person (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Such operations involve the provision of property or services to such undertaking; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Location. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The term ``location'' means, with respect to any business and rental operations, a fixed place of business at which such operations are regularly conducted;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Business and rental operations are conducted at the same location if they are conducted in the same physical structure or within close proximity of one another;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises shall be treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> All the facts and circumstances (including, in particular, the factors listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section) are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Oil and gas operations that are conducted for the development of a common reservoir are conducted within close proximity of one another.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Income-producing operations. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), the term ``income-producing operations'' means business and rental operations that are conducted at a location and relate to (or are conducted in reasonable anticipation of)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The production of property at such location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sale of property to customers at such location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The performance of services for customers at such location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Transactions in which customers take physical possession at such location of property that is made available for their use; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Any other transactions that involve the presence of customers at such location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Ownership by the same person. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), business and rental operations are owned by the same person if and only if one person (within the meaning of section 7701(a)(1)) is the direct owner of such operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Facts and circumstances determinations. In determining whether a location is the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated for purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, the following relationships between operations that are conducted at such location and other operations are generally the most significant:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The extent to which other persons conduct similar operations at one location;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whether such operations are treated as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The extent to which other persons treat similar operations as a unit in the primary accounting records reflecting the results of such similar operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which such operations involve products or services that are commonly provided together;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The extent to which such operations serve the same customers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The extent to which the same personnel, facilities, or equipment are used to conduct such operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The extent to which such operations are conducted in coordination with or reliance upon each other;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The extent to which the conduct of any such operations is incidental to the conduct of the remainder of such operations;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> The extent to which such operations depend on each other for their economic success; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Whether such operations are conducted under the same trade name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (c). In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual and the facts, analysis, and conclusion relate to a single taxable year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. The taxpayer is the sole owner of a department store and a restaurant and conducts both businesses in the same building. Thus, the department store and restaurant operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., property is sold to customers and services are performed for customers on the premises of the department store). Accordingly, the department store and restaurant operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is also the sole owner of an automotive center that services automobiles and sells tires, batteries, motor oil, and accessories. The taxpayer operates the automotive center in a separate structure in the shopping mall in which the department store is located. Although the automotive center operations and the department store and restaurant operations are not conducted in the same physical structure, they are conducted within close proximity (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of one another. Thus, the department store, restaurant, and automotive center operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 1, the operations conducted at the same location are owned by the same person, and the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location. Accordingly, the department store, restaurant, and automotive center operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that the automotive center is located several blocks from the shopping mall. As in Example 1, the department store and restaurant operations are treating as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings. Because, however, the automotive center operations are not conducted within close proximity (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(B) of this section) of the department store and restaurant operations, all of the taxpayer's operations are not conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All of the automotive center operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., property is sold to customers and services are performed for customers on the premises of the automotive center). Accordingly, the automotive center operations are also treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (g) of this section for rules under which certain trade or business activities are treated as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. The taxpayer is the sole owner of a building and rents residential, office, and retail space in the building to various tenants. The taxpayer manages these rental operations from an office located in the building. The rental operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., customers take physical possession in the building of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the rental operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (d) of this section for rules for determining whether this undertaking is a rental undertaking and paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the taxpayer also uses the rental office in the building (``Building 1'') to manage rental operations in another building (``Building 2'') that the

taxpayer owns. The rental operations conducted in Building 2 are treated as a separate source of income production under paragraph (c)(2) of this section and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (the ``Building 2 undertaking'') under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations conducted at the rental office in Building 1 and the Building 2 undertaking are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the operations conducted at the rental office with respect to the Building 2 undertaking relate to transactions in which customers take physical possession at another location of property that is made available for their use (i.e., the operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section)). Thus, to the extent the operations conducted at the rental office involve the management of the Building 2 undertaking, they are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to the Building 2 undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section provides that support operations are not treated as part of an undertaking under paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section. Therefore, the support operations conducted at the rental office are not treated as part of the undertaking that consists of the rental operations conducted in Building 1 (the ``Building 1 undertaking''). Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section provides that the income and expenses that are attributable to support operations and are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity that includes such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the rental office that are reasonably allocable to the Building 2 undertaking are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include the Building 2 undertaking. See paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rental office operations that involve the management of rental operations conducted in Building 1 are not support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) because they relate to an undertaking that is conducted at the same location (the ``Building 1 undertaking''). Thus, the rules for support operations in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A) of this section do not apply to such operations, and they are treated as part of the Building 1 undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer conducts business and rental operations at eleven different locations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). At ten of the locations the taxpayer owns grocery stores, and at the eleventh location the taxpayer owns a warehouse that receives goods and supplies them to the taxpayer's stores. The operations of each store are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at each location (i.e., property is sold to customers on the store premises, and customers take physical possession on the store premises of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the operations of each of the ten grocery stores are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section), and each store is treated as a single undertaking (a ``grocery store undertaking'') that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). The operations conducted at the warehouse, however, do not include any income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section). Accordingly, the warehouse operations do not satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(i) of this section and are not treated as a separate undertaking under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The warehouse operations and the grocery store undertakings are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations), the operations conducted at the warehouse involve the provision of property to the grocery store undertakings, and the warehouse operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section). Thus, the warehouse operations are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to the grocery store undertakings. Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section provides that the income and expenses that are attributable to support operations and are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the warehouse operations that are reasonably allocable to a grocery store undertaking are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking. See paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain similar, commonly-controlled undertakings are treated as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 6, except that the warehouse operations also include the sale of goods to grocery stores that the taxpayer does not own (``other grocery stores''). Because of these

sales, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the warehouse. The warehouse operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). Accordingly, prior to the application of the rules for support operations in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the warehouse operations are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking (the ``separate warehouse undertaking'') that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 6, the warehouse operations that involve supplying goods to the taxpayer's grocery store undertakings are support operations with respect to those undertakings. Therefore, those operations are not treated as part of the separate warehouse undertaking (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(1) of this section), and the income and expenses of such operations are taken into account, as in Example 6, in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include the taxpayer's grocery store undertakings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A partnership is formed to acquire real property and construct a building on the property. The partnership hires brokers to locate a suitable parcel of land, lawyers to negotiate zoning variances, easements, and building permits, and architects and engineers to design the improvements. After the architects and engineers have designed the improvements and other preliminaries have been completed, the partnership hires a general contractor who hires subcontractors and oversees construction. During the construction process and after construction has been completed, the partnership leases out space in the building. The partnership then operates the building as a rental property. The operations of acquiring the real property, negotiating contracts, overseeing the designing and construction of the improvements, leasing up the building, and operating the building are conducted at an office (the ``management office'') that is not at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) as the building.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations conducted at the building site (e.g., excavating the land, pouring the concrete for the foundation, erecting the frame of the building, completing the exterior of the building, and building out the interior of the building) are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the partnership is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the partnership conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., during the construction period property (the building) is produced at the building site, and during the rental period customers take physical possession in the building of property made available for their use). Accordingly, the operations conducted at the building site are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The operations conducted at the management office and the undertaking conducted at the building site are owned by the same person (i.e., the partnership is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the operations conducted at the management office relate to transactions in which customers take physical possession at another location of property that is made available for their use (i.e., the operations are not income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section)). Thus, to the extent the operations conducted at the management office involve the provision of services to the undertaking conducted at the building site, they are support operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B) of this section) with respect to such undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of this section provides that the income and expenses of support operations that are reasonably allocable to an undertaking conducted at a different location shall be taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity that includes such undertaking. Accordingly, the income and expenses of the management office that are reasonably allocable to the undertaking conducted at the building site are taken into account in determining the income or loss from the activity or activities that include such undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Until the building is first held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental, the undertaking conducted at the building site is a trade or business undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section). See paragraph (d) of this section for rules for determining whether the undertaking is a rental undertaking for periods after the building is first held out for rent and is in a state of readiness for rental and paragraph (k) of this section for rules for identifying rental real estate activities.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. The taxpayer owns 15 oil wells pursuant to a single working interest (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(4)(iv). All of the wells are drilled and operated for the development of a common reservoir. Thus, all of the wells are at the same location (see paragraph (c)(2)(iii)(E) of this section). All of the wells are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations), and the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of

paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., oil wells are drilled in reasonable anticipation of producing oil at the location). Accordingly, the operations of the wells are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See paragraph (e) of this section for rules under which certain oil and gas operations are treated as multiple undertakings even if they would be part of the same undertaking under the rules of this paragraph (c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partnership X owns an automobile dealership and partnership Y owns an automobile repair shop. The dealership and repair shop operations are conducted in the same physical structure. Individuals A, B, and C are the only partners in partnerships X and Y, and each of the partners owns a one-third interest in both partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The dealership operations and the repair-shop operations are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), but are owned by different persons (i.e., X is the direct owner of the dealership operations, and Y is the direct owner of the repair-shop operations). Moreover, indirect ownership of the operations is not taken into account under paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section. Thus, it is irrelevant that the two partnerships are owned by the same persons in identical proportions. Accordingly, the dealership and repair-shop operations are not treated as part of the same source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) or as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (g) of this section for rules under which certain trade or business activities are treated as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns and operates a delivery service. The business consists of a central office, retail establishments, and messengers who transport packages from one place to another. Customers may bring their packages to a retail establishment for delivery elsewhere or, by calling the central office, may have packages picked up at their homes or offices. The central office dispatches messengers and coordinates all pickups and deliveries. Customers may pay for deliveries when they drop off or pick up packages at a retail establishment, or the central office will bill the customer for services rendered. In addition, many packages are routed through the central office.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations conducted at the central office are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). The operations actually conducted at the central office, however, do not include any income-producting operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (c)(2)(iii) (C) and (D) of this section, business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises are treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated, and all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated. The facts and circumstances in this case (including the facts that the central office dispatches messengers, coordinates all pickups and deliveries, and is the transshipment point for many packages) establish that the operations of delivering packages from one location to another are most closely associated with the central office. Thus, the delivery operations are treated as operations that are conducted at the central office, and the deliveries are treated as income-producing operations (i.e., the performance of services for customers) that the taxpayer conducts at the central office. Accordingly, the operations conducted at the central office are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The operations conducted at each retail establishment are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). At each retail establishment, the taxpayer's operations include transactions that involve the presence of customers at the establishment. Thus, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of this section) at the retail establishments. Accordingly, the operations of each retail establishment are treated as a separate source of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section). See, however, paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain similar, commonly-controlled undertakings are treated as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer is the sole owner of a saw mill and a lumber yard. The taxpayer's business operations consist of converting timber into lumber and other wood products and selling the resulting products. The timber is processed at the saw mill, and the resulting products are transported to the lumber yard where they are sold. The saw mill and the lumber yard are at different locations (within the meaning of

paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section). The transportation operations are managed at the saw mill.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations conducted at the saw mill are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., lumber is produced at the mill). Similarly, the selling operations at the lumber yard are conducted at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are owned by the same person (i.e., the taxpayer is the direct owner of the operations). In addition, the taxpayer conducts income-producing operations (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iv) of this section) at the location (i.e., lumber is sold to customers at the lumber yard). Thus, the milling operations and the selling operations are treated as separate sources of income production (see paragraph (c)(2) of this section) and as separate undertakings (see paragraph (c)(1) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The operations conducted at the mill involve the provision of property to the lumber-yard undertaking. Nonetheless, the milling operations are income-producing operations because they relate to the production of property at the mill, and an undertaking's income-producing operations are not treated as support operations (see paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(B)(3) of this section). Accordingly, the milling operations are not support operations with respect to the lumber-yard undertaking. See, however, paragraph (f) of this section for rules under which certain vertically-integrated undertakings are treated as part of the same activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The operations of transporting finished products from the saw mill to the lumber yard are not conducted at a fixed location. Under paragraphs (c)(2)(iii) (C) and (D) of this section, business and rental operations that are not conducted at a fixed place of business or that are conducted on the customer's premises are treated as operations that are conducted at the location (other than the customer's premises) with which they are most closely associated, and all the facts and circumstances are taken into account in determining the location with which business and rental operations are most closely associated. The facts and circumstances in this case (including the fact that the transportation operations are managed at the saw mill) establish that the transportation operations are most closely associated with the saw mill. Thus, the transportation operations are treated as operations that are conducted at the mill and as part of the undertaking that consists of the milling operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Rental undertaking--(1) In general. This paragraph (d) applies to operations that are treated, under paragraph (c) of this section and before the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section, as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a ``paragraph (c) undertaking''). For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

A paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real property available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith shall not be treated as rental operations if such operations, considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity. An item of property is treated as short-term real property for this purpose if and only if such item is real property that the paragraph (c) undertaking makes available for use by customers and the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for all of the paragraph (c) undertaking's real property of the same type as such item is 30 days or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Property made available to licensees.

In each example that does not state otherwise, the taxpayer is an individual and the facts, analysis, and conclusions relate to a single taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents office space to tenants and operates a parking garage that is used by tenants and other persons. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The taxpayer's tenants typically occupy an office for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in office buildings. Some persons (including tenants) rent spaces in the parking garage on a monthly or annual basis. In general, however, spaces are rented on an hourly or daily basis, and the average period for which all customers (including tenants) use the parking garage is less than 24 hours. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 75 percent of its gross income from office-space rentals and 25 percent of its gross income from the parking garage. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The parking spaces are real property and the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the parking spaces is 30 days or less. Thus, the parking spaces are short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section). (For this purpose, individual parking spaces that are rented on a monthly or annual basis are, nevertheless, short-term real properties because all the parking spaces are property of the same type, and the average rental period taking all parking spaces into account is 30 days or less.) In addition, the parking-garage operations involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section provides, in effect, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith are treated as rental operations if and only if the operations, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)). In this case, the parking-garage operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because the average period of customer use for the parking spaces is seven days or less (see Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(ii)(A)). Accordingly, the parking-garage operations are not treated as rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The paragraph (c) undertaking's remaining operations involve the provision of tangible property (the office spaces) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. The average period of customer use for the office spaces exceeds 30 days. Thus, the office spaces are not short-term real properties, and the undertaking's operations involving the rental of office spaces are rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, at least 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the office-space operations) and at least 20 percent is attributable to operations other than rental operations (the parking-garage operations). Thus, the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply. In addition, the average period of customer use for the office spaces exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the office spaces is

not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the rental operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the rental operations and the parking-garage operations are treated as two separate undertakings (the ``office-space undertaking'' and the ``parking-garage undertaking'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the office-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (see (v) above), and the parking-garage undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (see (iii) above). Accordingly, the office-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking, and the parking-garage undertaking is not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents apartments to tenants and operates a restaurant. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The taxpayer's tenants typically occupy an apartment for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in residential apartment buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 85 percent of its gross income from apartment rentals and 15 percent of its gross income from the restaurant. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations with respect to apartments (the ``apartment operations'') involve the provision of tangible property (the apartments) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the apartments are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the apartments exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the apartment operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The restaurant operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the restaurant operations are not rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section applies because less than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to operations other than rental operations (the restaurant operations). Accordingly, the rental operations and the restaurant operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) includes both the apartment operations and the restaurant operations, and the gross income of this undertaking represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property (the apartments). Moreover, the average period of customer use for the apartments exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the apartments is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer rents hotel rooms, meeting rooms, and parking spaces to customers, rents space to various retailers, and operates a restaurant and health club. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Although some customers occupy hotel rooms for extended periods (including some customers who reside in the hotel), customers use hotel rooms for an average period of two days and meeting rooms for an average period of one day. The services provided to persons using the hotel rooms and meeting rooms are those customarily provided in hotels (including wake-up calls, valet services, and delivery of food and beverages to rooms). Some customers rent spaces in the parking garage on a monthly or annual basis. In general, however, parking spaces are rented on an hourly or daily basis, and the average period for which customers use the parking garage is less than 24 hours. Retail tenants typically occupy their space for at least one year, and the services provided to retail tenants are those customarily provided in commercial buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 45 percent of its gross income from renting hotel rooms,

meeting rooms, and parking spaces, 35 percent of its gross income from renting retail space, and 20 percent of its gross income from the restaurant and health club. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms are real property of three different types, but the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(iii)) for property of each type is 30 days or less. Thus, the parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms are short-term real properties. (For this purpose, individual parking spaces or hotel rooms that are rented for extended periods are, nevertheless, short-term real properties if the average rental period for all parking spaces is 30 days or less and the average rental period for all hotel rooms is 30 days or less.) In addition, the parking garage operations, the operations with respect to hotel rooms (the ``hotel-room operations''), and the operations with respect to meeting rooms (the ``meeting-room operations'') involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(3) (i) and (ii) of this section provides, in effect, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's operations that involve making short-term real properties available for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith are treated as rental operations if and only if the operations, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)). In this case the parking-garage, hotel-room and meeting-room operations, if considered as separate activities, would not constitute rental activities because the average period of customer use for parking spaces, hotel rooms, and meeting rooms does not exceed seven days (see Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(A)). Accordingly, the parking-garage, hotel-room, and meeting-room operations are not treated as rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The operations with respect to retail space in the building (the ``retail-space operations'') involve the provision of tangible property (the retail spaces) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the retail spaces are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(iii)) for the retail spaces exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the retail-space operations are rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The health-club operations involve making tangible property available for use by customers, but the property is customarily made available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers. Accordingly, the health-club operations are not rental operations (see paragraph (d)(3)(iii) of this seciton). The restaurant operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Accordingly, the restaurant operations also are not rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, at least 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (35 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is from the retail-space operations) and at least 20 percent is attributable to operations other than rental operations (45 percent from the hotel-room, meeting-room and parking-garage operations and 20 percent from the restaurant and health-club operations). Thus, the exceptions in paragraph (d)(2) (ii) and (iii) of this section do not apply. In addition, the average period of customer use for the retail space exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the retail space is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the retail-space operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the retail-space operations are treated as an undertaking (the ``retail-space undertaking'') and all the other operations conducted in the building (i.e., renting hotel and meeting rooms and parking spaces and operating the restaurant and health club) are treated as a separate undertaking (the ``hotel undertaking'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the retail-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity (see (iv) above). Accordingly, the retail-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking. The hotel undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because all tangible property provided for the use of customers in the hotel undertaking is either property for which the average period of customer use is seven days or less (see Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(A))

or property customarily made available during defined business hours for nonexclusive use by various customers (see Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(ii)(E)). Accordingly, the hotel undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A law partnership owns a ten-story building. The partnership uses eight floors of the building in its law practice and leases two floors to one or more tenants. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Tenants typically occupy space on the two rented floors for at least one year, and the services provided to tenants are those customarily provided in office buildings. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 90 percent of its gross income from rendering legal services and 10 percent of its gross income from renting space. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T (e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations with respect to the office space leased to tenants (the ``office-space operations'') involve the provision of tangible property (the office space) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith. In addition, the office spaces are not short-term real properties (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section) because the average period of customer use (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(iii)) for the office space exceeds 30 days. Accordingly, the office-space operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The operations that involve the performance of legal services (the ``law-practice operations'') do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Accordingly, the law-practice operations are not rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings. In this case, however, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(ii) of this section applies because less than 20 percent of the paragraph (c) undertaking's gross income is attributable to rental operations (the office-space operations). Accordingly, the law-practice operations and the office-space operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) includes both the law-practice operations and the office-space operations, and the gross income of this undertaking does not represent amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property. Thus, the undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity. Accordingly, the undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the building is owned by a separate partnership (the ``real estate partnership''), which leases eight floors of the building to the law partnership for use in its law practice and two floors to one or more other tenants. The law partnership and real estate partnership are owned by the same individuals in identical proportions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The operations conducted in the building are owned by two different persons (i.e., the law partnership and the real estate partnership). (See paragraph (c)(2)(v) of this section.) Thus, the operations conducted in the building are not treated as a single undertaking under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. Instead, each partnership's share of such operations is treated as a separate paragraph (c) undertaking (the ``law-practice undertaking'' and the ``office-space undertaking'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the office-space undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity because all of the undertaking's gross income (including rents paid by the law partnership) represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property (the office space), the average period of customer use for the office space exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the rental of the office space is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Accordingly, the office-space undertaking is treated as a rental undertaking. See, however, Sec. 1.469-2T(f)(6) (relating to certain rentals of property to a trade or business activity in which the taxpayer materially participates).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The law-practice undertaking, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity because none of the undertaking's gross income represents amounts paid principally for the use of tangible property. Accordingly, the law-practice undertaking is not treated as a rental undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a building in which the taxpayer operates a nursing home and a medical clinic. (Assume that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the operations conducted in the building are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) The nursing-home operations consist of renting apartments in the nursing home to elderly and handicapped persons and providing medical care, meals, and social activities. (Assume that these services are extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)). The medical clinic provides medical care to nursing-home residents and other individuals. Nursing-home residents typically occupy an apartment for at least one year. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 55 percent of its gross income from nursing-home operations (including the provision of medical services to nursing-home residents) and 45 percent of its gross income from medical-clinic operations. The operations conducted in the building are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The paragraph (c) undertaking's nursing-home operations involve the provision of tangible property (the apartments) for use by customers and the provision of property and services in connection therewith.

Accordingly, the nursing-home operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The medical-clinic operations do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the medical-clinic operations are not rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings.

Thus, the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section applies, and the nursing-home operations and the medical-clinic operations are not treated as two separate undertakings under paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity.

(Assumes that, under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the videocassette operations are treated as a single paragraph (c) undertaking.) Renters of videocassettes typically keep the videocassettes for one or two days, and do not receive any other property or services in connection with videocassette rentals. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 70 percent of its gross income from renting videocassettes and 30 percent of its gross income from selling videocassettes. The videocassette operations are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rental of videocassettes involves the provision of tangible property (the videocassettes) for use by customers. In addition, the special rules for short-term real properties contained in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section do not apply in this case because the videocassettes are not real property. Thus, the operations that involve videocassette rentals are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The sale of videocassettes does not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith. Thus, the operations that involve videocassette sales are not rental operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section provides, with certain exceptions, that a paragraph (c) undertaking's rental operations and its operations other than rental operations are treated as two separate undertakings.

operations, if considered as a separate activity, would not constitute a rental activity (see (iii) above). Thus, an undertaking that includes no rental operations other than the videocassette-rental operations would not, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity.

The minimum lease term for any leased automobile is 31 days, and the services provided to lessees (including periodic oil changes, lubrication, and routine services and repairs) are those customarily provided in long-term automobile leases. The paragraph (c) undertaking derives 75 percent of its gross income from selling automobiles, 15 percent of its gross income from servicing automobiles other than leased automobiles, and 10 percent of its gross income from leasing automobiles. The taxpayer's automobile operations are not incidental to any other activity of the taxpayer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The paragraph (c) undertaking's automobile-leasing operations involve the provision of tangible property (the automobiles) for use by customers and the provision of services in connection therewith.

Accordingly, the automobile-leasing operations are rental operations (within the meaning of paragraph (d)(3) of this section). The paragraph (c) undertaking's automobile-sales operations and servicing operations for automobiles other than leased automobiles (the ``selling-and-servicing operations'') do not involve the provision of tangible property for use by customers or the provision of property or services in connection therewith.

In addition, the average period of customer use for leased automobiles exceeds 30 days, extraordinary personal services (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(v)) are not provided, and the leasing of the automobiles is not treated as incidental to a nonrental activity under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(3)(vi) (relating to incidental rentals that are not treated as a rental activity). Thus, the leasing operations, if considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity, and the exception in paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the rental operations and the selling-and-servicing operations are treated as two separate undertakings (the ``automobile-leasing undertaking'' and the ``automobile selling-and-servicing undertaking'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (d)(1)(iii) of this section provides that an undertaking (determined after the application of paragraph (d)(1)(i) of this section) is treated as a rental undertaking if and only if the undertaking, considered as a separate activity, would constitute a rental activity. In this case, the automobile-leasing undertaking would, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity, and the automobile selling-

and-servicing undertaking would not, if considered as a separate activity, constitute a rental activity (see Example 8 and (ii) above).

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. During 1989, A directly owns an undivided interest in a working interest (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4)(iv)) in two oil wells. A does not participate in the activity in which the wells would be included if A's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, each well is treated as a separate undertaking in determining A's activities for 1989 because A holds the working interest directly and would not be treated as materially participating for 1989 in the activity in which the wells would be included if A's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). The aggregation rules in paragraph (f) of this section do not apply to these undertakings (see paragraph (f)(1)(ii)(B) of this section). Thus, each of the undertakings is treated as a separate activity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section. The result is the same even if A has net income from one or both wells for 1989 and even if the wells would otherwise be treated as part of the same undertaking under paragraph (c) of this section. The result would also be the same if A held the working interest through an entity, such as a general partnership, that does not limit A's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the wells pursuant to the working interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During 1989, B is a general partner in a partnership that owns a working interest (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4)(iv)) in an oil well. B does not own any interest in the well other than through the partnership. At the end of 1989, however, B's partnership interest is converted into a limited partnership interest, and during 1990 B holds the working interest only as a limited partner. B does not participate in the activity in which the well would be included if B's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the well is treated as a separate undertaking in determining B's activities for 1989 because B holds the working interest during 1989 through an entity that does not limit B's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the well pursuant to the working interest, and B would not be treated as materially participating for 1989 in the activity in which the well would be included if B's activities were determined without regard to this paragraph (e). Throughout 1990, however, B's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the well is limited by the entity through which B holds the working interest (i.e., the limited partnership). Accordingly, paragraph (e)(1) of this section does not apply to the well in 1990, and the well may be included under paragraph (c) of this section in an undertaking that includes other operations.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that B's partnership interest is converted into a limited partnership interest at the end of November 1989. An oil or gas well may be treated as a separate undertaking under paragraph (e)(1) of this section if at any time during the taxable year the taxpayer holds a working interest in the well directly or through an entity that does not limit the taxpayer's liability with respect to the drilling or operation of the well pursuant to the working interest (see Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4)(i)). Thus, although B's liability with respect to the drilling and operation of the

well is limited during December 1989, the result in both 1989 and 1990 is the same as in Example 2. In 1989, however, disqualified deductions and a ratable portion of the gross income from the well may be treated under Sec. 1.469-1T(e)(4)(ii) as passive activity deductions and passive activity gross income, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Certain trade or business undertakings treated as part of the same activity--(1) Applicability--(i) In general.

Thus, the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in undertakings A, B, and C (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Of these undertakings, only undertakings A and B are both similar and controlled by the same interests. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in undertakings A and B are treated as part of the same activity.

The predominant operations of undertakings D and E are not in the same line of business

as those of undertakings A, B, and C.

These rules apply, however, only if the supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property and services to the recipient undertaking (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section), or the supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property and services to the recipient undertaking (see paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section). In this case, undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings, and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings. Undertakings D and E, however, sell less than ten percent of their dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C and thus do not predominantly involve the provision of property and services to recipient undertakings. Similarly, undertakings D and E are not the predominant providers of property and services to undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, the rules for vertically-integrated undertakings in paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section do not apply in this case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that undertaking D sells 75 percent of its dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies if a supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests. Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(2) of this section provides that a supplier undertaking predominantly involves the provision of property to a recipient undertaking if the supplier undertaking provides more than 50 percent of its property to such recipient undertaking. In addition, paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(1) of this section provides that if a supplier undertaking and two or more similar recipient undertakings are controlled by the same interests, the recipient undertakings are treated as a single undertaking for purposes of applying paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section. Undertakings D and E both provide dairy products to undertakings A, B, and C. Thus, for purposes of paragraph (f)(4)(iii) of this section, undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings. Undertaking D predominantly involves the provision of property to undertakings A, B, and C. Moreover, undertakings A, B, and C are treated as a single undertaking under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A)(1) of this section because undertakings A, B, and C are similar to one another under paragraph (f)(4)(i) of this section, and undertakings A, B, C, and D are controlled by the same interests.

In addition, if paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(A) of this section applies to supplier and recipient undertakings, the supplier undertaking is treated under paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C)(2) of this section as an undertaking that is similar to the recipient undertakings and undertakings to which the recipient undertakings are similar. Accordingly, even though undertaking D does not provide any property or services to undertaking C, undertaking D is similar to undertaking C because undertaking C is similar to undertakings A and B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 9, except that undertakings A and B purchase 80 percent of their inventory from undertaking D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(B) of this section applies, except as provided in paragraph (f)(4)(iii)(C) of this section, if a supplier undertaking is the predominant provider of property to a recipient undertaking that is controlled by the same interests.

undertakings D and E are supplier undertakings, and undertakings A, B, and C are recipient undertakings.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (g). The facts, analysis, and conclusion in each example relate to a single taxable year, and the trade or business activities described in each example are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a number of department stores and auto-supply stores. Some of the taxpayer's department stores include auto-supply departments. In other cases, the taxpayer operates a department store and an auto-supply store at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section), or at different locations from which the same group of customers can be served. In cases in which a department store and an auto-supply store are operated at the same location, the department-store operations are the predominant operations (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4)(ii) of this section), and the undertaking that includes the stores is treated as a department-store undertaking for purposes of paragraph (f) of this section. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the department-

store undertakings are all treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer (the ``department-store activity''). Similarly, the auto-supply undertakings (i.e., the auto-supply stores that are not operated at a department-store location) are all treated as part of the same activity (the ``auto-supply activity''). (Assume that department-store undertakings and auto-supply undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The department stores and auto-supply stores use a common trade name and coordinate their marketing activities (e.g., the stores advertise in the same catalog and the same newspaper supplements, honor the same credit cards (including credit cards issued by the department stores), and jointly conduct sales and other promotional activities). Although sales personnel generally work only in a particular store or in a particular department within a store, other employees (e.g., cashiers, janitorial and maintenance workers, and clerical staff) may work in or perform services for various stores, including both department and auto-supply stores. In addition, the management of store operations is organized on a geographical basis, and managers above the level of the individual store generally supervise operations in both types of store. A central office provides payroll, financial, and other support services to all stores and establishes pricing and other business policies. Most inventory for both types of stores is acquired through a central purchasing department and inventory for all stores in an area is stored in a common warehouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the operations of the department-store activity and the auto-supply activity constitute an integrated business. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the conduct of department-store and auto-supply operations at the same location, the location of department and auto-supply stores at sites where the same group of customers can be served, the treatment of all such operations as a unit in the taxpayer's financial statements, the taxpayer's ownership and the common management of all such operations, the use of the same personnel, facilities, and equipment to conduct and support the operations, the use of a common trade name, and the coordination (as evidenced by the coordinated marketing activities) of department-store and auto-supply operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. The department-store activity and the auto-supply activity consist of trade or business undertakings and, thus, are trade or business activities. In addition, the activities are controlled by the same interests (the taxpayer), and the operations of the activities constitute an integrated business. Accordingly, the department-store activity and the auto-supply activity are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a number of stores that sell stereo equipment and a repair shop that services stereo equipment. Under paragraph (f) of this section, the stores are all treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer (the ``store activity''). The repair shop does not sell stereo equipment, does not predominantly involve the provision of services to the taxpayer's stores, and is treated as a separate activity (the ``repair-shop activity''). (Assume that stereo-sales undertakings and stereo-repair undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The stores sell stereo equipment produced by manufacturers for which the stores are an authorized distributor. The repair shop's operations principally involve the servicing of stereo equipment produced by the same manufacturers. These operations include repairs on equipment under warranty for which reimbursement is received from the manufacturer and reconditioning of equipment taken as trade-ins by the taxpayer's stores. The majority of the operations, however, involve repairs that are performed for customers and are not covered by a warranty. The taxpayer's distribution agreements with manufacturers generally require the taxpayer to repair and service equipment produced by the manufacturer both during and after the warranty period. In some cases, the distribution agreements require that the taxpayer's repair facility meet the manufacturer's standards and provide for periodic inspections to ensure that these standards are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The stores and the repair shop use a common trade name. Sales personnel generally work only in a particular store and stereo technicians work only in the repair shop. The stores and the repair shop are, however, managed from a central office, which supervises both store and repair-shop operations, provides payroll, financial, and other support services to the stores and the repair shop, and establishes pricing and other business policies. In addition, inventory for the stores and supplies for the repair shop are acquired through a central purchasing department and are stored in a single warehouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the operations of the store activity and the repair-shop activity constitute an integrated business. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the treatment of all such operations as a unit in the taxpayer's financial statements, the taxpayer's ownership and the common management of all such operations, the use of the same personnel and facilities to support the operations, the use of a common trade name, the extent to which the same customers patronize both the stores and the repair shop, the similarity of the products (i.e., stereo equipment) involved in both store and repair-shop operations, and the extent to which the provision of repair services contributes to the taxpayer's ability to obtain the stereo equipment sold in store operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. The store activity and repair-shop activity consist of trade or business undertakings and thus are trade or business activities. In addition, the activities are controlled by the same interests (the taxpayer), and the operations of the activities constitute an integrated business. Accordingly, the store activity and the repair-shop activity are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns interests in three partnerships. One partnership owns a television station, the second owns a professional sports franchise, and the third owns a motion-picture production company. The operations of the partnerships are treated as three separate undertakings. Although other persons own interests in the partnerships, all three undertakings are controlled (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) by the taxpayer. The operations of the partnerships are treated as three separate activities (the ``television activity,'' the ``sports activity,'' and the ``motion-picture activity''). (Assume that the undertakings are not similar and are not treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f) of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each partnership prepares financial statements that reflect only the results of that partnership's operations, and each of the activities is conducted under its own trade name. The taxpayer participates extensively in the management of each partnership and makes the major business decisions for all three partnerships. Each partnership, however, employs separate management and other personnel who conduct its operations on a day-to-day basis. The taxpayer generally arranges the partnerships' financing and often obtains loans for two, or all three, partnerships from the same source. Although the assets of one partnership are not used as security for loans to another partnership, the taxpayer's interest in a partnership may secure loans to the other partnerships. The television station broadcasts the sports franchise's games, and the motion-picture production company occasionally prepares programming for the television station. In addition, support staff of one partnership may, during periods of peak activity or in the case of emergency, be made available to another partnership on a temporary basis. There are no other significant transactions between the partnerships. Moreover, all transactions between the partnerships involve essentially the same terms as would be provided in transactions between unrelated persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, the television activity, the sports activity, and the motion-picture activity constitute three separate businesses. Paragraph (g)(3) of this section provides that the factors relevant to this determination include the treatment of the activities as separate units in the partnerships' financial statements, the use of a different trade name for each activity, the separate day-to-day management of the activities, and the limited extent to which the activities contribute to or depend on each other (as evidenced by the small number of significant transactions between the partnerships and the arm's length nature of those transactions). The taxpayer's participation in management and financing are taken into account in this determination, as are the transactions between the partnerships, but these factors do not of themselves support a determination that the activities constitute an integrated business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (g)(2) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business activities (within the meaning of paragraph (g)(1)(ii) of this section) are treated as a single activity of the taxpayer only if the operations of such activities constitute an integrated business and the activities are controlled by the same interests. In this case, the taxpayer's activities do not constitute an integrated business, and the aggregation rule in paragraph (g)(2) of this section does not apply. Accordingly, the television activity, the sports activity, and the motion-picture activity are treated as three separate activities of the taxpayer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Certain professional service undertakings treated as a single activity--(1) Applicability--(i) In general.

Some of the partnership's offices provide a full range of legal services. Other offices, however, specialize in a particular area or areas of the law (e.g., litigation, tax law, corporate law, etc.). In either case, substantially all of the office's gross income is derived from the provision of legal services. Under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each of the law partnership's offices is treated as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a ``law-office undertaking'').</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Each law-office undertaking derives more than 50 percent of its gross income from the provision of services in the field law.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (k). In each example, the taxpayer is an individual whose taxable year is the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In 1989, the taxpayer directly owns five condominium units (units A, B, C, D, and E) in three different buildings. Units A, B, and C are in one of the buildings and constitute a single rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). Units D and E are in the other two buildings, and each of these units constitutes a separate rental real estate undertaking. Each of the units can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section permits a taxpayer to treat a portion of the property included in a rental real estate undertaking as a separate rental real estate undertaking if the property can be separately conveyed under applicable State and local law and the taxpayer owns the property directly. Thus, the taxpayer can treat units A, B, and C as three separate undertakings. Alternatively, the taxpayer could treat two of those units (e.g., units A and C) as an undertaking and the remaining unit as a separate undertaking, or could treat units A, B, and C as a single undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section permits a taxpayer to treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity, or to treat such undertakings as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer, by combining undertakings, can treat all five units as a single activity. Alternatively, the taxpayer could treat each undertaking as a separate activity, or could combine some, but not all, undertakings. Thus, for example, the taxpayer could treat units A, B, C, and D as an activity and unit E as a separate activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For purposes of paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, a taxpayer's rental real estate undertakings are determined after the application of paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section. Thus, the taxpayer, by treating units as separate undertakings under paragraph (k)(2)(iii) of this section and combining them with other units under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section, can treat any combination of units as a single activity. For example, the taxpayer could treat units A and B as a separate rental real estate undertaking, and then treat units A, B, and D as a single activity. In that case, the taxpayer could treat units C and E either as a single activity or as two separate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer treats all five units as a single activity for 1989 and sells unit E in 1990. (See paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a rule providing that the units are treated as a single activity only if such treatment is reflected on a schedule attached to the taxpayer's return.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, rental real estate undertakings that are treated as part of the same activity for a taxable year must be treated as part of the same activity in each succeeding year. In this case, all five units were treated as part of the same activity for 1989 and must therefore be treated as part of the same activity for 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of unit E in 1990 cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in an activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-6T (relating to the treatment of losses upon certain dispositions of passive and former passive activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that is the direct owner of the five condominium units. In its return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989, the partnership treats the five units as a single activity. (See paragraph (k)(5) of this section for a rule providing that the units are treated as a single activity only if such treatment is reflected on a schedule attached to the partnership's return.) The partnership sells unit E on November 1, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (k)(2)(ii) of this section provides that a taxpayer who holds rental real estate undertakings through a passthrough entity must treat those undertakings as a single rental real estate undertaking if they are treated as a single activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity. Under paragraph (k)(4) of this section, the applicable return of the partnership for the taxpayer's 1989 taxable year is the partnership's return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. Accordingly, the taxpayer must treat the five condominium units as a single rental real estate undertaking (and thus as part of the same activity) for 1989 because they are treated as a single activity on the partnership's return for its taxable year ending in 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (k)(3) of this section, the taxpayer must continue treating the condominium units as part of the same activity for taxable years after 1989. Accordingly, as in Example 2, the five condominium units are treated as part of the same activity for 1990, and the sale of unit E in 1990 cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's interest in an activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-6T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer owns a shopping center and a vacant lot that are separate rental real estate undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). The taxpayer rents space in the shopping center to various tenants and rents the vacant lot to a parking lot operator. Most of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the shopping-center undertaking (taking into account the land on which the shopping center is built) is subject to the allowance for depreciation, but no depreciable property is used in the parking-lot undertaking.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This paragraph (k) provides rules for identifying rental real estate activities (including the rule in paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section that permits a taxpayer to treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity). Paragraph (k)(6) of this section provides, however, that these rules do not apply to a rental real estate undertaking if less than 30 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation.

Thus, the taxpayer may not combine the parking-lot undertaking, which includes no depreciable property, with the shopping-center undertaking or any other rental real estate undertaking under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section. Accordingly, the parking lot undertaking is treated as a separate activity under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that the shopping center and the vacant lot are at the same location (within the meaning of paragraph (c)(2)(iii) of this section) and are part of the same rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). Taking into account the property used in the shopping center operations (including the land on which the shopping center is built) and the vacant lot, 50 percent of the unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In this case, the vacant lot is used in a rental real estate undertaking in which depreciable property is also used. Moreover, the exception in paragraph (k)(6) of this section does not apply to the undertaking consisting of the shopping center and the parking lot because at least 30 percent of unadjusted basis of the property used in the undertaking is subject to the allowance for depreciation. Accordingly, the taxpayer may combine the undertaking with other rental real estate undertakings and treat the combined undertakings as a single activity under paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Consolidated groups--(1) In general.

The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (m).

Under Sec. 1.469-1T(h)(4)(i)(A) and (ii), the consolidated group and its members are treated as closely held corporations (within the meaning of Sec. 1.469-1T(g)(2)(ii)). Each member of the consolidated group owns a two-percent interest in partnership X and a two-percent interest in partnership Y, and owns interests in a number of trade or business undertakings (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section) through the partnerships. Each of these undertakings is directly owned by partnership X or Y, and all the undertakings of partnerships X and Y are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section) and are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section). The employees of the consolidated group and the shareholders of its common parent do not participate in the undertakings that the member corporations own through the partnerships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns interests in the undertakings through the same passthrough entity. In this case, the member corporations own interests in similar, commonly-controlled undertakings through both partnerships, and such interests are treated under this paragraph (m) as interests owned by one taxpayer (the consolidated group). Accordingly, the member corporations' interests in the undertakings owned through partnership X are treated as part of the same activity of the consolidated group, and their interests in the undertakings owned through partnership Y are treated similarly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that each member of the consolidated group owns a five-percent interest in partnership X and a five-percent interest in partnership Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section provides that trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer if the taxpayer owns a direct or substantial indirect interest in each such undertaking. In this case, the member corporations own, in the aggregate, a 15-percent interest in partnership X and a 15-percent interest in partnership Y, and such interests are treated under this paragraph (m) as interests owned by one taxpayer (the consolidated group). Thus, the consolidated group owns a substantial indirect interest in the similar, commonly-controlled undertakings owned by partnerships X and Y (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Accordingly, the member corporations' interests in the undertakings owned through partnerships X and Y are treated as part of the same activity of the consolidated group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Publicly traded partnerships. The rules of this section shall apply to a taxpayer's interest in business and rental operations held through a publicly traded partnership (within the meaning of section 469(k)(2)) as if the taxpayer had no interest in any other business and rental operations. The following example illustrates the application of this paragraph (n):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer, an individual, owns a 20-percent interest in partnership X and a 15-percent interest in partnership Y. Partnership X directly owns a hotel (``hotel 1'') and a commercial office building (``building 1''). Partnership Y directly owns two hotels (``hotels 2 and 3'') and two commercial office buildings (``buildings 2 and 3''). Each of the three hotels is a separate trade or business undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(1)(ii) of this section), and each of the three office buildings is a separate rental real estate undertaking (within the meaning of paragraph (k)(1)(ii) of this section). The three hotel undertakings are similar (within the meaning of paragraph (f)(4) of this section) and are controlled by the same interests (within the meaning of paragraph (j) of this section). Partnership X is not a publicly traded partnership (within the meaning of section 469(k)(2)). Partnership Y, however, is a publicly traded partnership and is not treated as a corporation under section 7704.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> This paragraph (n) provides that the rules of this section apply to a taxpayer's interest in business and rental operations held through a publicly traded partnership as if the taxpayer had no interest in any other business and rental operations. Thus, undertakings owned through partnership Y may be treated as part of the same activity under the rules of this section, but an undertaking owned through partnership Y and an undertaking that is not owned through partnership Y may not be treated as part of the same activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section provides that a taxpayer's interests in two or more trade or business undertakings that are similar and controlled by the same interests are treated as part of the same activity if the taxpayer owns interests in each undertaking through the same passthrough entity. Partnership Y's hotel undertakings (i.e., hotels 2 and 3) are similar and are controlled by the same interests. In addition, the taxpayer owns interests in both undertakings through the same partnership. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interests in partnership Y's hotel undertakings are treated as part of the same activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The hotel undertaking owned through partnership X (i.e., hotel 1) and the hotel undertakings owned through partnership Y are similar and controlled by the same interests, and the taxpayer owns a substantial indirect interest in each of the undertakings (see paragraph (f)(3)(i) of this section). Thus, the three undertakings would ordinarily be treated as part of the same activity under paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Under this paragraph (n), however, undertakings that are owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be treated as part of the same activity as any undertaking not owned through that partnership. Accordingly, the hotel undertaking that the taxpayer owns through partnership X and the hotel undertakings that the taxpayer owns through partnership Y are treated as two separate activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Paragraph (k)(2)(i) of this section provides that, with certain exceptions, a taxpayer may treat two or more rental real estate undertakings as a single activity or as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer's interests in the rental real estate undertakings owned through partnership Y (i.e., buildings 2 and 3) may be treated as a single activity or as separate activities. Under this paragraph (n), however, undertakings that are owned through a publicly traded partnership cannot be treated as part of the same activity as any undertaking not owned through that partnership. Accordingly, the taxpayer's interest in the rental real estate undertaking owned through partnership X (building 1) cannot be treated as part of an activity that includes any rental real estate undertaking owned through partnership Y.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(o)</em> Elective treatment of undertakings as separate activities--(1) Applicability.

The operations of each grocery store are treated under paragraph (c)(1) of this section as a single undertaking that is separate from other undertakings (a ``grocery-store undertaking''), and the taxpayer's interests in the grocery-store undertakings would be treated as part of the same activity of the taxpayer under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (o)(2) of this section provides that, with certain exceptions, undertakings that would be treated as part of the same activity under other rules in this section may, at the election of the taxpayer, be treated as separate activities. Thus, the taxpayer may elect to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity for 1989. Alternatively, the taxpayer may combine grocery-store undertakings in any manner and treat each combination of undertakings (and each uncombined undertaking) as a separate activity for 1989. In either case, the election must be made by attaching the written statement described in paragraph (o)(7)(ii) of this section to the taxpayer's 1989 return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer, in 1989, elects to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity and participates for 15 hours in each of the grocery-store undertakings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The taxpayer's interest in each grocery-store undertaking is treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1989 (a ``grocery-store activity''). In 1989, however, the taxpayer participates for more than 100 hours in the activity in which the undertakings would be included (but for the election to treat the grocery-store undertakings as separate activities) and would be treated under Sec. 1.469-5T(c)(2) as significantly participating in such activity. Accordingly, the taxpayer is treated under paragraph (o)(6)(ii) of this section as significantly participating in each of the grocery-store activities for 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1. In addition, the taxpayer, in 1989,

elects to treat each grocery-store undertaking as a separate activity. The taxpayer does not participate in any of the grocery-store undertakings in 1989 or 1990, and sells one of the grocery stores in 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As in Example 2, the taxpayer's interests in each grocery-store undertaking is treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1989. Because the taxpayer elected to treat the undertakings as separate activities for a preceding taxable year (1989), each grocery-store undertaking is also treated, under paragraph (o)(2) of this section, as a separate activity of the taxpayer for 1990. In addition, each of the taxpayer's grocery-store activities is a passive activity for 1989 and 1990 because the taxpayer does not participate in any of the grocery store undertakings for 1989 and 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of the grocery store will generally be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in a passive activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-6T (relating to the treatment of losses upon certain dispositions of passive and former passive activities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the taxpayer elects to treat the grocery-store undertakings as two separate activities.

The grocery store sold in 1990 was treated for 1989 as part of an activity that includes two other grocery stores. Thus, those three stores must be treated as part of the same activity for 1990. Accordingly, the taxpayer's sale of the grocery store cannot be treated as a disposition of the taxpayer's entire interest in a passive activity for purposes of section 469(g) and the rules to be contained in Sec. 1.469-6T.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the taxpayer is a partner in a partnership that acquires and is the direct owner of the ten grocery stores. The taxable year of the partnership ends on November 30, and the partnership acquires the grocery stores in its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. In its return for that taxable year, the partnership treats the grocery-store undertakings as a single activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paragraph (o)(3) of this section provides that a person who holds undertakings through a passthrough entity may not elect to treat those undertakings as separate activities if they are treated as part of the same activity on the applicable return of the passthrough entity. Under paragraph (o)(5) of this section, the applicable return of the partnership for the taxpayer's 1989 taxable year is the partnership's return for its taxable year ending on November 30, 1989. Accordingly, the taxpayer must treat the grocery-store undertakings as a single activity for 1989 because those undertakings are treated as a single activity on the partnership's return for its taxable year ending in 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (o)(4) of this section, the taxpayer must continue treating the grocery-store undertakings as part of the same activity for taxable years after 1989.
