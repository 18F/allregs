                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inexpensive equipment means equipment the  average purchase price of which did not exceed $150 during the period  July 1986 through June 1987.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Routinely purchased equipment means equipment that was acquired  by purchase on a national basis at least 75 percent of the time during  the period July 1986 through June 1987.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Accessories. Effective January 1, 1994, accessories used in  conjunction with a nebulizer, aspirator, or ventilator excluded from  Sec. 414.222 meet the definitions of ``inexpensive equipment'' and  ``routinely purchased equipment'' in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of  this section, respectively.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment rules. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subject to the limitation in paragraph (b)(3)  of this section, payment for inexpensive and routinely purchased items  is made on a rental basis or in a lump sum amount for purchase of the  item based on the applicable fee schedule amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Effective January 1, 1994, payment for ostomy supplies,  tracheostomy supplies, urologicals, and surgical dressings not furnished  as incident to a physician's professional service or furnished by an HHA  is made using the methodology for the inexpensive and routinely  purchased class.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The total amount of payments made for an item may not exceed the  fee schedule amount recognized for the purchase of that item.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Fee schedule amount for 1989 and 1990. The fee schedule amount  for payment of purchase or rental of inexpensive or routinely purchased  items furnished in 1989 and 1990 is the local payment amount determined  as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The carrier determines the average reasonable charge for  inexpensive or routinely purchased items that were furnished during the  period July 1, 1986 through June 30, 1987 based on the mean of the  carrier's allowed charges for the item. A separate determination of an  average reasonable charge is made for rental equipment, new purchased  equipment, and used purchased equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carrier adjusts the amount determined under paragraph (c)(1)  of this section by the change in the level of the CPI-U for the 6-month  period ending December 1987.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Updating the local payment amounts for years after 1990. For  each year subsequent to 1990, the local payment amounts of the preceding  year are increased or decreased by the covered item update. For 1991 and  1992, the covered item update is reduced by 1 percentage point.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Calculating the fee schedule amounts for years after 1990. For  years after 1990, the fee schedule amounts are equal to the national  limited payment amount.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Calculating the national limited payment amount. The national  limited payment amount is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The 1991 national limited payment amount is equal to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment  amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85  percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of 67 percent of the local payment amount plus 33  percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts if the  local payment amount exceeds the weighted average of all local payment  amounts; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sum of 67 percent of the local payment amount plus 33  percent of 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment  amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the  weighted average of all local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 1992 national limited payment amount is equal to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment  amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85  percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sum of 33 percent of the local payment amount plus 67  percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts if the  local payment amount exceeds the weighted average; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The sum of 33 percent of the local payment amount plus 67  percent of 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment  amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the  weighted average.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For 1993, the national limited payment amount is equal to one of  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 100 percent of the local payment amount if the local payment  amount is neither greater than the weighted average nor less than 85  percent of the weighted average of all local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> 100 percent of the weighted average of all local payment  amounts if the local payment amount exceeds the weighted average of all  local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> 85 percent of the weighted average of all local payment  amounts if the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the  weighted average of all local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For 1994 and subsequent years, the national limited payment  amount is equal to one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the local payment amount is not in excess of the median, nor  less than 85 percent of the median, of all local payment amounts--100  percent of the local payment amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the local payment amount exceeds the median--100 percent of  the median of all local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the local payment amount is less than 85 percent of the  median--85 percent of the median of all local payment amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment for surgical dressings. For surgical dressings furnished  after December 31, 1993, the national limited payment amount is computed  based on local payment amounts using average   reasonable charges for the 12-month period ending December 31, 1992,  increased by the covered item updates for 1993 and 1994.
