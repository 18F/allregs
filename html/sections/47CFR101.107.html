Tolerance for 2450-</p><p class="depth2">2500 MHz is 0.005%. Beginning Aug. 9, 1975, this tolerance will govern</p><p class="depth2">the marketing of LTTS equipment and the issuance of all such</p><p class="depth2">authorizations for new radio equipment. Until that date new equipment</p><p class="depth2">may be authorized with a frequency tolerance of .03% in the frequency</p><p class="depth2">range 2,200 to 10,500 MHz and .05% in the range 10,500 MHz to 12,200</p><p class="depth2">MHz, and equipment so authorized may continue to be used for its life</p><p class="depth2">provided that it does not cause interference to the operation of any</p><p class="depth2">other licensee. Beginning March 1, 2005, new LTTS operators will not</p><p class="depth2">be licensed and existing LTTS licensees will not be renewed in the</p><p class="depth2">11.7-12.2 GHz band.\2\ See subpart G of this part for the stability requirements for</p><p class="depth2">transmitters used in the Digital Electronic Message Service.\3\ Existing type accepted equipment with a frequency tolerance of 0.03% may be marketed until December 1, 1988.</p><p class="depth2">Equipment installed and operated prior to December 1, 1988 may</p><p class="depth2">continue to operate after that date with a minimum frequency tolerance</p><p class="depth2">of 0.03%.

Where such relaxation is sought, applicant must provide all calculations

and indicate the desired tolerance over each path. In such instances the radio transmitters and receivers used must individually be capable of complying with the tolerance specified in paragraph (a) of this section. Heterodyne operation is restricted to channel bandwidth of 10 MHz or greater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> As an additional requirement in any band where the Commission makes assignments according to a specified channel plan, provisions must be made to prevent the emission included within the occupied bandwidth from radiating outside the assigned channel at a level greater than that specified in Sec. 101.111.
