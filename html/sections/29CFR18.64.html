That party bears the expense of the additional record or transcript unless the judge orders otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> By remote means. The parties may stipulate--or the judge may on motion order--that a deposition be taken by telephone or other remote means. For the purpose of this section, the deposition takes place where the deponent answers the questions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Deposition officer's duties--(i) Before the deposition. Unless the parties stipulate otherwise, a deposition must be conducted before a person having power to administer oaths.

If the deposition is recorded nonstenographically, the officer must repeat the items in paragraphs (b)(5)(i)(A) and (B) of this section at the beginning of each unit of the recording medium. The deponent's and attorneys' appearance or demeanor must not be distorted through recording techniques.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> After the deposition. At the end of a deposition, the officer must state on the record that the deposition is complete and must set out any stipulations made by the attorneys about custody of the transcript or recording and of the exhibits, or about any other pertinent matters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notice or subpoena directed to an organization. In its notice or subpoena, a party may name as the deponent a public or private corporation, a partnership, an association, a governmental agency, or other entity and must describe with reasonable particularity the matters for examination. The named organization must then designate one or more officers, directors, or managing agents, or designate other persons who consent to testify on its behalf; and it may set out the matters on which each person designated will testify. A subpoena must advise a nonparty organization of its duty to make this designation. The persons

designated must testify about information known or reasonably available to the organization. This paragraph (b)(6) does not preclude a deposition by any other procedure allowed by these rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examination and cross-examination; record of the examination; objections; written questions--(1) Examination and cross-examination.

The testimony must be recorded by the officer personally or by a person acting in the presence and under the direction of the officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Objections. An objection at the time of the examination--whether to evidence, to a party's conduct, to the officer's qualifications, to the manner of taking the deposition, or to any other aspect of the deposition--must be noted on the record, but the examination still proceeds; the testimony is taken subject to any objection. An objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A person may instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to enforce a limitation ordered by the judge, or to present a motion under paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Participating through written questions. Instead of participating in the oral examination, a party may serve written questions in a sealed envelope on the party noticing the deposition, who must deliver them to the officer. The officer must ask the deponent those questions and record the answers verbatim.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Duration; sanction; motion to terminate or limit--(1) Duration. Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the judge, a deposition is limited to 1 day of 7 hours.

At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party. If the objecting deponent or party so demands, the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to obtain an order.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grounds. At any time during a deposition, the deponent or a party may move to terminate or limit it on the ground that it is being conducted in bad faith or in a manner that unreasonably annoys, embarrasses, or oppresses the deponent or party.

The party or the party's representative must store it under conditions that

will protect it against loss, destruction, tampering, or deterioration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification and delivery.
