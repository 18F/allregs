                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For submissions approved by the Board for reinsurance under  section 508(h) of the Act:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If it is determined to be marketable by the Board, the  submission may be eligible for a one-time payment of research and  development costs and reimbursement of maintenance costs for   up to four reinsurance years, as determined by the Board, after the date  such costs have been approved by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reimbursement of research and development costs or maintenance  costs will be considered as payment in full by FCIC for the submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the applicant elects at any time not to continue to maintain  the submission, it will automatically become the property of FCIC and  the applicant will no longer have any property rights to the submission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For submissions submitted to the Board for reinsurance after  publication of the interim rule on September 17, 2001, an estimated  amount of the total cost for reimbursement of research and development  costs and maintenance costs must be included with the original  submission to the Board in accordance with this section. These estimates  will be used by FCIC to evaluate if the interests of producers are  protected and to track potential expenditures and will not provide a  basis for making any reimbursements under this section. Documentation of  actual costs allowed under this section will be used to determine any  reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> To be eligible for any reimbursement under this section, FCIC  must determine that a submission is marketable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> To be considered for reimbursement of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Research and development costs, the total of the amount  requested, and all supporting documentation, must be submitted to FCIC  by electronic method or by hard copy and received by FCIC by August 1  immediately following the date the submission was first available to be  purchased by producers;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance costs, the total of the amount requested, and all  supporting documentation, must be submitted to FCIC by electronic method  or by hard copy and received by FCIC by August 1 of each year of the  maintenance period;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The procedure and time-frame in paragraphs (d)(1) or (2) of this  section, as applicable, must be followed or research and development  costs and maintenance costs may not be reimbursed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Given the limitation on funds, regardless of when the request is  received, no payment will be made prior to September 15 of the  applicable fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> There are limited funds available on an annual fiscal year basis  as contained in the Act. Therefore, requests for reimbursement will not  be considered in the order in which they are received. Consistent with  paragraphs (f), (g), (h), and (k) of this section, if all applicants'  requests for reimbursement of research and development costs and  maintenance costs in any fiscal year:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Do not exceed the maximum amount authorized by law, the  applicants may receive the full amount of reimbursement authorized under  these paragraphs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceed the amount authorized by law, each applicant's  reimbursement will be determined by dividing the total amount of each  individual applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (f),  (g), (h), and (k) of this section by the total amount of the aggregate  of all applicants' reimbursable costs authorized in paragraphs (f), (g),  (h), and (k) of this section for that year and multiplying the result by  the amount of reimbursement authorized under the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The amount of reimbursement for research and development costs,  will be determined based on the amount of reimbursement authorized under  paragraph (e) of this section, adjusted for the complexity of the  policy, plan of insurance, or rates of premium, as determined by FCIC,  and the size of the area in which the policy, plan of insurance, or  rates of premium may be offered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Policies or plans of insurance that offer new and innovative  coverages that are not currently available will be eligible for a higher  reimbursement than policies or plans of insurance that are, or have  components that are, based on existing policies or plans of insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Policies or plans of insurance that offer new premium rating or  market price methodologies will be eligible for a higher reimbursement  than policies or plans of insurance that use existing premium rating or  market price methodologies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Policies or plans of insurance that cover new commodities that  are not otherwise covered by crop insurance or that offer innovative  coverage and original policy language will be eligible for a higher  reimbursement than policies or plans of insurance for commodities for  which insurance is currently available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Policies or plans of insurance that may be offered for sale  nationwide or in large geographical regions will be eligible for higher  reimbursement than those that are applicable to only a few counties or  states or a small geographical region.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any reimbursement under this subpart will be scored as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Complexity scores:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Basic or Common Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of  insurance: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section): 0.20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Commodity Provisions and Special Provisions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of  insurance: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section): 0.20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Market prices:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of  insurance: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section): 0.20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Rates of Premium:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of  insurance: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section): 0.20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Underwriting:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Uses existing policies or plans of insurance: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contains modifications to existing policies or plans of  insurance: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section): 0.20</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Geographic scope scores:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Potential national availability: 0.10</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Potential county, state or regional availability: 0.05</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Policies or plans of insurance that receive a summed total score  for both complexity and geographic scope that is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Equal to or greater than 0.6 may receive the full amount of  reimbursement approved by the Board under paragraph (g) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Greater than 0.25 but lower than 0.60 will receive a  reimbursement that is not greater than 75 percent of the full amount of  reimbursement approved by the Board under paragraph (g) of this section;
