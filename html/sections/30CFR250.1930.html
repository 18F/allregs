                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Your SWA procedures must ensure the capability to immediately stop work that is creating imminent risk or danger. These procedures must grant all personnel the responsibility and authority, without fear of reprisal, to stop work or decline to perform an assigned task when an imminent risk or danger exists. Imminent risk or danger means any condition, activity, or practice in the workplace that could reasonably be expected to cause:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Death or serious physical harm; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Significant environmental harm to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Land;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Air; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Mineral deposits, marine, coastal, or human environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The person in charge of the conducted work is responsible for ensuring the work is stopped in an orderly and safe manner. Individuals who receive a notification to stop work must comply with that direction immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Work may be resumed when the individual on the facility with UWA determines that the imminent risk or danger does not exist or no longer exists. The decision to resume activities must be documented in writing as soon as practicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You must include SWA procedures and expectations as a standard statement in all JSAs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> You must conduct training on your SWA procedures as part of orientations for all new personnel who perform activities on the OCS. Additionally, the SWA procedures must be reviewed during all meetings focusing on safety on facilities subject to this subpart.
