                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> When the technical service provider is a private sector entity  or public agency, the decertifying official may decertify the entire  organization, including all the individuals identified as authorized to  provide technical services under the auspices of such organization. The  decertifying official may also limit the scope of decertification, for  example, to one or more specifically named individuals identified as  authorized to provide technical services under the organization's  auspices or to an organizational element of such private sector entity  or public agency. The scope of decertification will be set forth in the  decertification determination and will be based upon the facts of each  decertification action, including whether actions of particular  individuals can be imputed to the larger organization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In cases where specific individuals are decertified only, an  entity or public agency must file within 10 calendar days an amended  Certification Agreement removing the decertified individual(s) from the  Certification Agreement. In addition, the entity or public agency must  demonstrate that, to the satisfaction of the Deputy Chief for Programs,  the entity or public agency has taken affirmative steps to ensure that  the circumstances resulting in decertification have been addressed.
