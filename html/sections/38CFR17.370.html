                            <p class="depth0">Payments may be terminated if the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs determines the Veterans Memorial Medical Center has not replaced and upgraded as needed equipment during the period in which the agreements cited in Sec.  17.50 are in effect or has not rehabilitated the existing physical plant and facilities to place the medical center on a sound and effective operating basis, or has not maintained the medical center in a well-equipped and effective operating condition. Payments, however, will not be stopped unless the Veterans Memorial Medical Center has been given at least 60 days advance written notice of intent to stop payments.
