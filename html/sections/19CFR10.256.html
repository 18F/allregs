                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Submission of Certificate. An importer who claims preferential  treatment on an article under Sec. 10.255(a) must provide, at the  request of the port director, a copy of the Certificate of   Origin pertaining to the article. A Certificate of Origin submitted to  Customs under this paragraph:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be on CBP Form 449, including privately-printed copies of  that Form, or, as an alternative to CBP Form 449, in an approved  computerized format or other medium or format as is approved by the  Office of International Trade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection,  Washington, DC 20229. An alternative format must contain the same  information and certification set forth on CBP Form 449;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must be signed by the producer or exporter or by the producer's  or exporter's authorized agent having knowledge of the relevant facts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Must be completed either in the English language or in the  language of the country from which the article is exported. If the  Certificate is completed in a language other than English, the importer  must provide to Customs upon request a written English translation of  the Certificate; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> May be applicable to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A single importation of an article into the United States,  including a single shipment that results in the filing of one or more  entries and a series of shipments that results in the filing of one  entry; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Multiple importations of identical articles into the United  States that occur within a specified blanket period, not to exceed 12  months, set out in the Certificate by the exporter. For purposes of this  paragraph, ``identical articles'' means articles that are the same in  all material respects, including physical characteristics, quality, and  reputation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correction and nonacceptance of Certificate. If the port  director determines that a Certificate of Origin is illegible or  defective or has not been completed in accordance with paragraph (b) of  this section, the importer will be given a period of not less than five  working days to submit a corrected Certificate. A Certificate will not  be accepted in connection with subsequent importations during a period  referred to in paragraph (b)(4)(ii) of this section if the port director  determined that a previously imported identical article covered by the  Certificate did not qualify for preferential treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certificate not required--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Except as otherwise  provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, an importer is not  required to have a Certificate of Origin in his possession for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An importation of an article for which the port director has in  writing waived the requirement for a Certificate of Origin because the  port director is otherwise satisfied that the article qualifies for  preferential treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A non-commercial importation of an article; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A commercial importation of an article whose value does not  exceed US$2,500, provided that, unless waived by the port director, the  producer, exporter, importer or authorized agent includes on, or  attaches to, the invoice or other document accompanying the shipment the  following signed statement:</p><p class="depth4">I hereby certify that the article covered by this shipment qualifies  for preferential tariff treatment under the ATPDEA.</p><p class="depth4">Check One:  ( ) Producer ( ) Exporter ( ) Importer ( ) Agent  ---------------------------------- Name  ---------------------------------- Title  ---------------------------------- Address  ---------------------------------- Signature and Date</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exception. If the port director determines that an importation  described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section forms part of a series of  importations that may reasonably be considered to have been undertaken  or arranged for the purpose of avoiding a Certificate of Origin  requirement under Sec. Sec. 10.254 through 10.256, the port director  will notify the importer in writing that for that importation the  importer must have in his possession a valid Certificate of Origin to  support the claim for preferential treatment. The importer will have 30  calendar days from the date of the written notice to obtain a valid  Certificate of Origin, and a failure to timely obtain the Certificate of  Origin will result in denial of the claim   for preferential treatment. For purposes of this paragraph, a ``series  of importations'' means two or more entries covering articles arriving  on the same day from the same exporter and consigned to the same person.
