APHIS will publish a notice in the Federal Register and  maintain on an APHIS Web site a list of the specific areas that are  approved as areas in which Karnal bunt is not known to occur in order to  provide the public with current, valid information. Areas listed as  being free from Karnal bunt are subject to audit by APHIS to verify that  they continue to merit such listing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Handling, inspection and phytosanitary certificates.
