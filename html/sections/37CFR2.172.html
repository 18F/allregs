                                Sec.  2.172  Surrender for cancellation.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Upon application by the owner, the Director may permit any  registration to be surrendered for cancellation. The application for  surrender must be signed by the owner of the registration, someone with  legal authority to bind the owner (e.g., a corporate officer or general  partner of a partnership), or a practitioner qualified to practice under  Sec.  11.14 of this chapter. When a registration has more than one  class, one or more entire class(es) but fewer than the total number of  classes may be surrendered. Deletion of fewer than all the goods or  services in a single class constitutes amendment of the registration as  to that class (see Sec.  2.173), rather than surrender. A surrender for  cancellation may not subsequently be withdrawn.  [80 FR 2312, Jan. 16, 2015]</p>
