The notice  shall specify a place and a period of time during which the owner or  consignee shall have an opportunity to introduce testimony. Upon timely  request giving reasonable grounds therefor, such time and place may be   changed. Such testimony shall be confined to matters relevant to the  admissibility of the article, and may be introduced orally or in  writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If such owner or consignee submits or indicates his intention to  submit an application for authorization to relabel or perform other  action to bring the article into compliance with the act or to render it  other than a food, drug, device, or cosmetic, such testimony shall  include evidence in support of such application. If such application is  not submitted at or prior to the hearing, the district director shall  specify a time limit, reasonable in the light of the circumstances, for  filing such application.</p>
