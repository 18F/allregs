                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Section 467 recapture. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Internal Revenue Code, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a lessor disposing of property in a transaction to which this paragraph (a) applies must recognize the recapture amount (determined under paragraph (b) of this section) and treat that amount as ordinary income. This paragraph (a) applies to any disposition of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Is a leaseback (as defined in Sec. 1.467-3(b)(2)) or a long-term agreement (as defined in Sec. 1.467-3(b)(3));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Is not disqualified under Sec. 1.467-3(b)(1); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Allocates to any rental period fixed rent that, when annualized, exceeds the annualized fixed rent allocated to any preceding rental period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Recapture amount--(1) In general. The recapture amount for a disposition is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The recapture amount for a disposition is the lesser of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The prior understated inclusion (determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The section 467 gain (determined under paragraph (b)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prior understated inclusion. The prior understated inclusion is the excess (if any) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the period during which the lessor held the property, determined as if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement subject to constant rental accrual under Sec. 1.467-3; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest accrued by the lessor during that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Section 467 gain--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the section 467 gain is the excess (if any) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section, the section 467 gain is the excess (if any) of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount realized from the disposition; over</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The sum of the adjusted basis of the property and the amount of any gain from the disposition that is treated as ordinary income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c) (for example, section 1245 or 1250).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain dispositions. In the case of a disposition that is not a sale or exchange, the section 467 gain is the excess (if any) of the fair market value of the property on the date of disposition over the amount determined under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Special rules--(1) Gifts. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition by gift. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees. If a disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, paragraph (a) of this section applies to the disposition but the prior understated inclusion is determined by taking into account only section 467 rent and section 467 interest properly allocable to the portion of the property not disposed of by gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Gifts. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition by gift. However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees. If a disposition is in part a sale or exchange and in part a gift, paragraph (a) of this section applies to the disposition but the prior understated inclusion is determined by taking into account only section 467 rent and section 467 interest properly allocable to the portion of the property not disposed of by gift.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dispositions at death. Paragraph (a) of this section does not apply to a disposition if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined under section 1014(a). This paragraph (c)(2) does not apply to property which constitutes a right to receive an

item of income in respect of a decedent. See sections 691 and 1014(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain tax-free exchanges--(i) In general. The recapture amount in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies is limited to the amount of gain recognized to the transferor (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section), reduced by the amount of any gain from the disposition that is treated as ordinary income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The recapture amount in the case of a disposition to which this paragraph (c)(3) applies is limited to the amount of gain recognized to the transferor (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section), reduced by the amount of any gain from the disposition that is treated as ordinary income under any provision of subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). However, see paragraph (c)(4) of this section for dispositions by transferees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Dispositions covered--(A) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this paragraph (c)(3) applies to a disposition of property if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of section 332, 351, 361, 721, or 731.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section, this paragraph (c)(3) applies to a disposition of property if the basis of the property in the hands of the transferee is determined by reference to its basis in the hands of the transferor by reason of the application of section 332, 351, 361, 721, or 731.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Transfers to certain tax-exempt organizations. This paragraph (c)(3) does not apply to a disposition to an organization (other than a cooperative described in section 521) which is exempt from tax imposed by chapter 1, subtitle A of the Internal Revenue Code (a tax-exempt entity) except to the extent the property is used in an activity the income from which is subject to tax under section 511(a) (a section 511(a) activity). However, if assets used to any extent in a section 511(a) activity are disposed of by the tax-exempt entity, then, notwithstanding any other provision of law (except section 1031 or section 1033) the recapture amount with respect to such disposition, to the extent attributable under paragraph (c)(4) of this section to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition, shall be included in the tax-exempt entity's unrelated business taxable income. To the extent that the tax-exempt entity ceases to use the property in a section 511(a) activity, the entity will be treated for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section as having disposed of the property to such extent on the date of the cessation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Dispositions by transferee. If the recapture amount with respect to a disposition of property (the first disposition) is limited under paragraph (c)(1) or (3) of this section and the transferee subsequently disposes of the property in a transaction to which paragraph (a) of this section applies, the prior understated inclusion determined under paragraph (b)(2) of this section is computed by taking into account the amounts attributable to the period of the transferor's ownership of the property prior to the first disposition. Thus, for example, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest that would have been taken into account by the transferee if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement subject to constant rental accrual include the amounts that would have been taken into account by the transferor, and the aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest accrued by the transferee includes the aggregate amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest that was taken into account by the transferor. The prior understated inclusion determined under this paragraph (c)(4) must be reduced by any recapture amount taken into account under paragraph (a) of this section by the transferor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Like-kind exchanges and involuntary conversions. If property is disposed of or converted and, before the application of paragraph (a) of this section, gain is not recognized in whole or in part under section 1031 or 1033, then the amount of section 467 gain taken into account by the lessor is limited to the sum of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of gain recognized on the disposition or conversion of the property (determined without regard to paragraph (a) of this section); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The fair market value of property acquired that is not subject to the same section 467 rental agreement and that is not taken into account under paragraph (c)(5)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Installment sales. In the case of an installment sale of property to which paragraph (a) of this section applies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The recapture amount is recognized and treated as ordinary income in the year of the disposition; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any gain in excess of the recapture amount is reported under the installment method of accounting if and

to the extent that method is otherwise available under section 453.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Dispositions covered by section 170(e), 341(e)(12), or 751(c). For purposes of sections 170(e), 341(e)(12), and 751(c), amounts treated as ordinary income under paragraph (a) of this section must be treated in the same manner as amounts treated as ordinary income under section 1245 or 1250.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of this section. In each of these examples the transferor of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is entitled to the rent for the day of the disposition. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(A)</em> X and Y enter into a section 467 rental agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that the calendar year will be the rental period and that rents accrue and are paid in the following pattern:

Assume also that the rental agreement is a long-term agreement (as defined in Sec. 1.467-3(b)(3)), but it is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement. Further, because the agreement does not provide prepaid or deferred rent, proportional rental accrual is not applicable. (See Sec. 1.467-2(b)(1)(i)). Therefore, the rent taken into account under Sec. 1.467-1(d)(2) is the fixed rent allocated to the rental periods under Sec. 1.467-1(c)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 2000, X sells the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement to an unrelated person for $575,000. At the time of the sale, X's adjusted basis in the property is $175,000. Thus, X's gain on the sale of the property is $400,000. Assume that $175,000 of this gain would be treated as ordinary income under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). Under paragraph (a) of this section, X is required to take the recapture amount into account as ordinary income. Under paragraph (b) of this section, the recapture amount is the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(A)</em> In computing the prior understated inclusion under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, assume that the section 467 rent and section 467 interest (based on constant rental accrual) would be taken into account as follows if the section 467 rental agreement were a disqualified long-term agreement:

Since X did not take any section 467 rent or section 467 interest into account in 2000, the prior understated inclusion is also $65,812.55. X's section 467 gain is $225,000, which is the excess of the gain realized ($400,000) over the amount of that gain treated as ordinary income under non-section 467 provisions ($175,000). Accordingly, the recapture amount (the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain) treated as ordinary income is $65,812.55.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the section 467 rental agreement specifies that rents accrue and are paid in the following pattern:

Thus, the prior understated inclusion is $8,552.12 (the excess of the amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest based on constant rental accrual for 2000, $65,812.55, over the amount of section 467 rent and section 467 interest actually taken into account, $57,260.43). Since the prior understated inclusion is less than the section 467 gain ($225,000, as determined in

Example 1(iii)(B)), the recapture amount treated as ordinary income is also $8,552.12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that, instead of selling the property, X transfers the property to S on December 31, 2002, in exchange for stock of S in a transaction that meets the requirements of section 351(a). Under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, because of the application of section 351, X is not required to take into account any section 467 recapture.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 2003, S sells the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement to an unrelated person for $450,000. At the time of the sale, S's adjusted basis in the property is $105,000. Thus, S's gain on the sale of the property is $345,000. Assume that $245,000 of this gain would be treated as ordinary income under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code other than section 467(c). Under paragraph (a) of this section, S is required to take the recapture amount into account as ordinary income which, under paragraph (b) of this section, is the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> S owned the property in 2003 and, under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, for purposes of determining S's prior understated inclusion, S is treated as if it had owned the property during the years 2000 through 2002. In computing S's prior understated inclusion under paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the section 467 rent and section 467 interest based on constant rental accrual are the same as the amounts set forth in the schedule in Example 1(iii)(A). Thus, the constant rental amount for 2000, 2001, 2002, and 2003 is $290,709.40 ((4x$65,812.55) + $7,239.38 + $15,275.09 + $4,944.73). The section 467 rent and section 467 interest actually taken into account prior to the disposition is $262,500. Thus, S's prior understated inclusion is $28,209.40 ($290,709.40 minus $262,500 (3x$87,500)). S's section 467 gain is $100,000, the difference between the gain realized on the disposition ($345,000) and the amount of gain that is treated as ordinary income under non-section 467 Code provisions ($245,000). Accordingly, S's recapture amount, the lesser of the prior understated inclusion or the section 467 gain, is $28,209.40.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other rules relating to dispositions--(1) In general. If there is a sale, exchange, or other disposition of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement (the transfer), the section 467 rent and, if applicable, section 467 interest for a period are taken into account by the owner of the property during the period. The following rules apply in determining the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the transfer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If there is a sale, exchange, or other disposition of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement (the transfer), the section 467 rent and, if applicable, section 467 interest for a period are taken into account by the owner of the property during the period. The following rules apply in determining the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the transfer:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The section 467 rent and section 467 interest for the portion of the rental period ending immediately prior to the transfer are a pro rata portion of the section 467 rent and the section 467 interest, respectively, for the rental period. Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the transferor's section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the transferor of the property is entitled to the rent for the day of transfer, the transfer is treated as occurring at the end of the day of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the transferee of the property is entitled to the rent for the day of transfer, the transfer is treated as occurring at the beginning of the day of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of section 467 loan. If there is a transfer described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, the following rules apply in determining the transferor's and the transferee's section 467 loans for the period after the transfer, the amount realized by the transferor, and the transferee's basis in the property:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The beginning balance of the transferor's section 467 loan is equal to the net present value at the time of the transfer (but after giving effect to the transfer) of all subsequent amounts payable as fixed rent and interest on fixed rent to the transferor and all subsequent amounts payable as interest on prepaid fixed rent by the transferor. The transferor must continue to take into account interest on the transferor's section 467 loan balance after the date of the transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is equal to the principal balance of the transferor's section 467 loan immediately before the transfer reduced (below zero, if appropriate) by the beginning balance of the transferor's section 467 loan. Amounts payable to the transferor are not taken into account in adjusting the transferee's section 467 loan balance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is negative, the transferor and transferee must treat the balance as a liability that is either assumed in connection

with the transfer of the property or secured by the property acquired subject to the liability. If the beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan is positive, the transferor and transferee must treat the balance as an additional asset acquired in connection with the transfer of the property. In the case of a positive beginning balance of the transferee's section 467 loan, the transferee will have an initial cost basis in the section 467 loan equal to the lesser of the beginning balance of the loan or the aggregate consideration for the transfer of the property subject to the section 467 rental agreement and the transfer of the transferor's interest in the section 467 loan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of this paragraph (e). In each of these examples the transferor of property subject to a section 467 rental agreement is entitled to the rent for the day of the transfer. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Q and R enter into a section 467 rental agreement for a 5-year lease of personal property beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004. The rental agreement provides that $0 of rent is allocated to 2000, 2001, and 2002, and $1,750,000 is allocated to each of the years 2003 and 2004. The rental agreement provides that the calendar year will be the rental period and that the rent allocated to each calendar year is payable on the last day of that calendar year.

At the time of the sale, Q's adjusted basis in the property is $975,000. Assume that, under Sec. 1.467-1(f)(7), the disposition is not a substantial modification. Further, the Commissioner does not determine that the treatment of the agreement as a disqualified long-term agreement should be changed and, under Sec. 1.467-1(f)(4)(iii), the agreement remains subject to constant rental accrual. Thus, under paragraph (g)(2)(iii) of this section, section 467 rent and section 467 interest for periods after the disposition will be taken into account on the basis of constant rental accrual applied to the terms of the entire agreement (as modified).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section, the beginning balance of P's section 467 loan is $1,981,550.71.

Thus, Q's gain on the sale of the property is $43,449.29 ($1,018,449.29 amount realized less $975,000 adjusted basis). Q's gain is not subject to the recapture provisions of section 467(c) and paragraph (a) of this section because the rental agreement was disqualified under Sec. 1.467-3(b)(1) and, thus, the requirement of paragraph (a)(2) of this section is not met. Q recognizes no gain on the disposition of the section 467 loan because Q's basis in the loan equals the amount considered received for the loan.

Thus, the basis of P in the property subject to the rental agreement is $975,000, and the basis of P in the section 467 loan immediately following the transfer is $1,981,550.71. P takes section 467 rent and section 467 interest into account for the calendar years 2003 and 2004 under the constant rental accrual method and, accordingly, treats payments received under the rental agreement as recoveries of the principal balance of the section 467 loan (as adjusted from time to time).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Treatment of assignments by lessee and lessee-financed renewals--(1) Substitute lessee use.

Such amounts are also taken into account in determining the section 467 loan balance, prior to any adjustment thereof that may be required under paragraph (h) of this section, immediately before the effective date of the modification. Similar rules apply with respect to the section 467 rent and section 467 interest determined under the terms of the entire agreement (as modified) for purposes of computing the amount of the section 467 loan under paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section and the section 467 rent and section 467 interest for a partial rental period beginning on the effective date of the modification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Other adjustments.

If the modification involves a sale, exchange, or other disposition of the property subject to the rental agreement, an assignment of the lessee's interest in the rental agreement to a substitute lessee or a substitute lessee having use of the property during a period otherwise included in the lease term, adjustments required under this paragraph (g) are taken into account before applying paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (e), and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Exception for agreements entered into prior to effective date of section 467. This paragraph (g)(2) does not apply to a modification of a rental agreement that is not subject to section 467 because of the effective date provisions of section 92(c) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369 (98 Stat. 612)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Adjustment by Commissioner.

The rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to each calendar year during the lease term, such rent to be paid December 31 following the close of the calendar year to which it is allocated. Because the rental agreement does not provide for increasing rent, or deferred rent within the meaning of section 467(d)(1)(A), section 467 does not apply to the rental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Prior to January 1, 2001, G timely makes the $100,000 rental payments required as of December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000. On January 1, 2001, F and G modify the rental agreement payment schedule to provide for a single final payment of $500,000 on December 31, 2004. Assume that the change is a substantial modification within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii). Because the modification occurs after May 18, 1999, the post-modification agreement is treated, under Sec. 1.467-1(f)(1), as a new agreement for purposes of determining whether it is a section 467 rental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under Sec. 1.467-1(f)(5)(v), the $200,000 of rent allocated to calendar years 1998 and 1999 (periods prior to the modification) constitutes pre-modification rent, and the $100,000 rent payments made on December 31, 1999, and December 31, 2000, constitute pre-modification payments. Although calendar year 2000 is also prior to the modification, the rent allocated to calendar year 2000 is not pre-modification rent and the related payment is not a pre-modification payment because the modification changed the time at which that rent is payable. See Sec. 1.467-1(f)(5)(v)(A).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Under paragraph (g)(1)(i) of this section, F and G take pre-modification rent and pre-modification payments into account under the method of accounting they used to report income and deductions attributable to the pre-modification agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under Sec. 1.467-1(f)(1)(i), the post-modification agreement providing rent for the period beginning on January 1, 2000, and ending on December 31, 2004, is treated as a new rental agreement. This rental agreement allocates $100,000 of rent to each of the calendar years 2000 through 2004 and provides for a single rental payment of $500,000 on December 31, 2004. Because the post-modification agreement provides for deferred rent under Sec. 1.467-1(c)(3)(i), section 467 applies. Further, the post-modification agreement does not provide for adequate interest on fixed rent, and therefore F and G must account for fixed rent and interest on fixed rent using proportional rental accrual. Under paragraph (g)(1)(iii) of this section, for their taxable years which include January 1, 2001, F and G must adjust reported rent for the difference between the rent taken into account for the calendar year 2000 under the unmodified agreement and the proportional rental amount for that year under the post-modification agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, 2000, X, lessee, and Y, lessor, enter into a rental agreement for a 6-year lease of tangible personal property beginning January 1, 2000, and endingDecember 31, 2005.

Assume the agreement is not a disqualified leaseback or long-term agreement within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-3(b), and has the following allocation schedule and payment schedule:

Further, the rental agreement does not provide adequate interest on fixed rent within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-2(b). Therefore, the rent amount to be accrued by X and Y for each rental period is the proportional rental amount, as described in Sec. 1.467-2(c).

In applying the rules of this section in conjunction with the rules of Secs. 1.467-1 through 1.467-5, adjustments must be made to the extent necessary to prevent the omission or duplication of items of income, deduction, gain, or loss. For example, if a transferee lessor acquires property subject to a section 467 rental agreement at other than the beginning or end of a rental period, and the transferee lessor's beginning section 467 loan balance differs from the transferor lessor's section 467 loan balance immediately prior to the transfer, it will be necessary to treat the rental period that includes the day of transfer as consisting of two rental periods, one beginning at the beginning of the rental period that includes the day of transfer and ending with or immediately prior to the transfer and one beginning with or immediately after the transfer and ending immediately prior to the beginning of the succeeding rental period. Because the substitution of two rental periods for one rental period may change the proportional rental amount or constant rental amount, the change in rental periods should be treated as a modification of the rental agreement that occurs immediately prior to the transfer. The change in rental periods, by itself, is not treated as a substantial modification of the rental agreement although the substitution of a new lessor may constitute a substantial modification of the rental agreement. Likewise, Sec. 1.467-1(j)(2), which provides rules regarding when amounts are treated as payable, is designed to simplify calculations of present values, section 467 loan balances, and proportional and

constant rental amounts. These simplifying conventions assume that there will be no change in the lessor or lessee under a section 467 rental agreement and that the terms of the section 467 rental agreement will not be modified. Therefore, as illustrated in the example in paragraph (h)(2) of this section, when actual events do not reflect these assumptions, it may be necessary to alter the application of these rules to properly reflect taxable income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

This change in the payment schedule constitutes a modification of the terms of the rental agreement within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-1(f)(5)(i). Assume, however, that the change is not a substantial modification within the meaning of Sec. 1.467-1(f)(5)(ii). Because the modification occurs after May 18, 1999, and is not substantial, paragraph (g)(2) of this section applies. Thus, the section 467 loan balance at the beginning of 2002 must be recomputed as if the June 15, 2002, payment date had been included in the terms of the pre-modification rental agreement. If this had been the case, the section 467 rent, section 467 interest, amounts payable, and section 467 loan balances for each of the calendar years under the terms of the rental agreement would have been as follows:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Section 467                         Section 467 loan</p><p class="depth0">Calendar                Section 467 rent       interest            Payments            balance----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------2000..............................        $224,041.38                 $0            $450,000       $(225,958.62)2001..............................         224,041.38         (22,595.86)            450,000        (474,513.10)2002..............................         224,041.38         (47,451.31)                  0        (297,923.03)2003..............................         224,041.38         (29,792.30)            100,000        (203,673.95)2004..............................         224,041.38         (20,367.43)                  0                  0----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 1.467-4(b)(3) incorporates the conventions of Sec. 1.467-1(j)(2) in determining when amounts are treated as payable for purposes of determining the section 467 loan balance. Section 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(C) treats amounts payable during the first half of any rental period except the first rental period as payable on the last day of the preceding rental period. Therefore, because June 15, 2002, occurs in the first half of 2002, in determining the section 467 loan balance at the beginning of 2002 under the amended terms of the rental agreement, the $200,000 payment due on June 15, 2002, is treated as payable on December 31, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Under paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, if the recomputed section 467 loan balance is less than the section 467 loan balance

immediately before the modification, the difference is taken into account as a reduction of the rent previously taken into account by the lessor and the lessee. In this example, the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification is negative $474,513.10 and the section 467 loan balance immediately before the modification is negative $282,837.29. However, the section 467 loan balance immediately before the modification does not take into account the $200,000 payment originally payable on July 15, 2002, whereas, under the conventions of Sec. 1.467-1(j)(2)(i)(C), the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification takes into account that $200,000 payment because it is now payable in the first half of the rental period (June 15). Under these circumstances, if the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification is treated as negative $474,513.10 for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, K's gross income and J's deductions attributable to the section 467 rental agreement will be understated by $200,000. Therefore, under paragraph (h)(1) of this section, only for purposes of applying paragraph (g)(2)(ii)(B) of this section, the $200,000 payment due on June 15, 2002, should not be taken into account in determining the recomputed section 467 loan balance immediately after the modification.
