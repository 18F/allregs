If   an extension of time for payment of tax or deficiency is granted under  section 6161 or 6163(b), the district director may, if he deems it  necessary, require the executor to furnish a bond for the payment of the  amount in respect of which the extension is granted in accordance with  the terms of the extension. However, such bond shall not exceed double  the amount with respect to which the extension is granted. For other  provisions relating to bonds required where extensions of time to pay  estate taxes or deficiencies are granted under sections 6161 and  6163(b), see the regulations under section 7101 contained in part 301 of  this chapter (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Extensions under section 6163 of time to pay estate tax  attributable to reversionary or remainder interests. As a prerequisite  to the postponement of the payment of the tax attributable to a  reversionary or remainder interest as provided in Sec. 20.6163-1, a  bond equal to double the amount of the tax and interest for the  estimated duration of the precedent interest must be furnished  conditioned upon the payment of the tax and interest accrued thereon  within six months after the termination of the precedent interest. If  after the acceptance of a bond it is determined that the amount of the  tax attributable to the reversionary or remainder interest was  understated in the bond, a new bond or a supplemental bond may be  required, or the tax, to the extent of the understatement, may be  collected. The bond must be conditioned upon the principal or surety  promptly notifying the district director when the precedent interest  terminates and upon the principal or surety notifying the district  director during the month of September of each year as to the  continuance of the precedent interest, if the duration of the precedent  interest is dependent upon the life or lives of any person or persons,  or is otherwise indefinite. For other provisions relating to bonds where  an extension of time has been granted for paying the tax, see the  regulations under section 7101 contained in part 301 of this chapter  (Regulations on Procedure and Administration).
