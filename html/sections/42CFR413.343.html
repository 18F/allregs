In accordance with the methodology described in Sec. 413.337(c) related to the adjustment of the Federal rates for case-mix, SNFs must submit assessments according to an assessment schedule. This schedule must include performance of patient assessments on the 5th, 14th, 30th, 60th, and 90th days of posthospital SNF care and such other assessments that are necessary to account for changes in patient care needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Noncompliance with assessment schedule. CMS pays a default rate for the Federal rate when a SNF fails to comply with the assessment schedule in paragraph (b) of this section. The default rate is paid for the days of a patient's care for which the SNF is not in

compliance with the assessment schedule.
