                            <p class="depth0">Except as provided in Sec. 51.18 (Federal court-ordered changes),  the section 5 requirement applies to any change affecting voting, even  though it appears to be minor or indirect, returns to a prior practice  or procedure, seemingly expands voting rights, or is designed to remove  the elements that caused the Attorney General to object to a prior  submitted change. The scope of section 5 coverage is based on whether  the generic category of changes affecting voting to which the change  belongs (for example, the generic categories of changes listed in  Sec. 51.13) has the potential for discrimination. NAACP v. Hampton  County Election Commission, 470 U.S. 166 (1985). The method by which a  jurisdiction enacts or administers a change does not affect the  requirement to comply with section 5, which applies to changes enacted  or administered through the executive, legislative, or judicial  branches.
