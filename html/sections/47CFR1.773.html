Petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any provision thereof shall specify the filing's Federal Communications Commission tariff number and carrier transmittal number, the items against which protest is made, and the specific reasons why the protested tariff filing warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection under the Communications Act. No petition shall include a prayer that it also be considered a formal complaint. Any formal complaint shall be filed as a separate pleading as provided in Sec. 1.721.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Petitions seeking investigation, suspension, or rejection of a new or revised tariff filing or any provision of such a publication, must specify the pertinent Federal Communications Commission tariff number and carrier transmittal number; the matters protested; and the specific reasons why the tariff warrants investigation, suspension, or rejection. When a single petition asks for more than one form of relief, it must separately and distinctly plead and support each form of relief.

Formal complaints must be separately lodged, as provided in Sec. 1.721.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, tariff filings by nondominant carriers will be considered prima facie lawful, and
