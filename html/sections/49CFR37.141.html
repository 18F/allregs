                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Two or more entities with overlapping or contiguous service areas or jurisdictions may develop and submit a joint plan providing for coordinated paratransit service. Joint plans shall identify the participating entities and indicate their commitment to participate in the plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the maximum extent feasible, all elements of the coordinated plan shall be submitted on January 26, 1992. If a coordinated plan is not completed by January 26, 1992, those entities intending to coordinate paratransit service must submit a general statement declaring their intention to provide coordinated service and each element of the plan specified in Sec. 37.139 to the extent practicable. In addition, the plan must include the following certifications from each entity involved in the coordination effort:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A certification that the entity is committed to providing ADA paratransit service as part of a coordinated plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A certification from each public entity participating in the plan that it will maintain current levels of paratransit service until the coordinated plan goes into effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Entities submitting the above certifications and plan elements in lieu of a completed plan on January 26, 1992, must submit a complete plan by July 26, 1992.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Filing of an individual plan does not preclude an entity from cooperating with other entities in the development or implementation of a joint plan. An entity wishing to join with other entities after its initial submission may do so by meeting the filing requirements of this section.</p>
