                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insurance claims adjusters generally meet the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption, whether they work for an  insurance company or other type of company, if their duties include  activities such as interviewing insureds, witnesses and physicians;  inspecting property damage; reviewing factual information to prepare  damage estimates; evaluating and making recommendations regarding  coverage of claims; determining liability and total value of a claim;  negotiating settlements; and making recommendations regarding  litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Employees in the financial services industry generally meet the  duties requirements for the administrative exemption if their duties  include work such as collecting and analyzing information regarding the  customer's income, assets, investments or debts; determining which  financial products best meet the customer's needs and financial  circumstances; advising the customer regarding the advantages and  disadvantages of different financial products; and marketing, servicing  or promoting the employer's financial products. However, an employee  whose primary duty is selling financial products does not qualify for  the administrative exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An employee who leads a team of other employees assigned to  complete major projects for the employer (such as purchasing, selling or  closing all or part of the business, negotiating a real estate  transaction or a collective bargaining agreement, or designing and  implementing productivity improvements) generally meets the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption, even if the employee does  not have direct supervisory responsibility over the other employees on  the team.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> An executive assistant or administrative assistant to a business  owner or senior executive of a large business generally meets the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption if such employee, without  specific instructions or prescribed procedures, has been delegated  authority regarding matters of significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Human resources managers who formulate, interpret or implement  employment policies and management consultants who study the operations  of a business and propose changes in organization generally meet the  duties requirements for the administrative exemption. However, personnel  clerks who ``screen'' applicants to obtain data regarding their minimum  qualifications and fitness for employment generally do not meet the  duties requirements for the administrative exemption. Such personnel  clerks typically will reject all applicants who do not meet minimum  standards for the particular job or for employment by the company. The  minimum standards are usually set by the exempt human resources manager  or other company officials, and the decision to hire from the group of  qualified applicants who do meet the minimum standards is similarly made  by the exempt human resources manager or other company officials. Thus,  when the interviewing and screening functions are performed by the human  resources manager or personnel manager who makes the hiring decision or  makes recommendations for hiring from the pool of qualified applicants,  such duties constitute   exempt work, even though routine, because this work is directly and  closely related to the employee's exempt functions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Purchasing agents with authority to bind the company on  significant purchases generally meet the duties requirements for the  administrative exemption even if they must consult with top management  officials when making a purchase commitment for raw materials in excess  of the contemplated plant needs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Ordinary inspection work generally does not meet the duties  requirements for the administrative exemption. Inspectors normally  perform specialized work along standardized lines involving well- established techniques and procedures which may have been catalogued and  described in manuals or other sources. Such inspectors rely on  techniques and skills acquired by special training or experience. They  have some leeway in the performance of their work but only within  closely prescribed limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Employees usually called examiners or graders, such as employees  that grade lumber, generally do not meet the duties requirements for the  administrative exemption. Such employees usually perform work involving  the comparison of products with established standards which are  frequently catalogued. Often, after continued reference to the written  standards, or through experience, the employee acquires sufficient  knowledge so that reference to written standards is unnecessary. The  substitution of the employee's memory for a manual of standards does not  convert the character of the work performed to exempt work requiring the  exercise of discretion and independent judgment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Comparison shopping performed by an employee of a retail store  who merely reports to the buyer the prices at a competitor's store does  not qualify for the administrative exemption. However, the buyer who  evaluates such reports on competitor prices to set the employer's prices  generally meets the duties requirements for the administrative  exemption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Public sector inspectors or investigators of various types, such  as fire prevention or safety, building or construction, health or  sanitation, environmental or soils specialists and similar employees,  generally do not meet the duties requirements for the administrative  exemption because their work typically does not involve work directly  related to the management or general business operations of the  employer. Such employees also do not qualify for the administrative  exemption because their work involves the use of skills and technical  abilities in gathering factual information, applying known standards or  prescribed procedures, determining which procedure to follow, or  determining whether prescribed standards or criteria are met.</p>
