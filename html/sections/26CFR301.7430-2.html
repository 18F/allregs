                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. Section 7430(a)(1) provides for the recovery, under certain circumstances, of reasonable administrative costs incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding before the Internal Revenue Service. Paragraph (b) of this section lists the requirements that a taxpayer must meet to be entitled to an award of reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements for recovery--(1) Determination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service will grant a taxpayer's request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding under section 7430 and this section only if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determination by the Internal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service will grant a taxpayer's request for recovery of reasonable administrative costs incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding under section 7430 and this section only if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Jurisdiction. The underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over those issues;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Administrative proceeding. The costs were incurred in connection with an administrative proceeding as defined in Sec. 301.7430-3(a);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Administrative proceeding date. The costs were incurred on or after the administrative proceeding date as defined in Sec. 301.7430-3(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Reasonable administrative costs. The costs were reasonable administrative costs as defined in Sec. 301.7430-4;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Prevailing party. The taxpayer is a prevailing party as defined in Sec. 301.7430-5;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Not unreasonably protracted. The administrative proceeding was not unreasonably protracted by the taxpayer as discussed in paragraph (d) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Procedural requirements. The taxpayer follows the procedures set forth in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determination by court. Although the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for reasonable administrative costs where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, a taxpayer may file a claim for reasonable administrative costs with the court with jurisdiction over the judicial proceeding. The court may award the taxpayer reasonable administrative costs under section 7430(a). Under section 7430(c)(4)(C)(ii), where the final determination with respect to the tax, interest, or penalty at issue is made by a court, the court determines whether the taxpayer qualifies as a prevailing party. Thus, where the requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section are not met, the taxpayer's only possibility of obtaining an award of reasonable administrative costs is to obtain an award of such costs from the court. In the event the court awards reasonable administrative costs, it may also award litigation costs for the reasonable costs of pursuing the claim for reasonable administrative costs, provided the requirements under section 7430 regarding an award of reasonable administrative costs are satisfied with respect to such costs. A claim filed with the court should be made in accordance with the rules of the court.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Procedure for recovering reasonable administrative costs--(1) In general. The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written request to recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. The Internal Revenue Service will not award administrative costs under section 7430 unless the taxpayer files a written request to recover reasonable administrative costs in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where request must be filed. A request required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section must be filed with the Internal Revenue Service personnel who have jurisdiction over the tax matter underlying the claim for the costs, except that requests with respect to administrative proceedings defined by Sec. 301.7430-8(c) should be made to the Chief, Local Insolvency Unit. However, if those persons are unknown to the taxpayer making the request, the taxpayer may send the request to the Internal Revenue Service office that considered the underlying matter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Contents of request. The request must be in writing and must contain the following statements, affidavits, documentation, and information with regard to the taxpayer's administrative proceeding--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statements. (A) A statement that the underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over those issues;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A statement that the underlying substantive issues or the issue of reasonable administrative costs are not, and have never been, before any court of the United States (including the Tax Court or United States Court of Federal Claims) with jurisdiction over those issues;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A clear and concise statement of the reasons why the taxpayer alleges that the position of the Internal Revenue Service in the administrative proceeding was not substantially justified. For administrative proceedings commenced after July 30, 1996, if the taxpayer alleges that the Internal Revenue Service did not follow any applicable published guidance, the statement must identify all applicable published guidance that the taxpayer alleges that the Internal Revenue Service did not follow. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B), the term applicable published guidance means final or temporary regulations, revenue rulings, revenue procedures, information releases, notices, announcements, and, if issued to the taxpayer, private letter rulings, technical advice memoranda, and determination letters. Also, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B), the term administrative proceeding includes only those administrative proceedings or portions of administrative proceedings occurring on or after the administrative proceeding date as defined in Sec. 301.7430-3(c);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A statement sufficient to demonstrate that the taxpayer has substantially prevailed as to the amount in controversy or with respect to the most significant issue or set of issues presented in the proceeding;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A statement that the taxpayer has not unreasonably protracted the

portion of the administrative proceeding for which the taxpayer is requesting costs; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A statement supported by a detailed affidavit executed by the taxpayer or the taxpayer's representative that sets forth the nature and amount of each specific item of reasonable administrative costs for which the taxpayer is seeking recovery.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Affidavit or affidavits. (A) An affidavit executed by the taxpayer stating that the taxpayer meets the net worth and size limitations of Sec. 301.7430-5(f);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An affidavit executed by the taxpayer stating that the taxpayer meets the net worth and size limitations of Sec. 301.7430-5(f);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An affidavit supporting the statement described in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(E) of this section; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of administrative proceedings commenced after July 30, 1996, if more than $110 per hour, as adjusted by an increase in the cost of living as set forth in Sec. 301.7430-4(b)(3), is claimed for the fees of a representative in connection with the administrative proceeding, then an affidavit that specialized skills and distinctive knowledge as described in that section were necessary in the representation of the taxpayer in the proceeding and that there is a limited availability of representatives possessing such skills and knowledge as described in that section, or an affidavit that another special factor is applicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documentation and information. (A) A copy of the billing records of the representative for the requested fees; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A copy of the billing records of the representative for the requested fees; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> An address at which the taxpayer wishes to receive notice of the determination of the Internal Revenue Service with regard to the request for reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Form of Request. No specific form is required for the request other than one which satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c)(3) of this section. Where practicable the required statements may be included in a single document. Similarly, where practicable, the required affidavits may be combined in a single affidavit to the extent they are to be executed by the same person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Period for requesting costs from the Internal Revenue Service. To recover reasonable administrative costs pursuant to section 7430 and this section, the taxpayer must file a request for costs no later than 90 days after the date the final decision of the Internal Revenue Service with respect to all tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding is mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. The final decision of the Internal Revenue Service for purposes of this section is the document which resolves the tax liability of the taxpayer with regard to all tax, additions to tax and penalties at issue in the administrative proceeding (such as a Form 870 or closing agreement), or a notice of assessment for that liability (such as the notice and demand under section 6303), whichever is earlier mailed, or otherwise furnished, to the taxpayer. For purposes of this section, if the 90th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday, the 90-day period shall end on the next succeeding day which is not a Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday. The term legal holiday means a legal holiday in the District of Columbia. If the request for costs is to be filed with the Internal Revenue Service at an office of the Internal Revenue Service located outside the District of Columbia but within an internal revenue district, the term legal holiday also means a Statewide legal holiday in the State where such office is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Notice. The Internal Revenue Service is authorized, but not required, to notify the taxpayer of its decision to grant or deny (in whole or in part) an award for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by certified mail or registered mail. If the Internal Revenue Service does not respond on the merits to a request by the taxpayer for an award of reasonable administrative costs filed under paragraph (c)(1) of this section within 6 months after such request is filed, the Internal Revenue Service's failure to respond may be considered by the taxpayer as a decision of the Internal Revenue Service denying an award for reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Appeal to Tax Court. A taxpayer may appeal a decision by the Internal Revenue Service denying (in whole or in part) a request for reasonable administrative costs under section 7430 and this section by filing a petition for reasonable administrative costs with

the Tax Court. The petition must be in accordance with the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure and must be filed with the Tax Court after the Internal Revenue Service denies (in whole or in part) the taxpayer's request for reasonable administrative costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Unreasonable protraction of administrative proceeding. An award of reasonable administrative costs will not be made where the taxpayer unreasonably protracted the administrative proceeding. However, a taxpayer that unreasonably protracted only a portion of the administrative proceeding, but not other portions of the administrative proceeding, may recover reasonable administrative costs for the portion(s) of the administrative proceeding that the taxpayer did not unreasonably protract, if the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section are otherwise satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The provisions of this section are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Taxpayer A receives a notice of proposed deficiency (30-day letter). A requests and is granted Appeals office consideration. Appeals requests that A submit certain documents as substantiation for the tax matters at issue. Although A complies with this request, the information is misdirected and not considered by Appeals. Appeals then issues a notice of deficiency. A does not file a petition with the Tax Court. After receiving the notice of deficiency, A convinces Appeals that the notice of deficiency is incorrect and that A owes no tax. Appeals then closes the case showing a zero deficiency and mails A a notice to this effect. Assuming that the other requirements of this section are satisfied, A may recover reasonable administrative costs incurred after the date of the notice of deficiency (the administrative proceeding date). To recover these costs, A must file a request for costs with the Appeals office personnel who settled A's tax matter, or if that person is unknown to A, with the District Director of the district which considered the underlying matter, within 90 days after the date of mailing of the Office of Appeals' final decision that A owes no tax.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that after receipt of the notice of deficiency, A meets with an Appeals officer, but no agreement is reached on the tax matters at issue. A then files a petition with the Tax Court and prevails. Since the underlying tax issues have been determined by a court, the Internal Revenue Service will not grant a request for recovery of the reasonable administrative costs incurred by A. To recover reasonable administrative costs, A must file a claim with the Tax Court as prescribed under the Tax Court's Rules of Practice and Procedure.
