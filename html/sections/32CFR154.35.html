                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To conduct the required investigation, it is necessary that the  investigative agency be provided certain relevant data concerning the  subject of the investigation. The Privacy Act of 1974 requires that, to  the greatest extent practicable, personal information shall be obtained  directly from the subject individual when the information may result in  adverse determinations affecting an individual's rights, benefits, and  privileges under Federal programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Accordingly, it is incumbent upon the subject of each personnel  security investigation to provide the personal information required by  this part. At a minimum, the individual shall complete the appropriate  investigative forms, provide fingerprints of a quality acceptable to the  FBI, and execute a signed release, as necessary, authorizing custodians  of police, credit, education, employment, and medical and similar  records, to provide relevant record information to the investigative  agency. When the FBI returns a fingerprint card indicating that the  quality of the fingerprints is not acceptable, an additional set of  fingerprints will be obtained from the subject. In the event the FBI  indicates that the additional fingerprints are also unacceptable, no  further attempt to obtain more fingerprints need be made; this aspect of  the investigation will then be processed on the basis of the name check  of the FBI files. As an exception, a minimum of three attempts will be  made for all Presidential Support cases, for SCI access nominations if  the requester so indicates, and in those cases in which more than minor  derogatory information exists. Each subject of a personnel security  investigation conducted under the provisions of this part shall be  furnished a Privacy Act Statement advising of the authority for  obtaining the personal data, the principal purpose(s) for obtaining it,  the routine uses, whether disclosure is mandatory or voluntary, the  effect on the individual if it is not provided, and that subsequent use  of the data may be employed as part of an aperiodic review process to  evaluate continued eligibility for access to classified information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Failure to respond within the time limit prescribed by the  requesting organization with the required security forms or refusal to  provide or permit access to the relevant information required by this  part shall result in termination of the individual's security clearance  or assignment to sensitive duties utilizing the procedures of  Sec. 154.59 or further administrative processing of the investigative  request.</p>
