                            <p class="depth0">Each method of release detection for tanks used to meet the  requirements of Sec.  280.41 must be conducted in accordance with the  following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Inventory control. Product inventory control (or another test of  equivalent performance) must be conducted monthly to detect a release of  at least 1.0 percent of flow-through plus 130 gallons on a monthly basis  in the following manner:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inventory volume measurements for regulated substance inputs,  withdrawals, and the amount still remaining in the tank are recorded  each operating day;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The equipment used is capable of measuring the level of product  over the full range of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an  inch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The regulated substance inputs are reconciled with delivery  receipts by measurement of the tank inventory volume before and after  delivery;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Deliveries are made through a drop tube that extends to within  one foot of the tank bottom;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Product dispensing is metered and recorded within the local  standards for meter calibration or an accuracy of 6 cubic inches for  every 5 gallons of product withdrawn; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The measurement of any water level in the bottom of the tank is  made to the nearest one-eighth of an inch at least once a month.</p><p class="depth3">Note: Practices described in the American Petroleum Institute  Publication 1621, ``Recommended Practice for Bulk Liquid Stock Control  at Retail Outlets,'' may be used, where applicable, as guidance in  meeting the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manual tank gauging. Manual tank gauging must meet the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Tank liquid level measurements are taken at the beginning and  ending of a period of at least 36 hours during which no liquid is added  to or removed from the tank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Level measurements are based on an average of two consecutive  stick readings at both the beginning and ending of the period;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The equipment used is capable of measuring the level of product  over the full range of the tank's height to the nearest one-eighth of an  inch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A leak is suspected and subject to the requirements of subpart E  if the variation between beginning and ending measurements exceeds the  weekly or monthly standards in the following table:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Monthly standard</p><p class="depth3">Nominal tank capacity         Weekly standard    (average of four</p><p class="depth3">(one test)            tests) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 550 gallons or less.............  10 gallons........  5 gallons. 551-1,000 gallons...............  13 gallons........  7 gallons. 1,001-2,000 gallons.............  26 gallons........  13 gallons. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Only tanks of 550 gallons or less nominal capacity may use this  as the sole method of release detection. Tanks of 551 to 2,000 gallons  may use the method in place of manual inventory control in Sec.   280.43(a). Tanks of greater than 2,000 gallons nominal capacity may not  use this method to meet the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tank tightness testing. Tank tightness testing (or another test  of equivalent performance) must be capable of detecting a 0.1 gallon per  hour leak rate from any portion of the tank that routinely contains  product while accounting for the effects of thermal expansion or  contraction of the product, vapor pockets, tank deformation, evaporation  or condensation, and the location of the water table.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Automatic tank gauging. Equipment for automatic tank gauging  that tests for the loss of product and conducts inventory control must  meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The automatic product level monitor test can detect a 0.2 gallon  per hour leak rate from any portion of the tank that routinely contains  product; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inventory control (or another test of equivalent performance) is  conducted in accordance with the requirements of Sec.  280.43(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Vapor monitoring. Testing or monitoring for vapors within the  soil gas of the excavation zone must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The materials used as backfill are sufficiently porous (e.g.,  gravel, sand, crushed rock) to readily allow diffusion of vapors from  releases into the excavation area;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The stored regulated substance, or a tracer compound placed in  the tank system, is sufficiently volatile (e.g., gasoline) to result in  a vapor level that is detectable by the monitoring devices located in  the excavation zone in the event of a release from the tank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The measurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not  rendered inoperative by the ground water, rainfall, or soil moisture or  other known interferences so that a release could go undetected for more  than 30 days;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The level of background contamination in the excavation zone  will not interfere with the method used to detect releases from the  tank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The vapor monitors are designed and operated to detect any  significant increase in concentration above background of the regulated  substance stored in the tank system, a component or components of that  substance, or a tracer compound placed in the tank system;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In the UST excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure  compliance with the requirements in paragraphs (e) (1) through (4) of  this section and to establish the number and positioning of monitoring  wells that will detect releases within the excavation zone from any  portion of the tank that routinely contains product; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid  unauthorized access and tampering.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Ground-water monitoring. Testing or monitoring for liquids on  the ground water must meet the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The regulated substance stored is immiscible in water and has a  specific gravity of less than one;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ground water is never more than 20 feet from the ground surface  and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between the UST system and  the monitoring wells or devices is not less than 0.01 cm/sec (e.g., the  soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium sands, coarse silts or  other permeable materials);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The slotted portion of the monitoring well casing must be  designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack into the  well and to allow entry of regulated substance on the water table into  the well under both high and low ground-water conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Monitoring wells shall be sealed from the ground surface to the  top of the filter pack;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Monitoring wells or devices intercept the excavation zone or are  as close to it as is technically feasible;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The continuous monitoring devices or manual methods used can  detect the presence of at least one-eighth of an inch of free product on  top of the ground water in the monitoring wells;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Within and immediately below the UST system excavation zone, the  site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements in  paragraphs (f) (1) through (5) of this section and to establish the  number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will detect  releases from any portion of the tank that routinely contains product;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid  unauthorized access and tampering.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Interstitial monitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the UST  system and a secondary barrier immediately around or beneath it may be  used, but only if the system is designed, constructed and installed to  detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains  product and also meets one of the following requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For double-walled UST systems, the sampling or testing method  can detect a release through the inner wall in any portion of the tank  that routinely contains product;</p><p class="depth3">Note: The provisions outlined in the Steel Tank Institute's  ``Standard for Dual Wall Underground Storage Tanks'' may be used as  guidance for aspects of the design and construction of underground steel  double-walled tanks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For UST systems with a secondary barrier within the excavation  zone, the sampling or testing method used can detect a release between  the UST system and the secondary barrier;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The secondary barrier around or beneath the UST system consists  of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and  impermeable (at least 10-6 cm/sec for the regulated substance  stored) to direct a release to the monitoring point and permit its  detection;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The barrier is compatible with the regulated substance stored  so that a release from the UST system will not cause a deterioration of  the barrier allowing a release to pass through undetected;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For cathodically protected tanks, the secondary barrier must  be installed so that it does not interfere with the proper operation of  the cathodic protection system;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The ground water, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render  the testing or sampling method used inoperative so that a release could  go undetected for more than 30 days;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The site is assessed to ensure that the secondary barrier is  always above the ground water and not in a 25-year flood plain, unless  the barrier and monitoring designs are for use under such conditions;  and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Monitoring wells are clearly marked and secured to avoid  unauthorized access and tampering.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For tanks with an internally fitted liner, an automated device  can detect a release between the inner wall of the tank and the liner,  and the liner is compatible with the substance stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Other methods. Any other type of release detection method, or  combination of methods, can be used if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It can detect a 0.2 gallon per hour leak rate or a release of  150 gallons within a month with a probability of detection of 0.95 and a  probability of false alarm of 0.05; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The implementing agency may approve another method if the owner  and operator can demonstrate that the   method can detect a release as effectively as any of the methods allowed  in paragraphs (c) through (h) of this section. In comparing methods, the  implementing agency shall consider the size of release that the method  can detect and the frequency and reliability with which it can be  detected. If the method is approved, the owner and operator must comply  with any conditions imposed by the implementing agency on its use to  ensure the protection of human health and the environment.</p>
