Sec. 239.14 and 274.11a-1 of this chapter) is effective;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Bringing the financial statements up to date under section 10(a)(3) of the Act [15 U.S.C. 77j(a)(3)] or rule 3-18 of Regulation S-X [17 CFR 210.3-18];</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Designating a new effective date for a previously filed post-effective amendment or registration statement for additional shares under paragraph (a) of this section, which has not yet become effective, Provided, that the new effective date shall be no earlier than the effective date designated in the previously filed amendment or registration statement under paragraph (a) of this section and no later than thirty days after that date;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Disclosing or updating the information required by Item 9c of Form N-2 [17 CFR 239.14 and 274.11a-1];</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Making any non-material changes which the registrant deems appropriate; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any other purpose which the Commission shall approve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The registrant represents that the amendment is filed solely for one or more of the purposes specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section and that no material event requiring disclosure in the prospectus, other than one listed in paragraph (b)(1) or one for which the Commission has approved a filing under paragraph (b)(1)(vi) of this section, has occurred since the latest of the following three dates:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The effective date of the registrant's registration statement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The effective date of its most recent post-effective amendment to its registration statement which included a prospectus; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The filing date of a post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section which has not become effective; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amendment or registration statement recites on the facing sheet thereof that the registrant proposes that the amendment or registration statement will become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The representations of the registrant referred to in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be made by certification on the signature page of the post-effective amendment or registration statement that the amendment or registration statement meets all of the requirements for effectiveness under paragraph (b) of this section.

filed under paragraph (b) of this section, counsel shall furnish to the Commission at the time the amendment or registration statement is filed a written representation that the amendment or registration statement does not contain disclosure which would render it ineligible to become effective under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Incomplete or inaccurate amendments; suspension of use of paragraph (b) of this section.

Following such action by the Commission, the registrant may file with the Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for such a hearing is included in the petition.

The notice of such suspension shall be in writing and shall specify the period for which such suspension shall remain in effect. The Commission may issue a suspension if it appears to the Commission that a registrant which files a post-effective amendment under paragraph (b) of this section has not complied with the conditions of that paragraph. Any suspension under this paragraph shall become effective at such time as the Commission furnishes written notice thereof to the company. Any such suspension, so long as it is in effect, shall apply to any post-effective amendment or registration statement that has been filed but has not, at the time of such suspension, become effective, and to any post-effective amendment or registration statement that may be filed after the suspension. Any suspension shall apply only to the ability to file a post-effective amendment or registration statement under paragraph (b) of this section and shall not otherwise affect any post-effective amendment or registration statement. Following this action by the Commission, the registrant may file with the Commission at any time a petition for review of the suspension. The Commission will order a hearing on the matter if a request for a hearing is included in the petition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subsequent amendments. (1) Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment or registration statement which includes a prospectus shall not become effective under paragraph (a) of this section if a subsequent post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to the prospectus is filed before such amendment or registration statement becomes effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (d)(2) of this section, a post-effective amendment or registration statement which includes a prospectus shall not become effective under paragraph (a) of this section if a subsequent post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to the prospectus is filed before such amendment or registration statement becomes effective.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A post-effective amendment or registration statement which includes a prospectus shall become effective under paragraph (a) of this section notwithstanding the filing of a subsequent post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to the prospectus, Provided, that the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The subsequent amendment or registration statement is filed under paragraph (b) of this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The subsequent amendment or registration statement designates as its effective date either:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The date on which the prior post-effective amendment or registration statement was to become effective under paragraph (a) of this section or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.
In this case the prior post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (a) of this section and any prior post-effective amendment or registration statement filed under paragraph (b) of this section

shall also become effective on the new effective date designated under paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (d)(1) and (d)(2) of this section, if another post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to the same prospectus is filed under paragraph (a) of this section before the prior amendments or registration statements filed under paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section have become effective, none of such prior amendments or registration statements shall become effective under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Condition to use of paragraphs (a) or (b). A post-effective amendment or new registration statement shall not become effective under paragraphs (a) or (b) of this section unless within two years prior to the filing thereof a post-effective amendment or registration statement relating to the common stock of the registrant has become effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Electronic filers. When ascertaining the date of filing, electronic filers should not presume a registration statement has been accepted until notice of acceptance has been received from the Commission.</p><p class="depth2">Note: To determine the date of automatic effectiveness, the day following the filing date is the first day of the time period. For example, a post-effective amendment filed under paragraph (a) of this section on November 1 would become effective on December 31.
