                                Sec. 2634.403  General description of trusts.

                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Qualified blind trust. (1) The qualified blind trust is the most universally adaptable qualified trust. An interested party may put most types of assets (such as cash, stocks, bonds, mutual funds or real estate) into a qualified blind trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a qualified blind trust, 18 U.S.C. 208 and other Federal conflict of interest statutes and regulations apply to the assets that an interested party transfers to the trust until such time as he or she is notified by the independent trustee that such asset has been disposed of or has a value of less than $1,000. Because the employee knows what assets he or she placed in the trust and there is no requirement that these assets be diversified, the possibility still exists that the employee could be influenced in the performance of official duties by those interests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Qualified diversified trust. (1) An interested party may put only readily marketable securities into a qualified diversified trust. In addition, the portfolio must meet the diversification requirements of Sec. 2634.406(b)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a qualified diversified trust, the conflict of interest laws do not apply to the assets that an interested party transfers to the trust. Because the assets that an interested party puts into this trust must meet the diversification requirements set forth in this regulation, the diversification achieves ``blindness'' with regard to the initial assets.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special notice for Presidential appointees--(i) In general. In any case in which the establishment of a qualified diversified trust is contemplated with respect to an individual whose nomination is being considered by a Senate committee, that individual shall inform the committee of the intention to establish a qualified diversified trust at the time of filing a financial disclosure report with the committee. There is a section on the public financial disclosure form, the OGE Form 278, for the individual to indicate whether he or she intends to create a qualified diversified trust.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Applicability. Paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section is not applicable to members of the uniformed services or Foreign Service officers. The special notice requirement of this section shall not preclude an individual from seeking the certification of a qualified blind trust or qualified diversified trust after the Senate has given its advice and consent to a nomination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conflict of interest laws. In the case of each type of trust, the conflict of interest laws do not apply to the assets

that the independent trustee or any other designated fiduciary adds to the trust.</p>
