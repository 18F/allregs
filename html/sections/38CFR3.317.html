Specific functional gastrointestinal disorders include, but are not limited to, irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, functional vomiting, functional constipation, functional bloating, functional abdominal pain syndrome, and functional dysphagia. These disorders are commonly characterized by symptoms including abdominal pain, substernal burning or pain, nausea, vomiting, altered bowel habits (including diarrhea, constipation), indigestion, bloating, postprandial fullness, and painful or difficult swallowing. Diagnosis of specific functional gastrointestinal disorders is made in accordance with established medical principles, which generally require symptom onset at least 6 months prior to diagnosis and the presence of symptoms sufficient to diagnose the specific disorder at least 3 months prior to diagnosis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section, the term medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness means a diagnosed illness without conclusive pathophysiology or etiology, that is characterized by overlapping symptoms and signs and has features such as fatigue, pain, disability out of proportion to physical findings, and inconsistent demonstration of laboratory abnormalities. Chronic multisymptom illnesses of partially understood etiology and pathophysiology, such as diabetes and multiple sclerosis, will not be considered medically unexplained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of this section, ``objective indications of chronic disability'' include both ``signs,'' in the medical sense of objective evidence perceptible to an examining physician, and other, non-medical indicators that are capable of independent verification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this section, disabilities that have existed for 6 months or more and disabilities that exhibit intermittent episodes of improvement and worsening over a 6-month period

will be considered chronic. The 6-month period of chronicity will be measured from the earliest date on which the pertinent evidence establishes that the signs or symptoms of the disability first became manifest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A qualifying chronic disability referred to in this section shall be rated using evaluation criteria from part 4 of this chapter for a disease or injury in which the functions affected, anatomical localization, or symptomatology are similar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A qualifying chronic disability referred to in this section shall be considered service connected for purposes of all laws of the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Compensation shall not be paid under this section for a chronic disability:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disability was not incurred during active military, naval, or air service in the Southwest Asia theater of operations; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disability was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the veteran's most recent departure from active duty in the Southwest Asia theater of operations and the onset of the disability; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disability is the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Signs or symptoms of undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illnesses. For the purposes of paragraph (a)(1) of this section, signs or symptoms which may be manifestations of undiagnosed illness or medically unexplained chronic multisymptom illness include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fatigue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Signs or symptoms involving skin.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Headache.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Muscle pain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Joint pain.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Neurological signs or symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Neuropsychological signs or symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Signs or symptoms involving the respiratory system (upper or lower).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Sleep disturbances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Gastrointestinal signs or symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Cardiovascular signs or symptoms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Abnormal weight loss.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Menstrual disorders.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Presumptive service connection for infectious diseases.

Malaria must have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more within 1 year from the date of separation from a qualifying period of service or at a time when standard or accepted treatises indicate that the incubation period commenced during a qualifying period of service. There is no time limit for visceral leishmaniasis or tuberculosis to have become manifest to a degree of 10 percent or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), the term qualifying period of service means a period of service meeting the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section or a period of active military, naval, or air service on or after September 19, 2001, in Afghanistan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A disease listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section shall not be presumed service connected:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disease was not incurred during a qualifying period of service; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disease was caused by a supervening condition or event that occurred between the veteran's most recent departure from a qualifying period of service and the onset of the disease; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If there is affirmative evidence that the disease is the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or the abuse of alcohol or drugs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Long-term health effects potentially associated with infectious diseases.

These health effects and diseases are listed alphabetically and are not categorized by the level of association stated in the National Academy of Sciences report (see Table to Sec.  3.317). If a veteran who has or had an infectious disease identified in column A also has a condition identified in column B as potentially related to that infectious disease, VA must determine, based on the evidence in each case, whether the column B condition was caused by the infectious disease for purposes of paying disability compensation.
