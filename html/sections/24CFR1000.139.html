HUD will consider an application for approval of a self-insurance plan submitted under this section and approve or disapprove that application no later than 90 days from the date of receipt of a complete application. If an application is disapproved, HUD shall notify the applicant of the reasons for disapproval and may offer technical assistance to a recipient to help the recipient correct the deficiencies in the application. The recipient may then resubmit the application under this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual reporting. An approved plan must undergo an audit and actuarial review annually. In addition, an evaluation of the plan's management must be performed by an insurance professional every three years. These audits, actuarial reviews, and management reviews must be submitted to HUD within 90 days after the end of the insuring entity's fiscal year and be prepared in accordance with the following standards:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The annual financial statement must be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and audited by an independent auditor in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. The independent auditor shall state in writing an opinion on whether the plan's financial statement is presented fairly, in accordance with GAAP;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The actuarial review of the plan shall be done consistently with requirements established by the Association of Governmental Risk Pools and conducted by an independent property or casualty actuary who is a member of a recognized professional actuarial organization, such as the American Academy of Actuaries.

The plan's management will be notified in writing of the proposed revocation of its approval and of the manner and time in which to request a hearing to challenge the determination, in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in this part for model housing activities (Sec. 1000.118).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Preemption. In order that tribally owned Indian housing insurance entities that provide insurance for IHBG-assisted housing will not be subject to conflicting state laws and widely varying and costly requirements, any self-insurance plan under this section that meets the requirements of this section and that has been approved by HUD shall be governed by the regulations of this subpart in its provision of insurance for IHBG-assisted housing.
