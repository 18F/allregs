                            <p class="depth0">We may, under the provisions of this section, issue a permit  authorizing the taking, possession, transportation within the United  States, or transportation into or out of the United States of lawfully  possessed bald eagles or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or eggs  for the scientific or exhibition purposes of public museums, public  scientific societies, or public zoological parks. We will not issue a  permit under this section that authorizes the transportation into or out  of the United States of any live bald or golden eagles, or any live eggs  of these birds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> How do I apply if I want a permit for scientific and exhibition  purposes? (1) You must submit applications for permits to take, possess,  or transport within the United States lawfully acquired live or dead  bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or live or dead eggs for  scientific or exhibition purposes to the appropriate Regional Director-- Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office. You can find addresses for the  Regional Directors in 50 CFR 2.2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If you want a permit to transport into or out of the United  States any lawfully acquired dead bald or golden eagles or their parts,  nests, or dead eggs for scientific or exhibition purposes, you must  submit your application to the Office of Management Authority. Your  application must contain all the information necessary for the issuance  of a CITES permit. You must also comply with all the requirements in  part 23 of this subchapter before international travel. Mail should be  sent to the Division of Management Authority at the address provided at  50 CFR 2.1(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Your application for any permit under this section must also  contain the information required under this section, Sec.  13.12(a) of  this subchapter, and the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Species of eagle and number of such birds, nests, or eggs  proposed to be taken, possessed, or transported;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Specific locality in which taking is proposed, if any;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Method taking proposed, if any;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If not taken, the source of eagles and other circumstances  surrounding the proposed acquisition or transportation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Name and address of the public museum, public scientific  societies, or public zoological park for which they are intended;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Complete explanation and justification of request, nature of  project or study, number of specimens now at institution, reason these  are inadequate, and other appropriate explanations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What are the conditions? In addition to the general conditions  in part 13 of this subchapter B, permits to take, possess, transport  within the   United States, or transport into or out of the United States bald or  golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or eggs for scientific or  exhibition purposes, are also subject to the following condition: In  addition to any reporting requirement specifically noted in the permit,  you must submit a report of activities conducted under the permit to the  Regional Director--Attention: Migratory Bird Permit Office, within 30  days after the permit expires.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> How do we evaluate your application for a permit? We will  conduct an investigation and will only issue a permit to take, possess,  transport within the United States, or transport into or out of the  United States bald or golden eagles, or their parts, nests, or eggs for  scientific or exhibition purposes when we determine that the taking,  possession, or transportation is compatible with the preservation of the  bald eagle and golden eagle. In making this determination, we will  consider, among other criteria, the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The direct or indirect effect which issuing such permit would be  likely to have upon the wild populations of bald and golden eagles;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whether the expertise, facilities, or other resources available  to the applicant appear adequate to successfully accomplish the  objectives stated in the application;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Whether the justification of the purpose for which the permit is  being requested is adequate to justify the removal of the eagle from the  wild or otherwise change its status; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether the applicant has demonstrated that the permit is being  requested for bona fide scientific or exhibition purposes of public  museums, public scientific societies, or public zoological parks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Tenure of permits. The tenure of permits to take bald or golden  eagles for scientific or exhibition purposes shall be that shown on the  face of the permit.
