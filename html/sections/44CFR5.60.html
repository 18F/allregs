                            <p class="depth0">Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4)(F), whenever the district court, described in Sec. 5.59 orders the production of any FEMA records improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether FEMA personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel in the Merit Systems Protection Board is required to initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who primarily was responsible for the withholding. The Special Counsel after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, submits findings and recommendations to the Administrator of FEMA and sends copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his or her representative. The law requires the Administrator to take any corrective action which the Special Counsel recommends.
