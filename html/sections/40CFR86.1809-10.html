                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> No new light-duty vehicle, light-duty truck, medium-duty  passenger vehicle, or complete heavy-duty vehicle shall be equipped with  a defeat device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Administrator may test or require testing on any vehicle at  a designated location, using driving cycles and conditions that may  reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use,  for the purposes of investigating a potential defeat device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For cold temperature CO and cold temperature NMHC emission  control, the Administrator will use a guideline to determine the  appropriateness of the CO and NMHC emission control at ambient  temperatures between 25 F (the upper bound of the temperatue test  range) and 68 F (the lower bound of the FTP range). The guideline for  CO emission congruity across the intermediate temperature range is the  linear interpolation between the CO standard applicable at 25 F and the  CO standard applicable at 68 F. The guideline for NMHC emission  congruity across the intermediate temperature range is the linear  interpolation between the NMHC FEL pass limit (e.g. 0.3499 g/mi for a  0.3 g/mi FEL) applicable at 20 F and the Tier 2 NMOG standard to which  the vehicle was certified at 68 F, where the intermediate temperature  NMHC level is rounded to the nearest hundredth for comparison to the  interpolated line. For vehicles that exceed this CO emissions guideline  or this NMHC emissions guideline upon intermediate temperature cold  testing:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the CO emission level is greater than the 20 F emission  standard, the vehicle will automatically be considered to be equipped  with a defeat device without further investigation. If the intermediate  temperature NMHC emission level, rounded to the nearest hundredth, is  greater than the 20 F FEL pass limit, the vehicle will be presumed to  have a defeat device unless the manufacturer provides evidence to EPA's  satisfaction that the cause of the test result in question is not due to  a defeat device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the CO emission level does not exceed the 20 F emission  standard, the Administrator may investigate the vehicle design for the  presence of a defeat device under paragraph (d) of this section. If the  intermediate temperature NMHC emission level, rounded to the nearest  hundredth, does not exceed the 20 F FEL pass limit the Administrator  may investigate the vehicle design for the presence of a defeat device  under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The following provisions apply for vehicle designs designated by  the Administrator to be investigated for possible defeat devices:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The manufacturer must show to the satisfaction of the  Administrator that the vehicle design does not incorporate strategies  that unnecessarily reduce emission control effectiveness exhibited  during the Federal Test Procedure or Supplemental Federal Test Procedure  (FTP or SFTP) when the vehicle is operated under conditions that may  reasonably be expected to be encountered in normal operation and use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following information requirements apply:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Upon request by the Administrator, the manufacturer must provide  an explanation containing detailed information regarding test programs,  engineering evaluations, design specifications, calibrations, on-board  computer algorithms, and design strategies incorporated for operation  both during and outside of the Federal emission test procedure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of investigations of possible cold temperature CO  or cold temperature NMHC defeat devices   under this paragraph (d), the manufacturer must provide an explanation  to show, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that CO emissions and  NMHC emissions are reasonably controlled in reference to the linear  guideline across the intermediate temperature range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For each test group of Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs and  interim non-Tier 2 LDV/LLDTs and HLDT/MDPVs the manufacturer must  submit, with the Part II certification application, an engineering  evaluation demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Administrator that a  discontinuity in emissions of non-methane organic gases, carbon  monoxide, oxides of nitrogen and formaldehyde measured on the Federal  Test Procedure (subpart B of this part) does not occur in the  temperature range of 20 to 86 F. For diesel vehicles, the engineering  evaluation must also include particulate emissions.  [72 FR 8561, Feb. 26, 2007]</p>
