                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Matching rental assistance with supportive services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To  qualify for rental assistance grants, an applicant must certify that it  will provide or ensure the provision of supportive services, including  funding the services itself if the planned resources do not become  available for any reason, appropriate to the needs of the population  being served, and at least equal in value to the aggregate amount of  rental assistance funded by HUD. The supportive services may be newly  created for the program or already in operation, and may be provided or  funded by other Federal, State, local, or private programs in accordance  with 42 U.S.C. 11403b. This statute provides that a recipient may use  funds from any source, including any other Federal source (but excluding  the specific statutory subtitle from which S+C funds are provided), as  well as State, local, and private sources, provided that funds from the  other source are not statutorily prohibited to be used as a match.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Only services that are provided after the execution of the grant  agreement may count toward the match.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It is the responsibility of the recipient to ensure that any  funds or services used to satisfy the matching requirements of this  section are eligible under the laws governing the funds or services to  be used as matching funds or services for a grant awarded under this  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability to participants. Recipients must give reasonable  assurances that supportive services will be available to participants  for the entire term of the rental assistance. The value of the services  provided to a participant, however, does not have to equal the amount of  rental assistance provided that participant, nor does the value have to  be equal to the amount of rental assistance on a year-to-year basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Calculating the value of supportive services. In calculating the  amount of the matching supportive services, applicants may count:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Salaries paid to staff of the recipient to provide supportive  services to S+C participants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The value of supportive services provided by other persons or  organizations to S+C participants;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The value of time and services contributed by volunteers at the  rate of $10.00 an hour, except for donated professional services which  may be counted at the customary charge for the service provided  (professional services are services ordinarily performed by donors for  payment, such as the services of health professionals, that   are equivalent to the services they provide in their occupations);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The value of any lease on a building used for the provision of  supportive services, provided the value included in the match is no more  than the prorated share used for the program; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The cost of outreach activities, as described in Sec.   582.325(a) of this part.
