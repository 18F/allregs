premium payment. For example, if VA receives your application and premium payment on August 15, you may request an effective date of February 1 or the first day of any month following up to August 1. However, you must pay the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The insurance reserve amount for the time period for each month starting with the requested effective date up to the first day of the month prior to the month in which you delivered your application to VA; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The premium for the month in which you delivered your application to VA.</p><p class="depth4">Note to paragraph (c): For example, if your postmark date is August 15 and you request an effective date of February 1, you must pay the insurance reserve amount for February 1 through July 31, and also pay the August premium.
