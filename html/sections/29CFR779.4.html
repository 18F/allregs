                            <p class="depth0">There are many employees of retailers as well as other employees who would not be subject to the minimum wage or overtime pay provisions of the Act as it was prior to the 1966 amendments, either because of their individual activities or because of the activities of the enterprise in which they are employed, but who are brought under the minimum wage or overtime provisions, or both, for the first time by the changed enterprise coverage provisions or changes in exemptions, or both, which were enacted as part of the amendments and made effective February 1, 1967. The following pay standards apply to this newly covered employment, unless a specific exemption has been retained or provided in the amendments; such employees must be paid not less than the minimum wages for hours worked and not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay for overtime, as shown in the following schedule:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Minimum wage                          Beginning------------------------------------------------------------------------$1.00 an hour............................

February 1, 1970.$1.60 an hour............................  February 1, 1971 and</p><p class="depth0">thereafter.------------------------------------------------------------------------

In each instance where there is an increase in the minimum wage, the new minimum wage rate becomes effective 12:01 a.m., on the date indicated. (Minimum wage rates for newly covered employees in Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and American Samoa are set by wage order under special industry committee procedures. Information on these rates and their effective dates may be obtained at any office of the Wage and Hour Division.)

Feb. 1, 1968.After 40 hours in a workweek and           Feb. 1, 1969.</p><p class="depth0">thereafter.------------------------------------------------------------------------

In each instance where a new overtime pay standard is applicable, it shall be effective as to any workweek beginning on or after the date indicated.</p>
