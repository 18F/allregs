Reproduced asexually through cuttings, tissue  culture, suckers, or crown division. For the purposes of this subpart, a  Berberis plant will be considered clonally propagated only if its parent  stock is, or was derived from, a seed-propagated black stem rust- resistant plant of more than 2 years' growth.</p><p class="depth0">Compliance agreement. A written agreement between a State that is a  protected area or that encompasses a protected area and a person who  moves regulated articles interstate, or in a non-protected area between  APHIS and   such person, in which that person agrees to comply with this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Departmental permit. A document issued by the Administrator in which  he or she affirms that interstate movement of the regulated article  identified on the document is for scientific or experimental purposes,  and that the regulated article is eligible for interstate movement under  the conditions specified on the Departmental permit and found by the  Administrator to be adequate to prevent the introduction of rust- susceptible varieties of the genera Berberis, Mahoberberis, and Mahonia  into protected areas.</p><p class="depth0">Inspector. Any APHIS employee or other person authorized by the  Administrator in accordance with law to enforce this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Interstate. From any State into or through any other State.</p><p class="depth0">Limited permit.

All plants of the genera Berberis,  Mahoberberis, and Mahonia, and their progeny, that have proven resistant  to black stem rust during testing by the United States Department of  Agriculture, \2\ and that are listed as rust-resistant under Sec.  301.38-2 (a)(1) and (a)(2). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Testing is performed by the Agricultural Research Service of  USDA as follows: In a greenhouse, the suspect plant, or test subject, is  placed under a screen with a control plant, i.e., a known rust- susceptible variety of Berberis, Mahoberberis, or Mahonia. Infected  wheat stems, a primary host of black stem rust, are placed on top of the  screen. The plants are moistened and maintained in 100% humidity,  causing the spores to swell and fall on the plants lying under the  screen. The plants are then observed for 7 days at 20-80% relative  humidity. This test procedure is repeated 12 times. If in all 12 tests,  the rust-susceptible plant shows signs of infection after 7 days and the  test plants do not, USDA will declare the test plant variety rust- resistant. The tests must be performed on new growth, just as the leaves  are unfolding. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Rust-susceptible plants. All plants of the genera Berberis,  Mahoberberis, and Mahonia not listed as rust-resistant under Sec.  301.38-2 (a)(1) and (a)(2).</p><p class="depth0">Regulated article. Any article listed in Sec. 301.38-2 (a)(1)  through (a)(3) of this subpart or otherwise designated as a regulated  article in accordance with Sec. 301.38-2(a)(4) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">Seedling.
