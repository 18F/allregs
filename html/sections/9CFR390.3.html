Quarterly publication of the  index is unnecessary and impractical, since the material is voluminous  and does not change often enough to justify the expense of quarterly  publication. The Agency will provide copies of any index, upon request,  at a cost not to exceed direct cost of duplication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> FSIS is responsible for preparing reference material or a guide  for requesting records or information from the Agency. This guide also  will include an index of all major information systems and a description  of major information and record locator systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FSIS will prepare a handbook for obtaining information from the  Agency. The handbook will be available on paper and through electronic  means, and will discuss how the public can use it to access Agency FOIA  annual reports. Similarly, the annual reports will refer to the handbook  and how to obtain it.</p>
