(i) The boat must be rigged with equipment recommended or provided by the boat and motor manufacturer and tested with the highest horsepower production powerplant for which the boat is to be rated, not to exceed 40 horsepower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The boat must be rigged with equipment recommended or provided by the boat and motor manufacturer and tested with the highest horsepower production powerplant for which the boat is to be rated, not to exceed 40 horsepower.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Standard equipment must be installed in accordance with manufacturers' instructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The lowest ratio (quickest) steering system offered on the boat model being tested must be installed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The outboard motor must be fitted with the manufacturer's recommended propeller providing maximum speed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Standard permanently installed fuel tanks must be no more than one-half full. Boats without permanent tanks must be tested with one full portable tank.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Portable tanks must be in their designated location or placed as far aft as possible.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The outboard motor must be placed in the lowest vertical position on the transom or, if mounting instructions are provided with the boat, at the height recommended.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Boat bottom, motor and propeller must be in new or almost new condition.</p><p class="depth4">Note: The use of the following special equipment should be considered because of the potential for exceeding the capabilities of the boat while performing the test:Racing Type Personal Flotation DeviceHelmet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test conditions. Testing must be conducted on smooth, calm water with the wind speed below 10 knots. The test must be conducted with no load other than a driver who must weigh no more than 200 pounds. The motor trim angle must be adjusted to provide maximum full throttle speed short of excessive porpoising or propeller ventilation or ``cavitation'', so that there is no loss of directional control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quick turn test procedure. Set throttle at a low maneuvering speed and steer the boat straight ahead. Turn the steering wheel 180 in the direction of least resistance in \1/2\ second or less and hold it at that position without changing the throttle or trim settings during or after the wheel change. The boat completes the maneuver successfully if it is capable of completing a 90 turn without the driver losing control of the boat or reducing the throttle setting. Gradually increase the boat's turn entry speed incrementally until the boat does not complete the Quick Turn Test successfully or successfully completes it at maximum throttle.</p><p class="depth3">Note: It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It is permissible to make a number of practice runs through the quick turn test at any throttle setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test course method. Set throttle for 30 miles per hour boat speed and run the test course set up in accordance with Figure 183.53, passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 35 to 37.5 miles per hour without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course, increase the throttle setting to 35 to 37.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 37.5 to 42.5 miles per hour boat speed and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, increase the throttle setting to 42.5 miles per hour or more and run the course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for that speed without contacting any of the course markers. If the boat successfully completes this run of the test course and the motor was not at full throttle, continue to increase the throttle setting and run the test course passing outside the designated avoidance marker for 42.5 miles per hour or more until the boat fails to complete the test successfully or the boat completes the test course maneuvers successfully at full throttle. The boat successfully completes the test course if the driver is able to maneuver it between the designated avoidance markers without striking the markers and without losing control of the boat or

reducing the throttle setting. There must be no change in position of any equipment on board and there must be no change of position of personnel in order to influence the test results. There must be no instability evidenced by oscillating motion in the roll or yaw axes exhibited while negotiating the course.</p><p class="depth3">Note: It is recognized that operator skill and familiarity with a particular boat and motor combination will affect the test results. It is therefore considered permissible to make a number of practice runs through the test course at any throttle setting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Maximum horsepower capacity. (i) For boats capable of less than 35 miles per hour, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete the Quick Turn Test Procedure in Sec. 183.53(b)(4) at full throttle or the maximum horsepower determined under the calculations in Sec. 183.53(a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For boats capable of less than 35 miles per hour, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete the Quick Turn Test Procedure in Sec. 183.53(b)(4) at full throttle or the maximum horsepower determined under the calculations in Sec. 183.53(a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For boats capable of 35 miles per hour or more, the maximum horsepower capacity must be the maximum horsepower with which the boat was able to successfully complete both the Quick Turn Test Procedure in Sec. 183.53(b)(4) and the Test Course Method in Sec. 183.53(b)(5) at full throttle or the calculations in Sec. 183.53(a) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The maximum horsepower capacity determined in accordance with Sec. 183.53(b) must not exceed 40 horsepower.</p><p class="depth4">Figure 183.53--Boat Horsepower Capacity Test Course--35 MPH or More[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC18OC91.021
