                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The TV bands database serves the following functions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> To determine and provide to a TVBD, upon request, the available  TV channels at the TVBD's location. Available channels are determined  based on the interference protection requirements in Sec. 15.712. A  database must provide fixed and Mode II personal portable TVBDs with  channel availability information that includes scheduled changes in  channel availability over the course of the 48 hour period beginning at  the time the TVBDs make a re-check contact. In making lists of available  channels available to a TVBD, the TV bands database shall ensure that  all communications and interactions between the TV bands database and  the TVBD include adequate security measures such that unauthorized  parties cannot access or alter the TV bands database or the list of  available channels sent to TVBDs or otherwise affect the database system  or TVBDs in performing their intended functions or in providing adequate  interference protections to authorized services operating in the TV  bands. In addition, a TV bands database must also verify that the FCC  identifier (FCC ID) of a device seeking access to its services is valid;  under this requirement the TV bands database must also verify that the  FCC ID of a Mode I device provided by a fixed or Mode II device is  valid. A list of devices with valid FCC IDs and the FCC IDs of those  devices is to be obtained from the Commission's Equipment Authorization  System.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To register the identification information and location of fixed  TVBDs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To register protected locations and channels as specified in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, that are not otherwise recorded in  Commission licensing databases.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Information in the TV bands database. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Facilities already  recorded in Commission databases. Identifying and location information  will come from the official Commission database. These services include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Digital television stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Class A television stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Low power television stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Television translator and booster stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Broadcast Auxiliary Service stations (including receive only  sites), except low power auxiliary stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Private land mobile radio service stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Commercial mobile radio service stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Offshore radiotelephone service stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Class A television station receive sites.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Low power television station receive sites.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Television translator station receive sites.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Facilities that are not recorded in Commission databases.  Identifying and location information will be entered into the TV bands  database in accordance with the procedures established by the TV bands  database administrator(s). These include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> MVPD receive sites.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Sites where low power auxiliary stations, including wireless  microphones and wireless assist video devices, are used and their  schedule for operation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fixed TVBD registrations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> 600 MHz band operations under part 27 of this chapter in areas  where the licensee has commenced operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Restrictions on registration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Television translator, low  power TV and Class A station receive sites within the protected contour  of the station being received are not eligible for registration in the  database.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> MVPD receive sites within the protected contour or more than 80  kilometers from the nearest edge of the protected contour of a  television station being received are not eligible to register that  station's channel in the database.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of available channels. The TV bands database will  determine the available channels at a location using the interference  protection requirements of Sec. 15.712, the location information  supplied by a TVBD, and the data for protected stations/locations in the  database.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> TVBD initialization. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fixed and Mode II TVBDs must provide  their location and required identifying information to the TV bands  database in accordance with the provisions of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fixed and Mode II TVBDs shall not transmit unless they receive,  from the TV bands database, a list of available channels and may only  transmit on the available channels on the list provided by the database.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fixed TVBDs register and receive a list of available channels  from the database by connecting to the iInternet, either directly or  through another fixed TVBD that has a direct connection to the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Mode II TVBDs receive a list of available channels from the  database by connecting to the Internet, either directly or through a  fixed or Mode II TVBD that has a direct connection to the Internet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A fixed or Mode II TVBD that provides a list of available  channels to a Mode I device shall notify the database of the FCC  identifier of such Mode I device and receive verification that that FCC  identifier is valid before providing the list of available channels to  the Mode I device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A fixed device with an antenna height above ground that exceeds  30 meters or an antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) that exceeds  250 meters shall not be provided a list of available channels. The HAAT  is to be calculated using computational software employing the  methodology in Sec. 73.684(d) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Fixed TVBD registration. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to operating for the first  time or after changing location, a fixed TVBD must register with the TV  bands database by providing the information listed in paragraph (f)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The party responsible for a fixed TVBD must ensure that the TVBD  registration database has the most current, up-to-date information for  that device.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The TVBD registration database shall contain the following  information for fixed TVBDs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> FCC identifier (FCC ID) of the device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Manufacturer's serial number of the device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Device's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude (NAD  83) accurate to [/- 50 m);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Device's antenna height above ground level (meters);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Name of the individual or business that owns the device;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Name of a contact person responsible for the device's  operation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Address for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> E-mail address for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Phone number for the contact person.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A personal/portable device operating in Mode II shall provide  the database its FCC Identifier (as required by Sec. 2.926 of this  chapter), serial number as assigned by the manufacturer, and the  device's geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude (NAD 83)  accurate to [50 m)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> TV bands database information.

Use of licensed low power  auxiliary stations at well defined times and locations may be registered  in the database. Multiple registrations that specify more than one point  in the facility may be entered for very large sites. Registrations will  be valid for no more than one year, after which they may be renewed.  Registrations must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the individual or business responsible for the low power  auxiliary device(s);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An address for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An email address for the contact person (optional);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A phone number for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Coordinates where the device(s) are used (latitude and longitude  in NAD 83, accurate to [/- 50 m);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Channels used by the low power auxiliary devices operated at  the site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Specific months, weeks, days of the week and times when the  device(s) are used (on dates when microphones are not used the site will  not be protected); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The stations call sign.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Unlicensed wireless microphones at venues of events and  productions/shows that use large numbers of wireless microphones that  cannot be accommodated in the two reserved channels and other channels  that are not available for use by TVBDs at that location. Such sites of  large events and productions/shows with significant wireless microphone  use at well defined times and locations may be registered in the  database. Entities responsible for eligible event venues registering  their site with a TV bands data base are required to first make use of  the two reserved channels and other channels that are not available for  use by TVBDs at that location. As a benchmark, at least 6-8 wireless  microphones should be operating in each channel used at such venues  (both licensed and unlicensed wireless microphones used at the event may  be counted to comply with this benchmark). Multiple registrations that  specify more than one point in the facility may be entered for very  large sites. Sites of eligible event venues using unlicensed wireless  microphones must be registered with the Commission at least 30 days in  advance and the Commission will provide this information to the data  base managers. Parties responsible for eligible event venues filing  registration requests must certify that they are making use of all TV  channels not available to TV bands devices and on which wireless  microphones can practicably be used, including channels 7-51 (except  channel 37). The Commission will make requests for registration of sites  that use unlicensed wireless microphones public and will provide an  opportunity for public comment or objections. Registrations will be  valid for one year, after which they may be renewed. The Commission will  take actions against parties that file inaccurate or incomplete  information, such as denial of registration in the database, removal of  information from the database pursuant to paragraph (i) of this section,  or other sanctions as appropriate to ensure compliance with the rules.  Registrations must include the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name of the individual or business that owns the unlicensed  wireless microphones;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An address for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An e-mail address for the contact person (optional);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A phone number for the contact person;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Coordinates where the device(s) are used (latitude and longitude  in NAD 83, accurate to [/- 50 m);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Channels used by the wireless microphones operated at the site  and the number of wireless microphones used in each channel.
