                            <p class="depth0">The Air Force establishes and uses its airfields to support the  scope and level of operations necessary to carry out missions worldwide.  The Congress funds airfields in response to Air Force requirements, but  also specifies that civil aviation access is a national priority to be  accommodated when it does not jeopardize an installation's military  utility. The Air Force engages in dialogue with the civil aviation  community and the Federal Aviation Administration to ensure mutual  understanding of long-term needs for the national air transportation  system and programmed military force structure requirements. To  implement the national policy and to respond to requests for access, the  Air Force must have policies that balance such requests with military  needs. Civil aircraft access to Air Force airfields on foreign territory  requires host nation approval.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Air Force will manage two programs that are generally used  to grant civil aircraft access to its airfields: civil aircraft landing  permits and joint-use agreements. Other arrangements for access will be  negotiated as required for specific purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Normally, landing permits will be issued only for civil aircraft  operating in support of official Government business. Other types of use  may be authorized if justified by exceptional circumstances. Access will  be granted on an equitable basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Air Force will consider only proposals for joint use that do  not compromise operations, security, readiness, safety, environment, and  quality of life. Further, only proposals submitted by authorized local  Government representatives eligible to sponsor a public airport will be  given the comprehensive evaluation required to conclude a joint-use  agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any aircraft operator with an inflight emergency may land at any  Air Force airfield without prior authorization. An inflight emergency is   defined as a situation that makes continued flight hazardous.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Air Force requirements will take precedence on Air Force  airfields over all civil aircraft operations, whether they were  previously authorized or not.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Civil aircraft use of Air Force airfields in the United States  will be subject to Federal laws and regulations. Civil aircraft use of  Air Force airfields in foreign countries will be subject to US Federal  laws and regulations that have extraterritorial effect and to applicable  international agreements with the country in which the Air Force  installation is located.</p>
