Sec.  267.51 and 267.56 in response to fires, explosions, or any  unplanned sudden or non-sudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous  waste constituents to air, soil, or surface water at the facility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Describe all arrangements agreed upon under Sec.  267.36 by  local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and  state and local emergency response teams to coordinate emergency  services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> List names, addresses, and phone numbers (office and home) of  all persons qualified to act as emergency coordinator (see Sec.   267.55), and you must keep the list up to date. Where more than one  person is listed, one must be named as primary emergency coordinator and  others must be listed in the order in which they will assume  responsibility as alternates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include a current list of all emergency equipment at the  facility (such as fire extinguishing systems, spill control equipment,  communications and alarm systems (internal and external),   and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. In  addition, you must include the location and a physical description of  each item on the list, and a brief outline of its capabilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Include an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is  a possibility that evacuation could be necessary. You must describe  signal(s) to be used to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and  alternate evacuation routes (in cases where the primary routes could be  blocked by releases of hazardous waste or fires).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you have already prepared a Spill Prevention, Control, and  Countermeasures (SPCC) Plan under 40 CFR part 112, or some other  emergency or contingency plan, you need only amend that plan to  incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that will comply with  the requirements of this part.</p>
