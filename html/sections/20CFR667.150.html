                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The first reallotment of funds among States will occur during PY  2001 based on obligations in PY 2000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary determines, during the first quarter of the  program year, whether a State has obligated its required level of at  least 80 percent of the funds allotted under WIA sections 127 and 132  for programs serving youth, adults, and dislocated workers for the prior  year, as separately determined for each of the three funding streams.  Unobligated balances are determined based on allotments adjusted for any  allowable transfer between the adult and dislocated worker funding  streams. The amount to be recaptured from each State for reallotment, if  any, is based on State obligations of the funds allotted to each State  under WIA sections 127 and 132 for programs serving youth, adults, or  dislocated workers, less any amount reserved (up to 5 percent at the  State level and up to 10 percent at the local level) for the costs of  administration. This amount, if any, is separately determined for each  funding stream.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em>, respectively. To be eligible to receive a reallotment  of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds under the reallotment  procedures, a State must have obligated at least 80 percent of the prior  program year's allotment, less any amount reserved for the costs of  administration of youth, adult, or dislocated worker funds. A State's  eligibility to receive a reallotment is separately determined for each  funding stream.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The term ``obligation'' is defined at 20 CFR 660.300.
