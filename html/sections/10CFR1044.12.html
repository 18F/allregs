                                Sec. 1044.12  What procedures can you invoke if you believe you have reprisal for making a protected disclosure?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">If you believe you have been discriminated against as a reprisal for  making a protected disclosure, you may submit a complaint to the  Director of the Office of Hearings and Appeals, HG-1/L'Enfant Plaza  Building, U.S. Department of Energy, 1000 Independence Avenue SW.,  Washington, DC   20585-1615, or you may send your complaint to the Director, Office of  Hearings and Appeals, by facsimile to FAX number (202) 287-1415. In your  complaint, you should give your reasons for believing that you have been  discriminated against as a reprisal for making a protected disclosure,  and include any information you think is relevant to your complaint. The  Office of Hearings and Appeals will conduct an investigation of your  complaint unless the Director determines your complaint is frivolous.  The Director will notify you in writing if your complaint is found to be  frivolous. If an investigation is conducted, the Director will submit a  report of the investigation to you, to the employer named in your  complaint, and to the Secretary of Energy, or the Secretary's designee.  The Secretary, or the Secretary's designee, will take appropriate  action, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 7239(k), to abate any discriminatory  actions taken as reprisal for making a protected disclosure.
