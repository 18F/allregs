Endorsement of the Plan as a restoration  framework is not intended as an artificial constraint on innovation in  its implementation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessment activities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> RECOVER shall develop an assessment  program to assess responses of the system to implementation of the Plan.  The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  shall develop a guidance memorandum in accordance with Sec. 385.5 for  approval by the Secretary of the Army, with the concurrence of the  Secretary of the Interior and the Governor, that describes the processes  to be used to conduct these assessments.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> RECOVER shall develop a monitoring program that is designed to  measure status and trends towards achieving the goals and purposes of  the Plan throughout the South Florida ecosystem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> RECOVER shall conduct monitoring activities and use the  information collected and analyzed through the monitoring program as a  basis for conducting assessment tasks, which may include, but are not  limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determining if measured responses are desirable and are  achieving the interim goals and the interim targets or the expected  performance level of the Plan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Evaluating if corrective actions to improve performance or  improve cost-effectiveness should be considered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Preparing reports on the monitoring program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Whenever it is deemed necessary, but at least every five years,  RECOVER shall prepare a technical report that presents an assessment of  whether the goals and purposes of the Plan are being achieved, including  whether the interim goals and interim targets are being achieved or are  likely to be achieved. The technical report shall be provided to the  Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District for  use in preparing the assessment report. The technical report prepared by  RECOVER shall also be made available to the public.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management  District shall consult with the Department of the Interior, the  Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Commerce, the  Seminole Tribe of Florida, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida,  the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other Federal,  State, and local agencies in the development of the assessment report.

As part of the evaluation of the Plan, the Corps of  Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District shall  determine the total quantity of water that is expected to be generated  by implementation of the Plan, including the quantity expected to be  generated for the natural system to attain restoration goals as well as  the quantity expected to be generated for use in the human environment.  The Corps of Engineers and the South Florida Water Management District  shall also consult with the South Florida Ecosystem Restoration Task  Force in conducting the evaluation of the Plan. As appropriate, the  results of the evaluation of the Plan may be used to initiate management  actions in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section that are  necessary to seek continuous improvement of the Plan based upon new  information resulting from changed or unforeseen circumstances, new  scientific and technical information, new or updated modeling;  information developed through the assessment principles contained in the  Plan; and future authorized changes to the Plan integrated into the  implementation of the Plan.
