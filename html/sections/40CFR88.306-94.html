                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of meeting the requirements of section 246 of the Clean Air Act or the SIP revisions, conversions of engines or vehicles which satisfy the requirements of this section shall be treated as a purchase of a clean-fuel vehicle under subpart C of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The engine or vehicle must be converted using a conversion configuration which has been certified according to the provisions of 40 CFR part 86 using applicable emission standards and other provisions from part 88 for clean-fuel engines and vehicles. The following requirements will also apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is performed by an entity other than aftermarket conversion certifier, the aftermarket conversion certifier shall submit a list of such installers to the Administrator. Additional installers must be added to this list and the revised list submitted to the Administrator within 5 working days from the time they are authorized to perform conversion installations by the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the installation of the certified conversion configuration is performed by an entity other than the certificate holder, the certificate holder shall provide instructions for installation of the aftermarket conversion system to installers listed on the certificate, and ensure that the systems are properly installed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For the purpose of determining whether certification under the Small-Volume Manufacturers Certification Program pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 86.094-14 is permitted, the 10,000 sales volume limit in 40 CFR 86.094-14(b)(1) is waived for a certifier of a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifiers that are subject to the post-installation emissions testing requirements in paragraph (c) of this section and who will satisfy these requirements by using the two speed idle test procedure detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section must conduct the following testing at the time of certification in order to generate the required certification CO emissions reference values. The certification CO emissions reference values generated must be submitted to the Administrator at the time of application for certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, certification reference values must be generated for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.113. For heavy-duty engines the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.1313.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Single, consecutive idle mode and high-speed mode segments of the two speed idle test must be conducted pursuant to the requirements of 40 CFR 85.2215 and as modified by the provisions of paragraph (c)(4)(ii)(D) of this section and this paragraph to determine the required certification CO emission reference values.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The certification CO emission reference value for the idle mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions measurements taken during an idle mode of 90 seconds duration pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The certification CO emission reference value for the high-speed mode of the test will be the simple average of all emissions measurements taken during a high-speed mode of 180 seconds duration pursuant to the requirements in 40 CFR 85.2215(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, each converted vehicle manufactured by a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales of less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year must satisfy the post-installation emissions testing requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. If a vehicle fails to satisfy the emissions testing requirements such vehicle may not be considered a clean- fuel vehicle until such noncompliance is rectified and compliance is demonstrated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with estimated sales of 300 or fewer engines and vehicles in a calendar year and which sells or converts vehicles outside of a non-attainment area (as classified under subpart D of Title I) which has an inspection and maintenance program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions may submit a request to the Administrator for an exemption from the post-installation emission test requirements of paragraph (c) of this section. If granted, such an exemption would apply to converted vehicles that

have the conversion installation performed outside of a nonattainment area which has an inspection and maintenance program that includes a test of carbon monoxide emissions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The request for exemption submitted to the Administrator must include the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The estimated number of engines and vehicles that will be converted in the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Sufficient information to demonstrate that complying with the post-installation emission test requirement represents a severe financial hardship.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A description of any emission related quality control procedures used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Within 120 days of receipt of the application for exemption, the Administrator will notify the applicant either that an exemption is granted or that sufficient cause for an exemption has not been demonstrated and that all of the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier's vehicles are subject to the post-installation test requirement of paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier granted an exemption originally estimates that 300 or fewer conversions would be performed in the calendar year, and then later revises the estimate to more than 300 for the year, the certifier shall inform the Administrator of such revision. A post-installation emissions test for each conversion performed after the estimate is revised is required pursuant to the requirements of paragraph (c)(2) of this section. The estimated number of conversions from such a clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier must be greater than 300 in the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A clean-fuel vehicle aftermarket conversion certifier with aggregate sales less than 10,000 converted vehicles within a given calendar year shall conduct post-installation emissions testing using either of the following test methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner in which CO emissions are determined according to the inspection and maintenance requirements applicable in the area in which the vehicle is converted or is expected to be operated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For dual-fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each fuel on which the vehicle is capable of operating. For flexible fuel vehicles, a single test is required on a fuel that falls within the range of fuel mixtures for which the vehicle was designed. The test fuel(s) used must be commercially available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A converted vehicle shall be considered to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the vehicle's measured exhaust CO concentration(s) is lower than the cutpoint(s) used to determine CO pass/fail under the inspection and maintenance program in the area in which the conversion is expected to be operated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If CO pass/fail criteria are not available for a vehicle fuel type then pass/fail criteria specific to gasoline use are to be used for vehicles of that fuel type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The carbon monoxide (CO) emissions of the converted vehicle must be determined in the manner specified in the two speed idle test-EPA 91 found in 40 CFR 85.2215. All provisions in the two speed idle test must be observed except as detailed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii)(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For dual and flexible fuel vehicles, a separate test is required for each certification test fuel required for exhaust emissions testing pursuant to 40 CFR 86.113 or 40 CFR 86.1313.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks the test fuels used during the emissions testing required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section must comply with the fuel specifications for exhaust emissions testing found in 40 CFR 86.113.
