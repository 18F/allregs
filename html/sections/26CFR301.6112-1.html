                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Each material advisor, as defined in Sec. 301.6111- 3(b), with respect to any reportable transaction, as defined in Sec.  1.6011-4(b) of this chapter, shall prepare and maintain a list in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section and shall furnish such  list to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in accordance with paragraph  (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Preparation and maintenance of lists--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. A separate  list must be prepared and maintained for each reportable transaction.  However, one list must be maintained for substantially similar  transactions. A material advisor will have 30 calendar days from the  date the list maintenance requirement first arises (see Sec. 301.6111- 3(b)(4) and paragraph (a) of   this section) with respect to a reportable transaction to prepare the  list that must be maintained under this section with respect to that  transaction. The Commissioner in his discretion also may provide in  published guidance designating a transaction as a reportable transaction  a list preparation time period greater than 30 calendar days. If a list  is requested under this section during the list preparation time period,  the request for the list will be treated as having been made on the day  after the list preparation time period ends. A list must be maintained  in a form that enables the IRS to determine without undue delay or  difficulty the information required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.  The Commissioner in his discretion may provide in published guidance a  form or method for maintaining or furnishing the list.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Persons required to be included on lists. A material advisor is  required to maintain a list identifying each person with respect to whom  the advisor acted as a material advisor with respect to the reportable  transaction. However, a material advisor is not required to identify a  person on the list if the person entered into a listed transaction or a  transaction of interest more than 6 years before the transaction was  identified in published guidance as a listed transaction or a  transaction of interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em>, (ii), and (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Statement. An itemized statement containing the following  information--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The name of each reportable transaction, the citation to the  published guidance number identifying the transaction if the transaction  is a listed transaction or a transaction of interest, and the reportable  transaction number obtained under section 6111;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The name, address, and TIN of each person required to be  included on the list;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The date on which each person required to be included on the  list entered into each reportable transaction, if known by the material  advisor;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The amount invested in each reportable transaction by each  person required to be included on the list, if known by the material  advisor;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> A summary or schedule of the tax treatment that each person is  intended or expected to derive from participation in each reportable  transaction; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> The name of each other material advisor to the transaction, if  known by the material advisor.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Description of the transaction. A detailed description of each  reportable transaction that describes both the tax structure of the  transaction and the purported tax treatment of the transaction.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documents. The following documents--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A copy of any designation agreement (as described in paragraph  (f) of this section) to which the material advisor is a party; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Copies of any additional written materials, including tax  analyses or opinions, relating to each reportable transaction that are  material to an understanding of the purported tax treatment or tax  structure of the transaction that have been shown or provided to any  person who acquired or may acquire an interest in the transactions, or  to their representatives, tax advisors, or agents, by the material  advisor or any related party or agent of the material advisor. However,  a material advisor is not required to retain earlier drafts of a  document provided the material advisor retains a copy of the final  document (or, if there is no final document, the most recent draft of  the document) and the final document (or most recent draft) contains all  the information in the earlier drafts of such document that is material  to an understanding of the purported tax treatment or the tax structure  of the transaction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms  are defined as:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Material advisor. The term material advisor is defined in Sec.  301.6111-3(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reportable transaction. The term reportable transaction is  defined in Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Listed transaction. The term listed transaction is defined in  Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(2) of this chapter. See also Sec. Sec. 20.6011-4(a),  25.6011-4(a), 26.6011-4, 31.6011-4(a),   53.6011-4(a), 54.6011-4(a), or 56.6011-4(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Person.

The term tax treatment is defined in Sec.  301.6111-3(c)(10).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Transaction of interest. The term transaction of interest is  defined in Sec. 1.6011-4(b)(6) of this chapter. See also Sec. Sec.  20.6011-4(a), 25.6011-4(a), 26.6011-4, 31.6011-4(a), 53.6011-4(a),  54.6011-4(a), or 56.6011-4(a) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Retention of lists. Each material advisor must maintain each  component of the list described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section in a  readily accessible form for seven years following the earlier of the  date on which the material advisor last made a tax statement relating to  the transaction, or the date the transaction was last entered into, if  known. If the material advisor required to prepare, maintain, and  furnish the list is a corporation, partnership, or other entity (entity)  that has dissolved or liquidated before completion of the seven-year  period, the person responsible under state law for winding up the  affairs of the entity must prepare, maintain and furnish each component  of the list on behalf of the entity, unless the entity submits the list  to the Office of Tax Shelter Analysis (OTSA) within 60 days after the  dissolution or liquidation. If state law does not specify any person as  responsible for winding up the affairs, then each of the directors of  the corporation, the general partners of the partnership, or the  trustees, owners, or members of the entity are responsible for  preparing, maintaining and furnishing each component of the list on  behalf of the entity, unless the entity submits the list to the OTSA  within 60 days after the dissolution or liquidation. The responsible  person must also provide notice to OTSA of such dissolution or  liquidation within 60 days after the dissolution or liquidation. The  list and the notice provided to OTSA must be sent to: Internal Revenue  Service, OTSA Mail Stop 4915, 1973 North Rulon White Blvd., Ogden, Utah  84404, or to such other address as provided by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Furnishing of lists--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In general. Each material advisor  responsible for maintaining a list must, upon written request by the  IRS, make each component of the list described in paragraph (b)(3) of  this section available to the IRS. Each component of the list must be  furnished to the IRS in a form that enables the IRS to determine without  undue delay or difficulty the information required in paragraph (b)(3)  of this section. If any component of the list is not in a form that  enables the IRS to determine without undue delay or difficulty the  information required in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, the material  advisor will not be considered to have complied with the list  maintenance provisions in section 6112 and this section. A material  advisor must make the list or each component of the list available to  the IRS within the period prescribed in section 6708 or published  guidance relating to section 6708.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Claims of privilege. Each material advisor who is required to  maintain a list with respect to a reportable transaction, must still  maintain the list pursuant to the requirements of this section even if a  person asserts a claim of privilege with respect to the information  specified in paragraph (b)(3)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Designation agreements. If more than one material advisor is  required to maintain a list of persons for a reportable transaction, in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the material advisors may  designate by written agreement a single material advisor (the designated  material advisor) to maintain the list or a portion of the list. A  designation agreement does not relieve material advisors from their  obligation to maintain a list in accordance with paragraph (b) of this   section or to furnish their list to the IRS in accordance with paragraph  (e)(1) of this section, but a designation agreement may allow one  material advisor to maintain a list on behalf of the other material  advisors who are a party to the designation agreement. A material  advisor is not relieved from the requirement of this section because a  material advisor is unable to obtain the list from any designated  material advisor, any designated material advisor did not maintain a  list, or the list maintained by any designated material advisor is not  complete. The existence of a designation agreement does not affect the  ability of the IRS to request a list from any party to the designation  agreement. The IRS may request a list from any party to the designation  agreement, and the party receiving the request must furnish their list  to the IRS in accordance with paragraph (e)(1) of this section,  regardless of whether their list was maintained by another party  pursuant to the terms of a designation agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. In general, this section applies  to transactions with respect to which a material advisor makes a tax  statement under Sec. 301.6111-3 on or after August 3, 2007. However,  this section applies to transactions of interest entered into on or  after November 2, 2006, with respect to which a material advisor makes a  tax statement under Sec. 301.6111-3 on or after November 2, 2006.  Paragraphs (b)(1), (c)(3), (c)(12), and (f) of this section apply to  transactions with respect to which a material advisor makes a tax  statement under Sec. 301.6111-3 after November 14, 2011. Otherwise, the  rules that apply on or before November 14, 2011 are contained in this  section in effect prior to November 14, 2011 (see 26 CFR part 301  revised as of April 1, 2011).
