American Society of Testing and Measurements and titled Method for Smoke Density in Flue Gases from Burning Distillate Fuels.</p><p class="depth0">Basic model means all water heaters, hot water supply boilers, or unfired hot water storage tanks manufactured by one manufacturer within a single equipment class, having the same primary energy source (e.g., gas or oil) and that have essentially identical electrical, physical and functional characteristics that affect energy efficiency.</p><p class="depth0">Hot water supply boiler means a packaged boiler that is industrial equipment and that,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Has an input rating from 300,000 Btu/hr to 12,500,000 Btu/hr and of at least 4,000 Btu/hr per gallon of stored water,</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Is suitable for heating potable water, and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Meets either or both of the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> It has the temperature and pressure controls necessary for heating potable water for purposes other than space heating, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> The manufacturer's product literature, product markings, product marketing, or product installation and operation instructions indicate that the boiler's intended uses include heating potable water for purposes other than space heating.</p><p class="depth0">Instantaneous water heater means a water heater that has an input rating not less than 4,000 Btu/hr per gallon of stored water, and that is industrial equipment, including products meeting this description that are designed to heat water to temperatures of 180 [deg]F or higher.</p><p class="depth0">Packaged boiler means a boiler that is shipped complete with heating equipment, mechanical draft equipment and automatic controls; usually shipped in one or more sections and does not include a boiler that is custom designed and field constructed. If the boiler is shipped in more than one section, the sections may be produced by more than one manufacturer, and may be originated or shipped at different times and from more than one location.</p><p class="depth0">R-value means the thermal resistance of insulating material as determined based on ASTM Standard Test Method C177-97 or C518-91 and expressed in ([deg]F[middot]ft\2\[middot]h/Btu).</p><p class="depth0">Residential-duty commercial water heater means any gas-fired, electric, or oil storage or instantaneous commercial water heater that meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For models requiring electricity, uses single-phase external power supply;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Is not designed to provide outlet hot water at temperatures greater than 180 [deg]F; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Does not meet any of the following criteria:
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Indicator of non-residential</p><p class="depth2">Water heater type                       application------------------------------------------------------------------------Gas-fired Storage........................

Rated input 58.6</p><p class="depth2">kW; Rated storage volume 2 gallons.Oil-fired Instantaneous..................  Rated input 210</p><p class="depth2">kBtu/h; Rated storage volume</p><p class="depth2">2 gallons.------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Standby loss means the average hourly energy required to maintain the stored water temperature, expressed as applicable either (1) as a percentage (per hour) of the heat content of the stored water and determined by the formula for S given in Section 2.10 of ANSI Z21.10.3-1998, denoted by the term ``S,'' or (2) in Btu per hour based on a 70 [deg]F temperature differential between stored water and the ambient temperature, denoted by the term ``SL.''</p><p class="depth2">Storage water heater means a water heater that heats and stores water within the appliance at a thermostatically controlled temperature for delivery on demand and that is industrial equipment. Such term does not include units with an input rating of 4,000 Btu/hr or more per gallon of stored water.</p><p class="depth2">Tank surface area means, for the purpose of determining portions of a tank requiring insulation, those areas of a storage tank, including hand holes and manholes, in its uninsulated or pre-insulated state, that do not have pipe penetrations or tank supports attached.</p><p class="depth2">Thermal efficiency for an instantaneous water heater, a storage water heater or a hot water supply boiler means the ratio of the heat transferred to the water flowing through the water heater to the amount of energy consumed by the water heater as measured during the thermal efficiency test procedure prescribed in this subpart.</p><p class="depth2">Unfired hot water storage tank means a tank used to store water that is heated externally, and that is industrial equipment.
