In the event the loan is secured by a leasehold estate rather than a fee simple estate, the allowable cost of the property upon which the loan amount is based shall be reduced by the value of the leased fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Adjusted loan amount--rehabilitation projects. A loan amount that involves a project to be rehabilitated shall be subject to the following additional limitations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Property held in fee. If the Borrower is the fee simple owner of the project not encumbered by a mortgage, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed 100 percent of the cost of the proposed rehabilitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Property subject to existing mortgage. If the Borrower owns the project subject to an outstanding indebtedness, which is to be refinanced with part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of rehabilitation plus such portion of the outstanding indebtedness as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Property to be acquired. If the project is to be acquired by the Borrower and the purchase price is to be financed with a part of the Section 202 loan, the maximum loan amount shall not exceed the cost of the rehabilitation plus such portion of the purchase price as does not exceed the fair market value of such land and improvements prior to the rehabilitation, as determined by the field office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Increased Mortgage Limits--High Cost Areas. (1)(i) The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Assistant Secretary may increase the dollar amount limitations in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> By not to exceed 110 percent in any geographical area in which the Assistant Secretary finds that cost levels so require; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> By not to exceed 140 percent where the Assistant Secretary determines it necessary on a project-by-project basis.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In no case, however, may any such increase exceed 90 percent, where the Assistant Secretary determines that there is involved a mortgage purchased or to be purchased by the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA) in implementing its Special Assistance Functions under section 305 of the National Housing Act (as section 305 existed immediately before its repeal on November 30, 1983).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Assistant Secretary finds that because of high costs in Alaska, Guam, or Hawaii it is not feasible to construct dwellings without the sacrifice of sound standards of construction, design, and livability within the limitations of maximum loan amounts provided in this section, the principal amount of mortgages may be increased by such amounts as may be necessary

to compensate for such costs, but not to exceed in any event the maximum, including high cost area increases, if any, otherwise applicable by more than one-half thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Loan interest rate. Loans shall bear interest at a rate determined by HUD in accordance with this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual interest rate. Except as provided under paragraph (g)(2), loans shall bear interest at the rate in effect at the time the loan is made. The loan interest rate shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the loan is made (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Optional interest rate. The Borrower may elect an optional loan interest rate. To elect the optional rate, the Borrower must request that HUD determine the loan interest rate at the time of the Borrower's request for conditional or firm commitment for direct loan financing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Borrower elects the optional loan interest rate, the loan interest rate shall not exceed:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 3-month period immediately preceding the fiscal year in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The average yield on the most recently issued 30-year marketable obligations of the United States during the 1-month period immediately preceding the month in which the request for commitment is submitted (adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of one percent), plus an allowance to cover the administrative costs and probable losses under the program; and (C) Any applicable statutory ceiling on the loan interest rate including an allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The date of submission of a request for conditional or firm commitment is the date that the Borrower submits the complete and acceptable request to HUD. The date of the submission of a request for commitment will not be affected by any subsequent resubmission of the request by the Borrower or by any reprocessing of the request by HUD.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Borrower may withdraw its election of the optional interest rate at any time before initial loan closing. If the Borrower elected the optional interest rate with its request for conditional commitment and withdraws its election, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section, unless the Borrower elects an optional interest rate with its request for firm commitment. If the Borrower withdraws its election after the date of submission of its request for firm commitment, the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If initial loan closing has not occurred within 18 months after the Notice of Section 202 Fund Reservation is issued, the Borrower's election of the optional rate will be cancelled and the loan will bear interest at the rate determined under paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allowance for administrative costs and probable losses. For the purpose of computing the loan interest rate under paragraphs (g) (1) and (2) of this section, the allowance to cover administrative costs and probable losses under the program is one-fourth of one percent (.25%) per annum for both the construction and permanent loan periods.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Announcement of interest rates. (1) HUD will annually announce the loan interest rate determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section by publishing notice of the rate in the Federal Register. The Federal Register notice will include a statement explaining the basis for the interest rate determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> HUD will annually announce the loan interest rate determination under paragraph (g)(1) of this section by publishing notice of the rate in the Federal Register. The Federal Register notice will include a statement explaining the basis for the interest rate determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Upon the Borrower's request, HUD will provide available current information concerning the determination of

the interest rate under paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The loan shall be secured by a first mortgage on real estate in fee simple or long term leasehold. The mortgage shall be repayable during a term not to exceed 40 years and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as shall be determined by the Assistant Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In order to assure HUD of the Borrower's continued commitment to the development, management, and operation of the project, a minimum capital investment is required of Section 202 Borrowers of one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the mortgage amount committed to be disbursed, not to exceed the amount of $10,000. Section 106(b) loans made pursuant to section 106 of the Housing Act of 1968 may not be utilized to meet the minimum capital investment requirement. Such minimum capital investment shall be placed in escrow at the initial closing of the Section 202 loan and shall be held by HUD or other escrow agent acceptable to the field office for not less than a 3-year period from the date of initial occupancy and may be used for operating expenses or deficits as may be directed by the field office. Any unexpended balance remaining in the minimum capital investment account at the end of the escrow period shall be returned to the Borrower.</p>
