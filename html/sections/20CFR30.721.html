                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If the designated OWCP representative receives a timely request for hearing, the OWCP representative shall refer the matter to the Chief Administrative Law Judge of the Department of Labor, who shall assign it for an expedited hearing. The administrative law judge assigned to the matter shall consider the request for hearing, act on all requests therein, and issue a Notice of Hearing and Hearing Schedule for the conduct of the hearing. A copy of the hearing notice shall be served on the provider by certified mail, return receipt requested. The Notice of Hearing and Hearing Schedule shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A ruling on each item raised in the request for hearing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A schedule for the prompt disposition of all preliminary matters, including requests for more definite statements and for the certification of questions to advisory bodies; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A scheduled hearing date not less than 30 days after the date the schedule is issued, and not less than 15 days after the scheduled conclusion of preliminary matters, provided that the specific time and place of the hearing may be set on 10 days' notice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The purpose of the designation of issues is to provide for an effective hearing process. The provider is entitled to be heard on any matter placed in issue by his or her response to the Notice of Intent to Exclude, and may designate ``all issues'' for purposes of hearing. However, a specific designation of issues is required if the provider wishes to interpose affirmative defenses or request the certification of questions for an advisory opinion.</p>
