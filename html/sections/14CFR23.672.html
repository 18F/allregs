Warning systems must not activate the control system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The design of the stability augmentation system or of any other automatic or power-operated system must permit initial counteraction of failures without requiring exceptional pilot

skill or strength, by either the deactivation of the system or a failed portion thereof, or by overriding the failure by movement of the flight controls in the normal sense.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It must be shown that, after any single failure of the stability augmentation system or any other automatic or power-operated system--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airplane is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved operating limitations that is critical for the type of failure being considered;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The controllability and maneuverability requirements of this part are met within a practical operational flight envelope (for example, speed, altitude, normal acceleration, and airplane configuration) that is described in the Airplane Flight Manual (AFM); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The trim, stability, and stall characteristics are not impaired below a level needed to permit continued safe flight and landing.
