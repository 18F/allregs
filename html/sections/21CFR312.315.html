                            <p class="depth0">Under this section, FDA may permit an investigational drug to be  used for the treatment of a patient population smaller than that typical  of a treatment IND or treatment protocol. FDA may ask a sponsor to  consolidate expanded access under this section when the agency has  received a significant number of requests for individual patient  expanded access to an investigational drug for the same use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Need for expanded access. Expanded access under this section may  be needed in the following situations:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Drug not being developed. The drug is not being developed, for  example, because the disease or condition is so rare that the sponsor is  unable to recruit patients for a clinical trial.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Drug being developed. The drug is being studied in a clinical  trial, but patients requesting the drug for expanded access use are  unable to participate in   the trial. For example, patients may not be able to participate in the  trial because they have a different disease or stage of disease than the  one being studied or otherwise do not meet the enrollment criteria,  because enrollment in the trial is closed, or because the trial site is  not geographically accessible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Approved or related drug. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The drug is an approved drug  product that is no longer marketed for safety reasons or is unavailable  through marketing due to failure to meet the conditions of the approved  application, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The drug contains the same active moiety as an approved drug  product that is unavailable through marketing due to failure to meet the  conditions of the approved application or a drug shortage.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Criteria. The criteria in Sec. 312.305(a) must be met; and FDA  must determine that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is enough evidence that the drug is safe at the dose and  duration proposed for expanded access use to justify a clinical trial of  the drug in the approximate number of patients expected to receive the  drug under expanded access; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is at least preliminary clinical evidence of effectiveness  of the drug, or of a plausible pharmacologic effect of the drug to make  expanded access use a reasonable therapeutic option in the anticipated  patient population.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Submission. The expanded access submission must include  information adequate to satisfy FDA that the criteria in Sec.  312.305(a) and paragraph (b) of this section have been met. The expanded  access submission must meet the requirements of Sec. 312.305(b). In  addition:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The expanded access submission must state whether the drug is  being developed or is not being developed and describe the patient  population to be treated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the drug is not being actively developed, the sponsor must  explain why the drug cannot currently be developed for the expanded  access use and under what circumstances the drug could be developed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the drug is being studied in a clinical trial, the sponsor  must explain why the patients to be treated cannot be enrolled in the  clinical trial and under what circumstances the sponsor would conduct a  clinical trial in these patients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safeguards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon review of the IND annual report, FDA will  determine whether it is appropriate for the expanded access to continue  under this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the drug is not being actively developed or if the expanded  access use is not being developed (but another use is being developed),  FDA will consider whether it is possible to conduct a clinical study of  the expanded access use.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the drug is being actively developed, FDA will consider  whether providing the investigational drug for expanded access use is  interfering with the clinical development of the drug.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> As the number of patients enrolled increases, FDA may ask the  sponsor to submit an IND or protocol for the use under Sec. 312.320.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The sponsor is responsible for monitoring the expanded access  protocol to ensure that licensed physicians comply with the protocol and  the regulations applicable to investigators.</p>
