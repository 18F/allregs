                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Consensus-based management incorporates direct community  involvement in consideration of bureau activities subject to NEPA  analyses, from initial scoping to implementation of the bureau decision.  It seeks to achieve agreement from diverse interests on the goals of,  purposes of, and needs for bureau plans and activities, as well as the  methods anticipated to carry out those plans and activities. For the  purposes of this Part, consensus-based management involves outreach to  persons, organizations or communities who may be interested in or  affected by a proposed action with an assurance   that their input will be given consideration by the Responsible Official  in selecting a course of action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In incorporating consensus-based management in the NEPA process,  bureaus should consider any consensus-based alternative(s) put forth by  those participating persons, organizations or communities who may be  interested in or affected by the proposed action. While there is no  guarantee that any particular consensus-based alternative will be  considered to be a reasonable alternative or be identified as the  bureau's preferred alternative, bureaus must be able to show that the  reasonable consensus-based alternative, if any, is reflected in the  evaluation of the proposed action and discussed in the final decision.  To be selected for implementation, a consensus-based alternative must be  fully consistent with NEPA, the CEQ regulations, and all applicable  statutory and regulatory provisions, as well as Departmental and bureau  written policies and guidance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Responsible Official must, whenever practicable, use a  consensus-based management approach to the NEPA process.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the Responsible Official determines that the consensus-based  alternative, if any, is not the preferred alternative, he or she must  state the reasons for this determination in the environmental document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When practicing consensus-based management in the NEPA process,  bureaus must comply with all applicable laws, including any applicable  provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA).</p>
