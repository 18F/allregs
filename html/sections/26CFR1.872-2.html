                                Sec. 1.872-2  Exclusions from gross income of nonresident alien
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Earnings of foreign ships or aircraft--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Basic rule. So much  of the income from sources within the United States of a nonresident  alien individual as consists of earnings derived from the operation of a  ship or ships documented, or of aircraft registered, under the laws of a  foreign country which grants an equivalent exemption to citizens of the  United States nonresident in that foreign country and to corporations  organized in the United States shall not be included in gross income.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Equivalent exemption--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ships. A foreign country which either  imposes no income tax, or, in imposing an income tax, exempts from  taxation so much of the income of a citizen of the U.S. nonresident in  that foreign country and of a corporation organized in the United States  as consists of earnings derived from the operation of a ship or ships  documented under the laws of the United States is considered as granting  an equivalent exemption for purposes of the exclusion from gross income  of the earnings of a foreign ship or ships.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Aircraft. A foreign country which either imposes no income tax,  or, in imposing an income tax, exempts from taxation so much of the  income of a citizen of the U.S. nonresident in that foreign country and  of a corporation organized in the United States as consists of earnings  derived from the operation of aircraft registered under the laws of the  United States is considered as granting an equivalent exemption for  purposes of the exclusion from gross income of the earnings of foreign  aircraft.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Definition of earnings. For purposes of subparagraphs (1) and  (2) of this paragraph, compensation for personal services performed by  an individual aboard a ship or aircraft does not constitute earnings  derived by such individual from the operation of ships or aircraft.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compensation paid by foreign employer to participants in certain  exchange or training programs--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Exclusion from income. Compensation  paid to a nonresident alien individual for the period that the  nonresident alien individual is temporarily present in the United States  as a nonimmigrant under subparagraph (F) (relating to the admission of  students into the United States) or subparagraph (J) (relating to the  admission of teachers, trainees, specialists, etc., into the United  States) of section 101(a)(15) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8  U.S.C. 1101(a)(15) (F) or (J)) shall be excluded from gross income if  the compensation is paid to such alien by his foreign employer.  Compensation paid to a nonresident alien individual by the U.S. office  of a domestic bank which is acting as paymaster on behalf of a foreign  employer constitutes compensation paid by a foreign employer for  purposes of this paragraph if the domestic bank is reimbursed by the  foreign employer for such payment. A nonresident alien individual who is  temporarily present in the United States as a nonimmigrant under such  subparagraph (J) includes a nonresident alien individual admitted to the  United States as an ``exchange visitor'' under section 201 of the U.S.  Information and Educational Exchange Act of 1948 (22 U.S.C. 1446), which  section was repealed by section 111 of the Mutual Education and Cultural  Exchange Act of 1961 (75 Stat. 538).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Definition of foreign employer. For purposes of this paragraph,  the term ``foreign employer'' means a nonresident alien individual, a  foreign partnership, a foreign corporation, or an office or place of  business maintained in a foreign country or in a possession of the  United States by a domestic corporation, a domestic partnership, or an  individual who is a citizen or resident of the United States. The term  does not include a foreign government. However, see section 893 and  Sec. 1.893-1. Thus, if a French citizen employed in the Paris branch of  a banking company incorporated in the State of New York were admitted to  the United States under section 101(a)(15)(J) of the Immigration and   Nationality Act to study monetary theory and continued to receive a  salary from such foreign branch while studying in the United States,  such salary would not be includable in his gross income.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tax convention. Income of any kind which is exempt from tax  under the provisions of a tax convention or treaty to which the United  States is a party shall not be included in the gross income of a  nonresident alien individual. Income on which the tax is limited by tax  convention shall be included in the gross income of a nonresident alien  individual if it is not otherwise excluded from gross income. See  Sec. Sec. 1.871-12 and 1.894-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Certain bond income of residents of the Ryukyu Islands or the  Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands. Income derived by a nonresident  alien individual from a series E or series H U.S. savings bond shall not  be included in gross income if such individual acquired the bond while  he was a resident of the Ryukyu Islands or the Trust Territory of the  Pacific Islands. It is not necessary that the individual continue to be  a resident of such Islands or Trust Territory for the period when,  without regard to section 872(b)(4) and this paragraph, the income from  the bond would otherwise be includible in his gross income under the  provisions of section 446 or 454.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Certain annuities received under qualified plans. Pursuant to  section 871(f), income received by a nonresident alien individual as an  annuity under a qualified annuity plan described in section 403(a)(1)  (relating to taxation of employee annuities), or from a qualified trust  described in section 401(a) (relating to qualified pension, profit- sharing, and stock bonus plans) which is exempt from tax under section  501(a) (relating to exemption from tax on corporations, certain trusts,  etc.), shall not be included in gross income, and shall be exempt from  tax, for purposes of section 871 and Sec. Sec. 1.871-7 and 1.871-8,  if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All of the personal services by reason of which the annuity is  payable were either--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Personal services performed outside the United States by an  individual (whether or not the annuitant) who, at the time of  performance of the services, was a nonresident alien individual, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Personal services performed in the United States by a  nonresident alien individual (whether or not the annuitant) which, by  reason of section 864(b)(1) (or corresponding provision of any prior  law), were not personal services causing such individual to be engaged  in trade or business in the United States during the taxable year, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>, whichever  applies. See section 871(a)(1)(B) and paragraph (c)(1)(i) of Sec.  1.871-7. For exemption from withholding of tax at source on an annuity  which is exempt from tax under section 871(f) and this paragraph, see  paragraph (g) of Sec. 1.1441-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Other exclusions. Income which is from sources without the  United States, as determined under the provisions of sections 861  through 863, and the regulations thereunder, is not included in the  gross income of a nonresident alien individual unless such income is  effectively connected for the taxable year with the conduct of a trade  or business in the United States by that individual. To determine  specific exclusions in the case of other items which are from sources  within the United States, see the applicable sections of the Code. For  special rules under a tax convention for determining   the sources of income and for excluding, from gross income, income from  sources without the United States which is effectively connected with  the conduct of a trade or business in the United States, see the  applicable tax convention. For determining which income from sources  without the United States is effectively connected with the conduct of a  trade or business in the United States, see section 864(c)(4) and Sec.  1.864-5.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section shall apply for taxable years  beginning after December 31, 1966. For corresponding rules applicable to  taxable years beginning before January 4, 1967 see 26 CFR 1.872-2  (Revised as of January 1, 1971).  [T.D. 7332, 39 FR 44228, Dec. 23, 1974]</p>
