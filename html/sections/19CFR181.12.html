If a U.S. exporter or producer fails to maintain records or make records available to the Canadian or Mexican customs administration in accordance with the provisions of this section, or if a U.S. producer fails to conform its records to Generally Accepted Accounting Principles as provided in this paragraph, the Canadian or Mexican customs administration may deny preferential tariff treatment to the good that is the subject of the verification visit.
