                            <p class="depth0">The Assistant Secretary may afford the State an opportunity to  modify or clarify its plan on the basis of any comments received under  Sec. 1902.11 or Sec. 1902.13, before commencing a proceeding to reject  the plan. In this connection, the State may informally discuss any  issues raised by such comments with the staff of the Office of Federal  and State Operations. The Assistant Secretary may afford an additional  opportunity for public comment, particularly when such an opportunity  would not unduly delay final action on the plan and when the comments  could be expected to elicit new relevant matter.
