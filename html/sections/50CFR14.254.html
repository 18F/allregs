                            <p class="depth0">In order to qualify for the exemption in Sec.  14.255, an accredited wildlife sanctuary must maintain complete and accurate records of any possession, transportation, acquisition, disposition, importation, or exportation of the prohibited wildlife species covered by the CWSA. These records must be up to date, and must include the names and addresses of persons to or from whom any prohibited wildlife species has been

acquired, imported, exported, purchased, sold, or otherwise transferred; and the dates of these transactions. The accredited wildlife sanctuary must maintain these records for 5 years, must make these records available to Service officials for inspection at reasonable hours, and must copy these records for Service officials, if requested. In addition, by declaring itself to be accredited under this subpart, a wildlife sanctuary agrees to allow access to its facilities and its prohibited wildlife specimens by Service officials at reasonable hours.</p>
