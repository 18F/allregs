The Judicial Officer may require such additional showings or proof as the Judicial Officer may deem necessary on the issue of service and shall reopen any debarment proceeding previously closed pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section if the Judicial Officer shall find that service was incomplete or otherwise failed to adequately advise of the pendency of the proposed debarment.
