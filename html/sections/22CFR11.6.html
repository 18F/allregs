                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">After the results of the medical examination and background  investigation are received, the candidate's entire file will be reviewed  by a Final Review Panel, consisting of two or more deputy examiners.  Candidates who have been graded ``recommended'' by oral examining  panels, who have passed their medical examination, and who, on the basis  of investigation have been found to be loyal to the Government of the  United States and personally suitable to represent it abroad, will have  their names placed on a rank-order register for the functional specialty  for which they have been qualified. Their standing on the register will  be determined by the Final Review Panel after taking into account the  grade assigned by the oral examining panel and any information developed  subsequent to the oral examination concerning the applicant. The  candidacy of anyone who is determined by the Final Review Panel to be  unqualified for appointment shall be terminated and the candidate so  informed.  (22 U.S.C. 1221 et seq.)
