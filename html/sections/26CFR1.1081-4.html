                                Sec. 1.1081-4  Exchanges of property for property by corporations.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application of section 1081(b). Section 1081(b) applies only to the transfers specified therein with respect to which section 1081(d) is inapplicable, and deals only with such transfers if gain is realized upon the sale or other disposition effected by such transfers. If loss is realized section 1081(b) is inapplicable and the application of other provisions of subtitle A of the Code must be determined. See section 1081(g). If section 1081(b) is applicable, the other provisions of subchapters C and O, chapter 1 of the Code, relating to the nonrecognition of gain are inapplicable, and the conditions under which, and the extent to which, the realized gain is not recognized are set forth in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), (e), and (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonrecognition of gain; no nonexempt proceeds. No gain is recognized to a transferor corporation upon the sale or other disposition of property transferred by such transferor corporation in exchange solely for property other than nonexempt property, as defined in section 1083(e), but only if all of the following requirements are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The transferor corporation is, under the definition in section 1083 (b), a registered holding company or an associate company of a registered holding company;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such transfer is in obedience to an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (as defined in section 1083 (a)) and such order satisfies the requirements of section 1081 (f);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The transferor corporation has filed the required consent to the regulations under section 1082(a)(2) (see paragraph (g) of this section); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The entire amount of the gain, as determined under section 1001, can be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Nonrecognition of gain; nonexempt proceeds. If the transaction would be within the provisions of paragraph (b) of this section if it were not for the fact that the property received in exchange consists in whole or in part of nonexempt property (as defined in section 1083 (e)), then no gain is recognized if such nonexempt property, or an amount equal to the fair market value of such nonexempt property at the time of the transfer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is expended within the required 24-month period for property other than nonexempt property; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is invested within the required 24-month period as a contribution to the capital, or as paid-in surplus, of another corporation;
but only if the expenditure or investment is made</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In accordance with an order of the Securities and Exchange Commission (as defined in section 1083 (a)) which satisfies the requirements of section 1081 (f) and which recites that such expenditure or investment by the transferor corporation is necessary or appropriate to the integration or simplification of the holding company system of which the transferor corporation is a member; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The required consent, waiver, and bond have been executed and filed. See paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recognition of gain in part; insufficient expenditure or investment in case of

nonexempt proceeds. If the transaction would be within the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section if it were not for the fact that the amount expended or invested is less than the fair market value of the nonexempt property received in exchange, then the gain, if any, is recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the amount by which the fair market value of such nonexempt property at the time of the transfer exceeds the amount so expended and invested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Items treated as expenditures for the purpose of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For the purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, the following are treated as expenditures for property other than nonexempt property:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A distribution in cancellation or redemption (except a distribution having the effect of a dividend) of the whole or a part of the transferor's own stock (not acquired on the transfer);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A payment in complete or partial retirement or cancellation of securities representing indebtedness of the transferor or a complete or partial retirement or cancellation of such securities which is a part of the consideration for the transfer; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If, on the transfer, a liability of the transferor is assumed, or property of the transferor is transferred subject to a liability, the amount of such liability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recognition of gain in part; inability to reduce basis. If the transaction would be within the provisions of paragraph (b) or (c) of this section, if it were not for the fact that an amount of gain cannot be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2), then the gain, if any, is recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the amount which cannot be so applied in reduction of basis. If the transaction would be within the provisions of paragraph (d) of this section, if it were not for the fact that an amount of gain cannot be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2), then the gain, if any, is recognized, but in an amount not in excess of the aggregate of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The amount of gain which would be recognized under paragraph (d) of this section if there were no inability to reduce basis under section 1082(a)(2); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The amount of gain which cannot be applied in reduction of basis under section 1082(a)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Consent to regulations under section 1082(a)(2). To be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of section 1081(b), a corporation must file with its return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurs a consent to have the basis of its property adjusted under section 1082(a)(2) (see Sec. 1.1082-3), in accordance with the provisions of the regulations in effect at the time of filing of the return for the taxable year in which the transfer occurs. Such consent shall be made on Form 982 in accordance with these regulations and instructions on the form or issued therewith.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Requirements with respect to expenditure or investment. If the full amount of the expenditure or investment required for the application of paragraph (c) of this section has not been made by the close of the taxable year in which such transfer occurred, the taxpayer shall file with the return for such year an application for the benefit of the 24-month period for expenditure and investment, reciting the nature and time of the proposed expenditure or investment. When requested by the district director, the taxpayer shall execute and file (at such time and in such form) such waiver of the statute of limitations with respect to the assessment of deficiencies (for the taxable year of the transfer and for all succeeding taxable years in any of which falls any part of the period beginning with the date of the transfer and ending 24 months thereafter) as the district director may specify, and such bond with such surety as the district director may require, in an amount not in excess of double the estimated maximum income tax which would be payable if the corporation does not make the required expenditure or investment within the required 24-month period.
