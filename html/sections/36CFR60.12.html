                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Any person or local government may appeal to the Keeper the  failure or refusal of a nominating authority to nominate a property that  the person or local government considers to meet the National Register  criteria for evaluation upon decision of a nominating authority to not  nominate a property for any reason when requested pursuant to Sec.  60.11, or upon failure of a State Historic Preservation Officer to  nominate a property recommended by the State Review Board. (This action  differs from the procedure for appeals during the review of a nomination  by the National Park Service where an individual or organization may  ``petition the Keeper during the nomination process,'' as specified in  Sec. Sec. 60.6(t) and 60.9(i). Upon receipt of such petition the normal  45-day review period will be extended for 30 days beyond the date of the  petition to allow the petitioner to provide additional documentation for  review.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Such appeal shall include a copy of the nomination form and  documentation previously submitted to the State Historic Preservation  Officer or Federal Preservation Officer, an explanation of why the  applicant is submitting the appeal in accord with this section and shall  include pertinent correspondence from the State Historic Preservation  Officer or Federal Preservation Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Keeper will respond to the appellant and the State Historic  Preservation Officer or Federal Preservation Officer with a written  explanation either denying or sustaining the appeal within 45 days of  receipt. If the appeal is sustained, the Keeper will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal  Preservation Officer to submit the nomination to the Keeper within 15  days if the nomination has completed the procedural requirements for  nomination as described in Sec. Sec. 60.6 or 60.9 except that  concurrence of the State Review Board, State Historic Preservation  Officer or Federal Preservation Officer is not required; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the nomination has not completed these procedural  requirements, request the State Historic Preservation Officer or Federal  Preservation Officer to promptly process the nomination pursuant to  Sec. Sec. 60.6 or 60.9 and submit the nomination to the Keeper without  delay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State Historic Preservation Officers and Federal Preservation  Officers shall process and submit such nominations if so requested by  the Keeper pursuant to this section. The Secretary reserves the right to  list properties in the National Register or determine properties  eligible for such listing on his own motion when necessary to assist in  the preservation of historic resources and after notifying the owner and  appropriate parties and allowing for a 30-day comment period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No person shall be considered to have exhausted administrative  remedies with respect to failure to nominate a property to the National  Register until he or she has complied with procedures set forth in this  section. The decision of the Keeper is the final administrative action  on such appeals.  [48 FR 46308, Oct. 12, 1983]</p>
