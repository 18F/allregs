                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Before the award of the first visitor service authorization in a  park area to be made after the effective date of this subpart, the  Director will provide an opportunity for any Native Corporation  interested in providing visitor services within the applicable park area  to submit an application to the superintendent to be determined the  Native Corporation most directly affected by the establishment or  expansion of the park area by or under the provisions of ANILCA. An  application from an interested Native Corporation will include the  following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Name, address, and phone number of the Native Corporation; date  of incorporation; its articles of incorporation and structure;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Location of the corporation's population center or centers; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An assessment of the socioeconomic impacts, including historical  and traditional use and land-ownership patterns and their effects on the  Native Corporation as a result of the expansion or establishment of the  applicable park area by ANILCA.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any additional information the Native Corporation considers  relevant or the Director may reasonably require.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon receipt of all applications from interested Native  Corporations, the Director will determine the ``most directly affected''  Native Corporation considering the following factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Distance and accessibility from the corporation's population  center and/or business address to the applicable park area; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Socioeconomic impacts, including historical and traditional use  and landownership patterns, on Native Corporations and their effects as  a result of the expansion or establishment of the applicable park area;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information provided by Native Corporations and other  information considered relevant by the Director to the particular facts  and circumstances of the effects of the establishment or expansion of  the applicable park area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In the event that more than one Native Corporation is determined  to be equally affected within the meaning of this section, each such  Native Corporation will be considered as a preferred operator under this  subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Director's most directly affected Native Corporation  determination applies to the award of all future visitor service  authorizations for the applicable park area. However, a Native  Corporation that did not apply for this determination in connection with  an earlier visitor services authorization may apply for a determination  that it is an equally affected Native Corporation for the applicable  park area in connection with a later visitor services authorization.  Such subsequent applications must contain the information required by  paragraph (a) of this section, and must be made in a timely manner as  described by the Director in the applicable solicitation document so as  not to delay the consideration of offers for the visitor services  authorization.</p>
