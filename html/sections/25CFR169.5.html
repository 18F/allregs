                            <p class="depth0">Written application identifying the specific use requested shall be  filed in duplicate with the Secretary. The application shall cite the  statute or statutes under which it is filed and the width and length of  the desired right-of-way, and shall be accompanied by satisfactory  evidence of the good faith and financial responsibility of the  applicant. An application filed by a corporation must be accompanied by  a copy of its charter or articles of incorporation duly certified by the  proper State official of the State where the corporation was organized,  and a certified copy of the resolution or bylaws of the corporation  authorizing the filing of the application. When the land covered by the  application is located in a State other than that in which the applicant  was incorporated, it must also submit a certificate of the proper State  official that the applicant is authorized to do business in the State  where the land is located. An application filed by an unincorporated  partnership or association must be accompanied be a certified copy of  the articles of partnership or association, or if there be none, this  fact must be stated over the signature of each member of the partnership  or association. If the   applicant has previously filed with the Secretary an application  accompanied by the evidence required by this section, a reference to the  date and place of such filing will be sufficient. Except as otherwise  provided in this section, the application shall be accompanied by a duly  executed stipulation, in duplicate, expressly agreeing to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To construct and maintain the right-of-way in a workmanlike  manner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To pay promptly all damages and compensation, in addition to the  deposit made pursuant to Sec. 169.4, determined by the Secretary to be  due the landowners and authorized users and occupants of the land on  account of the survey, granting, construction and maintenance of the  right-of-way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To indemnify the landowners and authorized users and occupants  against any liability for loss of life, personal injury and property  damage arising from the construction, maintenance, occupancy or use of  the lands by the applicant, his employees, contractors and their  employees, or subcontractors and their employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To restore the lands as nearly as may be possible to their  original condition upon the completion of construction to the extent  compatible with the purpose for which the right-of-way was granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> To clear and keep clear the lands within the right-of-way to the  extent compatible with the purpose of the right-of-way; and to dispose  of all vegetative and other material cut, uprooted, or otherwise  accumulated during the construction and maintenance of the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To take soil and resource conservation and protection measures,  including weed control, on the land covered by the right-of-way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> To do everything reasonably within its power to prevent and  suppress fires on or near the lands to be occupied under the right-of- way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> To build and repair such roads, fences, and trails as may be  destroyed or injured by construction work and to build and maintain  necessary and suitable crossings for all roads and trails that intersect  the works constructed, maintained, or operated under the right-of-way.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> That upon revocation or termination of the right-of-way, the  applicant shall, so far as is reasonably possible, restore the land to  its original condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> To at all times keep the Secretary informed of its address, and  in case of corporations, of the address of its principal place of  business and of the names and addresses of its principal officers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> That the applicant will not interfere with the use of the lands  by or under the authority of the landowners for any purpose not  inconsistent with the primary purpose for which the right-of-way is  granted.  When the applicant is the U.S. Government or a State Government or an  instrumentality thereof and is prohibited by law from executing any of  the above stipulations, the Secretary may waive the requirement that the  applicant agree to any stipulations so prohibited.
