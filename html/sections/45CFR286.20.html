                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> We will request and use data submitted by a State to determine the amount of a TFAG. The State data that we will request and use are the total Federal payments attributable to State expenditures, including administrative costs (which includes systems costs) for fiscal year 1994 under the former Aid to Families With Dependent Children, Emergency Assistance and Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training programs, for all Indian families residing in the geographic service area or areas identified in the Tribe's letter of intent or Tribal Family Assistance Plan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Tribe must indicate its definition of ``Indian family'' in its Tribal Family Assistance Plan. Each Tribe may define ``Indian family'' according to its own criteria.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When we request the necessary data from the State, the State will have 30 days from the date of the request to submit the data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If we do not receive the data requested from the State at the end of the 30-day period, we will so notify the Tribe.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In cases where data is not received from the State, the Tribe will have 45 days from the date of the notification in which to submit relevant information. Relevant information may include, but is not limited to, Census Bureau data, data from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, data from other Federal programs, and Tribal records. In such a case, we will use the data submitted by the Tribe to assist us in determining the amount of the TFAG. Where there are inconsistencies in the data, follow-up discussions with the Tribe and the State will ensue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> We will share the data submitted by the State under paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section with the Tribe. The Tribe must submit to the Secretary a notice as to the Tribe's agreement or disagreement with such data no later than 45 days after the date of our notice transmitting the data from the State. During this 45-day period we will help resolve any questions the Tribe may have about the State-submitted data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We will notify each Tribe that has submitted a TFAP of the amount of the TFAG. At this time, we will also notify the State of the amount of the reduction in its SFAG.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We will prorate TFAGs that are initially effective on a date other than October 1 of any given Federal fiscal year, based on the number of days remaining in the Federal fiscal year.</p>
