                                Sec. 1230.4  Prior approval of termination agreements of Enterprises.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. An Enterprise may not enter into any agreement or  contract to provide any payment of money or other thing of current or  potential value in connection with the termination of employment of an  executive officer unless the agreement or contract is approved in  advance by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Covered agreements or contracts. An agreement or contract that  provides for termination payments to an executive officer of an  Enterprise that was entered into before October 28, 1992,\1\ is not  retroactively subject to approval or disapproval by the Director.  However, any renegotiation, amendment, or change to such an agreement or  contract shall be considered as entering into an agreement or contract  that is subject to approval by the Director. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ This date refers to the date of enactment of the Federal Housing  Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Factors to be taken into account. In making the determination  whether to approve or disapprove termination benefits, the Director may  consider:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whether the benefits provided under the agreement or contract  are comparable to benefits provided under such agreements or contracts  for officers of other public or private entities involved in financial  services and housing interests who have comparable duties and  responsibilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The factors set forth in Sec. 1230.3(b); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such other information as deemed appropriate by the Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exception to prior approval. An employment agreement or contract  subject to prior approval of the Director under this section may be  entered into prior to that approval, provided that such agreement or  contract specifically provides notice that termination benefits under  the agreement or contract shall not be effective and no payments shall  be made under such agreement or contract unless and until approved by  the Director. Such notice should make clear that alteration of benefit  plans subsequent to FHFA approval under this section, which affect final  termination benefits of an executive officer, requires review at the  time of the individual's termination from the Enterprise and prior to  the payment of any benefits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of prior approval of an agreement or contract. The  Director's approval of an executive officer's termination of employment  benefits shall not preclude the Director from making any subsequent  determination under this section to prohibit and withhold executive  compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Form of approval. The Director's approval pursuant to this  section may occur in such form and manner as the   Director shall provide through written notice to the regulated entities  or the Office of Finance.</p>
