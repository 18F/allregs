                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Commission, in determining whether to begin proceedings  to develop mandatory standards under the acts it administers, considers  whether mandatory regulation is necessary or whether there is an  existing voluntary standard that adequately addresses the problem and  the extent to which that voluntary standard is complied with by the  affected industry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission acknowledges that there are situations in which  adequate voluntary standards, in combination with appropriate  certification programs, may be appropriate to support a conclusion that  a mandatory standard is not necessary. The Commission may find that a  mandatory standard is not necessary where compliance with an existing  voluntary standard would   eliminate or adequately reduce the risk of injury associated with the  product, contains requirements and test methods that have been evaluated  and found acceptable by the Commission, and it is likely that there will  be substantial and timely compliance with the voluntary standard. Under  such circumstances, the Commission may agree to encourage industry  compliance with the voluntary standard and subsequently evaluate the  effectiveness of the standard in terms of accident and injury reduction  for products produced in compliance with the standard.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In evaluating voluntary standards, the Commission will relate  the requirements of the standard to the identified risks of injury and  evaluate the requirements in terms of their effectiveness in eliminating  or reducing the risks of injury. The evaluation of voluntary standards  will be conducted by Commission staff members, including representatives  of legal, economics, engineering, epidemiological, health sciences,  human factors, other appropriate interests, and the Voluntary Standards  Coordinator. The staff evaluation will be conducted in a manner similar  to evaluations of standards being considered for promulgation as  mandatory standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In the event that the Commission has evaluated an existing  voluntary standard and found it to be adequate in all but a few areas,  the Commission may defer the initiation of a mandatory rulemaking  proceeding and request the voluntary standards organization to revise  the standard to address the identified inadequacies expeditiously.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the event the Commission determines that there is no existing  voluntary standard that will eliminate or adequately reduce a risk of  injury the Commission may commence a proceeding for the development of a  consumer product safety rule or a regulation in accordance with section  9 of the Consumer Product Safety Act, 15 U.S.C. 2058, section 3(f) of  the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, 15 U.S.C. 1262(f), or section 4(a)  of the Flammable Fabrics Act, 15 U.S.C. 1193(g), as may be applicable.  In commencing such a proceeding, the Commission will publish an advance  notice of proposed rulemaking which shall, among other things, invite  any person to submit to the Commission an existing standard or portion  of an existing standard, or to submit a statement of intention to modify  or develop, within a reasonable period of time, a voluntary standard to  address the risk of injury.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Commission will consider those provisions of a voluntary  standard that have been reviewed, evaluated, and deemed to be adequate  in addressing the specified risks of injury when initiating a mandatory  consumer product safety rule or regulation under the Consumer Product  Safety Act, the Federal Hazardous Substances Act, or the Flammable  Fabrics Act, as may be applicable. Comments will be requested in the  advance notice of proposed rulemaking on the adequacy of such voluntary  standard provisions.</p>
