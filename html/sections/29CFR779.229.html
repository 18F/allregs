                            <p class="depth0">With respect to those arrangements specifically described in the  proviso contained in the definition, an independently owned retail or  service establishment will not be considered to be other than a separate  and distinct enterprise, if other arrangements the establishment makes  do not have the effect of bringing the establishment within a larger  enterprise. Whether or not other arrangements have such an effect will  necessarily depend upon all the facts. The Senate Report makes the  following observations with respect to this:</p><p class="depth0">Thus the mere fact that a group of independently owned and operated  stores join together to combine their purchasing activities or to run  combined advertising will not for these reasons mean that their  activities are performed through unified operation or common control and  they will not for these reasons be considered a part of the same  ``enterprise.'' This is also the case in food retailing because of the  great extent to which local independent food store operators have joined  together in many phases of their business. While maintaining their  stores as independently owned units, they have affiliated   together not just for the purchasing of merchandise, but also for  providing numerous other services such as (1) central warehousing; (2)  advertising; (3) sales promotions; (4) managerial advice; (5) store  engineering; (6) accounting systems; (7) site locations; and (8)  hospitalization and life insurance protection. (S. Rept. 145, 87th  Cong., 1st Sess., p. 42.)   The report continues with the following observations:</p><p class="depth0">Whether such arrangements bring the establishment within the  franchisor's, lessor's, or grantor's ``enterprise'' is a question to be  determined on all the facts. The facts may show that the arrangements  reserve the necessary right of control in the grantor or unify the  operations among the separate ``franchised'' establishments so as to  create an economic unity of related activities for a common business  purpose. In that case, the ``franchised'' establishment will be  considered a part of the same ``enterprise.'' For example, whether a  franchise, lease, or other contractual arrangement between a distributor  and a retail dealer has the effect of bringing the dealer's  establishments within the enterprise of the distributor will depend upon  the terms of the agreements and the related facts concerning the  relationship between the parties.</p><p class="depth0">There may be a number of different types of arrangements established  in such cases. The key in each case may be found in the answer to the  question, ``Who receives the profits, suffers the losses, sets the wages  and working conditions of employees, or otherwise manages the business  in those respects which are the common attributes of an independent  businessman operating a business for profit?''</p><p class="depth0">For instance, a bona fide independent automobile dealer will not be  considered a part of the enterprise of the automobile manufacturer or of  the distributor. Likewise, the same result will also obtain with respect  to the independent components of a shopping center.</p><p class="depth0">In all of these cases if it is found on the basis of all the facts  and circumstances that the arrangements are so restrictive as to  products, prices, profits, or management as to deny the ``franchised''  establishment the essential prerogatives of the ordinary independent  businessman, the establishment, the dealer, or concessionaire will be  considered an integral part of the related activities of the enterprise  which grants the franchise, right, or concession. (S. Rept. 145, 87th  Cong., 1st Sess., p. 42.)   Thus, there may be a number of different types of arrangements  established in such cases, and the determination as to whether the  arrangements create a larger ``enterprise'' will necessarily depend on  all the facts. Some arrangements which do not create a larger enterprise  and some which do are discussed in Sec. Sec. 779.230 through 779.235.</p>
