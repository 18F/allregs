                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">The adjustments provided in section 312(c) may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On December 2, 1954, Corporation X distributed to its  sole shareholder, A, an individual, as a dividend in kind a vacant lot  which was not an inventory asset. On that date, the lot had a fair  market value of $5,000 and was subject to a mortgage of $2,000. The  adjusted basis of the lot was $3,100. The amount of the earnings and  profits was $10,000. The amount of the dividend received by A is $3,000  ($5,000, the fair market value, less $2,000, the amount of the mortgage)  and the reduction in the earnings and profits of Corporation X is $1,100  ($3,100, the basis, less $2,000, the amount of mortgage).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1) above with the  exception that the amount of the mortgage to which the property was  subject was $4,000. The amount of the dividend received by A is $1,000,  and there is no reduction in the earnings and profits of the corporation  as a result of the distribution (disregarding such reduction as may  result from an increase in tax to Corporation X because, of gain  resulting from the distribution). There is a gain of $900 recognized to  Corporation X, the difference between the basis of the property ($3,100)  and the amount of the mortgage ($4,000), under section 311(c) and an  increase in earnings and profits of $900.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Corporation A, having accumulated earnings and profits of  $100,000, distributed in kind to its shareholders, not in liquidation,  inventory assets which had a basis to it on the ``Lifo'' method (section  472) of $46,000 and on the basis of cost or market (section 471) of  $50,000. The inventory had a fair market value of $55,000 and was  subject to a liability of $35,000. This distribution results in a net  decrease in earnings and profits of Corporation A of $11,000, (without  regard to any tax on Corporation A) computed as follows:  ``Fifo'' basis of inventory..........................   $50,000 Less: ``Lifo'' basis of inventory....................    46,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Gain recognized--addition to earnings and profits (section        $4,000</p><p class="depth0">311(b))....................................................... Adjustment to earnings and profits required by</p><p class="depth0">section 312(b)(1)(A):</p><p class="depth0">Fair market value of inventory.....................   $55,000</p><p class="depth0">Less: ``Lifo'' basis plus adjustment under section     50,000    5,000</p><p class="depth0">311(b)............................................</p><p class="depth0">------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total increase in earnings and profits........................    9,000 Decrease in earnings and profits--under section         $55,000</p><p class="depth0">312(b)(1)(B)(i)..................................... Less: Liability assumed..............................    35,000</p><p class="depth0">---------- Net amount of distribution (decrease in earnings)..............   20,000</p><p class="depth0">-----------</p><p class="depth0">Net decrease in earnings and profits..........................   11,000</p><p class="depth0"></p>
