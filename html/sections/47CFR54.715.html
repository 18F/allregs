                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The annual administrative expenses of the Administrator should  be commensurate with the administrative expenses of programs of similar  size, with the exception of the salary levels for officers and employees  of the Administrator described in paragraph (b) of this section. The  annual administrative expenses may include, but are not limited to,  salaries of officers and operations personnel, the costs of borrowing  funds, equipment costs, operating expenses, directors' expenses, and  costs associated with auditing contributors of support recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All officers and employees of the Administrator may be  compensated at an annual rate of pay, including any non-regular  payments, bonuses, or other compensation, in an amount not to exceed the  rate of basic pay in effect for Level I of the Executive Schedule under  5 U.S.C. 5312.</p><p class="depth2">Note to paragraph (b): The compensation to be included when  calculating whether an employee's rate of pay exceeds Level I of the  Executive Schedule does not include life insurance benefits, retirement  benefits (including payments to 401(k) plans), health insurance  benefits, or other similar benefits, provided that any such benefits are  reasonably comparable to benefits that are provided to employees of the  federal government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator shall submit to the Commission projected  quarterly budgets at least sixty (60) days prior to the start of every  quarter. The Commission must approve the projected quarterly budgets  before the Administrator disburses funds under the federal universal  service support mechanisms. The administrative expenses incurred by the  Administrator in connection with the schools and libraries support  mechanism, the rural health care support mechanism, the high-cost  support mechanism, and the low income support mechanism shall be  deducted from the annual funding of each respective support mechanism.  The expenses deducted from the annual funding for each support mechanism  also shall include the Administrator's joint and common costs allocated  to each support mechanism pursuant to the cost allocation manual filed  by the Administrator under Sec. 64.903 of this chapter.
