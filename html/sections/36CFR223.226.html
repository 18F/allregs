In determining whether such an extension is appropriate, responsible forest officers shall consider the value of the products or species, the length and type of authorizing instrument, the need for early/accelerated harvest, and any other appropriate factors. Circumstances beyond a person's reasonable control may include, but are not limited to, acts of God, acts of the public enemy, acts of

the Government, labor disputes, fires, insurrections, and floods. The responsible forest officer may grant such an extension upon finding:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Circumstances beyond the person's reasonable control delayed performance; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The person has diligently performed in accordance with the contract or other authorizing instrument.</p><p class="depth2">Advertisement and Bids</p>
