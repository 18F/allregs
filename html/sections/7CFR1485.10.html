MAP Participants may receive assistance for either generic or brand promotion activities. While activities generally take place overseas, reimbursable activities may also take place in the United States. CCC expects all activities that occur in the United States for which MAP reimbursement is sought to develop, maintain, or expand the commercial export market for the relevant U.S. agricultural commodity in accordance with the MAP Participant's approved MAP program. When considering eligible nonprofit U.S. trade organizations, CCC gives priority to organizations that have the broadest producer representation and affiliated industry participation of the commodity being promoted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The MAP generally operates on a reimbursement basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> CCC's policy is to ensure that benefits generated by MAP agreements are broadly available throughout the relevant agricultural sector and that no single entity gains an undue advantage. CCC also endeavors to enter into MAP agreements covering a broad

array of agricultural commodity sectors. The MAP is administered by personnel of the Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) acting on behalf of CCC.
