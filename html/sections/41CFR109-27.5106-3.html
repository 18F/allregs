                            <p class="depth0">All excess precious metals must be returned to the precious metals pool except as noted in Sec. 109-27.5106-1 of this subpart. The pool is entirely dependent on metal returns; therefore, metal inventories should be maintained on an as-needed basis, and any excess metals must be returned to the pool for recycling. With the exception of silver, this includes precious metals in any form, including shapes, scrap, or radioactively contaminated. Only high grade nonradioactively contaminated silver should be included. Procedures have been developed by the precious metals pool contractor for metal returns, including storing, packaging, shipping, and security.</p>
