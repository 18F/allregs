                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions; sampling; standards. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Frozen boneless  manufacturing meat is meat, frozen in the fresh state from cattle,  sheep, swine, goats, horses, mules, or other equines that has all bone  removed and is cut into pieces or trimmings, frozen into a compact block  of any shape and suitable for slicing or chopping in the manufacturing  of meat food products. As used in this section, the term ``frozen''  includes ``chilled fresh,'' and ``lot'' means any amount of frozen  boneless manufacturing meat of one species, similarly packaged, shipped  from one establishment, and offered for import inspection under one or  more foreign inspection certificates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Imported frozen boneless manufacturing meat shall be sampled as  required by Sec. 327.6(a) of this part, and the samples defrosted for  inspection. The Program import inspector, or in the case of Canadian  product subject to procedures described in Sec. 327.5(d)(1), the  Canadian representative will select from a lot the appropriate number of  cartons specified by the table of sampling plans. The total sample for  inspection will consist of the necessary number of 12-pound units drawn  from these cartons. The 12-pound units selected will be completely  defrosted and examined.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lots refused entry. Reinspection (including resampling) will be  provided for any lot of frozen boneless manufacturing meat which was  refused entry under this section on the basis of the original evaluation  of the sample thereof, upon appeal from the inspector's initial  decision.
