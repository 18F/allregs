                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1))</em> that  pays wages or compensation (``payor'') to the individual(s) performing  services for any client pursuant to a service agreement, except as  provided in paragraph (d) of this section, is designated to perform the  acts required of an employer with respect to the wages or compensation  paid. For purposes of this section the term wages has the same meaning  as the term wages has for purposes of chapters 21, 23, and 24, and the  term compensation has the same meaning as the term compensation has for  purposes of chapter 22. This section is not   applicable if the payor has been authorized as an agent of the employer  under Sec. 31.3504-1.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Client. The term client means an individual or  entity that enters into a service agreement with the payor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service agreement. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The term service agreement means an  agreement pursuant to which the payor--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Asserts it is the employer (or ``co-employer'') of the  individual(s) performing services for the client;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Pays wages or compensation to the individual(s) for services the  individual(s) perform for the client; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Assumes responsibility to collect, report, and pay, or assumes  liability for, any taxes applicable under subtitle C of the Code with  respect to the wages or compensation paid by the payor to the  individual(s) performing services for the client.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the  payor may implicitly or explicitly assert it is the employer (or ``co- employer'') of the individual(s) performing services for the client,  including by agreeing to--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Recruit and hire employees for the client or assign employees as  permanent or temporary members of the client's work force, or  participate with the client in these actions;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Hire the client's employees as its own and then provide them  back to the client to perform services for the client; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> File employment tax returns using its own employer  identification number that include wages or compensation paid to the  individual(s) performing services for the client.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of designation. If a payor is designated to perform the  acts required of an employer under this section then the following rules  apply--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A payor must perform the acts required of an employer under each  applicable chapter of the Code and the relevant regulations with respect  to the wages or compensation paid by such payor. All provisions of law  (including penalties) and the regulations applicable to the employer are  applicable to the payor so designated with respect to the wages or  compensation paid by the payor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each employer for whom the payor is designated remains subject  to all provisions of law (including penalties) and of the regulations  applicable to an employer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions. A payor is not designated to perform the acts  required of an employer under this section for any wages or compensation  paid by the payor to the individual(s) performing services for a client  if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The wages or compensation are reported on a return filed under  the client's employer identification number (as defined in section 6109  and the applicable regulations);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The payor is a common paymaster under sections 3121(s) or  3231(i);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The payor is the employer of the individual(s) (including an  employer within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1)); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The payor is treated as an employer under section 3121(a)(2)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of  this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>, or treated as the employer of the individual under  section 3121(a)(2)(A). Corporation P is designated to perform the acts  of an employer with respect to all of the wages   Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer  for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to  all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of  employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that Corporation P  only reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY  Federal Tax Return, filed for the 1st and 2nd quarters of 2015. Neither  Corporation P nor Employer files returns for the 3rd and 4th quarters of  2015. Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer  with respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals  performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and  Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including  penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015  with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Example 3. Same facts as Example 1, except that neither  Corporation P nor Employer reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941,  Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, for any quarter of 2015.  Corporation P is designated to perform the acts of an employer with  respect to all of the wages Corporation P paid to the individuals  performing services for Employer for all quarters of 2015. Employer and  Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of law (including  penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015  with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Example 4. Same facts as Example 1, except that Employer  provides only net payroll (that is, wages less tax amounts) to  Corporation P for each pay period. Corporation P is designated to  perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages  Corporation P paid to the individuals performing services for Employer  for all quarters of 2015. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to  all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of  employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Example 5. Same facts as Example 1, except that after  Corporation P reports the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, Employer's  QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return, filed for each quarter of 2015 under  Corporation P's employer identification number, Corporation P files a  claim for refund of the employment taxes it paid for each quarter of  2015 that are related to wages Corporation P paid to the individuals  performing services for Employer. The basis for Corporation P's refund  claim is that Corporation P is not the employer of the individuals that  performed services for Employer. Corporation P is designated to perform  the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation P  paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all  quarters of 2015. Accordingly, Corporation P is not entitled to a  refund. Employer and Corporation P are each subject to all provisions of  law (including penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all  quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Example 6. Corporation S enters into an agreement with Employer,  effective January 1, 2015. Under the agreement, Corporation S provides  payroll services, including payment of wages to individuals performing  services for Employer, and assumes responsibility for the collection,  reporting, and payment of applicable taxes. For all pay periods in 2015,  Employer provides Corporation S with an amount equal to the gross  payroll (that is, wage and tax amounts) of the individuals, and  Corporation S pays wages (less the applicable withholding) to the  individuals performing services for Employer. Corporation S also reports  the wage and tax amounts on Form 941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax  Return, filed for each quarter of 2015 under Employer's employer  identification number. Corporation S is not designated to perform the  acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation S paid  to the individuals performing services for Employer for all quarters of  2015. Corporation S did not assert it was the employer and filed Forms  941 using Employer's employer identification number. Accordingly,  Corporation S is not liable for the applicable employment taxes under  this section. Employer remains subject   to all provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of  employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Example 7. Corporation T enters into a consulting agreement with  Manufacturer effective January 1, 2015, to provide consulting services  to Manufacturer. Corporation T is responsible to pay wages to the  individuals providing the consulting services to Manufacturer and to  collect, report, and pay the applicable taxes. Corporation T has the  right to direct and control the individuals as to when and how to  perform the consulting services and, thus, is the common law employer of  the individuals providing the consulting services. Corporation T is not  designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all of the  wages Corporation T pays to individuals providing consulting services to  Manufacturer. However, as the common law employer of the individuals,  Corporation T is subject to all provisions of law (including penalties)  applicable in respect of employers with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Example 8. On January 1, 2015, Corporation U enters into an  agreement with Employer for Employer to farm Corporation U's property.  Under the agreement, Corporation U and Employer agree to split the  proceeds of the sale of the products grown on the property. Employer  hires workers to assist it with the farming. Employer has the right to  direct and control the workers as to when and how to perform the  services and, thus, is the common law employer of the workers. However,  Employer is unable to pay the workers until after the products are sold.  Therefore, Corporation U pays wages to the workers and deducts this  amount from Employer's share of the profits. Corporation U controls the  payment of wages within the meaning of section 3401(d)(1). Corporation U  is not designated to perform the acts of an employer with respect to all  of the wages Corporation U paid to workers providing services for  Employer. However, as the section 3401(d)(1) employer of the workers  performing services for Employer, Corporation U is subject to all  provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of  employers with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Example 9. Corporation V and Employer execute and submit a Form  2678, Employer/Payer Appointment of Agent, to the Service, requesting  approval to authorize Corporation V to report, deposit, and pay taxes  with respect to wages it pays, as agent of Employer for purposes of Form  941, Employer's QUARTERLY Federal Tax Return. The Form 2678 is approved  by the Service and effective for all quarters of 2015. Accordingly,  Corporation V reports the wages it pays to individuals performing  services for Employer and related tax amounts on Form 941 and Schedule R  (Form 941), Allocation Schedule for Aggregate Form 941 Filers, filed for  each quarter of 2015 under Corporation V's employer identification  number. Corporation V is not designated under this section to perform  the acts of an employer with respect to all of the wages Corporation V  paid to the individuals performing services for Employer for all  quarters of 2015. However, as an agent authorized under Sec. 31.3504- 1(a), Corporation V is subject to all provisions of law (including  penalties) applicable in respect of employers for all quarters of 2015  with respect to such wages. Employer also remains subject to all  provisions of law (including penalties) applicable in respect of  employers for all quarters of 2015 with respect to such wages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date. These final regulations are  effective for wages or compensation paid by a payor in quarters  beginning on or after March 31, 2014.  [T.D. 9662, 79 FR 17862, Mar. 31, 2014, as amended at 79 FR 31219, June  2, 2014]</p>
