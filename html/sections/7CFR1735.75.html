Loan funds shall not be used to reimburse acquisition costs unless RUS has granted approval of interim financing prior to the closing of the acquisition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> RUS will approve interim financing of acquisitions only in cases where loan funds cannot be made available in time for the closing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> RUS will not approve interim financing unless the following information is acceptable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written request for approval of interim financing, including a brief description of the acquisition, an explanation of the urgency of proceeding with the acquisition, and the source of funds to be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A completed RUS Form 490, ``Application for Telephone Loan or Loan Guarantee.'' See 7 CFR part 1737.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The portions of the Loan Design that cover the proposed acquisition, including cost estimates and information on any investments in nonrural areas.
