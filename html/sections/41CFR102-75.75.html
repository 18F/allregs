                            <p class="depth0">In every case of a proposed transfer of excess real property, the most important consideration is the validity and appropriateness of the requirement upon which the proposal is based. Also, a proposed transfer must not establish a new program that has never been reflected in any previous budget submission or congressional action. Additionally, a proposed transfer must not substantially increase the level of an agency's existing programs beyond that which has been contemplated in the President's budget or by the Congress.</p><p class="depth0">(Note: See Subpart I--Screening of Excess Federal Real Property (Sec. Sec. 102-75.1220 through 102-75.1290) for information on screening and transfer requests.)</p>
