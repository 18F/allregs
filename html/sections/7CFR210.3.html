Within FNS, the CND   will be responsible for Program administration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States. Within the States, the responsibility for the  administration of the Program in schools, as defined in Sec. 210.2,  shall be in the State educational agency. If the State educational  agency is unable to administer the Program in public or private  nonprofit residential child care institutions or nonprofit private  schools, then Program administration for such schools may be assumed by  FNSRO as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, or such other agency  of the State as has been designated by the Governor or other appropriate  executive or legislative authority of the State and approved by the  Department to administer such schools. Each State agency desiring to  administer the Program shall enter into a written agreement with the  Department for the administration of the Program in accordance with the  applicable requirements of this part; parts 235 and 245 of this chapter;  parts 15, 15a, 15b, 3015 and 3016 of this title; and FNS instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FNSRO. The FNSRO will administer the Program in nonprofit  private schools or public or nonprofit private residential child care  institutions if the State agency is prohibited by law from disbursing  Federal funds paid to such schools. In addition, the FNSRO will continue  to administer the Program in those States in which nonprofit private  schools or public or nonprofit private residential child care  institutions have been under continuous FNS administration since October  1, 1980, unless the administration of the Program in such schools is  assumed by the State. The FNSRO will, in each State in which it  administers the Program, assume all responsibilities of a State agency  as set forth in this part and part 245 of this chapter as appropriate.  References in this part to ``State agency'' include FNSRO, as  applicable, when it is the agency administering the Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> School food authorities. The school food authority shall be  responsible for the administration of the Program in schools. State  agencies shall ensure that school food authorities administer the  Program in accordance with the applicable requirements of this part;  part 245 of this chapter; parts 15, 15a, 15b, and 3016 or 3019, as  applicable, of this title; and FNS instructions.
