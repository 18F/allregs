                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the formation of an unincorporated entity (other than in  connection with a consolidation), even though the persons contributing  to the formation of the unincorporated entity and the unincorporated  entity itself may, in the formation transaction, be both acquiring and  acquired persons within the meaning of Sec. 801.2, the contributors  shall be deemed acquiring persons only and the unincorporated entity  shall be deemed the acquired person only.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Unless exempted by the Act or any of these rules, upon the  formation of an unincorporated entity, in a transaction meeting the  criteria of Section 7A(a)(1) and 7A(a)(2)(A) (other than in connection  with a consolidation), a person is subject to the requirements of the  Act if it acquires control of the newly-formed entity. Unless exempted  by the Act or any of these rules, upon the formation of an  unincorporated entity, in a transaction meeting the criteria of Section  7A(a)(1), the criteria of Section 7A(a)(2)(B)(i) (other than in  connection with a consolidation), a person is subject to the  requirements of the Act if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The acquiring person has annual net sales or total assets of  $100 million (as adjusted) or more;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The newly-formed entity has total assets of $10 million (as  adjusted) or more; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The acquiring person acquires control of the newly-formed  entity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The acquiring person has annual net sales or total assets of  $10 million (as adjusted) or more;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The newly-formed entity has total assets of $100 million (as  adjusted) or more; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The acquiring person acquires control of the newly-formed  entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For purposes of paragraph (b) of this section, the total assets  of the newly-formed entity is determined in accordance with Sec.  801.40(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The commerce criterion of Section 7A(a)(1) is satisfied if  either the Activities of any acquiring person are in or affect commerce,  or the person filing notification should reasonably believe that the  Activities of the newly-formed entity will be in or will affect  commerce.</p><p class="depth2">Example: A and B form a new partnership (LP) in which each will  acquire a 50 percent interest. A contributes a plant valued at $250  million and $100 million in cash. B contributes $350 million in cash.  Because each is acquiring non-corporate interests, valued in excess of  $50 million (as adjusted) which confer control of LP both A and B are  acquiring persons in the formation. Each must now determine if the  exemption in Sec. 802.4 is applicable to their acquisitions of non- corporate interests in LP. For A, LP's exempt assets consist of all of  the cash contributed by A and B (pursuant to Sec. 801.21) and A's  contribution of the plant (pursuant to Sec. 802.30(c)). Because all of  the assets of LP are exempt with regard to A, A's acquisition of non- corporate interests in LP is exempt under Sec. 802.4. For B, LP's  exempt assets include only the cash contributions by A and B. The plant  contributed by A, valued at $250 million is not exempt under Sec.  802.30(c) with regard to B. Because LP has non-exempt assets in excess  of $50 million (as adjusted) with regard to B, B's acquisition of non- corporate interests in LP is not exempt under Sec. 802.4. B must now  value its acquisition of non-corporate interests pursuant to Sec.  801.10(d) and because the value of the non-corporate interests is the  same as B's contribution to the formation ($350 million), the value  exceeds $200 million (as adjusted) and B must file notification prior to  acquiring non-corporate interests in LP. See additional examples  following Sec. Sec. 802.30(c) and 802.4.  [70 FR 11512, Mar. 8, 2005]</p>
