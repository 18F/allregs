For purposes of subpart C, the effective date of a new federally-insured credit union's classification within a net worth category in paragraph (c) of this section shall be determined as provided in Sec. 702.101(b); and written notice to the NCUA Board of a decline in net worth category in paragraph (c) of this section shall be given as required by section 702.101(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Net worth categories.
