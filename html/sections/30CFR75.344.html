                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except compressors that are components of equipment such as locomotives and rock dusting machines and compressors of less than 5 horsepower, electrical compressors including those that may start automatically shall be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Continuously attended by a person designated by the operator who can see the compressor at all times during its operation. Any designated person attending the compressor shall be capable of activating the fire suppression system and deenergizing or shutting-off the compressor in the event of a fire; or,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Enclosed in a noncombustible structure or area which is ventilated by intake air coursed directly into a return air course or to the surface and equipped with sensors to monitor for heat and for carbon monoxide or smoke. The sensors shall deenergize power to the compressor, activate a visual and audible alarm located outside of and on the intake side of the enclosure, and activate doors to automatically enclose the noncombustible structure or area when either of the following occurs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The temperature in the noncombustible structure or area reaches 165 [deg]F.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The carbon monoxide concentration reaches 10 parts per million above the ambient level for the area, or the optical density of smoke reaches 0.022 per meter. At least once every 31 days, sensors installed to monitor for carbon monoxide shall be calibrated with a known concentration of carbon monoxide and air sufficient to activate the closing door, and each smoke sensor shall be tested to determine that it functions correctly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Compressors, except those exempted in paragraph (a), shall be equipped with a heat activated fire suppression system meeting the requirements of 75.1107-3 through 75.1107-16.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Two portable fire extinguishers or one extinguisher having at least twice the minimum capacity specified for a portable fire extinguisher in Sec. 75.1100-1(e) shall be provided for each compressor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding the requirements of Sec. 75.1107-4, upon activation of any fire suppression system used under
