(The requirement that the tenant occupy such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service may be waived for good cause by the Postal Service.)</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Where such real property was used to construct a new building for the express purpose of leasing to the Postal Service under circumstances where such tenant would have been a ``displaced person'' hereunder had the Postal Service itself acquired the land and required the removal of the tenant to undertake construction of the building for Postal Service ownership.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where the Postal Service acquires either a fee interest or a leasehold interest in the property, a person who is a residential tenant and is or will be required to move or to move his or her property from the real property, in order for the Postal Service to accomplish the project for which the property was acquired, provided such tenant occupies such real property on the date title in such real property transfers to the Postal Service or the date the Postal Service leases or contracts to lease such property, and further provided such tenant was lawfully in possession at the time of the initiation of negotiations.

A tenant who was legally required by the lease or otherwise to have moved from the property at the times specified in such paragraphs shall not be considered to be lawfully in possession.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A person who, at the determination of the Postal Service, is not required to relocate permanently, or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A person who, after receiving a notice of displacement or notice to vacate by the Postal Service, is notified in writing that he or she will not be displaced. Such later notification shall not be issued if the person has already moved. If such latter notification is issued, the Postal Service shall reimburse the person for any reasonable expenses incurred to satisfy any binding contractual relocation obligations entered into after the effective date of the notice of displacement or the notice to vacate or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A person who is required to temporarily vacate the premises in order to permit fumigation, repair, painting, or other maintenance or code of enforcement work or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A tenant who is required to move from real property as a result of a notice from the Postal Service to vacate such real property where such notice to vacate is issued five years or more after the date of the acquisition of such real property. A tenant who is given a notice to vacate as a result of failure to comply with the terms of his/her lease with the Postal Service or failure to renew his/her lease under prevailing market conditions is not considered to be a displaced person.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A mobile home occupant who owns the site on which the mobile home is located and who voluntarily sells the site to the Postal Service, regardless of whether such person owns or rents the mobile home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> A person whose property is acquired through a ``friendly condemnation action'' where price is not an issue.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Displacement Dwelling. The dwelling acquired by the Postal Service from which a displaced person is required to move.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Dwelling. The place of permanent or customary and usual residence of a person including a single family house; a single family unit in a two-family, multi-family, or multi-purpose property; a unit of a condominium or cooperative housing project; a non-housekeeping unit (i.e. room in a boarding house); a mobile home; or any other residential unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Family. Two or more individuals who are related by blood, adoption, marriage, or legal guardianship who live together as a family unit. If the Postal Service considers that circumstances warrant, others who live together as a family unit may be treated as if they are a family for the purpose of determining assistance under these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Farm Operation. Any activity conducted solely or primarily for the production of one or more types of agricultural products or commodities, including timber, for sale or home use, and customarily producing such products or commodities in sufficient quantity to be capable of contributing materially to the operator's support.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Financial Means. A comparable replacement dwelling is within the financial means of the displaced family or individual if the average monthly rental or housing cost (e.g., monthly mortgage payments, insurance for the dwelling unit, property taxes, and other reasonable recurring related expenses) which the displaced person will be required to pay does not exceed the greater of 25 percent of the monthly gross income of the displaced family or individual or the ratio of the present monthly rental or housing cost to the

gross income of the displaced family or individual. (Supplemental payments made by public agencies are to be included in gross income for purposes of these comparisons.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Initiation of Negotiations. In the case where eminent domain is neither exercised nor threatened to be exercised, the initiation of negotiations is the initial written communication stating a price by the owner or the owner's representative to the Postal Service, or by the Postal Service to the owner or the owner's representative, regarding a proposed acquisition (by purchase or lease) or an interest in a specific piece of real property. In the case where eminent domain is either exercised or threatened to be exercised, the initiation of negotiations is the date the Postal Service makes a written offer of just compensation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Notice of Displacement. A notice given in writing by the Postal Service to a person that he or she will be displaced from his or her place of residence, business or farm, as a result of a facility action by the Postal Service.

A notice given in writing by the Postal Service to a person that he or she is to vacate postal owned property on or before a certain date. A notice to vacate may be combined with or in a notice of displacement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> Owner of Displacement Dwelling.

Any individual, family, partnership, corporation, association, business or farm operation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> Personal Property. Any tangible property, not considered part of the real property, for which payment has not been included in the acquisition cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Tenant. A person who has the legal right to temporary use and occupancy of real property owned by another.
