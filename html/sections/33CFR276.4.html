                            <p class="depth0">Section 134a authorizes and directs institution of a procedure for certification, at the request of local interests, that particular improvements for flood control to be locally constructed can reasonably be expected to be compatible with a specific, potential Federal project under study. Local interests may proceed to construct such certified compatible improvements at local expense with the understanding that such improvements can be expected to be included in the scope of the Federal project, if later authorized, both for the purposes of analyzing the costs and benefits of the project and assessing the local participation in the costs of such project. This legislative authority ceases to be in effect after December 31, 1977.</p>
