                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BLM will notify you in writing when it receives your application and will identify your processing fee described at Sec. 2804.14 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BLM may require you to submit additional information necessary to process the application. This information may include a detailed construction, operation, rehabilitation, and environmental protection plan, i.e., a ``Plan of Development,'' and any needed cultural resource surveys or inventories for threatened or endangered species. If BLM needs more information, we will identify this information in a written deficiency notice asking you to provide the additional information within a specified period of time. BLM will notify you of any other grant applications which involve all or part of the lands for which you applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Customer service standard.

In addition, the Bureau of Land Management may also segregate lands that it identifies for potential rights-of-way for electricity generation from wind or solar sources when initiating a competitive process for solar or wind development on particular lands. Upon segregation, such lands would not be subject to appropriation under the public land laws, including location under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.), but would remain open under the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920 (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or the Materials Act of 1947 (30 U.S.C. 601 et seq.). The BLM would effect a segregation by publishing a Federal Register notice that includes a description of the lands being segregated.

If the State Director determines an extension is necessary, the BLM will extend the segregation for up to 2 years by publishing a notice in the Federal Register, prior to the expiration of the initial segregation period. Segregations under this part may only be extended once and the total segregation period may not exceed 4 years.
