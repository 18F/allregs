                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All underground mining and reclamation activities shall be conducted to minimize disturbance of the hydrologic balance within the permit and adjacent areas, to prevent material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area, and to support approved postmining land uses in accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved permit and the performance standards of this part. The regulatory authority may require additional preventative, remedial, or monitoring measures to assure that material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area is prevented. Mining and reclamation practices that minimize water pollution and changes in flow shall be used in preference to water treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Ground-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic balance underground mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter and the following.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ground-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in a manner that minimizes acidic, toxic, or other harmful infiltration to ground-water systems and by managing excavations and other disturbances to prevent or control the discharge of pollutants into the ground water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ground-water monitoring. (1) Ground-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(h) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require additional monitoring when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ground-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the ground-water monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(h) of this chapter. The regulatory authority may require additional monitoring when necessary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ground-water monitoring data shall be submitted every 3 months to the regulatory authority or more frequently as prescribed by the regulatory authority. Monitoring reports shall include analytical results from each sample taken during the reporting period. When the analysis of any ground-water sample indicates noncompliance with the permit conditions, then the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in Sec. Sec. 773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Ground-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with the procedures of Sec. 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the monitoring requirements including the parameters covered and the sampling frequency if the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operation has minimized disturbance to the prevailing hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the

permit area; water quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(h) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring the quality and quantity of ground water onsite and offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed by the operator when no longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Surface-water protection. In order to protect the hydrologic balance, underground mining activities shall be conducted according to the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter, and the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Surface-water quality shall be protected by handling earth materials, ground-water discharges, and runoff in a manner that minimizes the formation of acidic or toxic drainage; prevents, to the extent possible using the best technology currently available, additional contribution of suspended solids to streamflow outside the permit area; and otherwise prevent water pollution. If drainage control, restabilization and revegetation of disturbed areas, diversion of runoff, mulching, or other reclamation and remedial practices are not adequate to meet the requirements of this section and Sec. 817.42, the operator shall use and maintain the necessary water-treatment facilities or water quality controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Surface-water quantity and flow rates shall be protected by handling earth materials and runoff in accordance with the steps outlined in the plan approved under Sec. 784.14(g) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Surface-water monitoring. (1) Surface-water monitoring shall be conducted according to the surface-water monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(i) of this chapter.

When the analysis of any surface-water sample indicates noncompliance with the permit conditions, the operator shall promptly notify the regulatory authority and immediately take the actions provided for in Sec. Sec. 773.17(e) and 784.14(g) of this chapter. The reporting requirements of this paragraph do not exempt the operator from meeting any National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Surface-water monitoring shall proceed through mining and continue during reclamation until bond release. Consistent with Sec. 774.13 of this chapter, the regulatory authority may modify the monitoring requirements, except those required by the NPDES permitting authority, including the parameters covered and sampling frequency if the operator demonstrates, using the monitoring data obtained under this paragraph, that--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The operation has minimized disturbance to the hydrologic balance in the permit and adjacent areas and prevented material damage to the hydrologic balance outside the permit area; water quantity and quality are suitable to support approved postmining land uses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Monitoring is no longer necessary to achieve the purposes set forth in the monitoring plan approved under Sec. 784.14(i) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Equipment, structures, and other devices used in conjunction with monitoring the quality and quantity of surface water onsite and offsite shall be properly installed, maintained, and operated and shall be removed by the operator when no longer needed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Acid- and toxic-forming materials.

the infiltration of polluted water. Storage shall be limited to the period until burial and/or treatment first become feasible, and so long as storage will not result in any risk of water pollution or other environmental damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Storage, burial or treatment practices shall be consistent with other material handling and disposal provisions of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Transfer of wells. Before final release of bond, exploratory or monitoring wells shall be sealed in a safe and environmentally sound manner in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.13 and 817.15. With the prior approval of the regulatory authority, wells may be transferred to another party for further use. However, at a minimum, the conditions of such transfer shall comply with State and local laws and the permittee shall remain responsible for the proper management of the well until bond release in accordance with Sec. Sec. 817.13 to 817.15.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Discharges into an underground mine.

The permittee must promptly replace any drinking, domestic or residential water supply that is contaminated, diminished or interrupted by underground mining activities conducted after October 24, 1992, if the affected well or spring was in existence before the date the regulatory authority received the permit application for the activities causing the loss, contamination or interruption. The baseline hydrologic information required in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and 784.14 of this chapter and the geologic information concerning baseline hydrologic conditions required in Sec. Sec. 780.21 and 784.22 of this chapter will be used to determine the impact of mining activities upon the water supply.
