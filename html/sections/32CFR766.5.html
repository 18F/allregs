                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Risk. The use of Navy or Marine Corps aviation facilities by civil aircraft shall be at the risk of the operator. Except as hereinafter provided for U.S. Government contractors, the Department of the Navy shall assume no

liability or responsibility by reason of the condition of the landing area, taxiways, radio and navigational aids, or other equipment or for notification of such condition; or by the acts of its agents in connection with the granting of the right to use such naval facility. No responsibility is assumed for the security of or damage to aircraft while on property owned or controlled by the U.S. Government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Military rules. Operators of civil aircraft utilizing a Navy or Marine Corps aviation facility shall be required to comply with the air and ground rules promulgated by the Department of the Navy and the commanding officer of the aviation facility. Such compliance shall pertain specifically to clearance authorization for the entry, departure, or movement of aircraft within the confines of the terminal area normally controlled by the commanding officer of the aviation facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Federal aviation regulations. Operators of civil aircraft shall be required to comply with all Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) rules and regulations including filing of flight plans. When such flight plans are required, they shall be filed with the commanding officer or his authorized representative prior to the departure of the aircraft. When such a flight plan is not required, a list of passengers and crew members, the airport of first intended landing, the alternate airport, and fuel supply in hours shall be placed on file prior to takeoff, with the commanding officer or with the local company representative as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Hours of operation. The use of a Navy/Marine Corps aviation facility by civil aircraft shall be limited to the hours when the facility is normally in operation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Weather minimums. Civil aircraft shall comply with weather minimums as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Visual Flight Operations shall be conducted in accordance with Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Sec. 91.105 of this title. If more stringent visual flight rules minimums have been established for the point of departure or destination, as noted in the aerodrome remarks section of the Department of Defense Flight Information Publication (en Route) Instrument Flight Rules--Supplement, then the ceiling and visibility must be at or above these minimums in the applicable control zone.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Instrument flight operations shall be conducted in accordance with FAR, Sec. 91.116 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Inspection. The commanding officer may conduct such inspection of a transiting civil aircraft and its crew, passengers and cargo as he may consider appropriate or necessary to the carrying out of his duties and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Customs, immigration, agriculture, and public health inspection. (1) The civil aircraft commander shall be responsible for compliance with all applicable customs, immigration, agriculture, and public health laws and regulations. He shall also be responsible for paying fees, charges for overtime services, and for all other costs connected with the administration of such laws and regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The commanding officer of the Navy/Marine Corps aviation facility will inform the appropriate public officials of the arrival of civil aircraft subject to such laws and regulations. He will not issue clearances for a civil aircraft to takeoff until such laws and regulations have been complied with. Procedures for insuring compliance with such laws and regulations shall be as mutually agreed to by the commanding officer of the aviation facility and the local public officials.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Weather alternate. If a Navy/Marine Corps aviation facility has been approved for use as an alternate airport, radio clearance must be obtained from such facility as soon as the decision is made en route for such use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Emergency landings. Any aircraft may land at a Navy/Marine Corps aviation facility when necessary as a result of a bona fide emergency. However, whenever the nature of the emergency permits the pilot to select the time and place of landing, it is preferred that the pilot land his aircraft at a civil field.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The commanding officer of the aviation facility will require that the pilot of the aircraft pay all fees and charges and execute the Aviation Facility License. A statement explaining the circumstances of the emergency

landing must be noted in Sec. 766.5 of the license application. If a narrative report from the pilot is available, it may be attached to the application.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Clearance of runway. The Department of the Navy reserves the right to use any method to clear a runway of aircraft or wreckage consistent with operational requirements. Care will be exercised to preclude unnecessary damage in removing wrecked aircraft; however, the Navy assumes no liability as a result of such removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Repairs. (i) Aircraft requiring major repairs may be stored temporarily in damaged condition. If repairs cannot be completed within a reasonable time, the aircraft must be removed from the facility by the owner or operator of the aircraft without delay.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No aircraft will be given a major or minor overhaul.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Engine or air frame minor components may be furnished, when not available through commercial sources, provided such supplies can be spared and are not known to be in short supply. The issuance of such supplies must be approved by the commanding officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Minor components in short supply or major components for which there is a repeated demand can be furnished only on message authority obtained from the Aviation Supply Office, Philadelphia, PA (for continental facilities) or local fleet air command or major aviation supply depot (for extracontinental facilities). Complete engines, airplane wings, or other major items of equipment shall not be furnished under this authority.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If the commanding officer believes it is desirable to furnish requested material or services in excess of the restrictions stated herein, he shall request instructions from the Chief of Naval Operations, giving a brief description of the material or services requested together with his recommendations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reimbursement for costs. (i) The civil user making an emergency landing will be billed in accordance with paragraphs 032500-032503 of the NAVCOMPT Manual and paragraphs 25345-25363 of the NAVSUP Manual for payment of all costs incurred by the Government as a direct result of the emergency landing. Such costs will include those associated with labor, material, rental of equipment, vehicles or tools, etc., for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Spreading foam on runway before the aircraft attempts emergency landing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fire and crash control and rescue.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Movement and storage of aircraft or wreckage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Damage to runway, lights, navigation aids, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> There will be no charge for naval meteorological services and naval communications facilities for the handling of arrival and departure reports, air traffic control messages, position reports and safety messages.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The determination as to whether landing fees shall be charged pursuant to an emergency landing for maintenance or repair shall be the prerogative of the commanding officer of the facility.
