Appendix A to Part 1320--Agencies With Delegated Review and</p><p class="depth0">Approval Authority</p><p class="depth0">1. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to review and approve collection of information  requests, collection of information requirements, and collections of  information in current rules is delegated to the Board of Governors of  the Federal Reserve System.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This delegation does not include review and approval authority  over any new collection of information or any modification to an  existing collection of information that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Is proposed to be collected as a result of a requirement or  other mandate of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council,  or other Federal executive branch entities with authority to require the  Board to conduct or sponsor a collection of information.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is objected to by another Federal agency on the grounds that  agency requires information currently collected by the Board, that the  currently collected information is being deleted from the collection,  and the deletion will have a serious adverse impact on the agency's  program, provided that such objection is certified to OMB by the head of  the Federal agency involved, with a copy to the Board, before the end of  the comment period specified by the Board on the Federal Register  notices specified in paragraph (1)(3)(i) of this section 1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Would cause the burden of the information collections  conducted or sponsored by the Board to exceed by the end of the fiscal  year the Information Collection Budget allowance set by the Board and  OMB for the fiscal year-end.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Board may ask that OMB review and approve collections of  information covered by this delegation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In exercising delegated authority, the Board will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with  reasonable opportunity to comment on collections of information under  review prior to taking final action approving the collection. Reasonable  opportunity for public comment will include publishing a notice in the  Federal Register informing the public of the proposed collection of  information, announcing the beginning of a 60-day public comment period,  and the availability of copies of the ``clearance package,'' to provide  the public with the opportunity to comment. Such Federal Register  notices shall also advise the public that they may also send a copy of  their comments to the Federal Reserve Board and to the OMB/OIRA Desk  Officer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Should the Board determine that a new collection of information  or a change in an existing collection must be instituted quickly and  that public participation in the approval process would defeat the  purpose of the collection or substantially interfere with the Board's  ability to perform its statutory obligation, the Board may temporarily  approve of the collection of information for a period not to exceed 90  days without providing opportunity for public comment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At the earliest practical date after approving the temporary  extension to the collection of information, the Board will publish a  Federal Register notice informing the public of its approval of the  collection of information and indicating why immediate action was  necessary. In such cases, the Board will conduct a normal delegated  review and publish a notice in the Federal Register soliciting public  comment on the intention to extend the collection of information for a  period not to exceed three years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide the OMB/OIRA Desk Officer for the Federal Reserve Board  with a copy of the Board's Federal Register notice not later than the  day the Board files the notice with the Office of the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed  not less frequently than once every three years, and that such reviews  are normally conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval.  Where   the review has not been completed prior to the expiration date, the  Board may extend the report, for up to three months, without public  notice in order to complete the review and consequent revisions, if any.  There may also be other circumstances in which the Board determines that  a three-month extension without public notice is appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Take every reasonable step to conduct the review established  under 5 CFR 1320.8, including the seeking of public comment under 5 CFR  1320.8(d). In determining whether to approve a collection of  information, the Board will consider all comments received from the  public and other agencies. The Board will not approve a collection of  information that it determines does not satisfy the guidelines set forth  in 5 CFR 1320.5(d)(2), unless it determines that departure from these  guidelines is necessary to satisfy statutory requirements or other  substantial need.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Assure that each approved collection of information displays,  as required by 5 CFR 1320.6, a currently valid OMB control number and  the fact that a person is not required to respond to a collection of  information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Assure that all collections of information, except those  contained in regulations, display the expiration date of the approval,  or, in case the expiration date has been omitted, explain the decision  that it would not be appropriate, under 5 CFR 1320.5(a)(1)(iii)(C), for  a proposed collection of information to display an expiration date.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Assure that each collection of information, as required by 5 CFR  1320.8(b)(3), informs and provides fair notice to the potential  respondents of why the information is being collected; the way in which  such information is to be used; the estimated burden; whether responses  are voluntary, required to obtain or retain a benefit, or mandatory; the  confidentiality to be provided; and the fact that an agency may not  conduct or sponsor, and the respondent is not required to respond to, a  collection of information unless it displays a currently valid OMB  control number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Assure that each approved collection of information, together  with a completed form OMB 83-I, a supporting statement, a copy of each  comment received from the public and other agencies in response to the  Board's Federal Register notice or a summary of these comments, the  certification required by 5 CFR 1320.9, and a certification that the  Board has approved of the collection of information in accordance with  the provisions of this delegation is transmitted to OMB for  incorporation into OMB's public docket files. Such transmittal shall be  made as soon as practical after the Board has taken final action  approving the collection. However, no collection of information may be  instituted until the Board has delivered this transmittal to OMB.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OMB will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the Board in advance with a block of control numbers  which the Board will assign in sequential order to and display on, new  collections of information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide a written notice of action to the Board indicating that  the Board approvals of collections of information that have been  received by OMB and incorporated into OMB's public docket files and an  inventory of currently approved collections of information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Review any collection of information referred by the Board in  accordance with the provisions of section 1(a)(2) of this Appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> OMB may review the Board's paperwork review process under the  delegation. The Board will cooperate in carrying out such a review. The  Board will respond to any recommendations resulting from such review  and, if it finds the recommendations to be appropriate, will either  accept the recommendations or propose an alternative approach to achieve  the intended purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This delegation may, as provided by 5 CFR 1320.16(c), be  limited, conditioned, or rescinded, in whole or in part at any time. OMB  will exercise this authority only in unusual circumstances and, in those  rare instances, will do so, subject to the provisions of 5 CFR  1320.10(f) and 1320.10(g), prior to the expiration of the time period  set for public comment in the Board's Federal Register notices and  generally only if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Prior to the commencement of a Board review (e.g., during the  review for the Information Collection Budget). OMB has notified the  Board that it intends to review a specific new proposal for the  collection of information or the continued use (with or without  modification) of an existing collection;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There is substantial public objection to a proposed information  collection: or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> of this  Appendix.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Where OMB conducts a review of a Board information collection  proposal under section 1(a)(1), 1(a)(2), or 1(d) of this Appendix, the  provisions of 5 CFR 1320.13 continue to apply.</p><p class="depth0">2. The Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Authority to review and approve currently valid (OMB-approved)  collections of   information, including collections of information contained in existing  rules, that have a total annual burden of 5,000 hours or less and a  burden of less than 500 hours per respondent is delegated to the  Managing Director of the Federal Communications Commission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> This delegation does not include review and approval authority  over any new collection of information, any collections whose approval  has lapsed, any substantive or material modification to existing  collections, any reauthorization of information collections employing  statistical methods, or any information collections that exceed a total  annual burden of 5,000 hours or an estimated burden of 500 hours per  respondent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Managing Director may ask that OMB review and approve  collections of information covered by the delegation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In exercising delegated authority, the Managing Director will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Provide the public, to the extent possible and appropriate, with  reasonable opportunity to comment on collections of information under  review prior to taking final action on reauthorizing an existing  collection. Reasonable opportunity for public comment will include  publishing a notice in the Federal Register and an FCC Public Notice  informing the public that a collection of information is being extended  and announcing the beginning of a 60-day comment period, notifying the  public of the ``intent to extend an information collection,'' and  providing the public with the opportunity to comment on the need for the  information, its practicality, the accuracy of the agency's burden  estimate, and on ways to minimize burden, including the use of  automated, electronic, mechanical, or other technological collection  techniques or other forms of information technology, e.g., permitting  electronic submission of responses. Such notices shall advise the public  that they may also send a copy of their comments to the OMB/Office of  Information and Regulatory Affairs desk officer for the Commission.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Should the Managing Director determine that a collection of  information that falls within the scope of this delegation must be  reauthorized quickly and that public participation in the  reauthorization process interferes with the Commission's ability to  perform its statutory obligation, the Managing Director may temporarily  reauthorize the extension of an information collection, for a period not  to exceed 90 days, without providing opportunity for public comment.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> At the earliest practical date after granting this temporary  extension to an information collection, the Managing Director will  conduct a normal delegated review and publish a Federal Register notice  soliciting public comment on its intention to extend the collection of  information for a period not to exceed three years.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Assure that approved collections of information are reviewed  not less frequently than once every three years and that such reviews  are conducted before the expiration date of the prior approval. When the  review is not completed prior to the expiration date, the Managing  Director will submit the lapsed information collection to OMB for review  and reauthorization.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assure that each reauthorized collection of information  displays an OMB control number and, except for those contained in  regulations or specifically designated by OMB, displays the expiration  date of the approval.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Inform and provide fair notice to the potential respondents, as  required by 5 CFR 1320.8(b)(3), of why the information is being  collected; the way in which such information is to be used; the  estimated burden; whether responses are voluntary, required, required to  obtain or retain a benefit, or mandatory; the confidentiality to be  provided; and the fact that an agency may not conduct or sponsor, and  the respondent is not required to respond to, a collection of  information unless it displays a currently valid OMB control number.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Transmit to OMB for incorporation into OMB's public docket  files, a report of delegated approval certifying that the Managing  Director has reauthorized each collection of information in accordance  with the provisions of this delegation. The Managing Director shall also  make the certification required by 5 CFR 1320.9, e.g., that the approved  collection of information reduces to the extent practicable and  appropriate, the burden on respondents, including, for small business,  local government, and other small entities, the use of the techniques  outlined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Such transmittals shall be  made no later than 15 days after the Managing Director has taken final  action reauthorizing the extension of an information collection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Ensure that the personnel in the Commission's functional  bureaus and offices responsible for managing information collections  receive periodic training on procedures related to meeting the  requirements of this part and the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> OMB will:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide notice to the Commission acknowledging receipt of the  report of delegated approval and its incorporation into OMB's public  docket files and inventory of currently approved collections of  information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this appendix.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Periodically assess, at its discretion, the Commission's  paperwork review process as administered under the delegation.
