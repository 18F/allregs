                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opportunity for hearing. When an opportunity for a hearing is required by Sec. 1203.8(c), reasonable notice shall be given by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the affected applicant or recipient. This notice shall advise the applicant or recipient of the action proposed to be taken, the specific provision under which the proposed action against it is to be taken, and the matters of fact or law asserted as the basis for this action, and either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fix a date not less than 20 days after the date of notice within which the applicant or recipient may request of ACTION that the matter be scheduled for hearing; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Advise the applicant or recipient that the matter in question has been set down for hearing at a stated time and place. The time and place so fixed shall be reasonable and subject to change for cause. The complainant, if any, shall be advised of the time and place of the hearing. An applicant or recipient may waive a hearing and submit written information and argument for the record. The failure of an applicant or recipient to request a hearing under this paragraph or to appear at a hearing for which a date has been set is deemed to be a waiver of the right to a hearing under section 602 of title VI and Sec. 1203.8(c) and consent to the making of a decision on the basis of the information available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place of hearing. Hearings shall be held at the offices of ACTION in Washington, DC, at a time fixed by ACTION unless it determines that the convenience of the applicant or recipient or of ACTION requires that another place be selected. Hearings shall be held before the Director, or at his discretion, before a hearing examiner appointed in accordance with section 3105 of title 5, United States Code, or detailed under section 3344 of title 5, United States Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Right to counsel. In all proceedings under this section, the applicant or recipient and ACTION have the right to be represented by counsel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedures, evidence, and record. (1) The hearing, decision, and an administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 554 through 557 of title 5, United States Code, and in accordance with the rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both ACTION and the applicant or recipient are entitled to introduce relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The hearing, decision, and an administrative review thereof shall be conducted in conformity with sections 554 through 557 of title 5, United States Code, and in accordance with the rules of procedure as are proper (and not inconsistent with this section) relating to the conduct of the hearing, giving of notices subsequent to those provided for in paragraph (a) of this section, taking of testimony, exhibits, arguments, and briefs, requests for findings, and other related matters. Both ACTION and the applicant or recipient are entitled to introduce relevant evidence on the issues as stated in the notice for hearing or as determined by the officer conducting the hearing at the outset of or during the hearing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical rules of evidence do not apply to hearings conducted pursuant

to this part, but rules or principles designed to assure production of the most credible evidence available and to subject testimony to test by cross-examination shall be applied where determined reasonably necessary by the officer conducting the hearing. The hearing officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence. Documents and other evidence offered or taken for the record shall be open to examination by the parties and opportunity shall be given to refute facts and arguments advanced on either side of the issues. A transcript shall be made of the oral evidence except to the extent the substance thereof is stipulated for the record. Decisions shall be based on the hearing record and written findings shall be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Consolidated or joint hearings. In cases in which the same or related facts are asserted to constitute noncompliance with this part with respect to two or more Federal statutes, authorities, or other means by which Federal financial assistance is extended and to which this part applies, or noncompliance with this part and the regulations of one or more other Federal departments or agencies issued under title VI, ACTION may, by agreement with the other departments or agencies, when applicable, provide for the conduct of consolidated or joint hearings, and for the application to these hearings of rules or procedures not inconsistent with this part. Final decisions in these cases, insofar as this regulation is concerned, shall be made in accordance with Sec. 1203.10.
