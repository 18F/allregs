                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a lease was in effect before August 8, 2005, the lessee may  submit to BLM a request to modify the royalty rate terms of your lease  to the applicable royalty rate or direct use fee terms prescribed in the  Geothermal Steam Act as amended by the Energy Policy Act of 2005. You  may withdraw your request before it is granted, but once you accept the  new terms, you may not revert to the earlier royalty rates. If your  request to modify is granted, the new royalty rate or direct use fees  will apply to all geothermal resources produced from your lease for as  long as your lease remains in effect. A modification under this section  does not affect the royalty rate for byproducts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The royalty rate for leases whose terms are modified and  production from which is used for commercial generation of electricity  is prescribed in Sec. 3211.17(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The direct use fees or royalty rate for leases whose terms are  modified and production from which is used directly for purposes other  than commercial generation of electricity is prescribed in Sec.  3211.18(a) of this part and MMS regulations at 30 CFR 206.356.</p>
