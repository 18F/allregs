                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With fuel supplied to the engine at the flow and pressure  specified by the applicant, the engine must function properly under each  operating condition required by this part. Each fuel control adjusting  means that may   not be manipulated while the fuel control device is mounted on the  engine must be secured by a locking device and sealed, or otherwise be  inaccessible. All other fuel control adjusting means must be accessible  and marked to indicate the function of the adjustment unless the  function is obvious.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It must be accessible for draining and cleaning and must  incorporate a screen or element that is easily removable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It must have a sediment trap and drain except that it need not  have a drain if the strainer or filter is easily removable for drain  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It must be mounted so that its weight is not supported by the  connecting lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer  or filter, unless adequate strength margins under all loading conditions  are provided in the lines and connections.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It must have the type and degree of fuel filtering specified as  necessary for protection of the engine fuel system against foreign  particles in the fuel. The applicant must show:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> That foreign particles passing through the specified filtering  means do not impair the engine fuel system functioning; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> That the fuel system is capable of sustained operation  throughout its flow and pressure range with the fuel initially saturated  with water at 80 [deg]F (27 [deg]C) and having 0.025 fluid ounces per  gallon (0.20 milliliters per liter) of free water added and cooled to  the most critical condition for icing likely to be encountered in  operation. However, this requirement may be met by demonstrating the  effectiveness of specified approved fuel anti-icing additives, or that  the fuel system incorporates a fuel heater which maintains the fuel  temperature at the fuel strainer or fuel inlet above 32 [deg]F (0  [deg]C) under the most critical conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The applicant must demonstrate that the filtering means has the  capacity (with respect to engine operating limitations) to ensure that  the engine will continue to operate within approved limits, with fuel  contaminated to the maximum degree of particle size and density likely  to be encountered in service. Operation under these conditions must be  demonstrated for a period acceptable to the Administrator, beginning  when indication of impending filter blockage is first given by either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Existing engine instrumentation; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional means incorporated into the engine fuel system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any strainer or filter bypass must be designed and constructed  so that the release of collected contaminants is minimized by  appropriate location of the bypass to ensure that collected contaminants  are not in the bypass flow path.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If provided as part of the engine, the applicant must show for  each fluid injection (other than fuel) system and its controls that the  flow of the injected fluid is adequately controlled.
