                            <p class="depth0">All sample handling, testing procedures, and tests must be conducted using good laboratory practices.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. As used in this subpart D:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Performance-based Analytical Test Method Approach means a measurement system based upon established performance criteria for accuracy and precision with use of analytical test methods. As used in this subpart, this is a measurement system used by laboratories to demonstrate that a particular analytical test method is acceptable for demonstrating compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accuracy means the closeness of agreement between an observed value from a single test measurement and an accepted reference value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Precision means the degree of agreement in a set of measurements performed on the same property of identical test material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Absolute fuel parameter means a fuel parameter for which a gravimetric standard is practical to construct and use. Sulfur content of gasoline, butane, or diesel fuel are examples of an absolute fuel parameter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Gravimetric standard means a test material made by adding a carefully weighed quantity of the analyte to a measured quantity of another substance known not to contain any of the analyte, resulting in a solution with an accurately known concentrate of the analyte.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Consensus named fuels are homogeneous quantities of fuel that have been analyzed by a number of different laboratories (by sending around small samples). The average concentration of some parameter of interest across all of the different laboratories is then used as the ``consensus name'' for that material.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Locally-named reference materials are gasoline or diesel fuels that are usually from the regular production of the facility where they are used in laboratory quality control efforts and have been analyzed using the designated method (either by the facility's lab or by a reference lab) to obtain an estimate of their concentration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Method-defined fuel parameter means a fuel parameter for which an EPA-prescribed primary test method or designated method defines the regulatory standard. Examples of method-defined fuel parameters include olefin content in gasoline, Reid vapor pressure (RVP) of gasoline, distillation parameters of gasoline, benzene content

of gasoline, aromatic content of gasoline and diesel fuel, and oxygen/oxygenates content of gasoline.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Reference installations are designated test method installations that are used to qualify the accuracy of other method-defined parameter instruments. Reference installations of the designated test method will be used to evaluate the accuracy of other method-defined alternative test methods and to establish correlation equations if necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Correlation equation is a correction equation as determined by the use of ASTM D6708. This standard practice determines whether the comparison between the alternative test method and the designated test method is a null result. If the comparison is not null, then the standard practice provides for a correlation equation that predicts designated test method results from the applicable method-defined alternative test method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Statistical quality control (SQC) means a planned system of activities whose purpose is to provide a level of quality that meets the needs of compliance with the standards of this part. This subpart prescribes specific SQC requirements for both absolute and method driven fuel parameters for both voluntary and non-voluntary consensus-based standards bodies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Voluntary consensus-based standards body (VCSB) means a domestic or international organization that plans, develops, establishes, or coordinates voluntary consensus standards using agreed-upon procedures and which possesses the attributes of openness, balance of interest, due process, and consensus, as explained in OMB Circular A-119 and the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995, P.L. 104-113, sec. 12(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Non-voluntary consensus-based standards body (non-VCSB) means a domestic or international regulated party that has developed a proprietary analytical test method that has not been adopted by a VCSB organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Precision and accuracy criteria for approval for the absolute fuel parameter of gasoline sulfur.--(1) Precision.
