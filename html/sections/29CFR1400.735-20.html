                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In 1964, a Code of Professional Conduct for Labor Mediators was  drafted by a Federal-State Liaison Committee and approved by the Service  and the Association of Labor Mediation Agencies at its annual meeting.  It is expected that mediators in the Federal Mediation and Conciliation  Service will make themselves familiar with this Code and will conduct  themselves in accordance with the responsibilities outlined therein. The  complete narrative of the Code appears in the appendix to this part.</p>
