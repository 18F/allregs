                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Most species taken in limited entry fixed gear (longline and pot/trap) fisheries will be managed with cumulative trip limits (see trip limits in Tables 2 (North) and 2 (South)

of this subpart), size limits (see Sec. 660.60(h)(5)), seasons (see trip limits in Tables 2 (North) and 2 (South) of this subpart and sablefish primary season details in Sec. 660.231), gear restrictions (see paragraph (b) of this section), and closed areas (see paragraph (d) of this section and Sec. Sec. 660.70 through 660.79). Cowcod retention is prohibited in all fisheries, and groundfish vessels operating south of Point Conception must adhere to CCA restrictions (see paragraph (d)(10) of this section and Sec. 660.70). Yelloweye rockfish and canary rockfish retention is prohibited in the limited entry fixed gear fisheries. Regulations governing and tier limits for the limited entry, fixed gear sablefish primary season north of 36[deg] N. lat. are found in Sec. 660.231. Vessels not participating in the sablefish primary season are subject to daily or weekly sablefish limits in addition to cumulative limits for each cumulative limit period. Only one sablefish landing per week may be made in excess of the daily trip limit and, if the vessel chooses to make a landing in excess of that daily trip limit, then that is the only sablefish landing permitted for that week. The trip limit for black rockfish caught with hook-and-line gear also applies, see Sec. 660.230(e). The trip limits in Table 2 (North) and Table 2 (South) of this subpart apply to vessels participating in the limited entry groundfish fixed gear fishery and may not be exceeded. Federal commercial groundfish regulations are not intended to supersede any more restrictive state commercial groundfish regulations relating to federally-managed groundfish.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Gear restrictions--(1) Longline and pot or trap gear are authorized in the limited entry fixed gear fishery, providing the gear is in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this section, and gear marking requirements described in Sec. 660.219 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Longline and pot or trap gear are authorized in the limited entry fixed gear fishery, providing the gear is in compliance with the restrictions set forth in this section, and gear marking requirements described in Sec. 660.219 of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Vessels participating in the limited entry fixed gear fishery may also fish with open access gear subject to the gear restrictions at Sec. 660.330(b), subpart F, but will be subject to the most restrictive trip limits for the gear used as specified at Sec. 660.60(h)(7), subpart C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limited entry fixed gear (longline, trap or pot gear) must be attended at least once every 7 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Traps or pots must have biodegradable escape panels constructed with 21 or smaller untreated cotton twine in such a manner that an opening at least 8 inches (20.3 cm) in diameter results when the twine deteriorates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sorting Requirements. (1) In addition to the requirements at Sec. 660.12(a)(8) the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In addition to the requirements at Sec. 660.12(a)(8) the States of Washington, Oregon, and California may also require that vessels record their landings as sorted on their state landing receipts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For limited entry fixed gear vessels, the following species must be sorted:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Coastwide--widow rockfish, canary rockfish, darkblotched rockfish, yelloweye rockfish, shortbelly rockfish, black rockfish, blue rockfish, minor nearshore rockfish, minor shelf rockfish, minor slope rockfish, shortraker rockfish, rougheye/blackspotted rockfish, shortspine and longspine thornyhead, Dover sole, arrowtooth flounder, petrale sole, starry flounder, English sole, other flatfish, lingcod, sablefish, Pacific cod, spiny dogfish, other fish, longnose skate, and Pacific whiting;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> North of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.--POP, yellowtail rockfish, cabezon (Oregon and California);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> South of 40[deg]10[min] N. lat.--minor shallow nearshore rockfish, minor deeper nearshore rockfish, California scorpionfish, chilipepper, bocaccio, splitnose rockfish, Pacific sanddabs, cowcod, bronzespotted rockfish, blackgill rockfish and cabezon.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Groundfish conservation areas applicable to limited entry fixed gear vessels. A GCA, a type of closed area, is a geographic area defined by coordinates expressed in degrees of latitude and longitude.

It is unlawful to take and retain, possess, or land groundfish taken with limited entry nontrawl gear within the nontrawl RCA, unless otherwise authorized in this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limited entry nontrawl vessels may transit through the nontrawl RCA, with or without groundfish on board, provided all groundfish nontrawl gear is stowed either: Below deck; or if the gear cannot readily be moved, in a secured and covered manner, detached from all lines, so that it is rendered unusable for fishing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The nontrawl RCA restrictions in this section apply to vessels registered to limited entry fixed gear permits fishing for species other than groundfish with nontrawl gear on trips where groundfish species are retained. Unless otherwise authorized in this section, a vessel may not retain any groundfish taken on a fishing trip for species other than groundfish that occurs within the nontrawl RCA. If a vessel fishes in a non-groundfish fishery in the nontrawl RCA, it may not participate in any fishing for groundfish on that trip that is prohibited within the nontrawl RCA. [For example, if a vessel fishes in the salmon troll fishery within the RCA, the vessel cannot on the same trip fish in the sablefish fishery outside of the RCA.]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> It is lawful to fish within the nontrawl RCA with limited entry fixed gear only under the following conditions: when fishing for ``other flatfish'' off California (between 42[deg] N. lat. south

to the U.S./Mexico border) using no more than 12 hooks, ``Number 2'' or smaller, which measure no more than 11 mm (0.44 inches) point to shank, and up to two 1-lb (0.91 kg) weights per line when trip limits authorize such fishing, provided a valid declaration report as required at Sec. 660.13(d), subpart C, has been filed with NMFS OLE.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Farallon Islands.
