Starting from a speed at least 10 knots above the stall speed, the elevator control must be pulled back so that the rate of speed reduction will not exceed one knot per second until a stall is produced, as shown by either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An uncontrollable downward pitching motion of the airplane;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A downward pitching motion of the airplane that results from the activation of a stall avoidance device (for example, stick pusher); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The control reaching the stop.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Normal use of elevator control for recovery is allowed after the downward pitching motion of paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section has unmistakably been produced, or after the control has been held against the stop for not less than the longer of two seconds or the time employed in the minimum steady slight speed determination of Sec. 23.49.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> During the entry into and the recovery from the maneuver, it must be possible to prevent more than 15 degrees of roll or yaw by the normal use of controls except as provided for in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For airplanes approved with a maximum operating altitude at or above 25,000 feet during the entry into and the recovery from stalls performed at or above 25,000 feet, it must be possible to prevent more than 25 degrees of roll or yaw by the normal use of controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Compliance with the requirements of this section must be shown under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wing flaps: Retracted, fully extended, and each intermediate normal operating position, as appropriate for the phase of flight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Landing gear: Retracted and extended as appropriate for the altitude.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Cowl flaps: Appropriate to configuration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Spoilers/speedbrakes: Retracted and extended unless they have no measureable effect at low speeds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Power:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Power/Thrust off; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For reciprocating engine powered airplanes: 75 percent of maximum continuous power.
