                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> At the time of original classification, the original  classification authority shall establish a specific date or event for  declassification based on the duration of the national security  sensitivity of the information. Upon reaching the date or event, the  information shall be automatically declassified. Except for information  that should clearly and demonstrably be expected to reveal the identity  of a confidential human source or a human intelligence source or key  design concepts of weapons of mass destruction, the date or event shall  not exceed the timeframe established in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the original classification authority cannot determine an  earlier specific date or event for declassification, information shall  be marked for declassification 10 years from the date of the original  decision, unless the original classification authority otherwise  determines that the sensitivity of the information requires that it be  marked for declassification for up to 25 years from the date of the  original decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An original classification authority may extend the duration of  classification up to 25 years from the date of origin of the document,  change the level of classification, or reclassify specific information  only when the standards and procedures for classifying information under  this Order are followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> No information may remain classified indefinitely. Information  that is marked for an indefinite duration of classification under  predecessor orders, for example, information marked as ``Originating  Agency's Determination Required,'' or classified information that  contains either incomplete or no declassification instructions, shall  have appropriate declassification information applied in accordance with  part 3 of this order.
