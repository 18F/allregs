                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Loan amount. The total amount of Agency loans to one borrower, including: The guaranteed and unguaranteed portions; the outstanding principal and interest balance of any existing Agency guaranteed loans; and new loan request, must not exceed $10 million, except as outlined in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception to the $10 million limit for loans of $25 million or less under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The project to be financed is a high-priority project. Priority will be determined in accordance with the criteria contained in Sec. 4279.155 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The lender must document to the satisfaction of the Agency that the loan will not be made and the project will not be completed if the guarantee is not approved;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The percentage of guarantee will not exceed 60 percent. No exception to this requirement will be approved under paragraph (b) of this section for loans exceeding $10 million; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Any request for a guaranteed loan exceeding the $10 million limit must be submitted to the Agency in the form of a preapplication. The preapplication must be submitted to the National Office for review and concurrence before encouraging a full application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary, whose authority may not be redelegated, may approve guaranteed loans in excess of $25 million, at the Secretary's discretion, for rural cooperative organizations that process value-added agricultural commodities in accordance with Sec. 4279.108(d)(1) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Percent of guarantee. The percentage of guarantee, up to the maximum allowed by this section, is a matter of negotiation between the lender and the Agency. The maximum percentage of guarantee is 80 percent for loans of $5 million or less, 70 percent for loans between $5 and $10 million, and 60 percent

for loans exceeding $10 million. Notwithstanding the preceding, the Administrator may, at the Administrator's discretion, grant an exception allowing guarantees of up to 90 percent on loans of $10 million or less under the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The project to be financed is a high-priority project. Priority will be determined in accordance with the criteria contained in 4279.155 of this subpart;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The lender must document to the satisfaction of the Agency that the loan will not be made and the project will not be completed if the higher guarantee percentage is not approved; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State Director may grant an exception for loans of up to 90 percent on loans of $2 million or less subject to the State Director's delegated loan authority and meeting all of the conditions as set forth in this section. In cases where the State Director does not have the loan approval authority to approve a loan of $2 million or less or the proposed percentage, the case must be submitted to the National Office for review.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each fiscal year, the Agency will establish a limit on the maximum portion of guarantee authority available for that fiscal year that may be used to guarantee loans with a guarantee percentage exceeding 80 percent. The limit will be announced by publishing a notice in the Federal Register. Once the limit has been reached, the guarantee percentage for all additional loans guaranteed during the remainder of that fiscal year will not exceed 80 percent.
