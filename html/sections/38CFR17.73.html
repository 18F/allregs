                                Sec.  17.73  Medical foster homes--general.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. Through the medical foster home program, VA recognizes  and approves certain medical foster homes for the placement of veterans.  The choice to become a resident of a medical foster home is a voluntary  one on the part of each veteran. VA's role is limited to referring  veterans to approved medical foster homes. When a veteran is placed in  an approved home, VA will provide inspections to ensure that the home  continues to meet the requirements of this part, as well as oversight  and medical foster home caregiver training. If a medical foster home  does not meet VA's criteria for approval, VA will not refer any veteran  to the home or provide any of these services. VA may also provide  certain medical benefits to veterans placed in   medical foster homes, consistent with the VA program in which the  veteran is enrolled.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section and Sec.  17.74:</p><p class="depth2">Labeled means that the equipment or materials have attached to them  a label, symbol, or other identifying mark of an organization recognized  as having jurisdiction over the evaluation and periodic inspection of  such equipment or materials, and by whose labeling the manufacturer  indicates compliance with appropriate standards or performance.</p><p class="depth2">Medical foster home means a private home in which a medical foster  home caregiver provides care to a veteran resident and:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The medical foster home caregiver lives in the medical foster  home;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The medical foster home caregiver owns or rents the medical  foster home; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> There are not more than three residents receiving care  (including veteran and non-veteran residents).</p><p class="depth4">Medical foster home caregiver means the primary person who provides  care to a veteran resident in a medical foster home.</p><p class="depth4">Placement refers to the voluntary decision by a veteran to become a  resident in an approved medical foster home.</p><p class="depth4">Veteran resident means a veteran residing in an approved medical  foster home who meets the eligibility criteria in paragraph (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligibility. VA health care personnel may assist a veteran by  referring such veteran for placement in a medical foster home if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The veteran is unable to live independently safely or is in need  of nursing home level care;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The veteran must be enrolled in, or agree to be enrolled in,  either a VA Home Based Primary Care or VA Spinal Cord Injury Homecare  program, or a similar VA interdisciplinary program designed to assist  medically complex veterans living in the home; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The medical foster home has been approved in accordance with  paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Approval of medical foster homes. Medical foster homes will be  approved by a VA Medical Foster Homes Coordinator based on the report of  a VA inspection and on any findings of necessary interim monitoring of  the medical foster home, if that home meets the standards established in  Sec.  17.74. The approval process is governed by the process for  approving community residential care facilities under Sec. Sec.  17.65  through 17.72 except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where Sec. Sec.  17.65 through 17.72 reference Sec.  17.63.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>; however, VA will assist such  veterans in locating an approved medical foster home when relocation is  necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Duties of Medical foster home caregivers. The medical foster  home caregiver, with assistance from relief caregivers, provides a safe  environment, room and board, supervision, and personal assistance, as  appropriate for each veteran.
