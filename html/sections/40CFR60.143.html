                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of an affected facility shall maintain a  single time-measuring instrument which shall be used in recording daily  the time and duration of each steel production cycle, and the time and  duration of any diversion of exhaust gases from the main stack servicing  the BOPF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The owner or operator of any affected facility that uses venturi  scrubber emission control equipment shall install, calibrate, maintain,  and continuously operate monitoring devices as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A monitoring device for the continuous measurement of the  pressure loss through the venturi constriction of the control equipment.  The monitoring device is to be certified by the manufacturer to be  accurate within 250 Pa (1  inch water).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A monitoring device for the continual measurement of the water  supply pressure to the control equipment. The monitoring device is to be  certified by the manufacturer to be accurate within 5 percent of the design water supply pressure. The  monitoring device's pressure sensor or pressure tap must be located  close to the water discharge point. The Administrator must be consulted  for approval in advance of selecting alternative locations for the  pressure sensor or tap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All monitoring devices shall be synchronized each day with the  time-measuring instrument used under paragraph (a) of this section. The  chart recorder error directly after synchronization shall not exceed  0.08 cm (\1/32\ inch).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All monitoring devices shall use chart recorders which are  operated at a minimum chart speed of 3.8 cm/hr (1.5 in/hr).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All monitoring devices are to be recalibrated annually, and at  other times as the Administrator may require, in accordance with the  procedures under Sec. 60.13(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any owner or operator subject to the requirements of paragraph  (b) of this section shall report to the Administrator, on a semiannual  basis, all measurements over any 3-hour period that average more than 10  percent below the average levels maintained during the most recent  performance test conducted under Sec. 60.8 in which the affected  facility demonstrated compliance with the mass standards under Sec.  60.142(a)(1), (b)(1)(i) or (b)(2)(i). The accuracy of the respective  measurements, not to exceed the values specified in paragraphs (b)(1)  and (b)(2) of this section, may be taken into consideration when  determining the measurement results that must be reported.
