                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Entity--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. An entity is any  corporation, estate, trust, association, company, partnership or similar  organization. An entity includes a group of persons who have a formal or  informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated  acquisition of stock. A principal element in determining if such an  understanding exists is whether the investment decision of each member  of a group is based upon the investment decision of one or more other  members. However, the participation by creditors in formulating a plan  for an insolvency workout or a reorganization in a title 11 or similar   case (whether as members of a creditors' committee or otherwise) and the  receipt of stock by creditors in satisfaction of indebtedness pursuant  to the workout or reorganization do not cause the creditors to be  considered an entity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of  paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L corporation has 1,000 shares of common stock  outstanding. For the three-year period ending on October 1, 1992, L's  stock was owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom owned five  percent or more of L. A group of 20 individuals who previously owned no  stock (the ``Group'') agree among themselves to acquire more than 5  percent of L's stock. The Group is not a corporation, trust,  association, partnership or company. On October 1, 1992, pursuant to  their understanding, the members of the Group purchase 600 shares of L  common stock from the old shareholders of L (a total of 60 percent of L  stock), with each member purchasing 30 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Before the members of the Group acquired L's stock on October  1, 1992, no individual or entity owned, directly or indirectly, five  percent or more of the stock of L. As a result, all shareholders were  aggregated into a public group and L was considered to be owned by a  single 5-percent shareholder (``Public L'') in accordance with Sec.  1.382-2T (g)(1) and (j)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the members of the  Group have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a  coordinated acquisition of stock and, therefore, the Group is an entity.  Thus, the acquisition of more than five percent of the stock of L on  October 1, 1992, by members of the Group is not disregarded under Sec.  1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii). Because no member of the Group owns, directly or  indirectly, five percent or more of the stock of L, Sec. Sec. 1.382-2T  (g)(1) and (j)(1) require that the members of the Group be aggregated  into a separate public group, which will be presumed to consist of  persons unrelated to the members of Public L. Because there is a shift  of more than fifty percentage points in the ownership of L stock during  the three-year testing period ending on October 1, 1992, an ownership  change occurs on October 1, 1992, as a result of the Group's purchase of  the 600 shares.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to October 1, 1992, L's 1,000 shares of  outstanding stock were owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom  owned five percent or more of the stock of L. L's management is  concerned that L may become subject to a takeover bid. In separate  meetings, L's management meets with potential investors who own no stock  and are friendly to management to convince them to acquire L's stock  based on an understanding that L will assemble a group that in the  aggregate will acquire more than 50 percent of L's stock. On October 1,  1992, 15 of these investors each purchase 4 percent of L's stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, the 15 investors  (the ``Group'') are treated as an entity because the members of the  Group purchase L stock pursuant to a formal or informal understanding  among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. Sections  1.382-2T (g)(1) and (j)(1) require that on October 1, 1992, the Group be  aggregated into a separate public group, which has increased its  ownership of L stock by 60 percentage points over its lowest level of  ownership in the three-year period ending on October 1, 1992.  Accordingly, an ownership change occurs on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Prior to October 1, 1992, L's 1,000 shares of  outstanding stock were owned by unrelated individuals, none of whom  owned five percent or more of the stock of L. On October 1, 1992, an  investment advisor advises its clients that it believes L's stock is  undervalued and recommends that they acquire L stock. Acting on the  investment advisor's recommendation, 20 unrelated individuals purchase 6  percent of L's stock in aggregate, with each individual purchasing less  than 5 percent. Each client's decision was not based upon the investment  decisions made by one or more other clients.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The result in this example would be the same under paragraph  (a)(3)(i) of this section if the only additional fact was that the  investment advisor is also the underwriter (without regard to whether it  is a firm commitment or best efforts underwriting) for a primary or  secondary offering of L stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume that the facts are the same except that, instead of an  investment advisor recommending that clients purchase L stock, the  trustee of several trusts qualified under section 401(a) sponsored by  unrelated corporations causes each trust to purchase the L stock. In  this case, the result is the same, so long as the investment decision  made on behalf of each trust was not based on the investment decision  made on behalf of one or more of the other trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Effective date. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The second, third and fourth  sentences of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and Examples 1, 2 and 3  of paragraph   (a)(1)(ii) of this section apply to testing dates (determined by  applying such sentence and examples) on or after November 20, 1990, but  with respect to any group of persons that pursuant to a formal or  informal understanding among themselves makes a coordinated acquisition  of stock before November 20, 1990, only if the group increases or  decreases its ownership of stock of the loss corporation relative to its  percentage ownership interest at the close of November 19, 1990, by five  percentage points or more on or after November 20, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Special rule. If pursuant to a formal or informal understanding  among themselves a group consisting only of regulated investment  companies under section 851, qualified trusts under section 401, common  trust funds under section 584, or trusts or estates that are clients of  a trust department of a bank under section 581, make a coordinated  acquisition of stock before November 20, 1990, the second, third and  fourth sentences of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section and Examples 1,  2, and 3 of paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of this section apply for testing dates  (determined by applying such sentences and examples) on or after  November 20, 1990, only if the group increases its ownership of stock of  the loss corporation relative to its percentage ownership interest at  the close of November 19, 1990, by five percentage points or more on or  after November 20, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of  paragraph (a)(1)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Prior to November 1, 1990, L, a loss, corporation, is owned  entirely by 1,000 unrelated individuals, none of whom owns as much as 5  percent of the stock of L (``Public L''). On November 1, 1990, 15  individuals (the ``Group'') each acquired 3 percent, or 45 percent, in  total, of L stock pursuant to an understanding among themselves to make  a coordinated acquisition of stock. The Group is not a corporation,  trust, association, partnership or company. On March 1, 1992, six  members of the Group each purchased an additional one percent of L  stock, or 6 percent, in total, pursuant to the understanding.  Accordingly, the Group increased its ownership in L stock by 51  percentage points during the three-year testing period ending on March  1, 1992. As a result, an ownership change of L occurs on March 1, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em>-</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)(2)(iii)</em> and (3)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Introduction. This paragraph (j) exempts, in  whole or in part, certain transfers of stock from the segregation rules  of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii) and (3). Terms and nomenclature used in  this paragraph (j), and not otherwise defined herein, have the same  meanings as in section 382 and the regulations issued under section 382.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Small issuance exception--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Section 1.382- 2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) does not apply to a small issuance (as defined in  paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of this section), except to the extent that the  total amount of stock issued in that issuance and all other small  issuances previously made in the same taxable year (determined in each  case on issuance) exceeds the small issuance limitation. This paragraph  (j)(2) does not apply to an issuance of stock that, by itself, exceeds  the small issuance limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>, all  stock issued in the issuance is taken into account, including stock  owned immediately after the issuance by a 5-percent shareholder that is  not a direct public group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Small issuance limitation--(A) In general. For each taxable  year, the loss corporation may, at its option, apply this paragraph  (j)(2)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On a corporation-wide basis, in which case the small issuance  limitation is 10 percent of the total value of the loss corporation's  stock outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year (excluding the  value of stock described in section 1504(a)(4)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On a class-by-class basis, in which case the small issuance  limitation is 10 percent of the number of shares of the class  outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Class of stock defined. For purposes of this paragraph  (j)(2)(iii), a class of stock includes all stock with the same material  terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions.  Appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of a class outstanding  at the beginning of a taxable year must be made to take into account any  stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend to which section 305(a)  applies, recapitalization, or similar transaction occurring during the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exception. The loss corporation may not apply this paragraph  (j)(2)(iii) on a class-by-class basis if, during the taxable year, more  than one class of stock is issued in a single issuance (or in two or  more issuances that are treated as a single issuance under paragraph  (j)(8)(ii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Short taxable years. In the case of a taxable year that is less  than 365 days, the small issuance limitation is reduced by multiplying  it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the  taxable year, and the denominator of which is 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Other issuances of stock for cash--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If the loss  corporation issues stock solely for cash, Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B)  does not apply to such stock in an amount equal (as a percentage of the  total stock issued) to one-half of the aggregate percentage ownership  interest of direct public groups immediately before the issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Solely for cash--(A) In general. A share of stock is not issued  solely for cash if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The acquiror, as a condition of acquiring that share for cash,  is required to purchase other stock for consideration other than cash;  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The share is acquired upon the exercise of an option that was  not issued solely for cash or was not distributed with respect to stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Related issuances. Paragraph (j)(8)(i) of this section (relating  to the treatment of one or more issuances as a single issuance) does not  apply in determining whether stock is issued solely for cash.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, this  paragraph (j)(3) applies only to the portion of the issuance not so  exempted, and that portion is treated as a separate issuance for  purposes of this paragraph (j)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitation on exempted stock. The total amount of stock that is  exempted from the application of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under  paragraphs (j)(2) and (j)(3) of this section cannot exceed the total  amount of stock issued in the issuance less the amount of that stock  owned by a 5-percent shareholder (other than a direct public group)  immediately after the issuance. Except to the extent that the loss  corporation has actual knowledge to the contrary, any increase in the  amount of the loss corporation's stock owned by a 5-percent shareholder  on the day of the issuance is considered to be attributable to an  acquisition of stock in the issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Proportionate acquisition of exempted stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  Each direct public group that exists immediately before an issuance to  which paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section applies is treated as  acquiring its proportionate share of the amount of stock exempted from  the application of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) under paragraph (j)(2)  or (j)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Actual knowledge of greater overlapping ownership. Under the  last sentence of Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation may treat  direct public groups existing immediately before an issuance to which  paragraph (j)(2) or (j)(3) of this section applies as acquiring in the  aggregate more stock than the amount determined under paragraph  (j)(5)(i) of this section, but only if the loss corporation actually  knows that the aggregate amount acquired by those groups in the issuance  exceeds the amount so determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Exception for equity structure shifts. This paragraph (j) does  not apply to any issuance of stock in an equity structure shift, except  that paragraph (j)(2) of this section applies (if its requirements are  met) to the issuance of stock in a recapitalization under section  368(a)(1)(E).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Transitory ownership by underwriter disregarded. For purposes of  Sec. 1.382-2T(g)(1) and (j), and this paragraph (j), the transitory  ownership of stock by an   underwriter of the issuance is disregarded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Certain related issuances. For purposes of this paragraph (j),  two or more issuances (including issuances of stock by first tier or  higher tier entities) are treated as a single issuance if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The issuances occur at approximately the same time pursuant to  the same plan or arrangement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A principal purpose of issuing the stock in separate issuances  rather than in a single issuance is to minimize or avoid an owner shift  under the rules of this paragraph (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Application to options. The principles of this paragraph (j)  apply for purposes of applying Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(D) (relating to  the deemed acquisition of stock as a result of the ownership of an  option).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> Issuance of stock pursuant to the exercise of certain options.  If stock is issued on the exercise of a transferable option issued by  the loss corporation, Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply and,  in applying the last sentence of Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss  corporation must take into account any transfers of the option  (including transfers described in Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(4)(xi)). Therefore,  even if transferable options are distributed pro rata to members of  existing public groups, the actual knowledge exception of Sec. 1.382- 2T(k)(2) applies only to the extent that the loss corporation actually  knows that the persons acquiring stock on exercise of the options are  members of a pre-existing public group. Moreover, if transferable  options are issued to more than one public group, Sec. 1.382- 2T(j)(2)(iii)(F) does not apply to treat the options as exercised pro  rata by each such public group as the options are actually exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> Application to first tier and higher tier entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. The principles of paragraphs (j)(1) through (10) and paragraph  (j)(12) apply to issuances of stock by a first tier entity or a higher  tier entity that owns 5 percent or more of the loss corporation's stock  (determined without regard to Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2)(1)(A)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small issuance limitation. In applying paragraph (j)(2) of this  section to any issuance of stock by a first tier or higher tier entity,  the small issuance limitations of paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A) and (B) of  this section are computed by reference to the stock value and the stock  classes of the issuing corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> Certain non-stock ownership interests. As the context may  require, a non-stock ownership interest in an entity other than a  corporation is treated as stock for purposes of this paragraph (j).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> Secondary transfer exception. The segregation rules of Sec.  1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) will not apply to the transfer of a direct ownership  interest in the loss corporation by a first tier entity or an individual  that owns five percent or more of the loss corporation to public  shareholders. Instead, each public group existing at the time of the  transfer will be treated under Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its  proportionate share of the stock exempted from the application of Sec.  1.382-2T(j)(3)(i). The segregation rules also will not apply if an  ownership interest in an entity that owns five percent or more of the  loss corporation (determined without regard to the application of Sec.  1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)) is transferred to a public owner or a 5-percent  owner who is not a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation.  Instead, provided that the transferor is either a 5-percent owner that  is a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation or a higher tier  entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation (determined  without regard to the application of section 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), each  public group of the entity existing at the time of the transfer is  treated under Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(i) as acquiring its proportionate  share of the transferred ownership interest. With regard to a transferor  that is neither a 5-percent shareholder of the loss corporation nor a  higher tier entity owning five percent or more of the loss corporation  (determined without regard to the application of Sec. 1.382- 2T(h)(2)(i)(A)), see generally Sec. 1.382-2T(e)(1)(ii) (disregarding  these transactions if the transferee is not a 5-percent shareholder).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(14)</em> Small redemption exception--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Section 1.382- 2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) does not apply to a small redemption (as defined in  paragraph (j)(14)(ii) of this section), except to the extent that the  total amount of stock redeemed in   that redemption and all other small redemptions previously made in the  same taxable year (determined in each case on redemption) exceeds the  small redemption limitation. This paragraph (j)(14) does not apply to a  redemption of stock that, by itself, exceeds the small redemption  limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small redemption defined. Small redemption means a redemption  of public shareholders by the loss corporation of an amount of stock not  exceeding the small redemption limitation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Small redemption limitation--(A) In general. For each taxable  year, the loss corporation may, at its option, apply this paragraph  (j)(14)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> On a corporation-wide basis, in which case the small redemption  limitation is 10 percent of the total value of the loss corporation's  stock outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year (excluding the  value of stock described in section 1504(a)(4)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> On a class-by-class basis, in which case the small redemption  limitation is 10 percent of the number of shares of the class redeemed  that are outstanding at the beginning of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Class of stock defined. For purposes of this paragraph  (j)(14)(iii), a class of stock includes all stock with the same material  terms.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Adjustments for stock splits and similar transactions.  Appropriate adjustments to the number of shares of a class outstanding  at the beginning of a taxable year must be made to take into account any  stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend to which section 305(a)  applies, recapitalization, or similar transaction occurring during the  taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Exception. The loss corporation may not apply this paragraph  (j)(14)(iii) on a class-by-class basis if, during the taxable year, more  than one class of stock is redeemed in a single redemption (or in two or  more redemptions that are treated as a single redemption under paragraph  (j)(14)(v) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Short taxable years. In the case of a taxable year that is less  than 365 days, the small redemption limitation is reduced by multiplying  it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the  taxable year, and the denominator of which is 365.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Proportionate redemption of exempted stock--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general.  Each direct public group that exists immediately before a redemption to  which this paragraph (j)(14) applies is treated as having been redeemed  of its proportionate share of the amount of stock exempted from the  application of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) under this paragraph  (j)(14).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Actual knowledge of greater redemption. Under the last sentence  of Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(2), the loss corporation may treat direct public  groups existing immediately before a redemption to which this paragraph  (j)(14) applies as having been redeemed of more stock than the amount  determined under paragraph (j)(14)(iv)(A) of this section, but only if  the loss corporation actually knows that the amount redeemed from those  groups in the redemption exceeds the amount so determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Certain related redemptions. For purposes of this paragraph  (j)(14), two or more redemptions (including redemptions of stock by  first tier or higher tier entities) are treated as a single redemption  if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The redemptions occur at approximately the same time pursuant to  the same plan or arrangement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A principal purpose of redeeming the stock in separate  redemptions rather than in a single redemption is to minimize or avoid  an owner shift under the rules of this paragraph (j)(14).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Certain non-stock ownership interests. As the context may  require, a non-stock ownership interest in an entity other than a  corporation is treated as stock for purposes of this paragraph (j)(14).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Application to first tier and higher tier entities--(A) In  general. The principles of this paragraph (j)(14) apply to redemptions  of stock by a first tier entity or a higher tier entity that owns 5  percent of the loss corporation stock (determined without regard to  Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2)(i)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A))</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Small redemption limitation. In applying this paragraph (j)(14)  to any redemption of stock by a first tier or a higher tier entity, the  small redemption limitations of paragraph   (j)(14)(iii)(A) of this section are computed by reference to the stock  value and the stock classes of the redeeming corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(15)</em> Exception for first tier and higher tier entities--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. The segregation rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) will not  apply to a transaction involving stock in a first tier or a higher tier  entity if, after taking into account the results of such transaction and  all other transactions occurring on that date, the first tier or higher  tier entity owns 10 percent or less (by value) of all the outstanding  stock (without regard to Sec. 1.382-2(a)(3)) of the loss corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Anti-avoidance rule. The rules of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this  section do not apply to a transaction involving an ownership interest in  a first tier or higher tier entity if the loss corporation, directly or  through one or more persons, has participated in planning or structuring  the transaction with a view to avoiding the application of the  segregation rules. For this purpose, a transaction includes any event  that would result in segregation under Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii), absent  the application of this paragraph (j)(15), and any event (for example,  the formation of a holding company) occurring as part of the same plan  that includes the event that would result in segregation (without the  application of this paragraph (j)(15)). Other anti-avoidance rules  continue to be applicable. See, for example, Sec. Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(4)  and 1.382-3(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rules. If application of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this  section results in the combination of public groups, then--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The amount of increase in the percentage of stock ownership of  the continuing public group will be the sum of its increase and a  proportionate amount of any increase by any public group that is  combined with the continuing public group (the former public group); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The continuing public group's lowest percentage ownership will  be the sum of its lowest percentage ownership and a proportionate amount  of the former public group's lowest percentage ownership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Ownership of the loss corporation. In making the determination  under paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(h)(2) will not apply;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The entity will be treated as owning the loss corporation stock  that it actually owns, and any other loss corporation stock if that  other stock would be attributed to the entity under section 318(a)  (without regard to paragraph (4) thereof) unless an option is treated as  exercised under Sec. 1.382-4(d)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The operating rules of paragraph (j)(15)(v) of this section will  apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Operating rules. Subject to the principles of Sec. 1.382- 2T(k)(4), a loss corporation may establish the ownership limitation of  paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section through either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Actual knowledge; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Absent actual knowledge to the contrary, the presumptions  regarding stock ownership in Sec. 1.382-2T(k)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(16)</em> Examples. The provisions of this paragraph (j) are illustrated  by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L corporation is a calendar year taxpayer. On January  1, 1994, L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock  outstanding, all of which are owned by a single direct public group  (Public L). On February 1, 1994, L issues to employees as compensation  60 new common shares of the same class. On May 1, 1994, L issues 50 new  common shares of the same class solely for cash. Following each  issuance, L's stock is owned entirely by public shareholders. No other  changes in the ownership of L's stock occur prior to May 1, 1994. L  chooses to determine its small issuance limitation for 1994 on a class- by-class basis under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The February issuance is a small issuance because the number of  shares issued (60) does not exceed 100, the small issuance limitation  (10 percent of the number of common shares outstanding on January 1,  1994). Under paragraph (j)(2) of this section, the segregation rules of  Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) do not apply to the February issuance.  Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Public L is treated as acquiring  all 60 shares issued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em> applies to the remaining 5 shares issued,  which are treated as acquired by a direct public group separate from  Public L. Each such public group is treated as an individual who is a  separate 5-percent shareholder. See Sec. 1.382-2T (g)(1)(iv) and  (j)(1)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assume that L actually knows that at least 10 shares of the May  issuance are acquired by members of Public L. The result is the same.  See paragraph (j)(5)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Assume instead that L actually knows that all 50 shares of the  May issuance are acquired by members of Public L. Under paragraph  (j)(5)(ii) of this section, L may treat Public L as acquiring 50 shares  in the May issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L corporation is a calendar year taxpayer. On January  1, 1995, L has 1,000 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, the  aggregate value of which is $1,000. Five hundred shares are owned by one  direct public group (Public 1), and 500 shares are owned by another  direct public group (Public 2). On August 1, 1995, L issues 200 shares  of Class B common stock for $200 cash. A, an individual, acquires 120  Class B shares in the transaction. The remaining 80 Class B shares are  acquired by public shareholders. No other changes in ownership of L's  stock occur prior to August 1, 1995.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The August issuance is not a small issuance. The total value of  the Class B stock issued ($200) exceeds $100, the small issuance  limitation as calculated under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(1) of this  section (10 percent of the value of L's stock on January 1, 1995). The  total number of Class B shares issued (200) exceeds 0, the small  issuance limitation as calculated under paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)(2) of  this section (10 percent of the number of Class B shares outstanding on  January 1, 1995). Accordingly, paragraph (j)(2) of this section does not  apply to the August issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)(B)</em>. Paragraph (j)(3) of this section,  without regard to paragraph (j)(4) of this section, would exempt 100  Class B shares: the product of the 200 Class B shares issued and 50  percent (one-half of the combined 100 percent pre-issuance ownership  interest of Public 1 and Public 2). Paragraph (j)(4), however, limits  the total number of Class B shares that may be excluded to 80 Class B  shares: the difference between the 200 shares issued and the 120 shares  acquired by A. Under paragraph (j)(5) of this section, Public 1 and  Public 2 are treated as acquiring the 80 exempted Class B shares.  Because Public 1 and Public 2 each owned 500 Class A shares prior to the  issuance, Public 1 and Public 2 are considered to acquire 40 Class B  shares each.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock  outstanding, all of which are owned by a direct public group (Public L).  At the same time pursuant to the same plan, L issues 500 shares of its  stock to its creditors in exchange for its outstanding debt and 500  shares of its stock to the public for cash. Assume that the separate  issuances of stock for debt and stock for cash do not have a principal  purpose of minimizing or avoiding an owner shift. L has no individual 5- percent shareholders immediately after the issuances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to the 500 shares of  stock issued by L to the public because that stock was issued solely for  cash. Because the two issuances occur at the same time pursuant to the  same plan, they are generally treated as a single issuance for purposes  of this paragraph (j). See paragraph (j)(8)(i) of this section. The  treatment of the two issuances as a single issuance does not apply,  however, for the purpose of determining whether the stock issued to the  public was issued solely for cash. See paragraph (j)(3)(ii)(B) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Paragraph (j)(3) of this section applies to exempt 250 of the  500 shares issued solely for cash from the segregation rules of Sec.  1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) (the product of the 500 shares issued for cash  and 50 percent (one-half of the 100 percent pre-issuance ownership  interest of Public L)). The creditors that receive stock in exchange for  their debt would not be treated as acquiring any of the 250 exempted  shares even if their exchange of debt for stock occurs prior to the cash  issuance. Paragraph (j)(5)(i) of this section allocates exempted shares  among the direct public groups that exist immediately before an  issuance. Because the issuance for cash and the issuance for debt are  generally treated as a single issuance, the public group comprised of  the former creditors of L was not a public group that existed  immediately before the issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Three public groups owning L stock exist immediately after the  two issuances. Public L owns 1,250 shares--the 1,000 shares it owned  prior to the issuances plus the 250   shares it is treated as acquiring in the cash issuance. A separate group  comprised of the former creditors of L owns the 500 shares issued for  debt. A third public group owns the 250 shares that are not treated as  acquired by Public L in the cash issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> L has 1,000 shares of a single class of common stock  outstanding, all of which are owned by a direct public group (Public L).  L issues 1,000 shares pursuant to an offer under which 500 shares must  be acquired in exchange for debt and the remainder may be acquired for  cash. Under the terms of the offer, only persons that acquire stock for  debt are eligible to acquire stock for cash. L has no 5-percent  shareholders other than direct public groups immediately after the  issuance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> As a condition of acquiring shares for cash, the creditors are  required to purchase stock for debt. Therefore, paragraph (j)(3) of this  section does not apply to any part of the issuance because it is not an  issuance of stock solely for cash. The segregation rules of Sec. 1.382- 2T(j)(2)(iii)(B) apply to treat all 1,000 shares as acquired by a new  public group separate from Public L.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. L is owned 60 percent by one public group  (Public L1) and 40 percent by another public group (Public  L2). On July 1, 2014, individual A acquires 10 percent of L's  stock over a public stock exchange. On December 31, 2014, A sells all of  his L stock over a public stock exchange. No individual or entity  acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as a result of A's  disposition of his L stock. On January 3, 2015, individual B acquires 10  percent of L's stock over a public stock exchange. On June 30, 2015, B  sells all of her L stock over a public stock exchange. No individual or  entity acquires as much as five percent of L's stock as a result of B's  disposition of her L stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The dispositions of the L stock by A and B are not  transactions that cause the segregation of L's direct public groups that  exist immediately before the transaction (Public L1 and  Public L2). When A and B sell their shares to public  shareholders over the public stock exchange, the shares are treated as  being reacquired by Public L1 and Public L2. As a  result, Public L1's ownership interest is treated as  increasing from 54 percent to 60 percent during the testing period, and  Public L2's ownership interest is treated as increasing from  36 percent to 40 percent during the testing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. L has a single class of common stock outstanding that is owned 60  percent by a direct public group (Public L) and 40 percent by P. P is  owned 20 percent by individual A and 80 percent by a direct public group  (Public P). On October 6, 2014, A sells 50 percent of his interest in P  to B, an individual who is, and remains, a member of Public P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. P is an entity that owns five percent or more of L. A  is a 5-percent owner of P that is a 5-percent shareholder of L. Because  A's sale of the P stock is to a member of Public P, the disposition of  the P stock by A is not a transaction that causes the segregation of P's  direct public group that exists immediately before the transaction  (Public P). See paragraph (j)(13) of this section. When A sells his  shares to B, the shares are treated as being acquired by Public P. As a  result, Public P's ownership interest in L is treated as increasing from  32 percent to 36 percent during the testing period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. L is a calendar  year taxpayer. On January 1, 2014, L has 1,060 shares of a single class  of common stock outstanding, all of which are owned by a single direct  public group (Public L). On July 1, 2014, L acquires 60 shares of its  stock for cash. On December 31, 2014, in an unrelated redemption, L  acquires 90 more shares of its stock for cash. Following each  redemption, L's stock is owned entirely by public shareholders. No other  changes in the ownership of L's stock occur prior to December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> July redemption. The July redemption is a small  redemption because the number of shares redeemed (60) does not exceed  106, the small redemption limitation (10 percent of the number of common  shares outstanding on January 1, 2014). Under paragraph (j)(14) of this  section, the segregation rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) do not  apply to the July redemption. Under paragraph (j)(14)(iv) of this  section, Public L is treated as having all 60 shares redeemed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> December redemption. The December redemption is a small  redemption because the number of shares redeemed (90) does not exceed  106, the small redemption limitation (10 percent of the number of common  shares outstanding on January 1, 2014). However, under paragraph  (j)(14)(i) of this section, only 46 of the 90 shares redeemed are  exempted from the segregation rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C)  because the total number of shares of common stock redeemed in the July  and December redemptions exceeds 106, the small redemption limitation,  by 44. Accordingly, under paragraph (j)(14)(iv) of this section, Public  L is treated as having 46 shares redeemed in the December redemption.  Section 1.382-2T(j)(2)(iii)(C) applies to the remaining 44 shares  redeemed. Accordingly, Public L is segregated into two different public   groups immediately before the transaction (and thereafter) so that the  redeemed interests (Public RL) are treated as part of a public group  that is separate from the ownership interests that are not redeemed  (Public CL). Therefore, as a result of the December redemption, Public  CL's interest in L increases by 4.4 percentage points (from 95.6 percent  (956/1,000) to 100 percent (910/910)) on the December 31, 2014 testing  date. For purposes of determining whether an ownership change occurs on  any subsequent testing date having a testing period that includes the  December redemption, Public CL is treated as a 5-percent shareholder  whose percentage ownership interests in L increased by 4.4 percentage  points as a result of such redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. P1 is a corporation that owns 8 percent of the stock  of L. The remaining L stock (92 percent) is owned by Public L.  P1 is entirely owned by Public P1. P2  is a corporation owned 90 percent by individual A and 10 percent by a  public group (Public P2). On May 22, 2014, P1  merges into P2 with the shareholders of P1  receiving an amount of P2 stock equal to 25 percent of the  value of P2 immediately after the reorganization. L was owned  92 percent by Public L and 8 percent by P1 throughout the  testing period ending on the date of the merger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Assuming L can establish that P2 owns 10  percent or less (by value) of L on May 22, 2014 pursuant to the  operating rules of paragraph (j)(15)(v) of this section, the segregation  rules of Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) will not apply to segregate  P1's direct public group (Public P1) immediately  before the merger from P2's direct public group (Public  P2). Thus, following the merger, P2 is owned 67.5  percent (90 percent x 75 percent) by A and 32.5 percent (25 percent +  (10 percent x 75 percent)) by Public P2. Pursuant to  paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public P2's lowest  percentage of ownership is the sum of its lowest percentage of ownership  (zero) and a proportionate amount of former Public P1's  lowest ownership percentage of L of 2.6 percent (32.5 percent x 8  percent). P2 will be treated as having one public group whose  ownership interest in L was 2.6 percent before the merger and remains  2.6 percent after the merger. Because Public P2 owns less  than 5 percent of L, Public P2 is treated as part of Public  L. See Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(1)(iv). Thus, pursuant to paragraph  (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public L's lowest ownership percentage  of L during the testing period is 94.6 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The  facts are the same as Example 8, except that P1 acquired its  8 percent interest in L during the testing period that includes the  merger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. Pursuant to the rules of paragraph (j)(15)(iii)(A) of  this section, the amount of increase in the percentage of stock  ownership by Public P2 is the sum of its increase (zero) and  a proportionate amount of the increase by former Public P1 of  2.6 percent (32.5 percent x 8 percent). Pursuant to paragraph  (j)(15)(iii)(B) of this section, Public P2's lowest  percentage of ownership is zero, because both former Public  P1 and Public P2 owned no L stock at the beginning  of the testing period. Accordingly, Public P2, the continuing  public group, is treated as having increased its ownership interest by  2.6 percent. Because Public P2 is treated as part of Public  L, Public L is treated as increasing its ownership interest by 2.6  percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>  Facts. L has one class of common stock and one class of preferred stock  outstanding. The preferred stock is stock within the meaning of Sec.  1.382-2(a)(3). Before December 23, 2014, a direct public group (Public  L) owns all of the common stock of L. On December 23, 2014, P purchases  all of the preferred stock of L and a portion of the common stock of L.  On the date of purchase, the value of the L common stock held by P was  greater than 5 percent of the value of L, and the total value of L  common and L preferred stock held by P was less than 10 percent of the  value of all stock of L. P has one class of common stock outstanding,  all of which is owned by a direct public group (Public P). On October 7,  2015, P redeems 30 percent of its single outstanding class of common  stock. On the redemption date of the P stock, due to a decline in the  relative value of the common stock of L, the preferred stock of L owned  by P represents 40 percent of the value of all the outstanding stock of  L. No ownership change of L occurs between December 23, 2014, and  October 7, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. The rules of paragraph (j)(15) of this section do not  apply to the redemption because P owns more than 10 percent of L (by  value) on that date.</p><p class="depth0">Example 11. Ownership limitation--fair market value includes  preferred stock. The facts are the same as in Example 10, except that  the preferred stock is not stock within the meaning of Sec. 1.382- 2(a)(3). Although the preferred stock is not stock for the purpose of  determining owner shifts, the value of that stock is taken into account  in computing the 10-percent limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this  section. Therefore, the results are the same as in Example 10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Individual A owns all the outstanding stock of X. A also owns  preferred stock in Y that is not stock within the meaning Sec. 1.382- 2(a)(3), which represents 50 percent of the value of Y. All the Y common  stock is owned by public owners. Each of X and Y own 6 percent of the  single class of L stock outstanding. On October 6, 2014, Y redeems 15  percent of its common stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Analysis. In determining satisfaction of the ownership  limitation of paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this section, the attribution  rules of section 318(a) apply. Pursuant to section 318(a)(2), A is  treated as owning the L stock owned by X. Pursuant to section 318(a)(3),  Y is treated as owning the L stock that A indirectly owns. Because Y's  ownership of L exceeds the 10 percent ownership limitation of paragraph  (j)(15)(i) of this section, the rules of paragraph (j)(15) of this  section do not apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. P1 is a  corporation that owns 10 percent of the stock of L. P1 is  owned entirely by a direct public group (Public P). L has had owner  shifts of 45 percentage points in its current testing period.  P1 is planning to merge into P2, a corporation  which has a public group. Advisers to L, upon learning of the proposed  merger, asked the management of P1 for details of the  proposed merger, including the stock ownership of P2 after  P1 merges into P2. After finding out that  information, L or L's advisers did not request any changes in the  planned transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> of  this section does not apply because L did not participate in planning or  structuring the transaction. Pursuant to paragraph (j)(15)(i) of this  section, Sec. 1.382-2T(j)(3)(iii) does not apply to cause the  segregation of P1's public group from P2's public  group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(17)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Special rules for certain regulated investment companies--(1) In  general.
