If the Administrator so suspends, he/she shall serve with the order to show cause pursuant to Sec. 1301.37 an order of immediate suspension which shall contain a statement of his findings regarding the danger to public health or safety.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Upon service of the order of the Administrator suspending or revoking registration, the registrant shall immediately deliver his/her Certificate of

This request shall be granted by the Administrator, who shall fix a date for such hearing as early as reasonably possible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the event that an applicant for reregistration (who is doing business under a registration previously granted and not revoked or suspended) has applied for reregistration at least 45 days before the date on which the existing registration is due to expire, and the Administrator has issued no order on the application on the date on which the existing registration is due to expire, the existing registration of the applicant shall automatically be extended and continue in effect until the date on which the Administrator so issues his/her order. The Administrator may extend any other existing registration under the circumstances contemplated in this section even though the registrant failed to apply for reregistration at least 45 days before expiration of the existing registration, with or without request by the registrant, if the Administrator finds that such extension is not inconsistent with the public health and safety.
