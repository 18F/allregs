                            <p class="depth0">Services that are allowable as administrative costs but are not  separately billable include, but are not limited to, the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Registered nurse initial evaluation visits. Initial evaluation  visits by a registered nurse for the purpose of assessing a  beneficiary's health needs, determining if the agency can meet those  health needs, and formulating a plan of care for the beneficiary are  allowable administrative costs. If a physician specifically orders that  a particular skilled service be furnished during the evaluation in which  the agency accepts the beneficiary for treatment and all other coverage  criteria are met, the visit is billable as a skilled nursing visit.  Otherwise it is considered to be an administrative cost.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Visits by registered nurses or qualified professionals for the  supervision of home health aides. Visits by registered nurses or  qualified professionals for the purpose of supervising home health aides  as required at Sec. 484.36(d) of this chapter are allowable  administrative costs. Only if the registered nurse or qualified  professional visits the beneficiary for the purpose of furnishing care  that meets the coverage criteria at Sec. 409.44, and the supervisory  visit occurs simultaneously with the provision of covered care, is the  visit billable as a skilled nursing or therapist's visit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Respiratory care services. If a respiratory therapist is used to  furnish overall training or consultative advice to an HHA's staff and  incidentally provides respiratory therapy services to beneficiaries in  their homes, the costs of the respiratory therapist's services are  allowable as administrative costs. Visits by a respiratory therapist to  a beneficiary's home are not separately billable. However, respiratory  therapy services that are furnished as part of a plan of care by a  skilled nurse or physical therapist and that constitute skilled care may  be separately billed as skilled visits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Dietary and nutrition personnel. If dieticians or nutritionists  are used to provide overall training or consultative advice to HHA staff  and incidentally provide dietetic or nutritional services to  beneficiaries in their homes, the costs of these professional services  are allowable as administrative costs. Visits by a dietician or  nutritionist to a beneficiary's home are not separately billable.  [59 FR 65496, Dec. 20, 1994]</p>
