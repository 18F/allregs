                            <p class="depth0">In general, an employee will not be considered to have experienced a  compensable recurrence of disability as defined in Sec. 10.5(x) merely  because his or her employer has eliminated the employee's light-duty  position in a reduction-in-force or some other form of downsizing. When  this occurs, OWCP will determine the employee's wage-earning capacity  based on his or her actual earnings in such light-duty position if this  determination is appropriate on the basis that such earnings fairly and  reasonably represent the employee's wage-earning capacity and such a  determination has not already been made and the employing agency has  stated, in writing, that no other employment is available.</p>
