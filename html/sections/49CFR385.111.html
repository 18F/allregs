                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a carrier is assigned an ``Unsatisfactory'' safety rating following a compliance review conducted under this subpart, or a safety audit conducted under this subpart determines that a carrier does not exercise the basic safety management controls necessary to ensure safe operations, the FMCSA will provide the carrier written notice, as soon as practicable, that its registration will be suspended effective 15 days from the service date of the notice unless the carrier demonstrates, within 10 days of the service date of the notice, that the compliance review or safety audit contains material error.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this section, material error is a mistake or series of mistakes that resulted in an erroneous safety rating or an erroneous determination that the carrier does not exercise the necessary basic safety management controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the carrier demonstrates that the compliance review or safety audit contained material error, its registration will not be suspended. If the carrier fails to show a material error in the safety audit, the FMCSA will issue an Order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Suspending the carrier's provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate of Registration and requiring it to immediately cease all further operations in the United States; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notifying the carrier that its provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate of Registration will be revoked unless it presents evidence of necessary corrective action within 30 days from the service date of the Order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If a carrier is assigned a ``Conditional'' rating following a compliance review conducted under this subpart, the provisions of subparagraphs (a) through (c) of this section will apply, except that its provisional registration will not be suspended under paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If a carrier subject to this subpart fails to provide the necessary documents for a safety audit or compliance review upon reasonable request, or fails to submit evidence of the necessary corrective action as required by Sec. 385.105 of this subpart, the FMCSA will provide the carrier with written notice, as soon as practicable, that its registration will be suspended 15 days from the service date of the notice unless it provides all necessary documents or information. This suspension

will remain in effect until the necessary documents or information are produced and:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A safety audit determines that the carrier exercises basic safety management controls necessary for safe operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The carrier is rated Satisfactory or Conditional after a compliance review; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The FMCSA determines, following review of the carrier's response to a demand for corrective action under Sec. 385.105, that the carrier has taken the necessary corrective action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If a carrier commits any of the violations specified in Sec. 385.105(a) of this subpart after the removal of a suspension issued under this section, the suspension will be automatically reinstated. The FMCSA will issue an Order requiring the carrier to cease further operations in the United States and demonstrate, within 15 days from the service date of the Order, that it did not commit the alleged violation(s). If the carrier fails to demonstrate that it did not commit the violation(s), the FMCSA will issue an Order revoking its provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate of Registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the FMCSA receives credible evidence that a carrier has operated in violation of a suspension order issued under this section, it will issue an Order requiring the carrier to show cause, within 10 days of the service date of the Order, why its provisional operating authority or provisional Certificate of Registration should not be revoked. If the carrier fails to make the necessary showing, the FMCSA will revoke its registration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If a Mexico-domiciled motor carrier operates a commercial motor vehicle in violation of a suspension or out-of-service order, it shall be subject to the penalty provisions in 49 U.S.C. 521(b) and the amount as stated in part 386, appendix B, of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Notwithstanding any provision of this subpart, a carrier subject to this subpart is also subject to the suspension and revocation provisions of 49 U.S.C. 13905 for repeated violations of DOT regulations governing its motor carrier operations.
