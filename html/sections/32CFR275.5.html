Statement of Customer Rights Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act of</p><p class="depth0">1978</p><p class="depth0">Federal law protects the privacy of your financial records. Before banks, savings and

loan associations, credit unions, credit card issuers, or other financial institutions may give financial information about you to a Federal Agency, certain procedures must be followed.</p><p class="depth0">Authorization To Access Financial Records</p><p class="depth0">You may be asked to authorize the financial institution to make your financial records available to the Government. You may withhold your authorization, and your authorization is not required as a condition of doing business with any financial institution. If you provide authorization, it can be revoked in writing at any time before your records are disclosed. Furthermore, any authorization you provide is effective for only three months, and your financial institution must keep a record of the instances in which it discloses your financial information.</p><p class="depth0">Without Your Authorization</p><p class="depth0">Without your authorization, a Federal Agency that wants to see your financial records may do so ordinarily only by means of a lawful administrative subpoena or summons, search warrant, judicial subpoena, or formal written request for that purpose. Generally, the Federal Agency must give you advance notice of its request for your records explaining why the information is being sought and telling you how to object in court.</p><p class="depth0">The Federal Agency must also send you copies of court documents to be prepared by you with instructions for filling them out. While these procedures will be kept as simple as possible, you may want to consult an attorney before making a challenge to a Federal Agency's request.</p><p class="depth0">Exceptions</p><p class="depth0">In some circumstances, a Federal Agency may obtain financial information about you without advance notice or your authorization. In most of these cases, the Federal Agency will be required to go to court for permission to obtain your records without giving you notice beforehand. In these instances, the court will make the Government show that its investigation and request for your records are proper. When the reason for the delay of notice no longer exists, you will be notified that your records were obtained.</p><p class="depth0">Transfer of Information</p><p class="depth0">Generally, a Federal Agency that obtains your financial records is prohibited from transferring them to another Federal Agency unless it certifies in writing that the transfer is proper and sends a notice to you that your records have been sent to another Agency.</p><p class="depth0">Penalties</p><p class="depth0">If the Federal Agency or financial institution violates the Right to Financial Privacy Act, you may sue for damages or seek compliance with the law. If you win, you may be repaid your attorney's fee and costs.</p><p class="depth0">Additional Information</p><p class="depth0">If you have any questions about your rights under this law, or about how to consent to release your financial records, please call the official whose name and telephone number appears below:________________________________________________________________________
