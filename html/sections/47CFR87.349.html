In addition  to the ground control frequency, an aeronautical utility station at an  airport served by a control tower or RCO may be assigned the tower or  RCO frequency if the assignment is specifically approved by the FAA as  provided for in Sec. 87.347(c). The frequencies assigned are normally  from the band 121.600-121.925 MHz.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The frequency assigned to the unicom is available to  aeronautical utility stations on a noninterference basis at airports  which have a part-time control tower, part-time RCO or part-time FAA  flight service station and a unicom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At airports which have a unicom but no control tower, RCO or FAA   flight service station, the frequency assigned to the unicom is  available to aeronautical utility stations on a noninterference basis.
