                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) transaction means a securities or  commodities transaction in which the buyer is obligated to make payment  only if the seller has made delivery of the securities or commodities  and the seller is obligated to deliver the securities or commodities  only if the buyer has made payment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Payment-versus-payment (PvP) transaction means a foreign  exchange transaction in which each counterparty is obligated to make a  final transfer of one or more currencies only if the other counterparty  has made a final transfer of one or more currencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A transaction has a normal settlement period if the contractual  settlement period for the transaction is equal to or less than the  market standard for the instrument underlying the transaction and equal  to or less than five business days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Positive current exposure of an FDIC-supervised institution for  a transaction is the difference between the transaction value at the  agreed settlement price and the current market price of the transaction,  if the difference results in a credit exposure of the FDIC-supervised  institution to the counterparty.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This section applies to all transactions involving  securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that have a  risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This section does not apply to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleared transactions that are marked-to-market daily and subject  to daily receipt and payment of variation margin;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repo-style transactions, including unsettled repo-style  transactions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> One-way cash payments on OTC derivative contracts; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Transactions with a contractual settlement period that is longer  than the normal settlement period (which are treated as OTC derivative  contracts as provided in Sec. 324.34).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> System-wide failures. In the case of a system-wide failure of a  settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, the FDIC may waive  risk-based capital requirements for unsettled and failed transactions  until the situation is rectified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Delivery-versus-payment (DvP) and payment-versus-payment (PvP)  transactions. An FDIC-supervised institution must hold risk-based  capital against any DvP or PvP transaction with a normal settlement  period if the FDIC-supervised institution's counterparty has not made  delivery or payment within five business days after the settlement date.  The FDIC-supervised institution must determine its risk-weighted asset  amount for such a transaction by multiplying the positive current  exposure of the transaction for the FDIC-supervised institution by the  appropriate risk weight in Table 1 to Sec. 324.38.</p><p class="depth2">Table 1 to Sec. 324.38--Risk Weights for Unsettled DvP and PvP</p><p class="depth2">Transactions ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Risk weight to</p><p class="depth2">be applied to</p><p class="depth2">Number of business days after contractual settlement       positive</p><p class="depth2">date                                current</p><p class="depth2">exposure (in</p><p class="depth2">percent) ------------------------------------------------------------------------ From 5 to 15............................................           100.0 From 16 to 30...........................................           625.0 From 31 to 45...........................................           937.5 46 or more..............................................         1,250.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Non-DvP/non-PvP (non-delivery-versus-payment/non-payment-versus- payment) transactions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An FDIC-supervised institution must hold  risk-based capital against any non-DvP/non-PvP transaction with a normal  settlement period if the FDIC-supervised institution has delivered cash,  securities, commodities, or currencies to its counterparty but has not  received its corresponding deliverables by the end of the same business  day. The FDIC-supervised institution must continue to hold risk-based  capital against the transaction until the FDIC-supervised institution  has received its corresponding deliverables.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From the business day after the FDIC-supervised institution has  made its delivery until five business days after the counterparty  delivery is due, the FDIC-supervised institution must calculate the  risk-weighted asset amount for the transaction by treating the current  fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC-supervised institution  as an exposure to the counterparty and using the applicable counterparty  risk weight under Sec. 324.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the FDIC-supervised institution has not received its  deliverables by the fifth business day after counterparty delivery was  due, the FDIC-supervised institution must assign a 1,250 percent risk  weight to the current fair value of the deliverables owed to the FDIC- supervised institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Total risk-weighted assets for unsettled transactions. Total  risk-weighted   assets for unsettled transactions is the sum of the risk-weighted asset  amounts of all DvP, PvP, and non-DvP/non-PvP transactions.    Sec. Sec. 324.39-324.40  [Reserved]</p><p class="depth2">Risk-Weighted Assets for Securitization Exposures</p>
