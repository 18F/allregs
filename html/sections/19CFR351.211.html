                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The Secretary issues an order when both the  Secretary and the Commission (except in certain countervailing duty  investigations) have made final affirmative determinations. The issuance  of an order ends the investigative phase of a proceeding. Generally,  upon the issuance of an order, importers no longer may post bonds as  security for antidumping or countervailing duties, but instead must make  a cash deposit of estimated duties. An order remains in effect until it  is revoked. This section contains rules regarding the issuance of orders  in general, as well as special rules for orders where the Commission has  found a regional industry to exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b))</em>, simultaneously with  publication of an affirmative final countervailing duty determination by  the Secretary, the Secretary will publish in the Federal Register an  ``Antidumping Order'' or ``Countervailing Duty Order'' that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Instructs the Customs Service to assess antidumping duties or  countervailing duties (whichever is applicable) on the subject  merchandise, in accordance with the Secretary's instructions at the  completion of each review requested under Sec. 351.213(b)  (administrative review), Sec. 351.214(b) (new shipper review), or Sec.  351.215(b) (expedited antidumping review), or if a review is not  requested, in accordance with the Secretary's assessment instructions  under Sec. 351.212(c);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Instructs the Customs Service to require a cash deposit of  estimated antidumping or countervailing duties at the rates included in  the Secretary's final determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Orders the suspension of liquidation ended for all entries of  the subject merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for  consumption before the date of publication of the Commission's final  determination, and instructs the Customs Service to release the cash  deposit or bond on those entries, if in its final determination, the  Commission found a threat of material injury or material retardation of  the establishment of an industry, unless the Commission in its final  determination also found that, absent the suspension of liquidation  ordered under section 703(d)(2) or section 733(d)(2) of the Act, it  would have found material injury (see section 706(b) or section 736(b)  of the Act).</p>
