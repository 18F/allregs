                            <p class="depth0">This section provides an overview of the regulatory structure of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The regulations of this part 92 are intended to control emissions from in-use locomotives. Because locomotive chassis and locomotive engines are sometimes manufactured or remanufactured separately, the regulations in this part include some provisions that apply specifically to locomotive engines. However, the use of the term ``locomotive engine'' in the regulations in this part does not limit in any manner the liability of any manufacturer or remanufacturer for the emission performance of a locomotive powered by an engine that it has manufactured or remanufactured.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The locomotives and locomotive engines for which the regulations of this part (i.e., 40 CFR part 92) apply are specified by Sec. 92.1, and by the definitions of Sec. 92.2. The point at which a locomotive or locomotive engine becomes subject to the regulations of this part is determined by the definition of ``new locomotive or new locomotive engine'' in Sec. 92.2. Subpart J of this part contains provisions exempting certain locomotives or locomotive engines from the regulations in this part under special circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To comply with the requirements of this part, a manufacturer or remanufacturer must demonstrate to EPA that the locomotive or locomotive engine meets the applicable standards of Secs. 92.7 and 92.8, and all other requirements of this part. The requirements of this certification process are described in subparts C and D of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpart B of this part specifies procedures and equipment to be used for conducting emission tests for the purpose of the regulations of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Subparts E, F, G, and H of this part specify requirements for manufacturers and remanufacturers after certification; that is during production and use of the locomotives and locomotive engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subpart I of this part contains requirements applicable to the importation of locomotives and locomotive engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Subpart K of this part contains requirements applicable to the owners and operators of locomotives and locomotive engines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Subpart L of this part describes prohibited acts and contains other enforcement provisions relating to locomotives and locomotive engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Unless specified otherwise, the provisions of this part apply to all locomotives and locomotive engines subject to the emission standards of this part.</p>
