                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Persons required to make return--(1) Controlling fifty-percent partners. The term controlling fifty-percent partner means a United States person that controlled (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) the foreign partnership at any time during the partnership's tax year (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section). Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, for each tax year of a foreign partnership during which the partnership has one or more controlling fifty-percent partners, each controlling fifty-percent partner must complete and file Form 8865, ``Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships,'' containing the information described in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Controlling fifty-percent partners. The term controlling fifty-percent partner means a United States person that controlled (as defined in paragraph (b)(1) of this section) the foreign partnership at any time during the partnership's tax year (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section). Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, for each tax year of a foreign partnership during which the partnership has one or more controlling fifty-percent partners, each controlling fifty-percent partner must complete and file Form 8865, ``Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships,'' containing the information described in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Controlling ten-percent partners. If at any point during a foreign partnership's tax year (as defined in paragraph (b)(8) of this section) a United States person owned a ten-percent or greater interest in the partnership while the partnership was controlled by United States persons owning ten-percent or greater interests, such United States person is a controlling ten-percent partner. See paragraph (b)(1) of this section for the definition of control. However, a United States person is not a controlling ten-percent partner with respect to a particular foreign partnership for a particular tax year of the foreign partnership if at any point during that year the partnership had a controlling fifty-percent partner, as defined in paragraph (a)(1) of this section. Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section, for each tax year of a partnership during which the partnership has controlling ten-percent partners, each controlling ten-percent partner must complete and file Form 8865 containing the information described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Separate returns for each partnership. A United States person required to report under this paragraph (a) must file a separate Form 8865 for each foreign partnership with respect to which the person is a controlling fifty-percent partner or a controlling ten-percent partner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Ownership determinations and definitions--(1) Control. Control of a foreign partnership is ownership of more than a fifty-percent interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Control. Control of a foreign partnership is ownership of more than a fifty-percent interest in the partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fifty-percent interest. A fifty-percent interest in a partnership is an interest equal to fifty percent of the capital interest in such partnership, an interest equal to fifty percent of the profits interest in such partnership, or an interest to which fifty percent of the deductions or losses of such partnership are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Ten-percent interest. A ten-percent interest in a partnership is an interest equal to ten percent of the capital interest in such partnership, an interest equal to ten percent of the profits interest in such partnership, or an interest to which ten percent of the deductions or losses of such partnership are allocated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Constructive ownership rules. For purposes of determining an interest in a partnership, the constructive ownership rules of section 267(c) (other than section 267(c)(3)) apply, taking into account that such rules refer to corporations and not to partnerships. However, an interest will be attributed from a nonresident alien under the family attribution rules of section 267(c)(2) and (4) only if the person to whom the interest is attributed owns a direct or indirect (under the rules of 267(c)(1) or (5)) interest in the foreign partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Determination of amount of interest. Whether a person owns a fifty-percent interest, or a ten-percent interest, as described in paragraphs (b)(2) and (3) of this section, is determined for each tax year of the foreign partnership by reference to the agreement of the partners relating to such interests during that tax year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Definition of United States person. The term United States person is defined in section 7701(a)(30).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Definition of a foreign partnership. A foreign partnership is a partnership described in section 7701(a)(5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Tax year of a foreign partnership. The tax year of a foreign partnership is determined under section 706.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Examples. The rules of paragraph (a) of this section and this paragraph

(b) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Sole U.S. partner does not own more than a fifty-percent interest. No United States person owns any interest (directly or constructively) in FPS, a foreign partnership whose tax year under section 706 is the calendar year. On January 1, 2001, US, a United States person with the calendar year as its tax year, contributes property to FPS in exchange for a 40% interest in a section 721 transaction. No United States persons acquire directly or constructively any other interests in FPS during FPS's 2001 tax year. US is not a controlling fifty-percent partner during FPS's 2001 tax year. US did not own during that tax year, either directly or constructively, more than a 50% interest in the partnership under paragraphs (b)(2) and (4) of this section. Also, US is not a controlling ten-percent partner; although US owned a 10% or greater interest, US persons owning at least 10% interests did not control FPS. Therefore, US does not have to file with its 2001 income tax return a Form 8865 with respect to FPS under section 6038. (But see section 6038B for the reporting obligations of US with respect to its transfer of property to FPS and section 6046A for the reporting obligation of US with respect to its acquisition of an interest in FPS. See also Sec. 1.6046A-1(f)(1) regarding the overlap between sections 6038B and 6046A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Controlling ten-percent partners. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. In addition, on January 1, 2002, US1, a United States person unrelated to US and a calendar year taxpayer, purchases a 15% interest in FPS from a foreign partner of FPS. Neither US nor US1 is a controlling fifty-percent partner during FPS's 2002 tax year because neither one owns more than a 50% percent interest in FPS during that year. However, US and US1 are controlling ten-percent partners for that year because each owns at least a 10% interest (US owns a 40% interest and US1 owns a 15% interest) and together they control FPS because collectively they own more than a 50% interest in FPS. As controlling ten-percent partners, under section 6038, each is required to file a Form 8865 with its 2002 income tax return. (US1 must also report its acquisition of the 15% interest in FPS under section 6046A on its Form 8865 filed with its 2002 income tax return.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Constructive ownership rules. Assume the same facts as in Example 2. In addition, on January 1, 2003, US2, a United States person and the brother of US, purchases 50% of the stock of FC, a foreign corporation. FC owns a 20% interest in FPS. Thus, under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1), US2 indirectly owns a 10% interest in FPS (10% is US2's proportionate share of FC's 20% interest in FPS), and under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(2), US2 is attributed US's 40% interest. Additionally, US directly owns a 40% interest in FPS and is attributed US2's 10% interest pursuant to section 6038(e)(3) and section 267(c)(2). Therefore, US2 is considered to own a 50% interest (10% indirectly and 40% from US) in FPS, and US is considered to own a 50% interest in FPS (40% directly and 10% from US2). FPS has no controlling fifty-percent partners, because neither US, US1, nor US2, owns a greater than 50% interest. However, US, US1, and US2 are each controlling ten-percent partners and each must file Form 8865 pursuant to section 6038 for FPS's 2003 tax year ending December 31, 2003. Each must attach Form 8865 to its tax return for its 2003 tax year.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Controlling fifty-percent partners. Assume the same facts as in Example 3. In addition, on June 1, 2004, US acquires an additional 1% direct interest in FPS. US is now a controlling fifty-percent partner of FPS, because US owns a 41% interest directly and a 10% interest constructively from US2. US2 is also a controlling fifty-percent partner, because US2 owns 10% indirectly and 41% constructively from US. Both US and US2 are required to file Form 8865 containing all the information required to be submitted by controlling fifty-percent partners. (But see paragraph (c)(1) of this section, which contains filing exceptions when there are multiple controlling fifty-percent partners). US1 is no longer a controlling ten-percent partner because FPS now has at least one controlling fifty-percent partner, and US1 does not qualify as a controlling fifty-percent partner. Therefore, US1 is not required to file Form 8865 under section 6038.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Constructive ownership from a nonresident alien. US, a United States person, does not own directly or constructively an interest in FPS, a foreign partnership. The tax year of FPS is the calendar year. NRA, a nonresident alien, is the mother of US. In 2002, NRA acquires a 55% interest in FPS. Because US owns neither a direct nor a constructive interest in FPS under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1) or (5), NRA's interest is not attributed to US under sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(2). If in 2003 NRA becomes a United States person, NRA's interest will be attributed to US. However, US is excused from filing Form 8865 if US satisfies the requirements of the constructive owners exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. In 2003, NRA is a controlling fifty-percent partner and must file a Form 8865 under section 6038 for FPS's 2003 tax year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Exceptions when more than one United States person is required to file Form 8865 pursuant to section 6038--(1) Multiple controlling fifty-percent partners--(i) In general. If, with respect to the same foreign partnership for the same tax year, more than one United

States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner, then in lieu of each controlling fifty-percent partner filing a separate Form 8865, only one Form 8865 from one of the controlling fifty-percent partners is required, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. A person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner solely because of an interest to which deductions or losses are allocated may file the single return only if there is no United States person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner by reason of an interest in capital or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiple controlling fifty-percent partners--(i) In general. If, with respect to the same foreign partnership for the same tax year, more than one United

States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner, then in lieu of each controlling fifty-percent partner filing a separate Form 8865, only one Form 8865 from one of the controlling fifty-percent partners is required, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. A person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner solely because of an interest to which deductions or losses are allocated may file the single return only if there is no United States person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner by reason of an interest in capital or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If, with respect to the same foreign partnership for the same tax year, more than one United

States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner, then in lieu of each controlling fifty-percent partner filing a separate Form 8865, only one Form 8865 from one of the controlling fifty-percent partners is required, provided all of the requirements of paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are satisfied. A person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner solely because of an interest to which deductions or losses are allocated may file the single return only if there is no United States person that is a controlling fifty-percent partner by reason of an interest in capital or profits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements--(A) The person undertaking the filing obligation must file Form 8865 with that person's income tax return in the manner provided by Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions. The return must contain all of the information that would have been required to be reported by this section if each controlling fifty-percent partner had filed its own Form 8865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person undertaking the filing obligation must file Form 8865 with that person's income tax return in the manner provided by Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions. The return must contain all of the information that would have been required to be reported by this section if each controlling fifty-percent partner had filed its own Form 8865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any controlling fifty-percent partner not filing Form 8865 must file with its income tax return a statement titled ``Controlled Foreign Partnership Reporting'' containing the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A statement that the person qualified as a controlling fifty-percent partner, but is not submitting Form 8865 pursuant to the multiple controlling fifty-percent partners exception;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name, address, and taxpayer identification number (if any) of the foreign partnership of which the person qualified as a controlling fifty-percent partner;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A representation that the filing requirement has been or will be satisfied;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The name and address of the person filing the single return;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The Internal Revenue Service Center where the single return is required to be filed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Any additional information that Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Penalties. If the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section are not satisfied, a United States person that did not file a Form 8865 pursuant to this paragraph will be subject to the penalties in paragraph (k) of this section, unless the reasonable cause provision in paragraph (k)(4) of this section is satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Certain constructive owners excepted from furnishing information--(i) In general. A United States person that does not own a direct interest in the foreign partnership and that is required to file Form 8865 under this section solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section (an indirect partner) is not required to file Form 8865 if all of the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A United States person that does not own a direct interest in the foreign partnership and that is required to file Form 8865 under this section solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section (an indirect partner) is not required to file Form 8865 if all of the requirements listed in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements--(A) The United States person(s) whose interest the indirect partner constructively owns reports all the information such person(s) is required to submit under this section, unless such person also is required to file solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or another person reports the information pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The United States person(s) whose interest the indirect partner constructively owns reports all the information such person(s) is required to submit under this section, unless such person also is required to file solely by reason of constructive ownership from a United States person(s) pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, or another person reports the information pursuant to paragraph (c)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The indirect partner files with its income tax return a statement titled ``Controlled Foreign Partnership Reporting'' containing the following information--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A representation that the indirect partner was required to file Form 8865, but is not doing so pursuant to the constructive owners exception;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The names and addresses of the United States persons whose interests the indirect partner constructively owns;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The name and address of the foreign partnership with respect to which the indirect partner would have had to have filed Form 8865 but for this exception; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any additional information that Form 8865 and the accompanying instructions require.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Penalties.

The following example illustrates the operation of this paragraph (c)(2)(iv):</p><p class="depth0">Example. US is a U.S. citizen. US owns 100% of the stock of DC, a domestic corporation. DC owns a 60% direct interest in FPS, a foreign partnership. DC and US are the only U.S. persons that own interests directly or constructively in FPS. DC owns directly a greater than 50% interest in FPS. US constructively owns DC's interest pursuant to sections 6038(e)(3) and 267(c)(1). Therefore, both DC and US are controlling fifty-percent partners. US qualifies for both the exception in paragraph (c)(1) of this section (multiple controlling fifty-percent partners) and the exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section (constructive owner exception). US may only utilize the paragraph (c)(1) exception to avoid its filing obligation. Accordingly, DC may file a single Form 8865 on behalf of US and itself. However, that form must contain all the information that would have been submitted had DC and US each submitted a separate Form 8865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return. If one or more members of an affiliated group of corporations filing a consolidated return are required under section 6038 to file a Form 8865 for a particular foreign partnership, the common parent corporation may file one Form 8865 on behalf of all of the members of the group required to report under section 6038. Except with respect to group members who also qualify under the exception in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the Form 8865 must contain all the information that would have been required to be submitted if each group member were required to file its own Form 8865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exception for certain trusts. Trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans are not required to report under this section, unless the instructions to Form 8865 provide otherwise.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reporting under this section not required with respect to partnerships excluded from the application of subchapter K. The reporting requirements of this section will not apply to any United States person in respect of an eligible partnership as described in Sec. 1.761-2(a) if such partnership has validly elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the manner specified in Sec. 1.761-2(b)(2)(i), or such partnership is deemed to have elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 1.761-2(b)(2)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Period covered by return.

If required by the instructions to Form 8865, a duplicate Form 8865 (including attachments and schedules) must also be filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Overlap with section 6031. A partner may be required to file Form 8865 under this section and the foreign partnership in which it is a partner may also be required to file a Form 1065 or Form 1065-B under section 6031(e) for the same partnership tax year. For cases where a United States person is a controlling fifty-percent partner or a controlling ten-percent partner with respect to a foreign partnership, and that foreign partnership completes and files Form 1065 or Form 1065-B, the instructions for Form 8865 will specify the filing requirements that address this overlap in reporting obligations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Failure to comply with reporting requirement--(1) In general.

A penalty of $10,000 shall be imposed for each tax year of each foreign partnership with respect to which a failure to comply occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> $10,000 penalty. A penalty of $10,000 shall be imposed for each tax year of each foreign partnership with respect to which a failure to comply occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Increase in penalty. If a failure to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section continues for more than 90 days after the date on which the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice of the failure to the United States person required to file Form 8865, the person must pay an additional penalty of $10,000 for each 30-day period (or fraction thereof) during which the failure continues after the 90-day period has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limitation. The additional penalty imposed on any United States person by section 6038(b)(2) and paragraph (k)(3)(i)(B) of this section is limited to a maximum of $50,000 for each partnership for each tax year with respect to which the failure occurs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Penalty of reducing foreign tax credit--(A) Effect on foreign tax credit. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section may cause a reduction of foreign tax credits under section 901 (taxes of foreign countries and of possessions of the United States). In applying section 901 to a United States person for any tax year with or within which its foreign partnership's tax year ended, the amount of taxes paid (and deemed paid under sections 902 and 960) by the United States person will be reduced by 10 percent if the person fails to comply. However, no tax deemed paid under section 904(c) will be reduced under the provisions of this paragraph (k)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Effect on foreign tax credit. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section may cause a reduction of foreign tax credits under section 901 (taxes of foreign countries and of possessions of the United States). In applying section 901 to a United States person for any tax year with or within which its foreign partnership's tax year ended, the amount of taxes paid (and deemed paid under sections 902 and 960) by the United States person will be reduced by 10 percent if the person fails to comply. However, no tax deemed paid under section 904(c) will be reduced under the provisions of this paragraph (k)(3)(ii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Reduction for continued failure. If a failure to comply with the reporting requirements of section 6038 and this section continues for more than 90 days after the date on which the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice of the failure to the person required to file Form 8865, then the amount of the reduction in paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(A) of this section will be 10 percent, plus an additional 5 percent for each 3-month period (or fraction thereof) during which the failure continues after the 90-day period has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Limitation on reduction. The amount of the reduction under paragraphs (k)(3)(ii)(A) and (B) of this section for each failure to furnish information required under this section will not exceed the greater of $10,000, or the gross income of the foreign partnership for its tax year with respect to which the failure occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Offset for dollar amount penalty imposed. The total amount of the reduction which, but for this paragraph (k)(3)(ii)(D), may be made under this paragraph (k)(3)(ii) with respect to any separate failure, may not exceed the maximum amount of the reductions that may be imposed, reduced (but not below zero) by the dollar amount penalty imposed by paragraph (k)(3)(i) of this section with respect to the failure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reasonable cause limitation. The time prescribed for filing a complete Form 8865, and the beginning of the 90-day period after the Commissioner or the Commissioner's delegate mails notice under paragraphs (k)(3)(i)(B) and (ii)(B) of this section, will be treated as being not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for failure to furnish the information. The United States person may show reasonable cause by providing a written statement to the Commissioner's delegate having jurisdiction over the person's return to which the Form 8865 should have been attached, setting forth the reasons for the failure to comply. Whether a failure to comply was due to reasonable cause will be determined by the Commissioner, or the Commissioner's delegate, under all the facts and circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Statute of limitations. For exceptions to the limitations on assessment

in the event of a failure to provide information under section 6038, see section 6501(c)(8).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effective date. Except as otherwise provided, this section shall apply for tax years of a foreign partnership ending on or after December 31, 2000.

Sec. 1.6038A-1  General requirements and definitions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Purpose and scope. This section and Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-2 through 1.6038A-7 provide rules for certain foreign-owned U.S. corporations and foreign corporations engaged in trade or business within the United States (reporting corporations) relating to information that must be furnished, records that

must be maintained, and the authorization of the reporting corporation to act as agent for related foreign persons for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 that must be executed. Section 6038A(a) and this section require that a reporting corporation furnish certain information annually and maintain certain records relating to transactions between the reporting corporation and certain related parties. This section also provides definitions of terms used in section 6038A. Section 1.6038A-2 provides guidance concerning the information to be submitted and the filing of the required return. Section 1.6038A-3 provides guidance concerning the maintenance of records. Section 1.6038A-4 provides guidance concerning the application of the monetary penalty for the failure either to furnish information or to maintain records. Section 1.6038A-5 provides guidance concerning the authorization of an agent for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604. Section 1.6038A-6 provides guidance concerning the failure to furnish information requested by a summons. Finally, Sec. 1.6038A-7 provides guidance concerning the application of the noncompliance penalty for failure by the related party to authorize an agent or by the reporting corporation to substantially comply with a summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In general. A reporting corporation must furnish the information described in Sec. 1.6038A-2 by filing an annual information return (Form 5472 or any successor), and must maintain records as described in Sec. 1.6038A-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reporting corporation--(1) In general. For purposes of section 6038A, a reporting corporation is either a domestic corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or a foreign corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned and engaged in trade or business within the United States. After November 4, 1990, a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business within the United States at any time during a taxable year is a reporting corporation. See section 6038C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of section 6038A, a reporting corporation is either a domestic corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned as defined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, or a foreign corporation that is 25-percent foreign-owned and engaged in trade or business within the United States. After November 4, 1990, a foreign corporation engaged in a trade or business within the United States at any time during a taxable year is a reporting corporation. See section 6038C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 25-percent foreign-owned.

In determining whether one foreign person owns 25 percent of the total voting power of all classes of stock of a corporation entitled to vote or 25 percent of the total value of all classes of stock of a corporation, consideration will be given to all the facts and circumstances of each case, under principles similar to Sec. 1.957-1(b)(2) (consideration of arrangements to shift formal voting power away from a foreign person).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Direct 25-percent foreign shareholder. A foreign person is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder if it owns directly at least 25 percent of the stock of the reporting corporation, either by vote or by value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder.

For taxable years beginning before July 11, 1989, the definition of a reporting corporation under this paragraph applies in determining whether a foreign-owned corporation is a reporting corporation. An examination may be reopened if the statute of limitations period for that taxable year has not expired. A taxable year may not be reopened under section 6038A for examination purposes if the taxable year is open under section 6511 only for purposes of the carryback of net operating losses or net capital losses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Exceptions--(i) Treaty country residents having no permanent establishment. A foreign corporation that has no permanent establishment in the United States under an applicable income tax convention is not a reporting corporation for purposes of section 6038A and

this section. Accordingly, such a foreign corporation is not subject to Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-2, 1.6038A-3, and 1.6038A-5.

A foreign corporation whose gross income is exempt from U.S. taxation under section 883 is not a reporting corporation provided that it timely and fully complies with the reporting requirements required to claim such exemption. In the event that such a corporation does not timely and fully comply with the reporting requirements under sections 887 and 883, it will be a reporting corporation subject to section 6038A, including the application of the monetary penalty for failure to file required information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Status as foreign related party. Nothing in this paragraph affects the determination of whether a person is a foreign related party as defined in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Related party. The term ``related party'' means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any direct or indirect 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any person who is related within the meaning of sections 267(b) or 707(b)(1) to the reporting corporation or to a 25-percent foreign shareholder of the reporting corporation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any other person who is related to the reporting corporation within the meaning of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. However, the term ``related party'' does not include any corporation filing a consolidated federal income tax return with the reporting corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Attribution rules--(1) Attribution under section 318. For purposes of determining whether a corporation is 25-percent foreign-owned and whether a person is a related party under section 6038A, the constructive ownership rules of section 318 shall apply, and the attribution rules of section 267(c) also shall apply to the extent they attribute ownership to persons to whom section 318 does not attribute ownership. However, ``10 percent'' shall be substituted for ``50 percent'' in section 318(a)(2)(C), and section 318(a)(3) (A), (B), and (C) shall not be applied so as to consider a U.S. person as owning stock that is owned by a person who is not a U.S. person. Additionally, section 318(a)(3)(C) and Sec. 1.318-1(b) shall not be applied so as to consider a U.S. corporation as being a reporting corporation if, but for the application of such sections, the U.S. corporation would not be 25-percent foreign owned.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Attribution under section 318. For purposes of determining whether a corporation is 25-percent foreign-owned and whether a person is a related party under section 6038A, the constructive ownership rules of section 318 shall apply, and the attribution rules of section 267(c) also shall apply to the extent they attribute ownership to persons to whom section 318 does not attribute ownership.

The transactions in which a domestic or foreign partnership engages shall be attributed to any reporting corporation whose interest in the capital or profits of the partnership, either directly or indirectly, combined with the interests of all related parties of the reporting corporation partner, equals 25 percent or more of the total partnership interests. Attribution of such transactions shall be made only to the extent of the partnership interest held by that reporting corporation partner. See sections 875 and 702(a) and the regulations thereunder. (Attribution shall not be made however, of transactions directly between the partnership and a reporting corporation.) Accordingly, a reporting corporation partner that is deemed to engage in transactions with related parties under this rule is subject to the information reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2, to the record maintenance requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-3, to the monetary penalty under Sec. 1.6038A-4, to the requirement of authorization of agent under Sec. 1.6038A-5, to the rules of Sec. 1.6038A-6 relating to the requirement to produce records, and to the noncompliance penalty adjustment under Sec. 1.6038A-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Foreign person. For purposes of section 6038A, a foreign person is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any individual who is not a citizen or resident of the United States, but not including any individual for whom an election under section 6013 (g) or (h) (relating to an election to file a joint return) is in effect;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any individual who is a citizen of any possession of the United States and who is not otherwise a citizen or resident of the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any partnership, association, company, or corporation that is not created or organized in the United States or under the law of the United States or any State thereof;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any foreign trust or foreign estate, as defined in section 7701(a)(31); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any foreign government (or agency or instrumentality thereof). To the extent that a foreign government is engaged in the conduct of commercial activity as defined under section 892 and the regulations thereunder, it will be treated as a foreign person under section 6038A and this section only for purposes of the information reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2. A foreign government will not be treated as a foreign related party for purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5.

For purposes of section 6038A, a possession of the United States shall be considered to be a foreign country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Foreign related party. A foreign related party is a foreign person as defined under paragraph (f) of this section that is also a related party as defined under paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Small corporation exception. A reporting corporation that has less than $10,000,000 in U.S. gross receipts for a taxable year is not subject to Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5 for that taxable year. Such a corporation, however, remains subject to the information reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2 and the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001. For purposes of this paragraph, U.S. gross receipts includes all amounts received or accrued to the extent that such amounts are taken into account for the determination and computation of the gross income of the corporation. For purposes of this test, the U.S. gross receipts of all related reporting corporations shall be aggregated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Safe harbor for reporting corporations with related party transactions of de minimis value--(1) In general. A reporting corporation is not subject to Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5 for any taxable year in which the aggregate value of all gross payments it makes to and receives from foreign related parties with respect to related party transactions (including monetary consideration, nonmonetary consideration, and the value of transactions involving less than full consideration), is not more than $5,000,000 and is less than 10 percent of its U.S. gross income. Such a corporation, however, remains subject to the information reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2 and the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001. For purposes of this paragraph, U.S. gross income means the gross income reportable by the reporting corporation (or the aggregate gross income reportable by all related reporting corporations) for U.S. income tax purposes. Gross payments made to or received from foreign related parties cannot be netted; rather, the gross payments made to and received from foreign related parties are to be aggregated. Thus, for example, if a reporting corporation receives $4,700,000 of gross payments from a related party and makes $500,000 of gross payments to the same related party, it has aggregate gross payments of $5,200,000, and, therefore, does not qualify for the safe harbor under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A reporting corporation is not subject to Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5 for any taxable year in which the aggregate value of all gross payments it makes to and receives from foreign related parties with respect to related party transactions (including monetary consideration, nonmonetary consideration, and the value of transactions involving less than full consideration), is not more than $5,000,000 and is less than 10 percent of its U.S. gross income. Such a corporation, however, remains subject to the information reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2 and the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001. For purposes of this paragraph, U.S. gross income means the gross income reportable by the reporting corporation (or the aggregate gross income reportable by all related reporting corporations) for U.S. income tax purposes. Gross payments made to or received from foreign related parties cannot be netted; rather, the gross payments made to and received from foreign related parties are to be aggregated. Thus, for example, if a reporting corporation receives $4,700,000 of gross payments from a related party and makes $500,000 of gross payments to the same related party, it has aggregate gross payments of $5,200,000, and, therefore, does not qualify for the safe harbor under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Aggregate value of gross payments made or received. The aggregate value of gross payments made to (or received from) a foreign related party with respect to foreign related party transactions is determined by totaling the dollar amounts of foreign related party transactions as described in Sec. 1.6038A-2(b) (3) and (4) on all Forms 5472 filed by the reporting corporation or related reporting corporations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Related reporting corporations. A reporting corporation is related to another reporting corporation if it is related to that other reporting corporation under the principles described in paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> Consolidated return groups--(1) Required information. If a reporting corporation is a member of an affiliated group for which a U.S. consolidated income tax return is filed, the return requirement of Sec. 1.6038A-2 may be satisfied by filing a consolidated Form 5472. The common parent, as identified on Form 851, must attach a schedule to the consolidated Form 5472 stating which members of the U.S. affiliated group are reporting corporations under section 6038A, and which of those are joining in the consolidated Form 5472. The schedule must provide the name,

address, and taxpayer identification number of each member whose transactions are included on the consolidated Form 5472. A member is not required to join in filing a consolidated Form 5472 merely because other members of the group choose to file one or more Forms 5472 on a consolidated basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Required information. If a reporting corporation is a member of an affiliated group for which a U.S. consolidated income tax return is filed, the return requirement of Sec. 1.6038A-2 may be satisfied by filing a consolidated Form 5472. The common parent, as identified on Form 851, must attach a schedule to the consolidated Form 5472 stating which members of the U.S. affiliated group are reporting corporations under section 6038A, and which of those are joining in the consolidated Form 5472.

A member is not required to join in filing a consolidated Form 5472 merely because other members of the group choose to file one or more Forms 5472 on a consolidated basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance of records and authorization of agent. Either the common parent or the principal operating company of an affiliated group filing a consolidated income tax return may be authorized under Sec. 1.6038A-5 to act as the agent for foreign related persons engaged in transactions with members of the group solely for purposes of section 7602, 7603, and 7604 under section 6038A(e)(1) and Sec. 1.6038A-5. Each member of the group, however, must maintain the records required under section 6038A (a) and Sec. 1.6038A-3 relating to its related party transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Monetary penalties. The common parent (or principal operating company) and all reporting corporations that join in the filing of a consolidated Form 5472 are liable jointly and severally for penalties for failure to file Form 5472 and for failure to mantain records under section 6038A(d) and Sec. 1.6038A-4(e). See Sec. 1.1502-77(a) regarding the scope of agency of the common parent corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> District Director. For purposes of the regulations under section 6038A, the term ``District Director'' means any District Director, or the Assistant Commissioner (International) when performing duties similar to those of a District Director with respect to any person over which the Assistant Commissioner (International) has appropriate jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. P, a U.S. partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business, is 75 percent owned by FC1, a foreign corporation that, in turn, is wholly owned by another foreign corporation, FC2. The remaining 25 percent of P is owned by Corp, a domestic corporation, that is wholly owned by FC3. P engages in transactions solely with FC2 and FC3. These transactions are attributed to FC1 and Corp. Under section 875, FC1 is considered as being engaged in a U.S. trade or business. For purposes of section 6038A and this section, FC1 and Corp are reporting corporations and must report their pro rata shares of the value of the transactions with FC2 and FC3. Thus, Corp must report 25 percent of P's transactions with FC3 and FC1 must report 75 percent of P's transactions with FC2.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. FC2 and FC3 are both foreign corporations that are wholly owned by FC1, also a foreign corporation. FC2 engages in a trade or business in the United States through a branch. The branch engages in related party transactions with FC1. FC2 is a reporting corporation. FC3 is a foreign related party. FC1 is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder of both FC2 and FC3. Neither FC1 nor FC3 is a reporting corporation.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. FC1 owns 25 percent of total voting power in each of FC2 and FC3. FC2 and FC3 each own 20 percent of the total voting power of Corp, a domestic corporation. The remaining stock of Corp is owned by an unrelated domestic corporation. Neither FC2 nor FC3 is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. Under section 318(a)(2)(C) and paragraph (e) of this section, FC1 constructively owns its proportionate share of the stock of Corp owned directly by FC2 and FC3. Thus, FCl is treated as constructively owning five percent of Corp through each of FC2 and FC3 or a total of 10 percent of the Corp stock. Consequently, Corp is not a reporting corporation because no 25 percent shareholder exists.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. FP owns 100 percent of FCl which, in turn, owns 100 percent of FC2. FC2 owns 100 percent of FC3 which owns 100 percent of RC. FP, FC1, and FC2 are indirect 25-percent foreign shareholders of RC, and FC3 is a direct 25-percent foreign shareholder.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. FP owns 100 percent of USS, a U.S. corporation, and 25 percent of FS, a foreign corporation. The remaining 75 percent of FS is publicly owned by numerous small shareholders. Sales transactions occur between USS and FS. Applying the rules of this section, USS is a reporting corporation. It is determined that USS and FS are each controlled by FP under section 482 and the regulations thereunder. Therefore, FS is related to USS within the meaning of section 482 and is a related party to USS. Accordingly, the sales transactions between USS and FS are subject to section 6038A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. The facts are the same as in Example 5, except that the remaining 75 percent of FS is owned by one shareholder that is unrelated to the FP group and it is determined that FS is not controlled by FP for purposes of section 482. Under these facts, FS is not a related party of either FP or USS. Accordingly, section 6038A does not apply to the sales transactions between FS and USS.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. P, a U.S. multinational, is a holding company that wholly owns X, a U.S. operating company, which in turn wholly owns FS, a controlled foreign corporation. Applying the rule of section 318(a)(3)(C), FS

is deemed to own the stock of X that is actually held by P. However, under the rules of paragraph (e) of this section, X will not be a reporting corporation by reason of section 318.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(n)</em> Effective dates--(1) Section 1.6038A-1.

The reporting corporation must provide information on Form 5472, set forth in the manner the form prescribes, about each related party, whether foreign or domestic, with which the reporting corporation had a transaction of the types described in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section during its taxable year, including the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The name, U.S. taxpayer identification number, if applicable, and address of the related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The nature of the reated party's business and the principal place or places where it conducts its business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Each country in which the related party files an income tax return as a resident under the tax laws of that country.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The relationship of the reporting corporation to the related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Foreign related party transactions for which only monetary consideration is paid or received by the reporting corporation. If the related party is a foreign person, the reporting corporation must set forth on Form 5472 the dollar amounts of all reportable transactions for which monetary consideration (including U.S. and foreign currency) was the sole consideration paid or received during the taxable year of the reporting corporation. The total amount of such transactions, as well as the separate amounts for each type of transaction described below, must be reported on Form 5472, in the manner the form prescribes. Where actual amounts are not determinable, a reasonable estimate (as described in paragraph (b)(6) of this section) is permitted. The types of transactions described in this paragraph are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sales and purchases of stock in trade (inventory);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Sales and purchases of tangible property other than stock in trade;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rents and royalties paid and received (other than amounts reported under paragraph (b)(3)(iv) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Sales, purchases, and amounts paid and received as consideration for the use of all intangible property, including (but not limited to) copyrights, designs, formulas, inventions, models, patents, processes, trademarks, and other similar intangible property rights;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Consideration paid and received for technical, managerial, engineering, construction, scientific, or other services;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Commissions paid and received;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Amounts loaned and borrowed (except open accounts resulting from sales and purchases reported under other items listed in this paragraph (b)(3) that arise and are collected in full in the ordinary course of business);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Interest paid and received;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Premiums paid and received for insurance and reinsurance; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Other amounts paid or received not specifically identified in this paragraph (b)(3) to the extent that such amounts are taken into account for the determination and computation of the taxable income of the reporting corporation.

Amounts required to be reported under paragraph (b)(3)(vii) of this section shall be reported as monthly averages

or outstanding balances at the beginning and end of the taxable year, as the form shall prescribe.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Foreign related party transactions involving nonmonetary consideration or less than full consideration. If the related party is a foreign person, the reporting corporation must provide on Form 5472 a description of any reportable transaction, or group of reportable transactions, listed in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, for which any part of the consideration paid or received was not monetary consideration, or for which less than full consideration was paid or received. A description required under paragraph (b)(4) of this section shall include sufficient information from which to determine the nature and approximate monetary value of the transaction or group of transactions, and shall include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of all property (including monetary consideration), rights, or obligations transferred from the reporting corporation to the foreign related party and from the foreign related party to the reporting corporation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A description of all services performed by the reporting corporation for the foreign related party and by the foreign related party for the reporting corporation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A reasonable estimate of the fair market value of all properties and services exchanged, if possible, or some other reasonable indicator of value.

If, for any transaction, the entire consideration received includes both tangible and intangible property and the consideration paid is solely monetary consideration, the transaction should be reported under paragraph (b)(3) of this section if the intangible property was related and incidental to the transfer of the tangible property (for example, a right to warranty services.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Additional information. In addition to the information required under paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section, a reporting corporation must provide on Form 5472, in the manner the form prescribes, the following information:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the reporting corporation imports goods from a foreign related party, whether the costs taken into account in computing the basis or inventory cost of such goods are greater than the costs taken into account in computing the valuation of the goods for customs purposes, adjusted pursuant to section 1059A and the regulations thereunder, and if so, the reasons for the difference.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the costs taken into account in computing the basis or inventory cost of such goods are greater than the costs taken into account in computing the valuation of the goods for customs purposes, whether the documents supporting the reporting corporation's treatment of the items set forth in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section are in existence and available in the United States at the time Form 5472 is filed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Reasonable estimate--(i) Estimate within 25 percent of actual amount.

Any amount reported under this section is considered to be a reasonable estimate if it is at least 75 percent and not more than 125 percent of the actual amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Other estimates. If any amount reported under this paragraph (b) of this section fails to meet the reasonable estimate test of paragraph (b)(6)(i) of this section, the reporting corporation nevertheless may show that such amount is a reasonable estimate by making an affirmative showing of relevant facts and circumstances in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under the penalties of perjury. The District Director shall determine whether the amount reported was a reasonable estimate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Small amounts. If any actual amount required under this section does not exceed $50,000, the amount may be reported as ``$50,000 or less.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Accrued payments and receipts. For purposes of this section, a reporting corporation that uses an accrual method of accounting shall use accrued payments and accrued receipts for purposes of computing the total amount of each of the types of transactions listed in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Method of reporting. All statements required on or with the Form 5472 under this section and Sec. 1.6038A-5 shall be in the English language.

A Form 5472 required under this section must be filed with the reporting corporation's income tax return for the taxable year by the due date (including extensions) of that return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Exceptions--(1) No reportable transactions. A reporting corporation is not required to file Form 5472 if it has no transactions of the types listed in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section during the taxable year with any related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No reportable transactions. A reporting corporation is not required to file Form 5472 if it has no transactions of the types listed in paragraphs (b) (3) and (4) of this section during the taxable year with any related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transactions solely with a domestic reporting corporation. If all of a foreign reporting corporation's reportable transactions are with one or more related domestic reporting corporations that are not members of the same affiliated group, the foreign reporting corporation shall furnish on Form 5472 only the information required under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section, if the domestic reporting corporations provide the information required under paragraphs (b) (3) through (5) of this section. Such a foreign reporting corporation nonetheless is subject to the record maintenance requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-3 and the requirements of Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-5 and 1.6038A-6. The name, address, and taxpayer identification number of each domestic reporting corporation that provided such information must be indicated on Form 5472 in the space provided for the information under paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transactions with a corporation subject to reporting under section 6038. A reporting corporation is not required to make a return of information on Form 5472 with respect to a related foreign corporation for a taxable year for which a U.S. person that controls the foreign related corporation makes a return of information on Form 5471 that is required under section 6038 and this section, if that return contains information required under Sec. 1.6038-2(f)(11) with respect to the reportable transactions between the reporting corporation and the related corporation for that taxable year. Such a reporting corporation also is not subject to Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-3 and 1.6038A-5. It remains subject to the general record maintenance requirements of section 6001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transactions with a foreign sales corporation. A reporting corporation is not required to make a return of information on Form 5472 with respect to a related corporation that qualifies as a foreign sales corporation for a taxable year for which the foreign sales corporation files Form 1120-FSC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Filing Form 5472 when transactions with related parties engaged in by a partnership are attributed to a reporting corporation. If transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under Sec. 1.6038A-1(e)(2) to a reporting corporation, the reporting corporation need report on Form 5472 only the percentage of the value of the transaction or transactions equal to the percentage of its partnership interest. Thus, for example, if a partnership buys $1000 of widgets from the foreign parent of a reporting corporation whose partnership interest in the partnership equals 50 percent of the partnership interests (and the remaining 50 percent is held by unrelated parties), the reporting corporation must report $500 of purchases from a foreign related party on Form 5472.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date. Except as otherwise provided, for applicability dates for this section for certain reporting corporations, see Sec. 1.6038A-1(n). Paragraph (b)(8) of this section applies with respect to information for annual accounting periods beginning on or after June 21, 2006.

Sec. 1.6038A-3  Record maintenance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General maintenance requirements--(1) Section 6001 and section 6038A. A reporting corporation must keep the permanent books of account or records as required by section 6001 that are sufficient to establish the correctness of the federal income tax return of the corporation, including information, documents, or records (``records'') to the extent they may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions with related parties.

Under section 6001, the District Director may require any person to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such specific records as will enable the District Director to determine whether or not that person is liable for any of the taxes to which the regulations under part I have application. See section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Such records must be permanent, accurate, and complete, and must clearly establish income, deductions, and credits. Additionally, in appropriate cases, such records include sufficient relevant cost data from which a profit and loss statement may be prepared for products or services transferred between a reporting corporation and its foreign related parties. This requirement includes records of the reporting corporation itself, as well as to records of any foreign related party that may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and foreign related parties. The relevance of such records with respect to related party transactions shall be determined upon the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Section 6038A and this section provide detailed guidance regarding the required maintenance of records with respect to such transactions and specify penalties for noncompliance. Banks and other financial institutions shall follow the specific record maintenance rules described in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 6001 and section 6038A. A reporting corporation must keep the permanent books of account or records as required by section 6001 that are sufficient to establish the correctness of the federal income tax return of the corporation, including information, documents, or records (``records'') to the extent they may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions with related parties.

Under section 6001, the District Director may require any person to make such returns, render such statements, or keep such specific records as will enable the District Director to determine whether or not that person is liable for any of the taxes to which the regulations under part I have application. See section 6001 and the regulations thereunder. Such records must be permanent, accurate, and complete, and must clearly establish income, deductions, and credits. Additionally, in appropriate cases, such records include sufficient relevant cost data from which a profit and loss statement may be prepared for products or services transferred between a reporting corporation and its foreign related parties. This requirement includes records of the reporting corporation itself, as well as to records of any foreign related party that may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and foreign related parties. The relevance of such records with respect to related party transactions shall be determined upon the basis of all the facts and circumstances. Section 6038A and this section provide detailed guidance regarding the required maintenance of records with respect to such transactions and specify penalties for noncompliance. Banks and other financial institutions shall follow the specific record maintenance rules described in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Safe harbor. A safe harbor for record maintenance is provided under paragraph (c) of this section, which sets forth detailed guidance concerning the types of records to be maintained with respect to related party transactions. The safe harbor consists of an all-inclusive list of record types that could be relevant to different taxpayers under a variety of facts and circumstances. It does not constitute a checklist of records that every reporting corporation must maintain or that generally should be requested by the Service. A specific reporting corporation is required to maintain, and the Service will request, only those records enumerated in the safe harbor (including material profit and loss statements) that may be relevant to its business or industry and to the correct U.S. tax treatment of its transactions with its foreign related parties. Accordingly, not every item listed in the safe harbor must be maintained by every reporting corporation. A corporation that maintains or causes another person to maintain the records listed in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that may be relevant to its foreign related party transactions and to its business or industry will be deemed to have met the record maintenance requirements of section 6038A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. RC, a U.S. reporting corporation, is owned by two shareholders, F and P. F is a foreign corporation that owns 30 percent of the stock of RC. P is a domestic corporation that owns the remaining 70 percent. RC purchases tangible property from F; however, the only potential audit issue with respect to these transactions is their treatment under section 482. It is determined that F does not in fact control RC and the two corporations do not constitute a group of ``controlled taxpayers'' for purposes of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. There are no other reportable transactions between RC and F. Under Sec. 1.6038A-1(g), F is a foreign related party with respect to RC. Accordingly, RC is required to report its purchases of property from F under the reporting requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-2. Nevertheless, because section 482 is not applicable to the transactions between RC and F, the records created by F with respect to its sales to RC are not relevant for purposes of determining the correct tax treatment of these transactions. RC is required to maintain its own records of these transactions under the requirements of section 6001, but the transactions are not subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section. If, however, on audit it is determined that F does control RC, all records relevant to determining the arm's length consideration for the tangible property under section 482 will be subject to these requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. FP, a foreign person, owns 30 percent of the stock of RC, a reporting corporation. The remaining 70 percent of RC stock is held by persons that are not 25-percent foreign shareholders. It is determined that FP is related to RC within the meaning of section 482 and the regulations thereunder. The only transactions between FP and RC are FP's capital contributions, dividends paid from RC to FP, and loans from FP to RC. Under section 6001, RC is required to maintain all documentation necessary to establish the U.S. tax treatment of the capital contributions, dividends, and loans. RC is not required to maintain records in other

categories listed in paragraph (c)(3) of this section because they are not relevant to the transactions between FP and RC. Records of FP not related to these transactions are not subject to the record maintenance requirements under section 6038A(a) and this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. G, a foreign multinational group, creates Sub, a wholly-owned U.S. subsidiary, in order to purchase tangible property from unrelated parties in the United States and resell such property to G. The property purchased by Sub is either used in G's business or resold to other unrelated parties by G. Sub's sole function is to act as a buyer for G and these purchases are the only transactions that G has with any U.S. affiliates. Under all the facts and circumstances of this case, it is determined that an analysis of the group's worldwide profit attributable to the property it purchases from Sub is not relevant for purposes of determining the tax treatment of the sales from Sub to G. Therefore, the records with respect to the profitability of G are not subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section. However, all records related to the appropriate method under section 482 for determining an arm's-length consideration for the property sold by Sub to G are subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. S, a U.S. reporting corporation, provides computer consulting services for its foreign parent, X. Based on the application of section 482 and the regulations, it is determined that the cost of services plus method, as described in Sec. 1.482-9(e), will provide the most reliable measure of an arm's length result, based on the facts and circumstances of the controlled transaction between S and X. S is required to maintain records to permit verification upon audit of the comparable transactional costs (as described in Sec. 1.482-9(e)(2)(iii)) used to calculate the arm's length price. Based on the facts and circumstances, if it is determined that X's records are relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of the controlled transaction between S and X, the record maintenance requirements under section 6038A(a) and this section will be applicable to the records of X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other maintenance requirements--(1) Indirectly related records. This section applies to records that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related parties. An example of records that are indirectly related to such transactions is records possessed by a foreign subsidiary of a foreign related party that document the raw material or component costs of a product that is manufactured or assembled by the subsdiary and sold as a finished product by the foreign related party to the reporting corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Indirectly related records. This section applies to records that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related parties. An example of records that are indirectly related to such transactions is records possessed by a foreign subsidiary of a foreign related party that document the raw material or component costs of a product that is manufactured or assembled by the subsdiary and sold as a finished product by the foreign related party to the reporting corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Foreign related party or third-party maintenance. If records that are required to be maintained under this section are in the control of a foreign related party, the records may be obtained or compiled (if not already in the possession of the foreign related party or already compiled) under the direction of the reporting corporation and then maintained by the reporting corporation, the foreign related party, or a third party. Thus, for example, a foreign related party may either itself maintain such records outside the United States or permit a third party to maintain such records outside the United States, provided that the conditions described in paragraph (f) of this section are met. Upon a request for such records by the Service, a foreign related party or third party may make arrangements with the District Director to furnish the records directly, rather than through the reporting corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Translation of records. When records are provided to the Service under a request for production, any portion of such records must be translated into the English language within 30 days of a request for translation of that portion by the District Director. To the extent that any requested documents are identical to documents that have already been translated, an explanation of how such documents are identical instead may be provided. An extension of this time period may be requested under paragraph (f)(4) of this section. Appropriate extensions will be liberally granted for translation requests where circumstances warrant. If a good faith effort is made to translate accurately the requested documents within the specified time period, the reporting corporation will not be subject to the penalties in Sec. Sec. 1.6038A-4 and 1.6038A-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Exception for foreign governments. A foreign government is not subject to the obligation to maintain records under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Records relating to conduit financing arrangements. See Sec. 1.881-4 relating to conduit financing arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Specific records to be maintained for safe harbor--(1) In general. A reporting

corporation that maintains or causes another person to maintain the records specified in this paragraph (c) that are relevant to its business or industry and to the correct U.S. tax treatment of its transactions with its foreign related parties will deemed to have met the record maintenance requirements of this section. This paragraph provides general descriptions of the categories of records to be maintained; the particular title or label applied by a reporting corporation or related party does not control. Functional equivalents of the specified documents are acceptable. Record maintenance in accordance with this safe harbor, however, requires only the maintenance of types of documents described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party. Additionally, to the extent the reporting corporation establishes that records in a particular category are not applicable to the industry or business of the reporting corporation and any foreign related party, maintenance of such records is not required under this paragraph. Record maintenance in accordance with this paragraph (c) generally does not require the original creation of records that are ordinarily not created by the reporting corporation or its related parties. (If, however, a document that is actually created is described in this paragraph (c), it is to be maintained even if the document is not of the type ordinarily created by the reporting corporation or its related parties.) There are two exceptions to the rule. First, basic accounting records that are sufficient to document the U.S. tax effects of transactions between related parties must be created and retained, if they do not otherwise exist. Second, records sufficient to produce material profit and loss statements as described in paragraphs (c)(2)(ii) and (3) of this section that are relevant for determining the U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and foreign related parties must be created if such records are not ordinarily maintained. All internal records storage and retrieval systems used for each taxable year must be retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A reporting

corporation that maintains or causes another person to maintain the records specified in this paragraph (c) that are relevant to its business or industry and to the correct U.S. tax treatment of its transactions with its foreign related parties will deemed to have met the record maintenance requirements of this section. This paragraph provides general descriptions of the categories of records to be maintained; the particular title or label applied by a reporting corporation or related party does not control. Functional equivalents of the specified documents are acceptable. Record maintenance in accordance with this safe harbor, however, requires only the maintenance of types of documents described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section that are directly or indirectly related to transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party.

All internal records storage and retrieval systems used for each taxable year must be retained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Descriptions of categories of documents to be maintained. The following records must be maintained in order to satisfy this paragraph (c) to the extent they may be relevant to determine the correct U.S. tax treatment of transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Original entry books and transaction records. This category includes books and records of original entry or their functional equivalents, however designated or labelled, that are relevant to transactions between any foreign related party and the reporting corporation. Examples include, but are not limited to, general ledgers, sales journals, purchase order books, cash receipts books, cash disbursement books, canceled checks and bank statements, workpapers, sales contracts, and purchase invoices. Descriptive material to explicate entries in the foregoing types of records, such as a chart of accounts or an accounting policy manual, is included in this category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Profit and loss statements. This category includes records from which the reporting corporation can compile and supply, within a reasonable time, material profit and loss statements of the reporting corporation and all related parties as defined in Sec. 1.6038A-1 (d) (the ``related party group'') that reflect profit or loss of the related party group attributable to U.S.-connected products or services as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(i) of this section. The determination of whether a profit and loss statement is material is made under the rules provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section. The material profit and loss statements described in this paragraph (c)(2)(ii) must reflect the consolidated revenue and expenses of all members of the related party group. Thus, records in this category include the documentation of the cost of raw materials used by a related party to manufacture finished goods that are then sold by another related party to the reporting corporation. The records should be kept under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles if they are ordinarily maintained in such manner; if not, an explanation of the material differences between the accounting principles used and U.S. generally accepted accounting principles must be

made available. The statements need not reflect tracing of the actual costs borne by the group with respect to its U.S.-connected products or services; rather, any reasonable method may be used to allocate the group's worldwide costs to the revenues generated by the sales of those products or services. An explanation of the methods used to allocate specific items to a particular profit and loss statement must be made available. The explanation of material differences between accounting principles and the explanation of allocation methods must be sufficient to permit a comparison of the profitability of the group to that of the reporting corporation attributable to the provision of U.S.-connected products or services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Pricing documents. This category includes all documents relevant to establishing the appropriate price or rate for transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related party. Examples include, but are not limited to, documents related to transactions involving the same or similar products or services entered into by the reporting corporation or a foreign related party with related and unrelated parties; shipping and export documents; commission agreements; documents relating to production or assembly facilities; third-party and intercompany purchase invoices; manuals, specifications, and similar documents relating to or describing the performance of functions conducted at particular locations; intercompany correspondence discussing any instructions or assistance relating to such transactions provided to the reporting corporations by the related foreign person (or vice versa); intercompany and intracompany correspondence concerning the price or the negotiation of the price used in such transactions; documents related to the value and ownership of intangibles used or developed by the reporting corporation or the foreign related party; documents related to cost of goods sold and other expenses; and documents related to direct and indirect selling, and general and administrative expenses (for example, relating to advertising, sales promotions, or warranties).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Foreign country and third party filings.

See Sec. 1.881-4 relating to conduit financing arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Material profit and loss statements. For purposes of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, the determination of whether a profit and loss statement is material will be made according to the following rules. An agreement between the reporting corporation and the District Director as described in paragraph (e) of this section may identify material profit and loss statements of the related party group and describe the items to be included in any profit and loss statements for which records are to be maintained to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section. In the absence of such an agreement, a profit and loss statement will be material if it meets any of the following tests: the existing records test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the significant industry segment test described in paragraph (c)(5) of this section, or the high profit test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Existing records test. A profit and loss statement is material under the existing records test described in this paragraph (c)(4) if any member of the related party group creates or compiles such statement in the course of its business operations and the statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the provision of U.S.-connected products or services (regardless of whether the profit and loss attributable to U.S.-connected products or services is shown separately or included within the calculation of aggregate figures on the statement). For example, a profit and loss statement is described in this paragraph if it was produced for internal accounting or management purposes, or for disclosure to shareholders, financial institutions, government agencies, or any other persons. Such existing statements and the records from which they were complied (to the extent such records relate to profit and loss attributable to U.S.-connected products or services) are subject to the record maintenance requirements described in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Significant industry segment test--(i) In general.

A profit and loss statement is material under the significant industry segment test described in this paragraph (c)(5) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services within a single industry segment (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The worldwide gross revenue attributable to such industry segment is 10 percent or more of the worldwide gross revenue attributable to the group's combined industry segments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The amount of gross revenue earned by the group from the provision of U.S.-connected products or services within such industry segment is $25 million or more in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Form of the statements. Profit and loss statements compiled for the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services in each significant industry segment must reflect revenues and expenses attributable to the operations in such segment by all members of the related party group. Statements may show each related party's revenues and expenses separately, or may be prepared in a consolidated format. Any reasonable method may be used to allocate the group's worldwide costs within the industry segment to the U.S.-connected products or services within that segment. An explanation of the methods used to prepare consolidated statements and to allocate specific items to a particular profit and loss statement must be made available, and the records from which the consolidations and allocations were prepared must be maintained.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special rule for component sales. Where the U.S.-connected products or services consist of components that are incorporated into other products or services before sale to customers, the

portion of the total gross revenue derived from sales of the finished products or services attributable to the components may be determined on the basis of relative costs of production. Thus, where relevant for determining whether the $25 million threshold in paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section has been met, the amount of gross revenue derived by the related party group from the provision of the finished products or services may be reduced by multiplying it by a fraction, the numerator of which is the costs of production of the related party group attributable to the component products or services that constitute U.S.-connected products or services and the denominator of which is the costs of production of the related party group attributable to the finished products in which such components are incorporated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Level of specificity required. In applying the significant industry segment test of this paragraph (c)(5), groups of related products and services must be chosen to provide a reasonable level of specificity that results in the greatest number of separate significant industry segments in comparison to other possible classifications. This determination must be made on the basis of the particular facts presented by the operations of the related party group. The following rules, however, provide general guidelines for making such classifications. First, the related party group's operations that involve the provision of U.S.-connected products should be grouped into product lines. The rules of this paragraph (c)(5) should then be applied to determine if any such product line would, standing alone, constitute a significant industry segment when compared to the related party group's operations as a whole. Any significant industry segments determined at the level of product lines should be further segregated, and tested for significant industry segments, at the level of separate products. Finally, any significant industry segments determined at the level of separate products should be segregated, and tested for significant industry segments, at the level of separate models. Similar principles should be applied in classifying and testing types of services. A profit and loss statement reflecting the related party group's provision of any product or service (or group of products or services as classified under these rules) that constitutes a significant industry segment will be considered material for purposes of this paragraph (c)(5). For definitions of the terms ``product'', ``related products or services'', ``model'', and ''product line'', see paragraph (c)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The rules for determining reasonable levels of specificity for significant industry segments may be illustrated by the following examples.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. A related party group is engaged in the manufacture and worldwide sales of automobiles and aftermarket parts. The group's operations within the categories of ``automobiles'' and ``aftermarket parts''. are each sufficient to constitute significant industry segments for the group under the rules of this paragraph (c)(5). No narrower classification of aftermarket parts results in any significant industry segments. Automobiles produced by the group are generally classified for marketing purposes by trade names; aggregating groups of automobiles by these trade names results in three significant industry segments, those for trade names A, B, and C. Finally, two car models sold under the trade name A (``A1'' and ``A2'') and one car model sold under the trade name B (``B3''), produce sufficient revenue to constitute significant industry segments. Such classifications into trade names and car models are generally used in the related party group's industry; moreover, different types of classifications would produce fewer significant industry segments. Accordingly, a reasonable level of specificity for this related party group's industry segments would be eight categories of products consisting of ``automobiles'', ``aftermarket parts'', ``A'', ``B'', ``C'', ``A1'', ``A2'', and ``B3''.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A related party group is engaged in manufacturing electronic goods that are distributed at retail in the United States by the reporting corporation. The group sells three types of products in the United States: televisions, radios, and video cassette recorders (VCRs). Each of these three broad product areas constitutes a significant industry segment for the group as a whole. VCRs can be further segregated by price into high-end and low-end models, and the provision of each constitutes a significant industry segment for the group. Revenues from only one VCR model, model number VCRX-10, are sufficiently large to make the provision of that model a significant industry segment. With respect to televisions, the group

normally accounts for these products by size. Using this classification, portable televisions, medium-sized televisions, and consoles each constitute significant industry segments. Narrower classifications by television model numbers result in no additional significant industry segments. Finally, a single radio product line, those sold under the trade name R, produces sufficient revenue to constitute a significant industry segment, but no other radio models or product groups are large enough to constitute a significant industry segment. In each case, these classifications conform to normal business practices in the industry and result in the greatest possible number of significant industry segments for this related party group. Accordingly, a reasonable level of specificity for this related party group's industry segments would include the ten categories consisting of ``VCRs'', ``high-end VCRs'', ``low-end VCRs'', ``model number VCRX-10'', ``televisions'', ``portable televisions'', ``medium-sized televisions'', ``console televisions'', ``radios'', and ``radio trade name R''.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> High profit test--(i) In general. A profit and loss statement is material under the high profit test described in this paragraph (c)(6) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. A profit and loss statement is material under the high profit test described in this paragraph (c)(6) if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The statement reflects the profit or loss of the related party group attributable to the group's provision of U.S.-connected products or services within a single industry segment (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(ii) of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The amount of gross revenue earned by the group from the provision of U.S.-connected products or services within such industry segment is $100 million or more in the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The return on assets test described in paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section is satisfied with respect to the products and services attributable to such segment.

Accordingly, a significant industry segment (as determined under paragraph (c)(5) of this section) must be divided into any narrower industry segments that meet the high profit test of this paragraph (c)(6), even if such narrower segments would not, standing alone, meet the significant industry segment test of paragraph (c)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Return on assets test. An industry segment meets the return on assets test if the rate of return on assets earned by the related party group on its worldwide operations within this industry segment exceeds 15 percent, and is at least 200 percent of the return on assets earned by the group in all industry segments combined. For purposes of this paragraph, the rate of return on assets earned by an industry segment is determined by dividing that segment's operating profit (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(v) of this section) by its identifiable assets (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iv) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Additional rules. The rules in paragraphs (c)(5)(ii) through (iv) of this section describing the application of the significant industry segment test shall apply in a similar manner for purposes of the high profit test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for purposes of paragraphs (c)(2)(ii), (c)(5), and (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> U.S.-connected products or services. The term U.S.-connected products or services means products or services that are imported to or exported from the United States by transfers between the reporting corporation and any of its foreign related parties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Industry segment. An industry segment is a segment of the related party group's combined operations that is engaged in providing a product or service or a group of related products or services (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(vii) of this section) primarily to customers that are not members of the related party group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Gross revenue of an industry segment. Gross revenue of an industry segment includes receipts (prior to reduction for cost of goods sold) both from sales to customers outside of the related party group and from sales or transfers to other industry segments within the related party group (but does not include sales or transfers between members of the related party group within the same industry segment). Interest from sources outside the related party group and interest earned on trade receivables between industry segments is included in gross revenue if the asset on which the interest is earned is included among the industry segment's identifiable assets, but interest earned on advances or loans to other industry segments is not included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Identifiable assets of an industry segment. The identifiable assets of an industry segment are those tangible and intangible assets of the related party group that are used by the industry segment, including assets that are used exclusively by that industry segment and an allocated portion of assets used jointly by two or more industry segments. The value of an identifiable asset may be determined using any reasonable method (such as book value or fair market value) applied consistently. Any allocation of assets among industry segments must be made on a reasonable basis, and a description of such basis must be provided. Assets of an industry segment that transfers products or services to another industry segment shall not be allocated to the receiving segment. Assets that represent part of the related party group's investment in an industry segment, such as goodwill, shall be included in the industry segment's identifiable assets. Assets maintained for general corporate purposes (that is, those not used in the operations of any industry segment) shall not be allocated to industry segments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Operating profit of an industry segment. The operating profit of an industry segment is its gross revenue (as defined in paragraph (c)(7)(iii) of this section) minus all operating expenses. None of the following shall be added or deducted in computing the operating profit of an industry segment: revenue earned at the corporate level and not derived from the operations of any industry segment; general corporate expenses; interest expense; domestic and foreign income taxes; and other extraordinary items not reflecting the ongoing business operations of the industry segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Product. The term product means an item of property (or combination of component parts) that is the result of a production process, is primarily sold to unrelated parties (or incorporated by the related party group into other products sold to unrelated parties), and performs a specific function.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Related products or services. The term related products or services means groupings of products and types of services that reflect reasonable accounting, marketing, or other business practices within the industries in which the related party group operates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Model. The term model means a classification of products that incorporate particular components, options, styles, and any other unique features resulting in product differentiation. Examples of models are electronic products that are sold or accounted for under a single model number and automobiles sold under a single model name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Product line. The term product line means a group of products that are aggregated into a single classification for accounting, marketing, or other business purposes. Examples of product lines are groups of products that perform similar functions; products that are marketed under the same trade names, brand names, or trademarks; and products that are related economically (that is, having similar rates of profitability, similar degrees of risk, and similar opportunities for growth).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> Example. The application of the rules for determining material profit and loss statements under paragraphs (c)(4) through (7) of this section is illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A multinational enterprise manufactures 50 different agricultural and chemical products that are sold through Subl, its wholly owned U.S. subsidiary, and other subsidiaries located in foreign countries. The parent company of the enterprise, P, is a foreign corporation. The corporations participating in the enterprise form a related party group, and Subl is a reporting corporation for purposes of section 6038A. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, an analysis of the group's worldwide profit attributable to its products sold in the U.S. is relevant for determining an arm's length consideration under section 482 for the transfers of goods between Subl and its foreign affiliates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Existing records test. For management purposes, the group prepares profit and loss statements that are segmented by sales in different geographic markets. One of these statements shows the combined worldwide profitability of the group. Another statement shows the profitability of the group attributable to its North American sales. Both of these profit and loss statements reflect aggregate figures that include sales to unrelated parties of products that have been transferred from P and other group members to Subl (that is, the group's ``U.S.-connected

products''). The two statements meet the existing records test described in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Significant industry segments. The group's worldwide gross revenue in all industry segments is $2 billion. An analysis of the group's 50 products demonstrates that they are reasonably grouped into eight industry segments (each of which earns roughly $250 million in worldwide gross revenue). Segments 1 through 6 relate to agricultural products and Segments 7 and 8 relate to other chemical products. More specific categories would result in groupings that generate less than 10 percent of the group's worldwide gross revenue (that is, less than $200 million each); these narrower categories would thus fail the gross revenue percentage test of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(B) of this section. The gross revenue in each of the eight segments from the sale to unrelated parties of U.S.-connected products is as follows: $180 million for Segment 1; $30 million for Segment 2; and less than $25 million for each of Segments 3 through 8. Under the $25 million threshold test of paragraph (c)(5)(i)(C) of this section, the group's significant industry segments are thus limited to Segments 1 and 2. In addition, the combined operations of the group related to agricultural products (encompassing Segments 1 through 6 on an aggregated basis), constitute a single significant industry segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> High profit test. One highly profitable product line within Segment 1, HPPL, accounts for $120 million gross revenue from Sub1's domestic sales of U.S.-connected products (and thus exceeds the $100 million gross revenue threshold in paragraph (c)(6)(i)(B) of this section). The return on the identifiable assets attributable to the HPPL product line is 85 percent, which is more than 15 percent and more than twice the return on assets earned by the group from its worldwide operations in its combined industry segments. The group's industry segment for HPPL thus meets the high profit test described in paragraph (c)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Material Profit and Loss Statements. The group's material profit and loss statements consist of statements for combined worldwide sales and North American sales (under the existing records test); Segment 1, Segment 2, and aggregated Segments 1-6 (under the significant industry segment test); and HPPL (under the high profit test). Under paragraph (c) of this section, Subl is required to retain the combined worldwide sales and North American sales profit and loss statements and to maintain sufficient records so that it can compile and supply upon request statements of the group's profitability from sales of its U.S.-connected products within Segment l, Segment 2, aggregated Segments 1-6, and HPPL. These records need not be in the possession of Subl and may be kept under the control of and produced by P or any third party. The statements for Segment l, Segment 2, aggregated Segments 1-6, and HPPL do not require tracing of actual costs to the U.S.-connected products; rather, these statements may be prepared by using any reasonable method to allocate a portion of the industry segment's overall operating costs to the sales of U.S.-connected products within that segment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Liability for certain partnership record maintenance. A reporting corporation to which transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under Sec. 1.6038A-1 (e)(2) is subject to the record maintenance requirements of this section to the extent of the transactions so attributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Agreements with the District Director--(1) In general. The District Director who has audit jurisdiction over the reporting corporation may negotiate and enter into an agreement with a reporting corporation that establishes the records the reporting corporation must maintain or cause another to maintain, how the records must be maintained, the period of retention for the records, and by whom the records must be maintained in order to satisfy the reporting corporation's obligations under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The District Director who has audit jurisdiction over the reporting corporation may negotiate and enter into an agreement with a reporting corporation that establishes the records the reporting corporation must maintain or cause another to maintain, how the records must be maintained, the period of retention for the records, and by whom the records must be maintained in order to satisfy the reporting corporation's obligations under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content of agreement--(i) In general. The agreement may include provisions relating to the authorization of agent requirement, the record maintenance requirement, and the production and translation time periods that vary the rules contained in these regulations under section 6038A. The District Director will generally require a reporting corporation to maintain only those records specified under the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that permit an adequate audit of the income tax return of the reporting corporation and to provide such authorizations of agent that permit adequate access to such records. In most instances, required record maintenance for a particular reporting corporation under a negotiated agreement will be less than the broad range of records described under the safe harbor provisions. Additionally, a provision specifying the effective date and the expiration date of the agreement that may vary the effective date of the regulations may be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The agreement may include provisions relating to the authorization of agent requirement, the record maintenance requirement, and the production and translation time periods that vary the rules contained in these regulations under section 6038A. The District Director will generally require a reporting corporation to maintain only those records specified under the safe harbor provisions of paragraph (c) of this section that permit an adequate audit of the income tax return of the reporting corporation and to provide such authorizations of agent that permit adequate access to such records. In most instances, required record maintenance for a particular reporting corporation under a negotiated agreement will be less than the broad range of records described under the safe harbor provisions. Additionally, a provision specifying the effective date and the expiration date of the agreement that may vary the effective date of the regulations may be included.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Significant industry segment test. A District Director may determine which

industry segment profit and loss statements are material for purposes of requiring the maintenance of records (under either paragraph (a)(1) of this section or the safe harbor described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section). The industry segments that the District Director determines are material need not be the industry segments that meet the significant industry segment test under paragraph (c)(5) of this section or the high profit test under paragraph (c)(6) of this section. For this purpose, a reporting corporation will be required to maintain only those records from which profit and loss statements for the related party group may be constructed with respect to industry segments identified by the District Director. To the extent that existing profit and loss statements are similar in scope and level of detail to statements for industry segments that would otherwise be described under the tests of paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section, the District Director shall accept the existing statements instead of the statements that would otherwise be required under paragraphs (c)(5) and (6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example. The District Director determines that RC, a reporting corporation that is a manufacturer of related chemical products, has two industry segments, Segment 1 and Segment 2. While both industry segments meet the significant industry segment test of paragraph (c)(5) of this section, Segment 1 has a relatively low volume of sales to foreign related parties. Additionally, Segment 1 consists of products that produce only a small profit margin because the product is generic and other companies also sell the product. The District Director enters into an agreement with RC that requires only records from which a profit and loss statement for the related party group can be constructed for Segment 2. Therefore, RC is not required to maintain records for Segment 1 from which a profit and loss statement for the related party group can be constructed. The other record maintenance requirements under this section apply, however.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Circumstances of agreement. The District Director generally will enter into an agreement under this paragraph (e) upon request by the reporting corporation when the District Director believes that the District has or can obtain sufficient knowledge of the business or industry of the reporting corporation to limit the record maintenance requirement to particular documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Agreement as part of APA process. An agreement with a reporting corporation under this paragraph (e) may be entered into as a part of the Advance Pricing Agreement (APA) process at any time during the APA process, insofar as the agreement relates to the subject matter of the APA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> U.S. maintenance--(1) General rule. Records that must be maintained under this section must be maintained within the United States, unless the conditions described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Records that must be maintained under this section must be maintained within the United States, unless the conditions described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Non-U.S. maintenance requirements. A reporting corporation may maintain outside the United States records not ordinarily maintained in the United States but required to be maintained in the United States under this section. However, the reporting corporation must either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Deliver to the Service the original documents (or duplicates) requested within 60 days of the request by the Service for such records and provide translations of such documents within 30 days of a request for translations of specific documents; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Move the original documents (or duplicates) requested to the United States within 60 days of the request of the Service for such records; provide the Service with an index to the requested records, the name and address of a custodian located within the United States having control over the records, and the address where the records are located within 60 days of the Service's request for the records; and continue to maintain the records within the United States throughout the period of retention described in paragraph (g) of this section. For summons procedures with respect to records that have been moved to the United States, see sections 6038A(e), 7602, 7603, and 7604.

With respect to any material profit and loss statements required to be created (either under paragraph (c) of this section or under an agreement with the District Director), unless otherwise

specified, ``120 days'' shall be substituted for ``60 days'' in this paragraph (f)(2), and labels and text with respect to such statements must be in the English language.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Prior taxable years. The non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in paragraph (f)(2) of this section apply to records located outside the United States that were in existence on or after March 20, 1990, without regard to the taxable year to which such records relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Scheduled production for high volume or other reasons. Upon a written request, for good cause shown, the District Director may grant an extension of the time for the production or translation of the requested documents. Such requests should be made within 30 days of the request for records by the Service. If an extension is needed because of the volume of records requested or the amount of translation requested, the District Director may allow production or translation to be scheduled over a period of time so that not all records need be produced or translated at the same time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Required U.S. maintenance. The District Director (with the concurrence of the Assistant Commissioner (International)), may require, for cause, the maintenance within the United States of any records specified in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. Such a requirement will be imposed only if there exists a clear pattern of failure to maintain or timely produce the required records. The assessment of a monetary penalty under section 6038A(d) and Sec. 1.6038A-4 for failure to maintain records is not necessarily sufficient to require the maintenance of records within the United States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Period of retention. Records required to be maintained by section 6038A(a) and this section shall be kept as long as they may be relevant or material to determining the correct tax treatment of any transaction between the reporting corporation and a related party, but in no case less than the applicable statute of limitations on assessment and collection with respect to the taxable year in which the transaction or item to which the records relate affects the U.S. tax liability of the reporting corporation.

If a reporting corporation fails to furnish the information described in Sec. 1.6038A-2 within the time and manner prescribed in Sec. 1.6038A-2(d), fails to maintain or cause another to maintain records as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, or (in the case of records maintained outside the United States) fails to meet the non-U.S. record maintenance requirements within the applicable time prescribed in Sec. 1.6038A-3(f), a penalty of $10,000 shall be assessed for each taxable year with respect to which such failure occurs. The filing of a substantially incomplete Form 5472 constitutes a failure to file Form 5472. Where, however, the information described in Sec. 1.6038A-2(b)(3) through (5) is not required to be reported, a Form 5472 filed without such information is not a substantially incomplete Form 5472.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for certain partnership transactions. A reporting corporation to which transactions engaged in by a partnership are attributed under Sec. 1.6038A-1(e)(2) is subject to the rules of this section to the extent failures

occur with respect to the partnership transactions so attributed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculation of monetary penalty. If a reporting corporation fails to maintain records as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3 of transactions with multiple related parties, the monetary penalty may be assessed for each failure to maintain records with respect to each related party. The monetary penalty, however, shall be imposed on a reporting corporation only once for a taxable year with respect to each related party for a failure to furnish the information required on Form 5472, for a failure to maintain or cause another to maintain records, or for a failure to comply with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in Sec. 1.6038A-3(f). An additional penalty for another failure may be imposed, however, under the rules of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. Thus, unless such failures continue after notification as described in paragraph (d) of this section, the maximum penalty under this paragraph with respect to each related party for all such failures in a taxable year is $10,000. The members of a group of corporations filing a consolidated return are jointly and severally liable for any monetary penalty that may be imposed under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reasonable cause--(1) In general. Certain failures may be excused for reasonable cause, including not timely filing Form 5472, not maintaining or causing another to maintain records as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, and not complying with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in Sec. 1.6038A-3(f). If an affirmative showing is made that the taxpayer acted in good faith and there is reasonable cause for a failure that results in the assessment of the monetary penalty, the period during which reasonable cause exists shall be treated as beginning on the day reasonable cause is established and ending not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for any such failure. Additionally, the beginning of the 90-day period after mailing of a notice by the District Director or the Director of an Internal Revenue Service Center of a failure described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be treated as not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Certain failures may be excused for reasonable cause, including not timely filing Form 5472, not maintaining or causing another to maintain records as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, and not complying with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements described in Sec. 1.6038A-3(f). If an affirmative showing is made that the taxpayer acted in good faith and there is reasonable cause for a failure that results in the assessment of the monetary penalty, the period during which reasonable cause exists shall be treated as beginning on the day reasonable cause is established and ending not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed for any such failure. Additionally, the beginning of the 90-day period after mailing of a notice by the District Director or the Director of an Internal Revenue Service Center of a failure described in paragraph (d) of this section shall be treated as not earlier than the last day on which reasonable cause existed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Affirmative showing required--(i) In general. To show that reasonable cause exists for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the reporting corporation must make an affirmative showing of all the facts alleged as reasonable cause for the failure in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury. The statement must be filed with the District Director (in the case of failure to maintain or furnish requested information permitted to be maintained outside the United States within the time required under Sec. 1.6038A-3(f) or a failure to file Form 5472) or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed (in the case of failure to file Form 5472). The District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed, as appropriate, shall determine whether the failure was due to reasonable cause, and if so, the period of time for which reasonable cause existed. If a return has been filed as required by Sec. 1.6038A-2 or records have been maintained as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, except for an omission of, or error with respect to, some of the information required or a record to be maintained, the omission or error shall not constitute a failure for purposes of section 6038A(d) if the reporting corporation that filed the return establishes to the satisfaction of the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center that it has substantially complied with the filing of Form 5472 or the requirement to maintain records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. To show that reasonable cause exists for purposes of paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the reporting corporation must make an affirmative showing of all the facts alleged as reasonable cause for the failure in a written statement containing a declaration that it is made under penalties of perjury. The statement must be filed with the District Director (in the case of failure to maintain or furnish requested information permitted to be maintained outside the United States within the time required under Sec. 1.6038A-3(f) or a failure to file Form 5472) or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed (in the case of failure to file Form 5472). The District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed, as appropriate, shall determine whether the failure was due to reasonable cause, and if so, the period of time for which reasonable cause existed. If a return has been filed as required by Sec. 1.6038A-2 or records have been maintained as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, except for an omission of, or error with respect to, some of the information required or a record to be maintained, the omission or error shall not constitute a failure for purposes of section 6038A(d) if the reporting corporation that filed the return establishes to the satisfaction of the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center that it has substantially complied with the filing of Form 5472 or the requirement to maintain records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Small corporations. The District Director shall apply the reasonable cause exception liberally in the case of a small corporation that had no knowledge of the requirements imposed by section 6038A; has limited presence in and contact with the United States; and promptly and fully complies with all requests by the District Director to file Form 5472, and to furnish books, records, or other materials relevant to the reportable transaction. A small corporation is a corporation whose gross receipts for a taxable year are $20,000,000 or less.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Facts and circumstances taken into account. The determination of whether

a taxpayer acted with reasonable cause and in good faith is made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all pertinent facts and circumstances. Circumstances that may indicate reasonable cause and good faith include an honest misunderstanding of fact or law that is reasonable in light of the experience and knowledge of the taxpayer. Isolated computational or transcriptional errors generally are not inconsistent with reasonable cause and good faith. Reliance upon an information return or on the advice of a professional (such as an attorney or accountant) does not necessarily demonstrate reasonable cause and good faith. Similarly, reasonable cause and good faith is not necessarily indicated by reliance on facts that, unknown to the taxpayer, are incorrect. Reliance on an information return, professional advice or other facts, however, constitutes reasonable cause and good faith if, under all the circumstances, the reliance was reasonable. A taxpayer, for example, may have reasonable cause for not filing a Form 5472 or for not maintaining records under section 6038A if the taxpayer has a reasonable belief that it is not owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder. A reasonable belief means that the taxpayer does not know or has no reason to know that it is owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder. For example, a reporting corporation would not know or have reason to know that it is owned by a 25-percent foreign shareholder if its belief that it is not so owned is consistent with other information reported or otherwise furnished to or known by the reporting corporation. A taxpayer may have reasonable cause for not treating a foreign corporation as a related party for purposes of section 6038A where the foreign corporation is a related party solely by reason of Sec. 1.6038A-1(d)(3) (under the principles of section 482), and the taxpayer had a reasonable belief that its relationship with the foreign corporation did not meet the standards for related parties under section 482.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Failure to maintain records or to cause another to maintain records. A failure to maintain records or to cause another to maintain records is determined by the District Director upon the basis of the reporting corporation's overall compliance (including compliance with the non-U.S. maintenance requirements under Sec. 1.6038A-3(f)(2)) with the record maintenance requirements. It is not an item-by-item determination. Thus, for example, a failure to maintain a single or small number of items may not constitute a failure for purposes of section 6038A(d), unless the item or items are essential to the correct determination of transactions between the reporting corporation and any foreign related parties. The District Director shall notify the reporting corporation in writing of any determination that it has failed to comply with the record maintenance requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Increase in penalty where failure continues after notification--(1) In general. If any failure described in this section continues for more than 90 days after the day on which the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed mails notice of the failure to the reporting corporation, the reporting corporation shall pay a penalty (in addition to the penalty described in paragraph (a) of this section) of $10,000 with respect to each related party for which a failure occurs for each 30-day period during which the failure continues after the expiration of the 90-day period. Any uncompleted fraction of a 30-day period shall count as a 30-day period for purposes of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. If any failure described in this section continues for more than 90 days after the day on which the District Director or the Director of the Internal Revenue Service Center where the Form 5472 is required to be filed mails notice of the failure to the reporting corporation, the reporting corporation shall pay a penalty (in addition to the penalty described in paragraph (a) of this section) of $10,000 with respect to each related party for which a failure occurs for each 30-day period during which the failure continues after the expiration of the 90-day period. Any uncompleted fraction of a 30-day period shall count as a 30-day period for purposes of this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional penalty for another failure. An additional penalty for a taxable year may be imposed, however, if at a time subsequent to the time of the imposition of the monetary penalty described in paragraph (a) of this section, a second failure is determined and the second failure continues after notification under paragraph (d)(1) of this section. Thus, if a taxpayer fails to file Form 5472 and is assessed a monetary penalty and later, upon audit, is determined to have failed to maintain records, an additional penalty for the failure to maintain records may be assessed under the rules of this paragraph if the failure to maintain records continues after notification under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cessation of accrual. The monetary penalty will cease to accrue if the reporting corporation either files Form 5472 (in the case of a failure to file Form 5472), furnishes information to substantially complete Form 5472, or demonstrates compliance with respect to the maintenance of records (in the case of a failure to maintain records) for the taxable year in which the examination occurs and subsequent years to the satisfaction of the District Director. The monetary penalty also will cease to accrue if requested information, documents, or records, kept outside the United States under the requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-3(f) and not produced within the time specified are produced or moved to the United States under the rules of paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Continued failures. If a failure under this section relating to a taxable year beginning before July 11, 1989 occurs, and if the failure continues following 90 days after the notice of failure under this paragraph is sent, the amount of the additional penalty to be assessed under this paragraph is $10,000 for each 30-day period beginning after November 5, 1990, during which the failure continues. There is no limitation on the amount of the monetary penalty that may be assessed after November 5, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Other penalties. For criminal penalties for failure to file a return and filing a false or fraudulent return, see sections 7203 and 7206 of the Code. For the penalty relating to an underpayment of tax, see section 6662.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Failure to file Form 5472. Corp X, a U.S. reporting corporation, engages in related party transactions with FC. Corp X does not timely file a Form 5472 or maintain records relating to the transactions with FC for Year 1 or subsequent years. The Service Center with which Corp X files its income tax return imposes a $10,000 penalty for each of Years 1, 2, and 3 under section 6038A (d) and this section for failure to provide information as required on Form 5472 and mails a notice of failure to provide inrormation. Corp X does not file Form 5472. Ninety days following the mailing of the notice of failure to Corp X an additional penaly of $10,000 is imposed. On the 135th day following the mailing of the notice of failure, Corp X files Form 5472 for Years 1, 2, and 3. The total penalty owed by Corp X for Year 1 is $30,000. ($10,000 for not timely filing Form 5472, $10,000 for the first 30-day period following the expiration of the 90-day period, and $10,000 for the fraction of the second 30-day period). The penalty for Years 2 and 3 for the failure to file Form 5472 is also $30,000 for each year, calculated in the same manner as for Year 1. The total penalty for failure to file Form 5472 for Years 1, 2, and 3 is $90,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Failure to maintain records. Assume the same facts as in Example 1. In Year 5, Corp X is audited for Years 1 through 3. Corp X has not been maintaining records relating to the transactions with FC. The District Director issues a notice of failure to maintain records. Corp X has already been subject to the monetary penalty of $10,000 for each of Years 1, 2, and 3 for failure to file Form 5472 and, therefore, a monetary penalty under paragraph (a) of this section for failure to maintain records is not assessed. However, an additional penalty is assessed after the 90th day following the mailing of the notice of failure to maintain records. Corp X develops a record maintenance system as required by section 6038A and Sec. 1.6038A-3. On the 180th day following the mailing of the notice of failure to maintain records, Corp X demonstrates to the satisfaction of the District Director that the newly developed record maintenance system will comply with the requirements of Sec. 1.6038A-3 and the increase in the monetary penalty after notification ceases to accrue. The additional penalty for failure to maintain records is $30,000. An additional penalty of $30,000 per year is assessed for each of years 2 and 3 for the failure to maintain records for a total of $90,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective dates.

Sec. 1.6038A-5  Authorization of agent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Failure to authorize. The rules of Sec. 1.6038A-7 shall apply to any transaction between a foreign related party and a reporting corporation (including any transaction engaged in by a partnership that is attributed to the reporting corporation under Sec. 1.6038A-1(e)(2)), unless the foreign related party authorizes (in the manner described in paragraph (b) of this section) the reporting corporation to act as its limited agent solely for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604 with respect to any request by the Service to examine records or produce testimony that may be relevant to the tax treatment of

such a transaction or with respect to any summons by the Service for such records or testimony. The fact that a reporting corporation is authorized to act as an agent for a foreign related party is to be disregarded for purposes of determining whether the foreign related party either has a trade or business in the United States for purposes of the Code or a permanent establishment or fixed base in the United States for purposes of an income tax treaty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Authorization by related party--(1) In general. Upon request by the Service, a foreign related party shall authorize as its agent (solely for purposes of sections 7602, 7603, and 7604) the reporting corporation with which it engages in transactions. The authorization must be signed by the foreign related party or an officer of the foreign related party possessing the authority to authorize an agent for purposes of Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The reporting corporation will accept this appointment by providing a statement to that effect, signed by an officer of the reporting corporation possessing the authority to accept such an appointment. The agency shall be effective at all times. For taxable years beginning after July 10, 1989, the authorization and acceptance must be provided to the Service within 30 days of a request by the Service to the reporting corporation for such an authorization.

In such a case, the common parent must attach a schedule to the authorization of agent stating which members of the group would otherwise be required to separately authorize the reporting corporation as agent.

The noncompliance rule of Sec. 1.6038A-7 shall apply to any transaction subsequent to that time with the same related party, unless the related party actually authorizes the reporting corporation to act as its agent under paragraph (a) of this section.

Sec. 1.6038A-6  Failure to furnish information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. The rules of Sec. 1.6038A-7 may be applied with respect to a transaction between a foreign related party and the reporting corporation (including any transaction engaged in by a partnership that is attributed to the reporting corporation under Sec. 1.6038A-

1(e)(2)) if a summons is issued to the reporting corporation to produce any records or testimony, either directly or as agent for such related party, to determine the correct treatment under title 1 of the Code of such a transaction between the reporting corporation and the related party; and if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)(i)</em> The summons is not quashed in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 6038A(e)(4) and is not determined to be invalid in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 7604 to enforce such summons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The summons is not quashed in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 6038A(e)(4) and is not determined to be invalid in a proceeding, if any, begun under section 7604 to enforce such summons; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The reporting corporation does not substantially and timely comply with the summons, and the District Director has sent by certified or registered mail a notice under section 6038A(e)(2)(C) to the reporting corporation that it has not so complied; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The reporting corporation fails to maintain or to cause another to maintain records as required by Sec. 1.6038A-3, and by reason of that failure, the summons is quashed in a proceeding under section 6038A(e)(4) or in a proceeding begun under section 7604 to enforce the summons, or the reporting corporation is not able to provide the records requested in the summons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Coordination with treaties. Where records of a related party are obtainable on a timely and efficient basis under information exchange procedures provided under a tax treaty or tax information exchange agreement (TIEA), the Service generally will make use of such procedures before issuing a summons. The absence or pendency of a treaty or TIEA request may not be asserted as grounds for refusing to comply with a summons or as a defense against the assertion of the noncompliance penalty adjustment under Sec. 1.6038A-7. For purposes of this paragraph, information is available on a timely and efficient basis if it can be obtained within 180 days of the request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Enforcement proceeding not required. The District Director is not required to begin an enforcement proceeding to enforce the summons in order to apply the rules of Sec. 1.6038A-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> De minimis failure. Where a reporting corporation's failure to comply with the requirement to furnish information under this section is de minimis, the District Director, in the exercise of discretion, may choose not to apply the noncompliance penalty. Thus, for example, in cases where a particular document or group of documents is not furnished upon request or summons, the District Director (in the District Director's sole discretion), may choose not to apply the noncompliance penalty if the District Director deems the document or documents not to have significant or sufficient value in the determination of the correctness of the tax treatment of the related party transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Suspension of statute of limitations. If the reporting corporation brings an action under section 6038A(e)(4)(A) (proceeding to quash) or (e)(4)(B) (review of secretarial determination of noncompliance), the running of any period of limitation under section 6501 (relating to assessment and collection of tax) or under section 6531 (relating to criminal prosecutions) for the taxable year or years to which the summons that is the subject of such proceeding relates shall be suspended for the period during which such proceeding, and appeals therein, are pending. In no event shall any such period expire before the 90th day after the day on which there is a final determination in such proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective dates.

In such a case--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The amount of the deduction allowed under subtitle A for any amount paid or incurred by the reporting corporation to the related party in connection with such transaction, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The cost to the reporting corporation of any property acquired in such transaction from the related party or transferred by such corporation in such transaction to the related party, may be determined by the District Director.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of the amount. The amount of the deduction or the cost to the reporting corporation shall be the amount determined by the District Director (in the District Director's sole

discretion) from the District Director's own knowledge or from such information as the District Director may choose to obtain through testimony or otherwise. The District Director shall consider any information or materials that have been submitted by the reporting corporation or a foreign related party. The District Director, however, may disregard any information, documents, or records submitted by the reporting corporation or the related party if (in the District Director's sole discretion) the District Director deems that they are insufficiently probative of the relevant facts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Separate application. If the noncompliance penalty of this section applies with respect to transactions with a related party of the reporting corporation, it will not be applied with respect to any other related parties of the reporting corporation solely upon the basis of that failure. Thus, for example, if a reporting corporation engages in transactions with related party A and related party B, and the reporting corporation does not respond to a summons for records related to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party A, the noncompliance penalty imposed as a result of such failure will not apply to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party B. If a separate summons is issued for records relating to the transactions between the reporting corporation and related party B and the reporting corporation does not produce such records, the noncompliance penalty may be applied to those transactions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective dates.

However, see paragraph (f)(3) of this section for certain relief that may be available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Satisfaction of section 6038B reporting if a gain recognition agreement is timely filed.

Paragraph (c)(6)(ii) of this section establishes the time and manner for the U.S. transferor to elect to apply the provisions of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c). Paragraph (c)(6)(iii) of this section establishes the manner for the U.S. transferor to satisfy the requirement of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(4).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

See Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(5)(ii) for the statement required to be filed by a control group member (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(1)) or final distributee (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The name and taxpayer identification number (if any) of each control group member and final distributee (if any), the foreign acquiring corporation, and in the case of a triangular reorganization (within the meaning of Sec. 1.358-6(b)(2)) the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation, and the ownership interest percentage (as defined in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(7)) in the U.S. transferor of each control group member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A calculation of the gain recognized (if any) by the U.S. transferor under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(2)(i) and (c)(2)(ii), and the basis adjustments (if any) required to be made by each control group member under Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The date on which the U.S. transferor and each control group member or final distributee entered into the written agreement described in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(5)(iv).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The amount of any deductible liability (as defined by Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(2)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The fair market value (as defined by Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(3)) of property transferred to the foreign acquiring corporation in the section 361 exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The inside basis (as defined by Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(4)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> The inside gain (as defined by Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(5)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(H)</em> The section 367(a) percentage (as defined by Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(9)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Agreement to amend U.S. transferor's tax return. The U.S. transferor complies with the requirement of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(4)(i) by attaching a statement to its timely filed return (within the meaning of Sec. 1.367(a)-7(f)(12)) for the taxable year in which the reorganization occurs, entitled ``STATEMENT UNDER Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)(4) FOR TRANSFERS OF ASSETS TO A FOREIGN CORPORATION IN A SECTION 361 EXCHANGE.'' The statement must certify that if a significant amount of the section 367(a) property received by the foreign acquiring corporation from the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange is disposed of, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions described in paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(B) of this section occurring within the sixty (60) month period that begins on the date of distribution or transfer (within the meaning of Sec. 1.381(b)-1(b)), then the exception provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c) will not apply to the section 361 exchange. Accordingly, the U.S. transferor will recognize the gain realized but not recognized in the section 361 exchange, computed as if the exception provided in Sec. 1.367(a)-7(c)

had never applied. A U.S. income tax return (or amended U.S. income tax return, as the case may be) for the year in which the reorganization occurred reporting the gain must be filed. If the section 361 exchange occurs in connection with a triangular reorganization (within the meaning of Sec. 1.358-6(b)(2)) and the corporation that controls the foreign acquiring corporation is foreign, an indirect disposition of the section 367(a) property includes the disposition by such controlling foreign corporation of the stock of the foreign acquiring corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Disposition of a significant amount--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (c)(6)(iii)(A)(2) and (c)(6)(iii)(A)(3) of this section, for purposes of this paragraph (c)(6)(iii), a disposition of a significant amount occurs if, in one or more related transactions, the foreign acquiring corporation disposes of an amount of the section 367(a) property received from the U.S. transferor in the section 361 exchange that is greater than 40 percent of the fair market value of all of the section 367(a) property transferred in the section 361 exchange.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exception for certain nonrecognition exchanges. Section 367(a) property that is subsequently transferred (retransferred property) pursuant to a nonrecognition provision is not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section, provided such transfer satisfies, and is treated in a manner consistent with the principles underlying Sec. 1.367(a)-8(k). Thus, for example, if section 367(a) property is subsequently transferred to a foreign corporation in exchange solely for stock in a transaction described in section 351, such retransferred property is not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section; in such a case, however, a subsequent disposition of either the retransferred property by the transferee foreign corporation, or of the stock of the transferee foreign corporation received in exchange for the retransferred property, is subject to the provisions of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exception for dispositions occurring in the ordinary course of business. Dispositions of section 367(a) property described in section 1221(a)(2) occurring in the ordinary course of business of the foreign acquiring corporation are not treated as disposed of for purposes of paragraph (c)(6)(iii)(A)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Gain recognition transaction--(1) General rule.

A United States person that transfers property to a foreign partnership in a contribution described in section 721 (including section 721(b)) must report that transfer on Form 8865 ``Information Return of U.S. Persons With Respect to Certain Foreign Partnerships'' pursuant to section 6038B and the rules of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Immediately after the transfer, the United States person owns, directly, indirectly, or by attribution, at least a 10-percent interest in the partnership, as defined in section 6038(e)(3)(C) and the regulations thereunder; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The value of the property transferred, when added to the value of any other property transferred in a section 721 contribution by such person (or any related person) to such partnership during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, exceeds $100,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Indirect transfer through a domestic partnership--For purposes of this section, if a domestic partnership transfers property to a foreign partnership in a section 721 transaction, the domestic partnership's partners shall be considered to have transferred a proportionate share of the property to the foreign partnership. However, if the domestic partnership properly reports all of the information required under this section with respect to the contribution, no partner of the transferor partnership, whether direct or indirect (through tiers of partnerships), is also required to report under this section. For illustrations of this rule, see Examples 4 and 5 of paragraph (a)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Indirect transfer through a foreign partnership. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Requirement to report dispositions--(i) In general. If a United States person was required to report a transfer to a foreign partnership of appreciated property under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and the foreign partnership disposes of the property while such United States person remains a direct or indirect partner, that United States person must report the disposition by filing Form 8865. The form must be attached to, and filed by the due date (including extensions) of, the United States person's income tax return for the year in which the disposition occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. If a United States person was required to report a transfer to a foreign partnership of appreciated property under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, and the foreign partnership disposes of the property while such United States person remains a direct or indirect partner, that United States person must report the disposition by filing Form 8865. The form must be attached to, and filed by the due date (including extensions) of, the United States person's income tax return for the year in which the disposition occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disposition of contributed property in nonrecognition transaction. If a foreign partnership disposes of contributed appreciated property in a nonrecognition transaction and substituted basis property is received in exchange, and the substituted basis property has built-in gain under Sec. 1.704-3(a)(8), the original transferor is not required to report the disposition. However, the transferor must report the disposition of the substituted basis property in the same manner as provided for the contributed property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Time for filing Form 8865. The Form 8865 on which a transfer is reported must be attached to the transferor's timely filed (including extensions) income tax return for the tax year that includes the date of the transfer. If the person required to report under this section is not required to file an income tax return for its tax year during which the transfer occurred, but is required to file an information return for that year (for example, Form 1065, ``U.S. Partnership Return of Income,'' or Form 990, ``Return of Organization Exempt from Income Tax''), the person should attach the Form 8865 to its information return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Returns to be made--(i) Separate returns for each partnership. If a United States person transfers property reportable under this section to more than one foreign partnership in a taxable year, the United States person

must submit a separate Form 8865 for each partnership.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Duplicate form to be filed. If required by the instructions accompanying Form 8865, a duplicate Form 8865 (including attachments and schedules) must also be filed by the due date for submitting the original Form 8865 under paragraph (a)(5)(i) or (ii) of this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Examples. The application of this paragraph (a) may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On November 1, 2001, US, a United States person that uses the calendar year as its taxable year, contributes $200,000 to FP, a foreign partnership, in a transaction subject to section 721. After the contribution, US owns a 5% interest in FP. US must report the contribution by filing Form 8865 for its taxable year ending December 31, 2001. On March 1, 2002, US makes a $40,000 section 721 contribution to FP, after which US owns a 6% interest in FP. US must report the $40,000 contribution by filing Form 8865 for its taxable year ending December 31, 2002, because the contribution, when added to the value of the other property contributed by US to FP during the 12-month period ending on the date of the transfer, exceeds $100,000.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. F, a nonresident alien, is the brother of US, a United States person. F owns a 15% interest in FP, a foreign partnership. US contributes $99,000 to FP, in exchange for a 1-percent partnership interest. Under sections 6038(e)(3)(C) and 267(c)(2), US is considered to own at least a 10-percent interest in FP and, therefore, US must report the $99,000 contribution under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. US, a United States person, owns 40 percent of FC, a foreign corporation. FC owns a 20-percent interest in FP, a foreign partnership. Under section 267(c)(1), US is considered to own 8 percent of FP due to its ownership of FC. US contributes $50,000 to FP in exchange for a 5-percent partnership interest. Immediately after the contribution, US is considered to own at least a 10-percent interest in FP and, therefore, must report the $50,000 contribution under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. US, a United States person, owns a 60-percent interest in USP, a domestic partnership. On March 1, 2001, USP contributes $200,000 to FP, a foreign partnership, in exchange for a 5-percent partnership interest. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, US is considered as having contributed $120,000 to FP ($200,000 x 60%). However, under paragraph (a)(2), if USP properly reports the contribution to FP, US is not required to report its $120,000 contribution. If US directly contributes $5,000 to FP on June 10, 2001, US must report the $5,000 contribution because US is considered to have contributed more than $100,000 to FP in the 12-month period ending on the date of the $5,000 contribution.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. US, a United States person, owns an 80-percent interest in USP, a domestic partnership. USP owns an 80-percent interest in USP1, a domestic partnership. On March 1, 2001, USP1 contributes $200,000 to FP, a foreign partnership, in exchange for a 3-percent partnership interest. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, USP is considered to have contributed $160,000 ($200,000 x 80%) to FP. US is considered to have contributed $128,000 to FP ($200,000 x 80% x 80%). However, if USP1 reports the transfer of the $200,000 to FP, neither US nor USP are required to report under this section the amounts they are considered to have contributed. Additionally, regardless of whether USP1 reports the $200,000 contribution, if USP reports the $160,000 contribution it is considered to have made, US does not have to report under this section the $128,000 contribution US is considered to have made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transfers by trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans. Trusts relating to state and local government employee retirement plans are not required to report transfers under this section, unless otherwise specified in the instructions to Form 8865.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information required with respect to transfers of property. With respect to transfers required to be reported under paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this section, the return must contain information in such form or manner as Form 8865 (and its accompanying instructions) prescribes with respect to reportable events, including--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name, address, and U.S. taxpayer identification number of the United States person making the transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The name, U.S. taxpayer identification number (if any), and address of the transferee foreign partnership, and the type of entity and country under whose laws the partnership was created or organized;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A general description of the transfer, and of any wider transaction of which it forms a part, including the date of transfer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The names and addresses of the other partners in the foreign partnership, unless the transfer is solely of cash and the transferor holds less than a ten-percent interest in the transferee foreign partnership immediately after the transfer. However, for tax years of

U.S. persons beginning on or after January 1, 2000, the person reporting pursuant to section 6038B (the transferor) must provide the names and addresses of each United States person that owned a ten-percent or greater direct interest in the foreign partnership during the transferor's tax year in which the transfer occurred, and the names and addresses of any other United States or foreign persons that were direct partners in the foreign partnership during that tax year and that were related to the transferor during that tax year.

The reporting requirements of this section will not apply to any United States person in respect of an eligible partnership as described in Sec. 1.761-2(a), if such partnership has validly elected to be excluded from all of the provisions of subchapter K of chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code in the manner specified in Sec. 1.761-2(b)(2)(i).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Election to be wholly excluded.
