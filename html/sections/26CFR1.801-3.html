                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">For purposes of part I, subchapter L, chapter 1 of the Code, this  section defines the following terms, which are to be used in determining  if a taxpayer is a life insurance company (as defined in section 801(a)  and paragraph (b) of this section):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insurance company. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term insurance company means a  company whose primary and predominant business activity during the  taxable year is the issuing of insurance or annuity contracts or the  reinsuring of risks underwritten by insurance companies. Thus, though  its name, charter powers, and subjection to State insurance laws are  significant in determining the business which a company is authorized  and intends to carry on, it is the character of the business actually  done in the taxable year which determines whether a company is taxable  as an insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(B)</em> (as in effect for such years), formed for the  purpose of relieving sick and aged members and the dependents of  deceased members, is an insurance company, whether the fund for such  purpose is created wholly by membership dues or partly by contributions  from the employer. A corporation which merely sets aside a fund for the  insurance of its employees is not an insurance company, and the income  from such fund shall be included in the return of the corporation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Life insurance company. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term life insurance company, as  used in subtitle A of the Code, is defined in section 801(a). For the  purpose of determining whether a company is a ``life insurance company''  within the meaning of that term as used in section 801(a), it must first  be determined whether the company is taxable as an insurance company (as  defined in paragraph (a) of this section). An insurance company shall be  taxed as a life insurance company if it is engaged in the business of  issuing life insurance and annuity contracts (either separately or  combined with health and accident insurance), or noncancellable  contracts of health and accident insurance, and its life insurance  reserves (as defined in section 801(b) and Sec. 1.801-4), plus unearned  premiums, and unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained), on  noncancellable life, health, or accident policies not included in life  insurance reserves, comprise more than 50 percent of its total reserves  (as defined in section 801(c) and Sec. 1.801-5). For purposes of  determining whether it satisfies the percentage requirements of the  preceding sentence, a company shall first make any adjustments to life  insurance reserves and total reserves required by section 806(a)  (relating to adjustments for certain changes in reserves and assets) and  then as required by section 801(d) (relating to adjustments in reserves  for policy loans). For examples of the adjustments required under  section 806(a), see paragraph (b)(4) of Sec. 1.806-3. For an example of  the adjustments required under section 801(d), see paragraph (c) of  Sec. 1.801-6. Furthermore, if an insurance company which computes its  life insurance reserves on a preliminary term basis elects to revalue  such reserves on a net level premium basis under section 818(c), such  revalued basis shall be disregarded for purposes of section 801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An insurance company writing only noncancellable life, health,  or accident policies and having no ``life insurance reserves'' may  qualify as a life insurance company if its unearned premiums, and unpaid  losses (whether or not ascertained), on such policies comprise more than  50 percent of its total reserves.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Section 801(f) provides that a burial or funeral benefit  insurance company engaged directly in the manufacture of funeral  supplies or the performance of funeral services shall not be taxable  under section 802 but shall be taxable under section 821 or section 831  as an insurance company other than life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Noncancellable life, health, or accident insurance policy. The  term noncancellable life, health, or accident insurance policy means a  health and accident contract, or a health and accident   contract combined with a life insurance or annuity contract, which the  insurance company is under an obligation to renew or continue at a  specified premium and with respect to which a reserve in addition to the  unearned premiums (as defined in paragraph (e) of this section) must be  carried to cover that obligation. Such a health and accident contract  shall be considered noncancellable even though it states a termination  date at a stipulated age, if, with respect to the health and accident  contract, such age termination date is 60 or over. Such a contract,  however, shall not be considered to be noncancellable after the age  termination date stipulated in the contract has passed. However, if the  age termination date stipulated in the contract occurs during the period  covered by a premium received by the life insurance company prior to  such date, and the company cannot cancel or modify the contract during  such period, the age termination date shall be deemed to occur at the  expiration of the period for which the premium has been received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident insurance  policy. The term guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident  insurance policy means a health and accident contract, or a health and  accident contract combined with a life insurance or annuity contract,  which is not cancellable by the company but under which the company  reserves the right to adjust premium rates by classes in accordance with  its experience under the type of policy involved, and with respect to  which a reserve in addition to the unearned premiums (as defined in  paragraph (e) of this section) must be carried to cover that obligation.  Section 801(e) provides that such policies shall be treated in the same  manner as noncancellable life, health, and accident insurance policies.  For example, the age termination date requirements applicable to  noncancellable health and accident insurance policies shall also apply  to guaranteed renewable life, health, and accident insurance policies.  See paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Unearned premiums. The term unearned premiums means those  amounts which shall cover the cost of carrying the insurance risk for  the period for which the premiums have been paid in advance. Such term  includes all unearned premiums, whether or not required by law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Life insurance reserves. For the definition of the term ``life  insurance reserves'', see section 801(b) and Sec. 1.801-4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Unpaid losses (whether or not ascertained). The term unpaid  losses (whether or not ascertained) means a reasonable estimate of the  amount of the losses (based upon the facts in each case and the  company's experience with similar cases):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reported and ascertained by the end of the taxable year but  where the amount of the loss has not been paid by the end of the taxable  year,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reported by the end of the taxable year but where the amount  thereof has not been either ascertained or paid by the end of the  taxable year, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Which have occurred by the end of the taxable year but which  have not been reported or paid by the end of the taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Total reserves. For the definition of the term total reserves,  see section 801(c) and Sec. 1.801-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Amount of reserves. For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and  (c) of section 801 and this section, section 801(b)(5) provides that the  amount of any reserve (or portion thereof) for any taxable year shall be  the mean of such reserve (or portion thereof) at the beginning and end  of the taxable year.
