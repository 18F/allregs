                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the case of a design-build project, right-of-way must be acquired and cleared in accordance with the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policies Act of 1970, as amended, and STD right-of-way procedures. The STD shall submit a right-of-way certification in accordance with 23 CFR 635.309(p) when requesting FHWA's authorization. If the right-of-way services are included in the Request for Proposal document, the STD shall ensure that right-of-way is available prior to the start of physical construction on individual properties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The decision to advance a right-of-way segment to the construction stage shall not impair the safety or in anyway be coercive in the context of 49 CFR 24.102(h) with respect to unacquired or occupied properties on the same or adjacent segments of project right-of-way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Certain right-of-way acquisition and clearance services may be incorporated into the design-build contract if allowed under State law. The contract may include language that provides that construction will not commence until all property is acquired and relocations have been completed; or, the construction could be phased or segmented to allow right-of-way activities to be completed on individual properties or a group of properties, thereby allowing certification in a manner satisfactory to the STD for each phase or segment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the STD elects to include right-of-way services in the design-build contract, the following provisions must be addressed in the request for proposals document:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The design-builder must submit written acquisition and relocation procedures to the STD for approval prior to commencing right-of-way activities. These procedures should contain a prioritized appraisal, acquisition, and relocation strategy as well as check points for STD approval, such as approval of just compensation, replacement housing payment calculations, replacement housing payment and moving cost claims, appraisals, administrative and stipulated settlements that exceed determined thresholds based on a risk management analysis, etc. STD's which have an FHWA approved procedures manual, in accordance with 23 CFR 710.201(c), may comply with this section by requiring the design-builder to execute a certification in its proposal that it has received the approved right-of-way manual and will comply with the procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The design-builder must submit written acquisition and relocation procedures to the STD for approval prior to commencing right-of-way activities. These procedures should contain a prioritized appraisal, acquisition, and relocation strategy as well as check points for STD approval, such as approval of just compensation, replacement housing payment calculations, replacement housing payment and moving cost claims, appraisals, administrative and stipulated settlements that exceed determined thresholds based on a risk management analysis, etc. STD's which have an FHWA approved procedures manual, in accordance with 23 CFR 710.201(c), may comply with this section by requiring the design-builder to execute a certification in its proposal that it has received the approved right-of-way manual and will comply with the procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The written relocation plan must provide reasonable time frames for the orderly relocation of residents and businesses on the project as provided at 49 CFR 24.205. It should be understood that these time frames will be based on best estimates of the time it will take to acquire the right-of-way and relocate families in accordance with certain legal requirements and time frames which may not be violated. Accordingly, the time frames estimated for right-of-way acquisition will not be compressed in the event other necessary actions preceding right-of-way acquisition miss their assigned due dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> The design-builder must establish a project tracking system and quality control system. This system must show the appraisal, acquisition and relocation status of all parcels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The design-builder must establish a project tracking system and quality control system. This system must show the appraisal, acquisition and relocation status of all parcels.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The quality control system may be administered by an independent consultant with the necessary expertise in appraisal, acquisition and relocation policies and procedures, who can make periodic reviews and reports to the design-builder and the STD.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The STD may consider the establishment of a hold off zone around all occupied properties to ensure compliance with right-of-way procedures prior to starting construction activities in affected areas. The limits of this zone should be established by the STD prior to the design-builder entering on the property. There should be no construction related activity within the hold off zone until the property is vacated. The design-builder must have written notification of vacancy from the right-of-way quality control consultant or STD prior to entering the hold off zone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adequate access shall be provided to all occupied properties to insure emergency and personal vehicle access.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Utility service must be available to all occupied properties at all times prior to and until relocation is completed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Open burning should not occur within 305 meters (1,000 feet) of an occupied dwelling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The STD will provide a right-of-way project manager who will serve as the first point of contact for all right-of-way issues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the STD elects to perform all right-of-way services relating to the design-build contract, the provisions in Sec. 710.311 will apply. The STD will notify potential offerors of the status of all right-of-way issues in the request for proposal document.
