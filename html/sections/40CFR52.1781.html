                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as outlined in the three-year variance for the coal-fired units of Duke Power Company and Carolina Power & Light Company from

the particulate emission limits of Regulation 15 N.C.A.C. 2D.0503, with submittals on June 18, September 7, October 31, and December 14, 1979, by the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development, is disapproved only insofar that it provides an exemption for excess emissions during periods of startup, shutdown, and verified malfunction. (See Sec. 52.1770(c)(22).)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in regulation 15 NCAC 2D.0536, which was submitted on January 24 and February 21, 1983, and on December 17, 1985, and became effective on August 1, 1987, is disapproved insofar as it provides annual opacity limits for the seven plants of Duke Power Company and for Plants Roxboro and Cape Fear of Carolina Power and Light Company.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The plan's control strategy for particulate matter as contained in revisions to 15 NCAC 2D.0536 submitted on January 24, 1983, February 21, 1983, and December 17, 1985, is disapproved as it applies to the Carolina Power and Light Asheville, Lee, Sutton and Weatherspoon Plants. These plants will continue to be subject to the particulate limits of 15 NCAC 2D.0503, contained in the original SIP, submitted to EPA on January 27, 1972, and approved on May 31, 1982 at 47 FR 10884.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In letters dated February 4, 1987, and June 15, 1987, the North Carolina Department of Natural Resources and Community Development certified that no emission limits in the State's plan are based on dispersion techniques not permitted by EPA's stack height rules.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of January 4, 2010, the Greensboro-Winston-Salem-High Point, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of Attaining Data. EPA has determined, as of January 5, 2010, the Hickory-Morganton-Lenoir, North Carolina, nonattainment area has attaining data for the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS. This determination, in accordance with 40 CFR 51.1004(c), suspends the requirements for this area to submit an attainment demonstration, associated reasonably available control measures, a reasonable further progress plan, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment of the standard for as long as this area continues to meet the 1997 PM2.5 NAAQS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Disapproval. EPA is disapproving portions of North Carolina's Infrastructure SIP for the 2006 24-hour PM2.5 NAAQS addressing interstate transport, specifically with respect to section 110(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> North Carolina submitted a control strategy plan for particulate matter entitled, ``An Act to Improve Air Quality in the State by Imposing Limits on the Emission of Certain Pollutants from Certain Facilities that Burn Coal to Generate Electricity and to Provide for Recovery by Electric Utilities of the Costs of Achieving Compliance with Those Limits.'' The State expects the resulting emission reductions of nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxide from this control plan will serve as a significant step towards meeting the 1997 PM2.5 and 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS), among other NAAQS, improving visibility in the mountains and other scenic vistas, and reducing acid rain. The specific approved provisions, submitted on August 21, 2009, are paragraphs (a) through (e) of Section 1 of Session Law 2002-4, Senate Bill 1078 enacted and state effective on June 20, 2002. This approval does not include paragraphs (f) through (j) of Section 1 of Senate Bill 1078 nor any of Section 2 of Senate Bill 1078.
