                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Posting of surety bonds--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Extension agreements; consent of  surety; collateral security. All surety bonds posted in immigration  cases shall be executed on Form I-352, Immigration Bond, a copy of  which, and any rider attached thereto, shall be furnished the obligor. A  district director is authorized to approve a bond, a formal agreement to  extension of liability of surety, a request for delivery of collateral  security to a duly appointed and undischarged administrator or executor  of the estate of a deceased depositor, and a power of attorney executed  on Form I-312, Designation of Attorney in Fact. All other matters  relating to bonds, including a power of attorney not executed on Form I- 312 and a request for delivery of collateral security to other than the  depositor or his or her approved attorney in fact, shall be forwarded to  the regional director for approval.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Bond riders--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> General. Bond riders shall be prepared on Form  I-351, Bond Riders, and attached to Form I-352. If a condition to be  included in a bond is not on Form I-351, a rider containing the  condition shall be executed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceptable sureties. Either a company holding a certificate from  the Secretary of the Treasury under 6 U.S.C. 6-13 as an acceptable  surety on Federal bonds, or a surety who deposits cash or U.S. bonds or  notes of the class described in 6 U.S.C. 15 and Treasury Department  regulations issued pursuant thereto and which are not redeemable within  1 year from the date they are offered for deposit is an acceptable  surety.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Cancellation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Public charge bonds. A public charge bond  posted for an immigrant shall be cancelled when the alien dies, departs  permanently   from the United States or is naturalized, provided the immigrant did not  become a public charge prior to death, departure, or naturalization. The  district director may cancel a public charge bond at any time if he/she  finds that the immigrant is not likely to become a public charge. A bond  may also be cancelled in order to allow substitution of another bond. A  public charge bond shall be cancelled by the district director upon  review following the fifth anniversity of the admission of the  immigrant, provided that the alien has filed Form I-356, Request for  Cancellation of Public Charge Bond, and the district director finds that  the immigrant did not become a public charge prior to the fifth  anniversary. If Form I-356 is not filed, the bond shall remain in effect  until the form is filed and the district director reviews the evidence  supporting the form and renders a decision to breach or cancel the bond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintenance of status and departure bonds. When the status of a  nonimmigrant who has violated the conditions of his admission has been  adjusted as a result of administrative or legislative action to that of  a permanent resident retroactively to a date prior to the violation, any  outstanding maintenance of status and departure bond shall be canceled.  If an application for adjustment of status is made by a nonimmigrant  while he is in lawful temporary status, the bond shall be canceled if  his status is adjusted to that of a lawful permanent resident or if he  voluntarily departs within any period granted to him. As used in this  paragraph, the term lawful temporary status means that there must not  have been a violation of any of the conditions of the alien's  nonimmigrant classification by acceptance of unauthorized employment or  otherwise during the time he has been accorded such classification, and  that from the date of admission to the date of departure or adjustment  of status he must have had uninterrupted Service approval of his  presence in the United States in the form of regular extensions of stay  or dates set by which departure is to occur, or a combination of both.  An alien admitted as a nonimmigrant shall not be regarded as having  violated his nonimmigrant status by engaging in employment subsequent to  his proper filing of an application for adjustment of status under  section 245 of the Act and part 245 of this chapter. A maintenance of  status and departure bond posted at the request of an American consular  officer abroad in behalf of an alien who did not travel to the United  States shall be canceled upon receipt of notice from an American  consular officer that the alien is outside the United States and the  nonimmigrant visa issued pursuant to the posting of the bond has been  canceled or has expired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Substantial performance. Substantial performance of all  conditions imposed by the terms of a bond shall release the obligor from  liability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Bond schedules--(1) Blanketbonds for departure of visitors and  transits. The amount of bond required for various numbers of  nonimmigrant visitors or transits admitted under bond on Forms I-352  shall be in accordance with the following schedule:</p><p class="depth0">Aliens  1 to 4--$500 each. 5 to 9--$2,500 total bond. 10 to 24--$3,500 total bond. 25 to 49--$5,000 total bond. 50 to 74--$6,000 total bond. 75 to 99--$7,000 total bond. 100 to 124--$8,000 total bond. 125 to 149--$9,000 total bond. 150 to 199--$10,000 total bond. 200 or more--$10,000 plus $50 for each alien over 200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Blanket bonds for importation of workers classified as  nonimmigrants under section 101(a)(15)(H). The following schedule shall  be employed by district directors when requiring employers or their  agents or representatives to post bond as a condition to importing alien  laborers into the United States from the West Indies, the British Virgin  Islands, or from Canada:  Less than 500 workers--$15 each 500 to 1,000 workers--$10 each 1,000 or more workers--$5 each   A bond shall not be posted for less than $1,000 or for more than $12,000  irrespective of the number of workers involved. Failure to comply with  conditions of the bond will result in the employer's   liability in the amount of $200 as liquidated damages for each alien  involved.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Breach of bond. A bond is breached when there has been a  substantial violation of the stipulated conditions. A final  determination that a bond has been breached creates a claim in favor of  the United States which may not be released or discharged by a Service  officer. The district director having custody of the file containing the  immigration bond executed on Form I-352 shall determine whether the bond  shall be declared breached or cancelled, and shall notify the obligor on  Form I-323 or Form I-391 of the decision, and, if declared breached, of  the reasons therefor, and of the right to appeal in accordance with the  provisions of this part.
