Clean Air Act?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An exceedance of the NTE found through the in-use testing program under this subpart is not by itself sufficient to show a breach of warranty under Clean Air Act section 207(a)(1) (42 U.S.C. 7541(a)(1)). A breach of warranty would also require one of the following things:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> That, at the time of sale, the engine or vehicle was designed, built, and equipped in a manner that does not conform in all material respects reasonably related to emission controls to the engine as described in the application for certification and covered by the certificate; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A defect in materials or workmanship of a component causes the vehicle or engine to fail to conform to the applicable regulations for its useful life.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To the extent that in-use NTE testing does not reveal such a material deficiency at the time of sale in the design or manufacture of an engine compared with the certified engine, or a defect in the materials and workmanship of a component or part, test results showing an exceedance of the NTE by itself would not show a breach of the warranty under 42 U.S.C. 7541(a)(1).</p>
