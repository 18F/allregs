                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The following changes in an existing licensee's organization  require prior approval of the Commission, and application for such  status change or license transfer shall be made on Form   FMC-18 Rev., filed in duplicate with the Commission's Bureau of  Certification and Licensing, and accompanied by the fee required under  Sec. 515.5(b)(2):</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transfer of a corporate license to another person;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in ownership of a sole proprietorship;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Addition of one or more partners to a licensed partnership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any change in the business structure of a licensee from or to a  sole proprietorship, partnership, or corporation, whether or not such  change involves a change in ownership;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Any change in a licensee's name; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Change in the identity or status of the designated qualifying  individual, except as described in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Operation after retirement, resignation, or death of qualifying  individual. When a partnership or corporation has been licensed on the  basis of the qualifications of one or more of the partners or officers  thereof, and such qualifying individual(s) no longer serve in a full- time, active capacity with the firm, the licensee shall report such  change to the Commission within 30 days. Within the same 30-day period,  the licensee shall furnish to the Commission the name(s) and detailed  intermediary experience of any other active managing partner(s) or  officer(s) who may qualify the licensee. Such qualifying individual(s)  must meet the applicable requirements set forth in Sec. 515.11(a). The  licensee may continue to operate as an ocean transportation intermediary  while the Commission investigates the qualifications of the newly  designated partner or officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Incorporation of branch office. In the event a licensee's  validly operating branch office becomes incorporated as a separate  entity, the licensee may continue to operate such office pending receipt  of a separate license, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The separately incorporated entity applies to the Commission for  its own license within ten (10) days after incorporation, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> While the application is pending, the continued operation of the  office is carried on as a bona fide branch office of the licensee, under  its full control and responsibility, and not as an operation of the  separately incorporated entity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Acquisition of one or more additional licensees. In the event a  licensee acquires one or more additional licensees, for the purpose of  merger, consolidation, or control, the acquiring licensee shall advise  the Commission of such change within 30 days after such change occurs by  submitting in duplicate, an amended Form FMC-18, Rev. No application fee  is required when reporting this change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Optional method of filing Form FMC-18. In lieu of completing and  filing Form FMC-18 in paper format, applications for approval of changes  in organization, transfer of license, or changes in the identity or  status of the designated qualifying individual required under this  section may be completed and submitted to the Bureau of Certification  and Licensing by using the automated FMC-18 filing system in accordance  with the instructions found on the Commission's home page, http:// www.fmc.gov. A $250 fee for filing a new application and a $125 fee for  filing an amended application will be assessed for filers using the  automated FMC-18 filing system instead of the fees listed at Sec.  515.5(b)(1), (2).
