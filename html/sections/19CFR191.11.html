This provision shall be known as tradeoff and is authorized by   Sec. 313(k) of the Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1313(k)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements. Tradeoff must occur between two separate legal  entities but it is not necessary that the entity exchanging the imported  merchandise be the importer thereof. In addition, tradeoff must consist  of an exchange of same kind and quality merchandise and nothing else  (the exchange may be of different quantities of same kind and quality  merchandise, but may not involve the payment or receipt of cash payments  or other than same kind and quality merchandise). If the quantities of  merchandise exchanged are different, the lesser quantity shall be the  quantity available for drawback. If the quantity of domestic merchandise  received is greater than the quantity of imported merchandise exchanged,  the merchandise identified for drawback shall be the portion of the  domestic merchandise equal to the quantity of imported merchandise which  is first received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Application. Each would-be user of tradeoff, except those  operating under an approved specific manufacturing drawback ruling  covering substitution, must apply to the Entry Process and Duty Refunds  Branch, Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade, CBP  Headquarters, for a determination of whether the imported and domestic  merchandise are of the same kind and quality. For those users  manufacturing under substitution drawback, this request should be  contained in the application for a specific manufacturing drawback  ruling (Sec. 191.8). For those users manufacturing under a general  manufacturing drawback ruling (Sec. 191.7), the request should be made  by a separate letter.
