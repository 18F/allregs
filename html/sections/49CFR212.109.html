The plan shall include a program of inspections designed to monitor the compliance of the railroads, shippers, and manufacturers operating within the State (or portion thereof) with applicable Federal railroad safety laws and regulations. In the event the participating State and the FRA Regional Director cannot agree on an annual work plan, the Associate Administrator for Safety shall review the matter.
