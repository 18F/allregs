                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Functionalization of each Account included in a Utility's ASC  must be according to the functionalization prescribed in Table 1,  Functionalization and Escalation Codes. Direct analysis on an Account  may be performed only if Table 1 states specifically that a Utility may  perform a direct analysis on the Account, with the exception of  conservation costs. Utilities will be able to functionalize all  conservation-related costs to Production, regardless of the Account in  which they are recorded. The direct analysis must be consistent with the  directions provided in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Functionalization codes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DIRECT--Direct Analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> PROD--Production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TRANS--Transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DIST--Distribution/Other.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> PTD--Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> TD--Transmission, Distribution/Other Ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> GP--General Plant Ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> GPM--General Plant Maintenance Ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> PTDG--Production, Transmission, Distribution/Other, General  Plant Ratio.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> LABOR--Labor Ratio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Functionalization requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Functionalization of certain Accounts may be based on Direct  Analysis or with a default ratio associated with that specific Account  as shown in Table 1. Once a Utility uses a specific functionalization  method for an Account, the Utility may not change the functionalization  method for that Account without prior written approval from Bonneville.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Utility must submit with its Appendix 1 all work papers,  documents, or other materials that demonstrate that the  functionalization under its Direct Analysis assigns costs, revenues,  debits or credits based upon the actual and/or intended functional use  of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will result in the  entire account being functionalized to Distribution/Other, or  Production, or Transmission, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Functionalization methods. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Direct analysis, if allowed or  required by Table 1, assigns costs, revenues, debits and credits to the  Production, Transmission, and/or Distribution/Other function of the  Utility. The only exception to this requirement is for Accounts that  include conservation-related costs. Subject to the provisions of  paragraph (d)(4) of this section, a Utility may conduct a Direct  Analysis on any Account that contains conservation-related costs. The  Direct Analysis performed by a Utility is subject to Bonneville review  and approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Bonneville will not allow a Utility to use a combination of  Direct Analysis and a prescribed functionalization method for the same  Account. The Utility can develop and use a functionalization ratio, or  use a prescribed functionalization method, if the Utility, through  Direct Analysis, can justify how the ratio reflects the functional  nature of the costs, revenues, debits, or credits included in any  Account.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A Utility that wishes to include advertising and promotion costs  related to conservation will use Direct Analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a Utility records conservation costs in an Account that is  functionalized to Distribution/Other, the Utility will identify and  document the conservation-related costs included in the Account, and the  balance of the costs will be functionalized to Distribution/Other. The  presence of conservation-related costs in an Account does not authorize  the Utility to perform a Direct Analysis on the entire Account. This  option allows a Utility to assign conservation costs in the specified  Account to Production based on analysis and support from the Utility  that demonstrates the cost assignment is appropriate. The Utility must  submit with its ASC filing all work papers, documents, and other  materials that demonstrate the functionalization contained in its Direct  Analysis and assign costs based upon the actual and/or intended  functional use of those items. Failure to submit the documentation will  result in the entire Account being functionalized to Distribution/Other  for all schedules with the exception of items included in Schedule 3B,  Other Included Items, where certain Accounts must be functionalized to  Production as appropriate.</p><p class="depth3">Sec.
