Either the applicant or agency counsel may seek review of the recommended decision on the fee application, or the Secretary may decide to review the decision on his or her own initiative, in accordance with the Department of Labor's regular review procedures. If neither the applicant nor agency counsel seeks review and the Secretary does not take review on his or her own initiative, the adjudicative officer's decision on the application shall become a final decision of the Department 45 days after it is issued. If review is taken, the Secretary will issue a final decision on the application or remand the application to the adjudicative officer for further proceedings.</p>
