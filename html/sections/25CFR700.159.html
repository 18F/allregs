                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A certified eligible business is entitled to payment  for actual direct loss of an item of tangible personal property incurred  as a result of moving or discontinuing his business, farm operation, or  nonprofit organization. The payment shall consist of the reasonable  costs incurred in attempting to sell the item plus the less of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The fair market value of the item for continued use at the  acquired site, less the proceeds from its sale. (When payment for  property loss is claimed for goods held for sale, the fair market value  shall be based on the cost of the goods to the business, not the  potential selling price); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated cost of moving the item, but with no allowance for  storage. (If the business, farm operation or nonprofit organization is  discontinued, the estimated cost shall be based on a moving distance of  50 (fifty) miles.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Advertising sign. The amount of a payment for direct loss of an  advertising sign, which is personal property, shall be the lesser of--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The depreciated reproduction cost of the sign as determined by  the Commission, less the proceeds from its sale; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The estimated cost of moving the sign.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sales effort. To be eligible for payment for direct loss of  personal property, the claimant must make good faith effort to sell the  personal property, unless the Commission determines that no such effort  is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Transfer of ownership. To be eligible for payment for direct  loss of personal property, the claimant shall transfer to the Commission  ownership of the unsold personal property.</p>
