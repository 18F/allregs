                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> With respect to any development that is identified under  Sec. Sec. 972.121 through 972.127, the PHA generally must develop a 5- year plan for removal of the affected public housing units from the  inventory. The plan must consider relocation alternatives for households  in occupancy, including other public housing and Section 8 tenant-based  assistance, and must provide for relocation from the units as soon as  possible. For planning purposes, the PHA must assume that HUD will be  able to provide in a timely fashion any necessary Section 8 rental  assistance. The plan must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A listing of the public housing units to be removed from the  inventory;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identification and obligation status of any previously approved  modernization, reconstruction, or other capital funds for the distressed  development and the PHA's recommendations concerning transfer of these  funds to Section 8 or alternative public housing uses;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A record indicating compliance with the statute's requirements  for consultation with applicable public housing tenants of the affected  development and the unit of local government where the public housing is  located, as set forth in Sec. 972.133;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the plans for demolition or disposition of the  public housing units; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A relocation plan, in accordance with paragraph (b) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(5)</em> of this section. The relocation plan must incorporate  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The number of households to be relocated, by bedroom size, and  by the number of accessible units.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relocation resources that will be necessary, including a  request for any necessary Section 8 funding and a description of actual  or potential public or other assisted housing vacancies that can be used  as relocation housing and budget for carrying out relocation activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A schedule for relocation and removal of units from the public  housing inventory (including the schedule for providing actual and  reasonable relocation expenses, as determined by the PHA, for families  displaced by the conversion).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provide for issuance of a written notice to families residing in  the development in accordance with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Timing of notice. If the required conversion is not subject to  the URA, the notice shall be provided to families at least 90 days  before displacement. If the required conversion is subject to the URA  the written notice shall be provided to families no later than the date  the conversion plan is submitted to HUD. For purposes of a required  conversion subject to the URA, this written notice shall constitute the  General Information Notice (GIN) required by the URA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contents of notice. The written notice shall include all of the  following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The development must be removed from the public housing  inventory and that the family may be displaced as a result of the  conversion;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The family will be offered comparable housing, which may include  tenant-based or project-based assistance, or occupancy in a unit  operated or assisted by the PHA (if tenant-based assistance is used, the  comparable housing requirement is fulfilled only upon the relocation of  the family into such housing);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Any necessary counseling with respect to the relocation will be  provided, including any appropriate mobility counseling (the PHA may  finance the mobility counseling using Operating Fund, Capital Fund, or  Section 8 administrative fee funding);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Such families will be relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary,  and affordable housing that is, to the maximum extent possible, housing  of their choice;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> If the development is used as housing after conversion, the PHA  must ensure that each resident may choose to remain in the housing,  using tenant-based assistance towards rent; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(F)</em> Where section 8 voucher assistance is being used for relocation,  the family will be provided with the vouchers at least 90 days before  displacement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the required conversion is subject to the URA, the written  notice described in paragraph (b)(4) must also provide that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The family will not be required to move without at least 90-days  advance written notice of the earliest date by which the family may be  required to move, and that the family will not be required to move  permanently until the family is offered comparable housing, as provided  in paragraph (b)(4)(ii)(B) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any person who is an alien not lawfully present in the United  States is ineligible for relocation payments or assistance under the  URA, unless such ineligibility would result in exceptional and extremely  unusual hardship to a qualifying spouse, parent, or child, as provided  in the URA regulations at 49 CFR 24.208;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The family has a right to appeal the PHA's determination as to  the family's application for relocation assistance for which the family  may be eligible under this subpart and URA;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Families residing in the development will be provided with the  URA Notice of Relocation Eligibility or Notice of Non-displacement (as  applicable) as of the date HUD approves the conversion plan (for  purposes of this subpart, the date of HUD's approval of the conversion  plan shall be the ``date of initiation of negotiations'' as that term is  used in URA and the implementing regulations at 49 CFR part 24); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any family that moves into the development after submission of  the conversion plan to HUD will also be eligible for relocation  assistance, unless the PHA issues a written move-in notice to the family  prior to leasing and occupancy of the unit advising the family of the  development's possible conversion, the impact of the conversion on the  family, and that the family will not be eligible for relocation  assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The conversion plan may not be more than a 5-year plan, unless  the PHA applies for and receives approval from HUD for a longer period  of time. HUD may allow the PHA up to 10 years to remove the units from  the inventory, in exceptional circumstances where HUD determines that  this is clearly the most cost effective and beneficial means of  providing housing assistance over that same period. For example, HUD may  allow a longer period of time to remove the units from the public  housing inventory, where more than one development is being converted,  and a larger number of families   require relocation than can easily be absorbed into the rental market at  one time, provided the housing has a remaining useful life of longer  than five years and the longer time frame will assist in relocation.</p>
