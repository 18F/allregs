                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grantees, the Secretary concerned, and participants  shall all contribute to the cost of providing supportive services  according to section 802(i)(A)(i). Grantees must contribute at least 50  percent of program cost, participants must contribute fees that in total  are at least 10 percent of program cost, and the Secretary concerned  will provide funds in an amount not to exceed 40 percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Section 802(i)(1)(B)(ii) creates a cost-sharing provision  between grantee and the Secretary concerned if total participant fees  collected over a year are less than 10 percent of total program cost.  This provision is subject to availability of appropriated grant funds.  If funds are not available, the grantee must assume the funding  shortfall.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibition on substitution of funds and maintenance of existing  supportive services. Grantees shall maintain existing funding for and  provision of supportive services prior to the application date, as set  forth in section 802(i)(1)(D). The grantee shall ensure that the  activities provided to the project under a CHSP grant will be in  addition to, and not in substitution for, these previously existing  services. The value of these services do not qualify as matching funds.  Such services must be maintained either for the time the participant  remains in CHSP, or for the duration of CHSP grant. The grantee shall  certify compliance with this paragraph to the Secretary concerned.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible matching funds. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All sources of matching funds must  be directly related to the types of supportive services prescribed by  the PAC or used for administration of CHSP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Matching funds may include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cash (which may include funds from Federal, State and local  governments, third party contributions, available payments authorized  under Medicaid for specific individuals in CHSP, Community Development  Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants, Older American Act  programs or excess residual funds with the approval of the Secretary  concerned),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The imputed dollar value of other agency or third party- provided direct services or staff who will work with or provide services  to program participants; these services must be justified in the  application to assure that they are the new or expanded services of CHSP  necessary to keep the program participants independent. If services are  provided by the state, Indian tribe, unit of general local government,  or local nonprofit housing sponsor, IHA, PHA, or for-profit or not-for- profit owner, any salary paid to staff from governmental sources to  carry out the program of the grantee and any funds paid to residents  employed by the Program (other than from amounts under a contract under  section 700.155) is allowable match.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In-kind items (these are limited to 10 percent of the 50  percent matching amount), such as the current market value of donated  common or office space, utility costs, furniture, material, supplies,  equipment and food used in direct provision of services. The applicant  must provide an explanation for the estimated donated value of any item  listed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The value of services performed by volunteers to CHSP, at the  rate of $5.00 an hour.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Limitation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following are not eligible for use as  matching funds:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> PHA operating funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> CHSP funds;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Section 8 funds other than excess residual receipts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Funds under section 14 of the U.S. Housing Act of 1937, unless  used for service coordination or case management; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Comprehensive grant funds unless used for service coordination  or case management;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Local government contributions are limited by section  802(i)(1)(E).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Annual review of match. The Secretary concerned will review the  infusion of matching funds annually, as part of the program or budget  review. If there are insufficient matching funds available to meet  program requirements at any point after grant start-up, or at any time  during the term of the grant (i.e., if matching funds from sources other  than program participant fees drop below 50 percent of total supportive  services cost), the Secretary concerned may decrease the federal grant  share of supportive services funds accordingly.</p>
