The notice may condition the permission on requirements related to the operation and maintenance of the alternative means.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any notice under paragraph (a) of this section shall be published only

after public notice and an opportunity for a hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person seeking permission under this section shall collect, verify, and submit to the Administrator information showing that the alternative means achieves equivalent emission reductions.
