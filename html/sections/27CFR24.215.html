The shipping records for transfers in bond of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked ``Not for Sale or Consumption as Beverage Wine.'' Upon removal from bonded wine premises free of tax, containers of nonbeverage wine or wine products will be marked to clearly indicate such products are not for sale or consumption as beverage wine, e.g., salted wine, vinegar, nonbeverage cooking wine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Salted wine.
