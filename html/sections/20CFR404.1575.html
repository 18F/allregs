                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> through (e) of this section that are relevant to your  work activity. We will use these provisions whenever they are  appropriate, whether in connection with your application for disability  benefits (when we make an initial determination on your application and  throughout any appeals you may request), after you have become entitled  to a period of disability or to disability benefits, or both.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> How we evaluate the work you do after you have become entitled  to disability benefits. If you are entitled to social security  disability benefits and you work as a self-employed person, the way we  will evaluate your work activity will depend on whether the work  activity occurs before or after you have received such benefits for at  least 24 months and on the purpose of the evaluation. For purposes of  paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section, social security disability  benefits means disability insurance benefits for a disabled worker,  child's insurance benefits based on disability, or widow's or widower's  insurance benefits based on disability. We will use the rules in  paragraph (e)(2) of this section to determine if you have received such  benefits for at least 24 months.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We will use the guides in paragraph (a)(2) of this section to  evaluate any work activity you do before you have received social  security disability benefits for at least 24 months to determine whether  you have engaged in substantial gainful activity, regardless of the  purpose of the evaluation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> We will use the guides in paragraph (e) of this section to  evaluate any work activity you do after you have received social  security disability benefits for at least 24 months to determine whether  you have engaged in substantial gainful activity for the purpose of  determining whether your disability has ceased because of your work  activity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If we have determined under Sec. 404.1592a(a)(1) that your  disability ceased in a month during the reentitlement period because you  performed substantial gainful activity, and we need to decide under  Sec. 404.1592a(a)(2)(i) or (a)(3)(i) whether you are doing substantial  gainful activity in a subsequent month in or after your reentitlement  period, we will use the guides in paragraph (a)(2) of this section  (subject to the limitations described in Sec. 404.1592a(a)(2)(i) and  (a)(3)(i)) to determine whether your work activity in that month is  substantial gainful activity. We will use the guides in paragraph (a)(2)  of this section for these purposes, regardless of whether your work  activity in that month occurs before or after you have received social  security disability benefits for at least 24 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> General rules for evaluating your work activity if you are self- employed. We will consider your activities and their value to your  business to decide whether you have engaged in substantial gainful  activity if you are self-employed. We will not consider your income  alone because the amount of income you actually receive may depend on a  number of different factors, such as capital investment and profit- sharing agreements. We will generally consider work that you were forced  to stop or reduce to below substantial gainful activity after 6 months  or less because of your impairment as an unsuccessful work attempt. See  paragraph (d) of this section. We will evaluate your work activity based  on the value of your services to the business regardless of whether you  receive an immediate income for your services. We determine whether you  have engaged in substantial gainful activity by applying three tests. If  you have not engaged in substantial gainful activity under test one,  then we will consider tests two and three. The tests are as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Test one: You have engaged in substantial gainful activity if  you render services that are significant to the operation of the  business and receive a substantial income from the business.   Paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section explain what we mean by  significant services and substantial income for purposes of this test.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Test Two: You have engaged in substantial gainful activity if  your work activity, in terms of factors such as hours, skills, energy  output, efficiency, duties, and responsibilities, is comparable to that  of unimpaired individuals in your community who are in the same or  similar businesses as their means of livelihood.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Test Three: You have engaged in substantial gainful activity  if your work activity, although not comparable to that of unimpaired  individuals, is clearly worth the amount shown in Sec. 404.1574(b)(2)  when considered in terms of its value to the business, or when compared  to the salary that an owner would pay to an employee to do the work you  are doing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What we mean by significant services. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If you are not a farm  landlord and you operate a business entirely by yourself, any services  that you render are significant to the business. If your business  involves the services of more than one person, we will consider you to  be rendering significant services if you contribute more than half the  total time required for the management of the business, or you render  management services for more than 45 hours a month regardless of the  total management time required by the business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you are a farm landlord, that is, you rent farm land to  another, we will consider you to be rendering significant services if  you materially particpate in the production or the management of the  production of the things raised on the rented farm. (See Sec. 404.1082  of this chapter for an explanation of material participation.) If you  were given social security earnings credits because you materially  participated in the activities of the farm and you continue these same  activities, we will consider you to be rendering significant services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> What we mean by substantial income--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determining countable  income. We deduct your normal business expenses from your gross income  to determine net income. Once we determine your net income, we deduct  the reasonable value of any significant amount of unpaid help furnished  by your spouse, children, or others. Miscellaneous duties that  ordinarily would not have commercial value would not be considered  significant. We deduct impairment-related work expenses that have not  already been deducted in determining your net income. Impairment-related  work expenses are explained in Sec. 404.1576. We deduct unincurred  business expenses paid for you by another individual or agency. An  unincurred business expense occurs when a sponsoring agency or another  person incurs responsibility for the payment of certain business  expenses, e.g., rent, utilities, or purchases and repair of equipment,  or provides you with equipment, stock, or other material for the  operation of your business. We deduct soil bank payments if they were  included as farm income. That part of your income remaining after we  have made all applicable deductions represents the actual value of work  performed. The resulting amount is the amount we use to determine if you  have done substantial gainful activity. For purposes of this section, we  refer to this amount as your countable income. We will generally average  your countable income for comparison with the earnings guidelines in  Sec. 404.1574(b)(2). See Sec. 404.1574a for our rules on averaging of  earnings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When countable income is considered substantial. We will  consider your countable income to be substantial if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It averages more than the amounts described in  Sec. 404.1574(b)(2); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It averages less than the amounts described in  Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) but it is either comparable to what it was before  you became seriously impaired if we had not considered your earnings or  is comparable to that of unimpaired self-employed persons in your  community who are in the same or a similar business as their means of  livelihood.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The unsuccessful work attempt--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Ordinarily, work you  have done will not show that you are able to do substantial gainful  activity if, after working for a period of 6 months or less, you were  forced by your impairment to stop working or to reduce the amount of  work you do so that you are   no longer performing substantial gainful activity and you meet the  conditions described in paragraphs (d)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this  section. We will use the provisions of this paragraph when we make an  initial determination on your application for disability benefits and  throughout any appeal you may request. Except as set forth in  Sec. 404.1592a(a), we will also apply the provisions of this paragraph  if you are already entitled to disability benefits, when you work and we  consider whether the work you are doing is substantial gainful activity  or demonstrates the ability to do substantial gainful activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Event that must precede an unsuccessful work attempt. There must  be a significant break in the continuity of your work before we will  consider you to have begun a work attempt that later proved  unsuccessful. You must have stopped working or reduced your work and  earnings below substantial gainful activity because of your impairment  or because of the removal of special conditions which took into account  your impairment and permitted you to work. Examples of such special  conditions may include any significant amount of unpaid help furnished  by your spouse, children, or others, or unincurred business expenses, as  described in paragraph (c) of this section, paid for you by another  individual or agency. We will consider your prior work to be  ``discontinued'' for a significant period if you were out of work at  least 30 consecutive days. We will also consider your prior work to be  ``discontinued'' if, because of your impairment, you were forced to  change to another type of work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you worked 3 months or less. We will consider work of 3  months or less to be an unsuccessful work attempt if it ended, or was  reduced below substantial gainful activity, because of your impairment  or because of the removal of special conditions which took into account  your impairment and permitted you to work.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If you worked between 3 and 6 months. We will consider work that  lasted longer than 3 months to be an unsuccessful work attempt if it  ended, or was reduced below substantial gainful activity, within 6  months because of your impairment or because of the removal of special  conditions which took into account your impairment and permitted you to  work and--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You were frequently unable to work because of your impairment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your work was unsatisfactory because of your impairment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You worked during a period of temporary remission of your  impairment; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> You worked under special conditions that were essential to your  performance and these conditions were removed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If you worked more than 6 months. We will not consider work you  performed at the substantial gainful activity level for more than 6  months to be an unsuccessful work attempt regardless of why it ended or  was reduced below the substantial gainful activity earnings level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Special rules for evaluating the work you do after you have  received social security disability benefits for at least 24 months--(1)  General. We will apply the provisions of this paragraph to evaluate the  work you are doing or have done if, at the time you do the work, you are  entitled to social security disability benefits and you have received  such benefits for at least 24 months. We will apply the provisions of  this paragraph only when we are evaluating that work to consider whether  you have engaged in substantial gainful activity or demonstrated the  ability to engage in substantial gainful activity for the purpose of  determining whether your disability has ceased because of your work  activity (see Secs. 404.1592a(a)(1) and (3)(ii) and 404.1594(d)(5) and  (f)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1))</em>. We will use the countable income test described in paragraph  (e)(3) of this section to determine whether the work you do after you  have received such benefits for at least 24 months is substantial  gainful activity or demonstrates the ability to do substantial gainful  activity. We will not consider the services you perform in that work to  determine that the work you are doing shows that you are able to engage  in substantial gainful activity and are, therefore, no longer disabled.  However, we may consider the services you perform to determine that you  are not doing substantial gainful activity. We   will generally consider work that you were forced to stop or reduce  below substantial gainful activity after 6 months or less because of  your impairment as an unsuccessful work attempt. See paragraph (d) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The 24-month requirement. For purposes of paragraphs (a)(1) and  (e) of this section, we consider you to have received social security  disability benefits for at least 24 months beginning with the first day  of the first month following the 24th month for which you actually  received social security disability benefits that you were due or  constructively received such benefits. The 24 months do not have to be  consecutive. We will consider you to have constructively received a  benefit for a month for purposes of the 24-month requirement if you were  otherwise due a social security disability benefit for that month and  your monthly benefit was withheld to recover an overpayment. Any months  for which you were entitled to benefits but for which you did not  actually or constructively receive a benefit payment will not be counted  for the 24-month requirement. If you also receive supplemental security  income payments based on disability or blindness under title XVI of the  Social Security Act, months for which you received only supplemental  security income payments will not be counted for the 24-month  requirement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Countable income test. We will compare your countable income to  the earnings guidelines in Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) to determine if you have  engaged in substantial gainful activity. See paragraph (c)(1) of this  section for an explanation of countable income. We will consider that  you have engaged in substantial gainful activity if your monthly  countable income averages more than the amounts described in  Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) for the month(s) in which you work, unless the  evidence shows that you did not render significant services in the  month(s). See paragraph (b) of this section for what we mean by  significant services. If your average monthly countable income is equal  to or less than the amounts in Sec. 404.1574(b)(2) for the month(s) in  which you work, or if the evidence shows that you did not render  significant services in the month(s), we will consider that your work as  a self-employed person shows that you have not engaged in substantial  gainful activity.
