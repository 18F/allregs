Except as provided in Sec.  63.4340(a)(4), and except for solvent recovery systems for which you  conduct liquid-liquid material balances according to Sec. 63.4341(e)(5)  or (f)(5), you must establish and demonstrate continuous compliance  during the initial compliance period with the operating limits required  by Sec. 63.4292, using the procedures specified in Sec. Sec. 63.4363  and 63.4364.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compliance with work practice requirements.

Using Equation 1 of Sec. 63.4331, calculate the mass of  organic HAP emissions before add-on controls from all coating, printing,  thinning, and cleaning materials applied during the compliance period  minus the organic HAP in certain waste materials in the web coating/ printing operation or group of web coating/printing operations for which  you use the emission rate with add-on controls.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions for each  controlled web coating/printing operation. Determine the mass of organic  HAP emissions reduced for each controlled web coating/printing operation  during the compliance period. The emissions reductions determination  quantifies the total organic HAP emissions that pass through the  emission capture system and are destroyed or removed by the add-on  control device. Use the procedures in paragraph (e)(4) of this section  to calculate the mass of organic HAP emissions reductions for each  controlled web coating/printing operation using an emission capture  system and add-on control device other than a solvent recovery system  for which you conduct liquid-liquid material balances.

For each controlled web coating/printing operation  using an emission capture system and add-on control device other than a  solvent recovery system for which you conduct liquid-liquid material  balances, calculate the organic HAP emissions reductions using Equation  1 of this section. The equation applies the emission capture system  efficiency and add-on control device efficiency to the mass of organic  HAP contained in the coating, printing, thinning, and cleaning materials  applied in the web coating/printing operation served by the emission  capture system and add-on control device during the compliance period.  For any period of time a deviation specified in Sec. 63.4342(c) or (d)  occurs in the controlled web coating/printing operation, including a  deviation during startup, shutdown, or malfunction, then you must assume  zero efficiency for the emission capture system and add-on control  device. Equation 1 of this section treats the coating, printing,  thinning, and cleaning materials applied during such a deviation as if  they were used on an uncontrolled web coating/printing operation for the  time period of the deviation.

To demonstrate initial compliance with  the emission limit, the organic HAP emission rate with add-on controls  for the compliance period, calculated using Equation 8 of this section,  must be less than or equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1  to this subpart. You must keep all records as required by Sec. Sec.  63.4312 and 63.4313. As part of the Notification of Compliance Status  required by Sec. 63.4310, you must identify the dyeing/finishing  operation(s) for which you used the emission rate with add-on controls  option and submit a statement that the dyeing/finishing operation(s) was  (were) in compliance with the emission limitations during the initial  compliance period because the organic HAP emission rate was less than or  equal to the applicable emission limit in Table 1 to this subpart, and  that you achieved the operating limits required by Sec. 63.4292 and the  work practice standards required by Sec. 63.4293.</p>
