                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The operator shall calculate and record complete individual  exposures to concentrations of radon daughters as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where uranium is mined--the complete individual exposures of all  mine personnel working underground shall be calculated and recorded.  These records shall include the individual's time in each active working  area such as stopes, drift headings, travelways, haulageways, shops,  stations, lunch rooms, magazines and any other place or location where  persons work, travel or congregate, and the concentration of airborne  radon daughters for each active working area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Where uranium is not mined--the complete individual exposure of  all mine personnel working in active working areas with radon daughter  concentrations in excess of 0.3 WL shall be calculated and recorded.  These records shall include the individual's time in each active working  area and the concentrations of airborne radon daughters for each active  working area. The operator may discontinue calculating and recording the  individual exposures of any personnel assigned to work in active working  areas where radon daughter concentrations have been reduced to 0.3 WL or  less for 5 consecutive weeks provided that such exposure calculation and  recordation shall not be discontinued with respect to any person who has  accumulated more exposure than \1/12\ (one-twelfth) of a WLM times the  number of months for   which exposures have been calculated and recorded in the calendar year  in which the exposure calculation and recordation is proposed to be  discontinued.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The operator shall maintain the form entitled ``Record of  Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters'' (Form 4000-9), or equivalent  forms that are acceptable to the Administrator, Metal and Nonmetal Mine  Safety and Health, Mine Safety and Health Administration, on which there  shall be recorded the specific information required by the form with  respect to each person's time-weighted current and cumulative exposure  to concentrations of radon daughters.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The form entitled ``Record of Individual Exposure to Radon  Daughters'' (Form 4000-9), shall consist of an original of each form for  the operator's records which shall be available for examination by the  Secretary or his authorized representative.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> On or before February 15 of each calendar year, or within 45  days after the shutdown of mining operations for the calendar year, each  mine operator shall submit to the Mine Safety and Health Administration  a copy of the ``Record of Individual Exposure to Radon Daughters'' (Form  4000-9), or acceptable equivalent form, showing the data required by the  form for all personnel for whom calculation and recording of exposure  was required during the previous calendar year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Errors detected by the operator shall be corrected on any forms  kept by the operator and a corrected copy of any forms submitted to the  Mine Safety and Health Administration shall be submitted to the Mine  Safety and Health Administration within 60 days of detection and shall  identify the errors and indicate the date the corrections are made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The operator's records of individual exposure to concentrations  of radon daughters and copies of ``Record of Individual Exposure to  Radon Daughters'' (Form 4000-9) or acceptable equivalent form or true  legible facsimiles thereof (microfilm or other), shall be retained at  the mine or nearest mine office for a period as specified in paragraph  9.8, ANSI N13.8-1973, or shall be submitted to the Mine Safety and  Health Administration. These records, if retained by the operator, shall  be open for inspection by the Secretary of Labor, his authorized  representative, and authorized representatives of the official mine  inspection agency of the State in which the mine is located. Paragraph  9.8, ANSI N13.8-1973, is incorporated by reference and made a part of  this standard. ANSI N13.8-1973 may be examined at any Metal and Nonmetal  Mine Safety and Health District Office of the Mine Safety and Health  Administration, and may be obtained from the American National Standards  Institute, Inc., at 25 W. 43rd Street, 4th Floor, New York, NY 10036;  http://www.ansi.org.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Upon written request from a person who is a subject of these  records, a statement of the year-to-date and cumulative exposure  applicable to that person shall be provided to the person or to whomever  such person designates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The blank form entitled ``Record of Individual Exposure to Radon  Daughters'' (Form 4000-9) may be obtained on request from any MSHA Metal  and Nonmetal Mine Safety and Health district office.</p><p class="depth3">Note: To calculate an individual's exposure to WLM for a given  period of time, multiply the total exposure time (hours to the nearest  half-hour) in an active working area by the average concentration of  airborne radon daughters for the applicable active working area (average  working level calculated to the nearest hundredth working level) and  divide the product by the constant 173 hours per month.</p><p class="depth3">An average airborne radon daughter concentration for a designated  active working area shall be determined by averaging all sampling  results for that working area during the time that persons are present.  Any sample taken by Federal or State mine inspectors, which represents  exposure to miners and reported to the operator within three days of  being taken, shall be included in the average concentration; except that  if the mine operator samples simultaneously with the inspector, he may  use his own sample results.
