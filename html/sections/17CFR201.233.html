                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness by deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why such deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the party believes the witness will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing; the name and address of the prospective witness; the matters concerning which the prospective witness is expected to be questioned; and the proposed time and place for the taking of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required finding when ordering a deposition. In the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, an order for a deposition may be issued upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give testimony material to the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective witness, who is then within the United States, will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age, sickness, infirmity, imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a deposition will serve the interests of justice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of order. An order for deposition shall designate by name a deposition officer. The designated officer may be the hearing officer or any other person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the place where the deposition is to be held. An order for deposition also shall state:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The scope of the testimony to be taken;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The time and place of the deposition;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to be filed upon completion of the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Procedure at depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put to him or her. Examination and cross-examination of deponents may proceed as permitted at a hearing. The witness being deposed may have counsel present during the deposition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Objections to questions or evidence. Objections to questions or evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon. Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer upon the deposition, but a deposition officer other than the hearing officer shall not have the power to decide on the competency, materiality or relevance of evidence. Failure to object to questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be deemed a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Filing of depositions. The questions propounded and all answers or objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a transcript prepared by the deposition officer, or under his or her direction. The transcript shall be subscribed by the witness and certified by the deposition officer. The original deposition and exhibits shall be filed with the Secretary. A copy of the deposition shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase at prescribed rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Payment. The cost of the transcript shall be paid by the party requesting the deposition.
