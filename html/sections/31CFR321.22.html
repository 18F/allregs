                            <p class="depth0">Any securities an agent is not authorized to pay under the  provisions of this part should be forwarded for redemption to a TRS  Site. The requests for payment on the securities should be properly  certified. Any documentary evidence required to support the transaction  should accompany the securities. If the securities are presented for  redemption-exchange, they must also be accompanied by a completed and  signed exchange subscription and additional cash needed to complete the  transaction. Unpaid securities must be forwarded to a TRS Site in  accordance with the rules in this part. The Bureau of the Fiscal Service  provides agents with instructions and guidance regarding forwarding  items. These instructions identify the specific types of redemption  cases that should be forwarded and the processing instructions that  paying agents must follow. These instructions are available from a TRS  Site or online at www.treasurydirect.gov.  [77 FR 16167, Mar. 20, 2012]</p>
