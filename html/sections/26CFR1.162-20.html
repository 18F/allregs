                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope of section. This section contains rules  governing the deductibility or nondeductibility of expenditures for  lobbying purposes, for the promotion or defeat of legislation, for  political campaign purposes (including the support of or opposition to  any candidate for public office) or for carrying on propaganda  (including advertising) related to any of the foregoing purposes. For  rules applicable to such expenditures in respect of taxable years  beginning before January 1, 1963, and for taxable years beginning after  December 31, 1962, see paragraphs (b) and (c), respectively, of this  section. This section also deals with expenditures for institutional or  ``good will'' advertising.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Institutional or ``good will'' advertising. Expenditures for  institutional or ``good will'' advertising which keeps the taxpayer's  name before the public are generally deductible as ordinary and  necessary business expenses provided the expenditures are related to the  patronage the taxpayer might reasonably expect in the future. For  example, a deduction will ordinarily be allowed for the cost of  advertising which keeps the taxpayer's name before the public in  connection with encouraging contributions to such organizations as the  Red Cross, the purchase of United States Savings Bonds, or participation  in similar causes. In like fashion, expenditures for advertising which  presents views on economic, financial, social, or other subjects of a  general nature, but which does not involve any of the activities  specified in paragraph (b) or (c) of this section for which a deduction  is not allowable, are deductible if they otherwise meet the requirements  of the regulations under section 162.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For taxable years beginning before January 1, 1963, expenditures for  lobbying purposes, for the promotion or defeat of legislation, for  political campaign purposes (including the support of or opposition to  any candidate for public office), or for carrying on propaganda  (including advertising) related to any of the foregoing purposes are not  deductible from gross income. For example, the cost of advertising to  promote or defeat legislation or to influence the public with respect to  the desirability   or undesirability of proposed legislation is not deductible as a  business expense, even though the legislation may directly affect the  taxpayer's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a substantial part of the activities of an organization,  such as a labor union or a trade association, consists of one or more of  the activities specified in the first sentence of this subparagraph,  deduction will be allowed only for such portion of the dues or other  payments to the organization as the taxpayer can clearly establish is  attributable to activities other than those so specified. The  determination of whether such specified activities constitute a  substantial part of an organization's activities shall be based on all  the facts and circumstances. In no event shall special assessments or  similar payments (including an increase in dues) made to any  organization for any of such specified purposes be deductible. For other  provisions relating to the deductibility of dues and other payments to  an organization, such as a labor union or a trade association, see  paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.162-15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Expenditures for promotion or defeat of legislation. For  purposes of this paragraph, expenditures for the promotion or the defeat  of legislation include, but shall not be limited to, expenditures for  the purpose of attempting to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Influence members of a legislative body directly, or indirectly  by urging or encouraging the public to contact such members for the  purpose of proposing, supporting, or opposing legislation, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Influence the public to approve or reject a measure in a  referendum, initiative, vote on a constitutional amendment, or similar  procedure.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.  For taxable years beginning after December 31, 1962, certain types of  expenses incurred with respect to legislative matters are deductible  under section 162(a) if they otherwise meet the requirements of the  regulations under section 162. These deductible expenses are described  in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph. All other expenditures for  lobbying purposes, for the promotion or defeat of legislation (see  paragraph (b)(2) of this section), for political campaign purposes  (including the support of or opposition to any candidate for public  office), or for carrying on propaganda (including advertising) relating  to any of the foregoing purposes are not deductible from gross income  for such taxable years. For the disallowance of deductions for bad debts  and worthless securities of a political party, see Sec. 1.271-1. For  the disallowance of deductions for certain indirect political  contributions, such as the cost of certain advertising and the cost of  admission to certain dinners, programs, and inaugural events, see Sec.  1.276-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> and the cost of  preparing testimony) paid or incurred by the taxpayer during a taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1962, in carrying on any trade or  business which are in direct connection with--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Appearances before, submission of statements to, or sending  communications to, the committees, or individual members of Congress or  of any legislative body of a State, a possession of the United States,  or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing with respect to  legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest to the taxpayer,  or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Communication of information between the taxpayer and an  organization of which he is a member with respect to legislation or  proposed legislation of direct interest to the taxpayer and to such  organization.  For provisions relating to dues paid or incurred with respect to an  organization of which the taxpayer is a member, see subparagraph (3) of  this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest to the  taxpayer--(a) Legislation or proposed legislation. The term  ``legislation or proposed legislation'' includes bills and resolutions  introduced by a member of Congress or other legislative body referred to  in subdivision (i)(a) of this subparagraph for consideration by such  body as well   as oral or written proposals for legislative action submitted to the  legislative body or to a committee or member of such body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Direct interest--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Legislation or proposed  legislation is of direct interest to a taxpayer if the legislation or  proposed legislation is of such a nature that it will, or may reasonably  be expected to, affect the trade or business of the taxpayer. It is  immaterial whether the effect, or expected effect, on the trade or  business will be beneficial or detrimental to the trade or business or  whether it will be immediate. If legislation or proposed legislation has  such a relationship to a trade or business that the expenses of any  appearance or communication in connection with the legislation meets the  ordinary and necessary test of section 162(a), then such legislation  ordinarily meets the direct interest test of section 162(e). However, if  the nature of the legislation or proposed legislation is such that the  likelihood of its having an effect on the trade or business of the  taxpayer is remote or speculative, the legislation or proposed  legislation is not of direct interest to the taxpayer. Legislation or  proposed legislation which will not affect the trade or business of the  taxpayer is not of direct interest to the taxpayer even though such  legislation will affect the personal, living, or family activities or  expenses of the taxpayer. Legislation or proposed legislation is not of  direct interest to a taxpayer merely because it may affect business in  general; however, if the legislation or proposed legislation will, or  may reasonably be expected to, affect the taxpayer's trade or business  it will be of direct interest to the taxpayer even though it also will  affect the trade or business of other taxpayers or business in general.  To meet the direct interest test, it is not necessary that all  provisions of the legislation or proposed legislation have an effect, or  expected effect, on the taxpayer's trade or business. The test will be  met if one of the provisions of the legislation has the specified  effect. Legislation or proposed legislation will be considered to be of  direct interest to a membership organization if it is of direct interest  to the organization, as such, or if it is of direct interest to one or  more of its members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Legislation which would increase or decrease the taxes  applicable to the trade or business, increase or decrease the operating  costs or earnings of the trade or business, or increase or decrease the  administrative burdens connected with the trade or business meets the  direct interest test. Legislation which would increase the social  security benefits or liberalize the right to such benefits meets the  direct interest test because such changes in the social security  benefits may reasonably be expected to affect the retirement benefits  which the employer will be asked to provide his employees or to increase  his taxes. Legislation which would impose a retailer's sales tax is of  direct interest to a retailer because, although the tax may be passed on  to his customers, collection of the tax will impose additional burdens  on the retailer, and because the increased cost of his products to the  consumer may reduce the demand for them. Legislation which would provide  an income tax credit or exclusion for shareholders is of direct interest  to a corporation, because those tax benefits may increase the sources of  capital available to the corporation. Legislation which would favorably  or adversely affect the business of a competitor so as to affect the  taxpayer's competitive position is of direct interest to the taxpayer.  Legislation which would improve the school system of a community is of  direct interest to a membership organization comprised of employers in  the community because the improved school system is likely to make the  community more attractive to prospective employees of such employers. On  the other hand, proposed legislation relating to Presidential succession  in the event of the death of the President has only a remote and  speculative effect on any trade or business and therefore does not meet  the direct interest test. Similarly, if a corporation is represented  before a congressional committee to oppose an appropriation bill merely  because of a desire to bring increased Government economy with the hope  that such economy will eventually cause a reduction in the Federal  income tax, the legislation does not   meet the direct interest test because any effect it may have upon the  corporation's trade or business is highly speculative.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)(a)</em> of this  section) by an individual in connection with legislation or proposed  legislation shall be considered to be with respect to legislation of  direct interest to such individual if the legislation is in a field in  which he specializes as an employee, if the appearance or communication  is not on behalf of his employer, and if it is customary for individuals  in his type of employment to publicly express their views in respect of  matters in their field of competence. Expenses incurred by such an  individual in connection with such an appearance of communication,  including traveling expenses properly allocable thereto, represent  ordinary and necessary business expenses and are, therefore, deductible  under section 162. For example, if a university professor who teaches in  the field of money and banking appears, on his own behalf, before a  legislative committee to testify on proposed legislation regarding the  banking system, his expenses incurred in connection with such appearance  are deductible under section 162 since university professors customarily  take an active part in the development of the law in their field of  competence and publicly communicate the results of their work.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An appearance or communication (of a type described in  paragraph (c)(2)(i)(a) of this section) by an employee or self-employed  individual in connection with legislation or proposed legislation shall  be considered to be with respect to legislation of direct interest to  such person if the legislation is in the field in which he specializes  in his business (or as an employee) and if the appearance or  communication is made pursuant to an invitation extended to him  individually for the purpose of receiving his expert testimony. Expenses  incurred by an employee or self-employed individual in connection with  such an appearance or communication, including traveling expenses  properly allocable thereto, represent ordinary and necessary business  expenses and are, therefore, deductible under section 162. For example,  if a self-employed individual is personally invited by a congressional  committee to testify on proposed legislation in the field in which he  specializes in his business, his expenses incurred in connection with  such appearance are deductible under section 162. If a self-employed  individual makes an appearance, on his own behalf, before a legislative  committee without having been extended an invitation his expenses will  be deductible to the extent otherwise provided in this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Nominations, etc. A taxpayer does not have a direct interest in  matters such as nominations, appointments, or the operation of the  legislative body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Allowable expenses. To be deductible under section 162(a),  expenditures which meet the tests of deductibility under the provisions  of this paragraph must also qualify as ordinary and necessary business  expenses under section 162(a) and, in addition, be in direct connection  with the carrying on of the activities specified in subdivision (i)(a)  or (i)(b) of this subparagraph. For example, a taxpayer appearing before  a committee of the Congress to present testimony concerning legislation  or proposed legislation in which he has a direct interest may deduct the  ordinary and necessary expenses directly connected with his appearance,  such as traveling expenses described in section 162(a)(2), and the cost  of preparing testimony.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Deductibility of dues and other payments to an organization. If  a substantial part of the activities of an organization, such as a labor  union or a trade association, consists of one or more of the activities  to which this paragraph relates (legislative matters, political  campaigns, etc.), exclusive of any activity constituting an appearance  or communication with respect to legislation or proposed legislation of  direct interest to the organization (see subparagraph (c)(2)(ii)(b)(1)),  a deduction will be allowed only for such portion of the dues or other  payments to the organization as the taxpayer can clearly establish is  attributable to activities to which this paragraph does not relate   and to any activity constituting an appearance or communication with  respect to legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest to the  organization. The determination of whether a substantial part of an  organization's activities consists of one or more of the activities to  which this paragraph relates (exclusive of appearances or communications  with respect to legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest  to the organization) shall be based on all the facts and circumstances.  In no event shall a deduction be allowed for that portion of a special  assessment or similar payment (including an increase in dues) made to  any organization for any activity to which this paragraph relates if the  activity does not constitute an appearance or communication with respect  to legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest to the  organization. If an organization pays or incurs expenses allocable to  legislative activities which meet the tests of subdivisions (i) and (ii)  of subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (appearances or communications  with respect to legislation or proposed legislation of direct interest  to the organization), on behalf of its members, the dues paid by a  taxpayer are deductible to the extent used for such activities. Dues  paid by a taxpayer will be considered to be used for such an activity,  and thus deductible, although the legislation or proposed legislation  involved is not of direct interest to the taxpayer, if, pursuant to the  provisions of subparagraph (2)(ii)(b)(1) of this paragraph, the  legislation or proposed legislation is of direct interest to the  organization, as such, or is of direct interest to one or more members  of the organization. For other provisions relating to the deductibility  of dues and other payments to an organization, such as a labor union or  a trade association, see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.162-15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Limitations. No deduction shall be allowed under section 162(a)  for any amount paid or incurred (whether by way of contribution, gift,  or otherwise) in connection with any attempt to influence the general  public, or segments thereof, with respect to legislative matters,  elections, or referendums. For example, no deduction shall be allowed  for any expenses incurred in connection with ``grassroot'' campaigns or  any other attempts to urge or encourage the public to contact members of  a legislative body for the purpose of proposing, supporting, or opposing  legislation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, in connection  with influencing legislation other than certain local legislation. The  provisions of paragraphs (c)(1) through (3) of this section are  superseded for expenses paid or incurred after December 31, 1993, in  connection with influencing legislation (other than certain local  legislation) to the extent inconsistent with section 162(e)(1)(A) (as  limited by section 162(e)(2)) and Sec. Sec. 1.162-20(d) and 1.162-29.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>.
