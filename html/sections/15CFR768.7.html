                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Initiation of an assessment. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Once BIS accepts a FAS or TAC  certification of foreign availability, BIS will notify the claimant or  TAC that it is initiating the assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> BIS will publish a Federal Register notice of the initiation of  any assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> BIS will notify the Departments of Defense and State, the  intelligence community, and any other departments, agencies and their  contractors that may have information concerning the item on which BIS  has initiated an assessment. Each such department, agency, and  contractor shall provide BIS all relevant information concerning the  item. BIS will invite interested departments and agencies to participate  in the assessment process (See paragraph (e) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and (c) of this part. As soon as BIS initiates the  assessment, it will seek evidence relevant to the assessment, including  an analysis of the military needs of a selected country or countries,  technical analysis, and intelligence information from the Departments of  Defense and State, and other U.S. agencies. Evidence is particularly  sought from: industry sources worldwide; other U.S. organizations;  foreign governments; commercial, academic and classified data bases;  scientific and engineering research and development organizations; and  international trade fairs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Analysis. BIS will conduct its analysis by evaluating whether  the reasonable and reliable evidence that is   relevant to each of the foreign availability criteria provides a  sufficient basis to recommend a determination that foreign availability  does or does not exist.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Recommendation and determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Upon completion of each  assessment, BIS, on the basis of its analysis, will recommend that the  Secretary make a determination either that there is or that there is not  foreign availability, whichever the evidence supports. The assessment  upon which BIS bases its recommendation will accompany the  recommendation to the Secretary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> BIS will recommend on the basis of its analysis that the  Secretary determine that foreign availability exists to a country when  the available evidence demonstrates that an item of comparable quality  is available-in-fact to the country, from non-U.S. sources, in  sufficient quantity so that continuation of the existing national  security export control, or denial of the license application in  question on national security grounds, would be ineffective in achieving  its purpose. For a controlled country, such control or denial is  ``ineffective'' when comparable items are available-in-fact from foreign  sources in sufficient quantities so that maintaining such control or  denying a license would not be effective in restricting the availability  of items that would make a significant contribution to the military  potential of any country or combination of countries detrimental to the  national security of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Secretary will make the determination of foreign  availability on the basis of the BIS assessment and recommendation; the  Secretary's determination will take into account the evidence provided  to BIS, the recommendations of the Secretaries of Defense and State and  any other interested agencies, and any other information that the  Secretary considers relevant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For all decontrol and denied license assessments (under section  5(f)(3) of the EAA) initiated by a FAS, the Secretary will make a  determination within 4 months of the initiation of the assessment and  will notify the claimant. The Secretary will submit positive  determinations for review to the appropriate departments and agencies.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The deadlines for determinations based on self-initiated and  TAC-initiated assessments are different from the deadlines for claimant- initiated assessments (see paragraphs (f)(2) and (f)(3) of this  section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interagency review. BIS will notify all appropriate U.S.  agencies and Departments upon the initiation of an assessment and will  invite their participation in the assessment process. BIS will provide  all interested agencies and departments an opportunity to review source  material, draft analyses and draft assessments immediately upon their  receipt or production. For claimant-initiated assessments, BIS will  provide a copy of all positive recommendations and assessments to  interested agencies and departments for their review following the  Secretary's determination of foreign availability. For self-initiated  and TAC-initiated assessments, BIS will provide all interested agencies  an opportunity to review and comment on the assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> No later than 5 months after the initiation of  an assessment based on a FAS (claimant assessments), the Secretary will  inform the claimant in writing and will submit for publication in the  Federal Register a notice that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Foreign availability exists, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The requirement of a license has been removed or the license  application in question has been approved; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The President has determined that for national security purposes  the export controls must be maintained or the license application must  be denied, notwithstanding foreign availability, and that appropriate  steps to eliminate the foreign availability are being initiated; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> In the case of an item controlled multilaterally under the  former COCOM regime, the U.S. Government will conduct any necessary  consultations concerning the proposed decontrol or approval of the  license with the former COCOM regime for a period of up to 4 months from  the date of the publication of the determination in the Federal Register  (the U.S. Government may remove the license requirement for exports to  non-controlled   countries pending completion of the former COCOM regime review process);  or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Foreign availability does not exist.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For all TAC certification assessments, the Secretary will make a  foreign availability determination within 90 days following initiation  of the assessment. BIS will prepare and submit a report to the TAC and  to the Congress stating that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary has found foreign availability and has removed the  license requirement; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Secretary has found foreign availability, but has  recommended to the President that negotiations be undertaken to  eliminate the foreign availability; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The Secretary has not found foreign availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> There is no statutory deadline for assessments self-initiated by  the Secretary or for the resulting determination. However, BIS will make  every effort to complete such assessments and determinations promptly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Foreign availability to controlled countries. When the Secretary  determines that an item controlled for national security reasons is  available to a controlled country and the President does not issue a  National Security Override (NSO), BIS will submit the determination to  the Department of State, along with a draft proposal for the  multilateral decontrol of the item or for the former COCOM regime  approval of the license. The Department of State will submit the  proposal or the license for former COCOM regime review. The former COCOM  regime will have up to 4 months for review of the proposal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Foreign availability to non-controlled countries. If the  Secretary determines that foreign availability to non-controlled  countries exists, the Secretary will decontrol the item for export to  all non-controlled countries where it is found to be available, or  approve the license in question, unless the President exercises a  National Security Override.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Negotiations to eliminate foreign availability. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  President may determine that an export control must be maintained  notwithstanding the existence of foreign availability. Such a  determination is called a National Security Override (NSO) and is based  on the President's decision that the absence of the control would prove  detrimental to the United States national security. Unless extended (as  described in paragraph (i)(7) of this section), an NSO is effective for  6 months. Where the President invokes an NSO, the U.S. Government will  actively pursue negotiations with the government of any source country  during the 6 month period to eliminate the availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are two types of National Security Overrides:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting from  an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(f) of the EAA (claimant  and self-initiated assessments); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An NSO of a determination of foreign availability resulting  from an assessment initiated pursuant to section 5(h) of the EAA (TAC- certification assessments).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section  5(f) of the EAA, the Secretary of any agency may recommend that the  President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls or  deny the license notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under section  5(h) of the EAA, the Secretary of Commerce may recommend that the  President exercise the authority under the EAA to retain the controls  notwithstanding the finding of foreign availability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under  section 5(f) of the EAA, the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban  Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on International Relations of  the House of Representatives will be notified of the initiation of the  required negotiations. The notice will include an explanation of the  national security interest that necessitates the retention of controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Under an NSO resulting from an assessment initiated under  section 5(f) of the EAA, BIS will publish notices in the Federal  Register consisting of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Secretary's determination of foreign availability;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The President's decision to exercise the NSO;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A concise statement of the basis for the President's decision;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An estimate of the economic impact of the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The 6 month effective period for an NSO may be extended up to an  additional 12 months if, prior to the end of the 6 months, the President  certifies to Congress that the negotiations are progressing, and  determines that the absence of the controls would continue to be  detrimental to the United States national security.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> After the conclusion of negotiations, BIS will retain the  control only to the extent that foreign availability is eliminated. If  foreign availability is not eliminated, BIS will decontrol the item by  removing the requirement for a license for the export of the item to the  destinations covered by the assessment. To the extent that the  negotiations are successful and the foreign availability is eliminated,  BIS will remove the license requirement for the export of the item to  any country that has agreed to eliminate foreign availability.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Changes in foreign availability. If BIS becomes aware of  conditions, including new evidence, that affect a previous determination  that foreign availability exists or does not exist, BIS may review the  conditions. If BIS finds that the foreign availability previously  determined no longer exists, or that foreign availability not earlier  found now does exist, BIS will make a recommendation to the Secretary of  Commerce for the appropriate changes in the control. The Secretary of  Commerce will make a determination, and BIS will publish a Federal  Register notice of the determination.</p>
