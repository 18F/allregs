failure occurring before that date.

Second and subsequent offenses by persons are subject to an appropriate civil penalty between $10,000 and $100,000, as determined by the Commissioner or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Imposition of a civil penalty under this section does not prevent the United States from seeking any other remedy that may apply to the same conduct that is the basis for the imposition of the civil penalty.</p>
