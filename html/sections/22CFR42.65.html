In the case of the country of an alien's nationality and the country of an alien's current residence (as of the time of visa application) the term ``appropriate police authorities'' means those of a country, area or locality in which the alien has resided for at least six months. In the case of all other countries, areas, or localities, the term ``appropriate police authorities'' means the authorities of any country, area, or locality in which the alien has resided for at least one year. A consular officer may require a police certificate regardless of length of residence in any country if he or she has reason to believe that a police record exists in the country, area, or locality concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Police certificate means a certification by the police or other appropriate authorities reporting information entered in their records relating to the alien.

A certificate of discharge from the military forces or an enrollment book belonging to the applicant shall not be acceptable in lieu of the official military record, unless it shows the alien's complete record while in military service.

If the consular officer has reason to believe that a required record or document submitted by an applicant is not authentic or has been altered or tampered with in any material manner, the officer shall take such action as

may be necessary to determine its authenticity or to ascertain the facts to which the record or document purports to relate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Photographs.
