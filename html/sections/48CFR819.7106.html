                            <p class="depth0">Eligible business entities approved as mentors may enter into agreements (hereafter referred to as ``Mentor-Protege Agreement'' or ``Agreement'' and explained in 819.7108) with eligible Proteges. Mentors provide appropriate developmental assistance to enhance the capabilities of Proteges to perform as contractors and/or subcontractors. Eligible small business entities capable of providing developmental assistance may be approved as mentors. Proteges may participate in the program in pursuit of a prime contract or as subcontractors under the mentor's prime contract with VA, but are not required to be a subcontractor to a VA prime contractor or be a VA prime contractor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Eligibility. A Mentor:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> May be either a large or small business entity and either a prime contractor or subcontractor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must be able to provide developmental assistance that will enhance the ability of Proteges to perform as prime contractors or subcontractors; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Will be encouraged to enter into arrangements with entities with which

it has established business relationships.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility. A Protege:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Must be a SDVOSB or VOSB as defined in 802.101;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Must meet the size standard corresponding to the NAICS code that the Mentor prime contractor believes best describes the product or service being acquired by the subcontract; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Proteges may have multiple mentors. Proteges participating in mentor-Protege programs in addition to VA's Program should maintain a system for preparing separate reports of mentoring activity so that results of VA's Program can be reported separately from any other agency program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A Protege firm shall self-represent to a mentor firm that it meets the requirements set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. Mentors shall confirm eligibility by documenting the verified status of the Protege in the VetBiz.gov VIP database. Proteges must maintain verified status throughout the term of the Mentor-Protege Agreement. Failure to do so shall result in cancellation of the Agreement.</p>
