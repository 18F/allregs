                                Sec. 761.350  Subsampling from composite samples.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Preparing the composite. Composite the samples (eight from a flattened pile; eight or more from a conical pile; eight from waste that is continuously generated) and select a 19-liter subsample for shipment to the chemical extraction and analysis laboratory for further subsampling. There are two options for the preparation of the composite:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Option one. Place all of the contents of all 19-liter samples that you collected into a 209 liter (55 gallon) drum or similar sized, cylinder-shaped

container. Completely close the container, and roll it 10 or more complete revolutions to mix the contents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Option two. Add the 19-liter samples one at a time to a 209 liter (55 gallon) drum. Between the addition of each 19-liter sample, stir the composite using a broom handle or similar long, narrow, sturdy rod that reaches the bottom of the container. Stir the mixture for a minimum of 10 complete revolutions of the stirring instrument around the container at a distance approximately half way between the outside and center of the container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Selecting a 19-liter subsample from the composite. Once the composite is mixed, pour the mixture of waste out on a plastic sheet and either divide it into 19-liter size piles or make one large pile.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From 19-liter sized piles, use a random number generator or random number table to select one of the piles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From one large pile, flatten the pile to a depth of 30 cm and divide it into 4 quarters of equal size. Use a random number generator or random number table to select one quarter of the pile. Further divide the selected quarter pile into 19-liter portions and use a random number generator or random number table to select one 19-liter portion. A square having a 25 cm side or a circle having a diameter of approximately 28.5 cm when projected downwards 30 cm equals approximately 19 liters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Transferring the sample to the analytical laboratory. Place the selected 19-liter subsample in a container, approved for shipment of the sample, to the chemical extraction and analysis laboratory, for the next step in sample selection in accordance with Sec. 761.353.</p>
