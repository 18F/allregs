                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Easements Costing in Excess of $1,000. Curative action and clearance of title to easements costing in excess of $1,000 will be the same as in fee acquisitions, as outlined above, except as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Under an agreement with the Department of Justice, title to easements will be approved subject to outstanding encumbrances, such as mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, and vendors' liens, where the tract is not encumbered in excess of 50 percent of the reasonable value of the remaining property, and the consideration being paid for the easement does not represent a sum in excess of ten percent of the value of the remaining property. (As to taxes, see Sec. 644.70(k)(6).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For the purpose of making the determinations necessary to apply the formula set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, resort may be had to the tract appraisal, provided it is based on a ``before and after'' approach, in which case the amount of the ``after'' appraisal will be used as the reasonable value of the remaining property. In the event no such appraisal has been made, a memorandum estimate by a qualified appraiser (staff or contract) will be obtained. Determination of the total encumbrances may be made on the basis of the face of the encumbering instruments. However, if it is necessary to determine that the total amount of the outstanding liens as of the date of closing has been reduced to an amount less than 50 percent of the reasonable value of the remaining property, such reduction must be evidenced by signed statements from the lienees or their authorized representatives. The appraisal or memorandum estimate and the lienee statements will be placed in the tract file.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> On the basis of the determinations described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the appropriate information will be inserted on ENG Form 3536, Statement Concerning Outstanding Encumbrances, which will be signed by the closing agent. The original will appear as a separate document in the Final Title Assembly submitted to HQDA (DAEN-REA-P) WASH DC 20314.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Easements Costing Not in Excess of $1,000. (1) Requirements for the release or subordination to such easements of mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, taxes which are a lien, whether or not presently due and payable, and similar encumbrances will ordinarily be the same as for easements costing in excess of $1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements for the release or subordination to such easements of mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments, vendors' liens, taxes which are a lien, whether or not presently due and payable, and similar encumbrances will ordinarily be the same as for easements costing in excess of $1,000.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In unusual circumstances, these requirements need not be applied if the purchase price of the easement is insufficient to satisfy the liens and interest, or the amount of such liens or interest is small in comparision with the value

of the land in which the easement is being acquired, and in comparison with the cost of condemnation proceedings to clear the title. In such cases, the Division or District Engineer (or the Chief, Real Estate Division, if delegated such authority) may waive such title infirmities as he determines will not interfere with the use of the easement by the Government or jeopardize the interests of the United States: Provided:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The easement deed contains a general warranty covenant by the grantor to satisfy all such unpaid taxes and other liens and to warrant the title against any encumbrances or interests left outstanding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The Division or District Engineer (or the Chief, Real Estate Division, if delegated the authority) has determined that such outstanding liens, encumbrances, or interest, if left outstanding, will not interfere with the Government's use of the easement, or will not jeopardize the interests of the United States, and in his opinion the title is sufficient. A certificate to this effect should be attached to the Final Title Assembly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Curative action. (1) Curative action will be initiated promptly in all cases to eliminate all title defects or encumbrances, except those which may be administratively waived, those which may be eliminated by the payment of money and cleared at the time of closing, and those which may be waived as hereinafter provided. Curative material need not be recorded, however, until the closing of the transaction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Curative action will be initiated promptly in all cases to eliminate all title defects or encumbrances, except those which may be administratively waived, those which may be eliminated by the payment of money and cleared at the time of closing, and those which may be waived as hereinafter provided.
