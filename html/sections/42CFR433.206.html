                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)(1)</em>, and in accordance with States' Medicaid eligibility  criteria as in effect on December 1, 2009 and to attribute their  associated medical expenditures with the appropriate FMAP. The threshold  methodology must not be applied by States for the purpose of determining  the applicable FMAP for individuals under any other eligibility category  other than Sec.  435.119 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General principles. The threshold methodology should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Not impact the timing or approval of an individual's eligibility  for Medicaid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not be biased in such a manner as to inappropriately establish  the numbers of, or medical assistance expenditures for, individuals  determined to be newly or not newly eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Provide a valid and accurate accounting of individuals who would  have been eligible in accordance with the December 1, 2009 eligibility  standards and applicable eligibility categories for the benefits  described in Sec.  433.204(a)(1), and subject to paragraphs (d), (e),  and (g) of this section, by incorporating simplified assessments of  resources, enrollment cap requirements in place at that time, and other  special circumstances as approved by CMS, respectively.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Operate efficiently, without further review once an individual  has been determined not to be newly eligible based on the December 1,  2009 standards for any eligibility category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Components of the threshold methodology. Subject to the  submission of a threshold methodology State plan amendment as specified  in paragraph (h) of this section, the provisions of the threshold  methodology consist of two components, the individual income-based  determination and population-based non-income adjustments to reflect  resource criteria, enrollment caps in effect on December 1, 2009, and  other factors in accordance with paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Scope. The threshold methodology shall apply with respect to the  population, and the associated expenditures for such population, which  has been determined eligible for Medicaid under section  1902(a)(10)(A)(i)(VIII) of the Act and in accordance with Sec.  435.119  of this chapter. This population and associated expenditures must not  include individuals who have been determined eligible for Medicaid under  any other mandatory or optional eligibility category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Benefit criteria for newly eligible. An individual eligible for  and enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter is considered newly  eligible if, with respect to the applicable eligibility category in  effect on December 1, 2009, the benefits did not meet the criteria  described in the newly eligible definition at Sec.  433.204(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Individual income-based determination. The individual income- based determination shall be a comparison of the individual's MAGI-based  income to the income standard in effect on December 1, 2009, as  converted to an equivalent MAGI-based income standard for each  applicable eligibility category as in effect on that date, as follows.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount of an individual's income under the threshold  methodology is the MAGI-based income determined in accordance with Sec.   435.603 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For each individual, the equivalent MAGI-based income  eligibility standard is the applicable income eligibility standard for  the applicable category of eligibility as in effect on December 1, 2009  that is converted to an equivalent MAGI-based income standard. For  example, as applicable, a separate MAGI-based income standard will be  applied for individuals determined to be disabled who would have been  eligible under an optional eligibility category in effect on December 1,  2009 that was based on disability. For these purposes, the applicable  equivalent MAGI-based standard is the standard as submitted by the State  and approved by CMS in accordance with CMS guidance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the  individual's MAGI-based income is at or below the applicable converted  MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or  group, then the individual is included in the population that is not  newly eligible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> With respect to income eligibility criteria, if the  individual's MAGI-based income is greater than the applicable converted  MAGI-based income standard for the relevant eligibility category or  group, then the individual is included in the population that is newly  eligible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Treatment of spend-down programs. Treatment of medically needy  or spend-down programs under the threshold methodology is described in  paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> For purposes of comparing the individual's MAGI-based income to  the applicable converted MAGI-based income standard in effect on  December 1, 2009, an individual will not be considered disabled absent  an actual disability determination for the individual that is in  accordance with the disability definition applicable for the State under  Title XIX of the Act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Treatment of disability. For purposes of applying the  appropriate FMAP under Sec.  433.10(b) or (c) for the medical assistance  expenditures of an individual in applying the definition of newly  eligible under Sec.  433.204(a)(1), for eligibility categories or groups  as in effect on December 1, 2009 for which disability was an eligibility  criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> During the period of a disability determination. During the  period for which a disability determination is pending, including during  the period of any appeal process, and absent an actual disability  determination for the individual that is in accordance with the  disability definition applicable for the State under Title XIX of the  Act,   the individual is not considered to be disabled.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Following a disability determination. With respect to an  individual for which a disability determination was pending, following  the actual determination of disability, the individual will be  considered disabled effective with the date of the disability  determination, or, if later, the disability onset date, as determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Population-based adjustments to the populations of newly  eligible and not newly eligible. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The State may elect a resource  criteria proxy adjustment described in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> States that had a waiver or demonstration program with an  enrollment cap in effect as of December 1, 2009 must apply an adjustment  based on enrollment caps, subject to the definition of newly eligible  individual in Sec.  433.204(a)(1) and paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> States that have special circumstances may need to submit  associated proxy methodologies to CMS for approval by CMS as described  in paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Application of FMAP rates to adult group expenditures. Subject  to population adjustments under paragraphs (d), (e), or (g) of this  section, federal funding for a State's expenditures for medical  assistance provided to individuals determined eligible under Sec.   435.119 of this chapter, including individuals determined eligible under  that eligibility group during the evaluation for another eligibility  category, must be claimed using the applicable FMAP as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The newly eligible FMAP under Sec.  433.10(c)(6) is applicable  for the medical assistance expenditures for individuals determined to be  newly eligible, as defined in Sec.  433.204(a)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The applicable FMAP under Sec.  433.10(b) or Sec.  433.10(c)(7)  or (8) is applicable for the medical assistance expenditures for  individuals determined not to be newly eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Status as newly or not newly eligible. Under the threshold  methodology States must provide that once individuals are determined  under the threshold methodology to be either newly or not newly eligible  individuals in accordance with the applicable December 1, 2009  eligibility criteria, the State would apply that determination until a  new determination of MAGI-based income has been made in accordance with  Sec.  435.916 of this chapter, or the individual has been otherwise  determined not to be covered under the adult group set forth at Sec.   435.119 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em>, the State may use a resource proxy  methodology for purposes of adjusting the claims for the expenditures of  the population enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter to account  for individuals who would not have been eligible for Medicaid because of  the application of resource criteria as in effect for such population as  of December 1, 2009, and therefore would meet the newly eligible  individual definition at Sec.  433.204(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>. Under this paragraph (d),  a State may elect to apply a resource proxy methodology with respect to  the resource criteria as in effect on December 1, 2009 and applied to  the expenditures for a specific eligibility category or categories of  individuals as in effect on December 1, 2009, or applied to the  expenditures of the entire population enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of  this chapter. As provided in paragraph (d)(4) of this section, the State  must indicate any resource proxy election in the threshold methodology  State plan amendment submitted under paragraph (h) of this section. The  use of a resource proxy methodology must not delay or interfere with the  eligibility determination for an individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State's resource proxy methodology must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Describe each eligibility group or groups for which an  individual eligible under Sec.  435.119 would have been eligible on  December 1, 2009, subject to resource criteria, and a methodology to  apply those resource criteria as an adjustment to the total expenditures  to adjust determinations of the newly eligible population under  paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Be auditable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Be based on statistically valid data, which is either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Existing State data from and for periods before January 1, 2014  on the   resources of individuals who had applied and received a determination  with respect to Medicaid eligibility, including resource eligibility  under the State's applicable December 1, 2009 eligibility criteria. The  existing State data must be specifically related to resource eligibility  determinations, indicate the number and types of individuals for whom  resource determinations were made, and establish the denial rates  specifically identified as due to excess resources; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)(1)</em> and (2) of this section, based  on and obtained through a post-eligibility statistically valid sample of  such individuals with respect to the applicable Medicaid eligibility  categories and resource eligibility criteria under the State's  applicable December 1, 2009 eligibility criteria:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> State data from and for periods before January 1, 2014 must be  for individuals in eligibility categories relevant to Sec.  435.119 of  this chapter who apply and receive a determination with respect to  Medicaid eligibility, including both approvals and denials, to establish  denial rates specifically due to excess resources and identify numbers  and types of individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> State data from and for periods on or after January 1, 2014 must  only be for individuals determined eligible and enrolled under Sec.   435.119 of this chapter, must compare individuals' resources to the  applicable December 1, 2009 resource criteria to establish denial rates  specifically due to excess resources, and identify numbers and types of  individuals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Describe the State data on individuals' resources used and the  application of such data. Whether such State data is based on data  described in paragraph (d)(2)(iii)(A) or (B) of this section, such State  data must represent sampling results for a period of sufficient length  to be statistically valid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Provide that the resource proxy methodology will account for the  treatment of resources in a statistically valid manner when there is a  lack of sufficient information to make a resource determination for a  particular individual in a sampled population.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Describe the application of the resource proxy methodology in  establishing the amount and submission of claims for Federal funding by  the State for the medical assistance expenditures of the applicable  eligibility group(s). Such claims submitted under the resource proxy  methodology must reflect the appropriate FMAP for the medical assistance  expenditures of the affected eligibility group(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> As appropriate, describe and demonstrate the statistical  validity of the resource proxy methodology and the use of data under  such methodology.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Effective date for application of resource proxy. The resource  proxy shall not be effective prior to the beginning of the quarter in  which such resource proxy is submitted to CMS under the threshold  methodology State plan in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> One time election for resource proxy. The election, application,  and description of a resource proxy methodology under this paragraph for  individuals determined eligible under Sec.  435.119 must be included in  a one-time submission of a State plan amendment submitted under  paragraph (h) of this section no later than one year from the first day  of the quarter in which eligibility for individuals under Sec.  435.119  of this chapter is initially effective for the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Enrollment caps adjustment--(1) Scope. Certain States may have  applied enrollment caps, limits, or waiting lists in their Medicaid  programs as in effect on December 1, 2009. Under the definition of newly  eligible individual in Sec.  433.204(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, such States must consider as  newly eligible those individuals eligible under Sec.  435.119 of this  chapter who would otherwise be eligible for full benefits, benchmark  coverage, or benchmark equivalent coverage provided through a  demonstration under the State plan effective December 1, 2009, but would  not have been enrolled (or would have been on a waiting list) based on  the application of an enrollment cap or limit determined in accordance  with the approved demonstration as in effect on that date. Such   States must only apply such enrollment cap, limit or waiting list  provisions with respect to eligibility category or categories for which  such provisions were applicable (for example, nonpregnant childless  adults or parents/caretaker relatives) and in effect under the State's  Medicaid program on December 1, 2009. For this purpose, individuals who  would have been on a waiting list are considered as not enrolled under  the demonstration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A State for which multiple enrollment caps or limits were in  effect under its December 1, 2009 Medicaid program may elect to combine  such enrollment caps or limits, unless such treatment would preclude  claiming of Federal funding at the applicable FMAP rate required under  Sec.  433.10(b) or (c) (for example, to distinguish claims for childless  adults and parents in an expansion State) for the medical assistance  expenditures of individuals determined eligible and enrolled under Sec.   435.119 of this chapter; a State with enrollment cap or limit provisions  that would preclude combining enrollment caps or limit provisions must  use separate caps; or, the State, at its option, may elect to use  separate caps.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of claiming Federal funding, with respect to each  claiming period for which the State claims Federal funding for an  eligibility category for which an enrollment cap or limit is applicable  and in effect on December 1, 2009, the State must account for:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The total unduplicated number of individuals eligible and  enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter for the applicable claiming  period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The total State medical assistance expenditures for individuals  eligible and enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter for the  applicable claiming period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The enrollment cap or limit in effect on December 1, 2009 for  the eligibility category, determined in accordance with the approved  demonstration as in effect on December 1, 2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For States that elect under paragraph (e)(2) of this section to  combine the enrollment caps, the enrollment cap is the sum of the  enrollment caps for each eligibility group which is being combined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For States that elect to treat the enrollment caps separately  under paragraph (e)(2) of this section, each enrollment cap will be  accounted for separately.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The level of the enrollment cap will be as authorized under the  demonstration in effect on December 1, 2009; or, if the State had  affirmatively set the cap at a lower level consistent with flexibility  provided by the demonstration terms and conditions, the State may elect  to apply the lower cap as in effect in the State on December 1, 2009. If  a State elects to use such an alternate State-specified enrollment cap,  the State will provide CMS with evidence, in its State plan amendment  submitted to CMS under paragraph (h) of this section, that it had  affirmatively implemented such a cap. Whether the State uses the  authorized cap or a lower, verifiable cap as in effect in the State  consistent with the demonstration special terms and conditions, the  amount of expenditures up to the proportion of the 2009 enrollment cap  to the total number of currently enrolled people in the group would not  be claimed at the newly eligible FMAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> States for which an enrollment cap, limit, or waiting list was  applicable under their Medicaid programs as in effect on December 1,  2009, must describe the treatment of such provision or provisions in the  submission to CMS for approval by CMS in accordance with the State plan  requirements outlined in Sec.  433.206(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(2)</em> and (3) of this section apply, for purposes of determining  whether an individual enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter meets  the definition of newly eligible under Sec.  433.204(a)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>, and for  purposes of applying the appropriate FMAP under Sec.  433.10(b) or (c)  for the medical assistance expenditures of the   individual for which a spend-down eligibility category of a State  effective on December 1, 2009 is applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Not newly eligible individual. For purposes of a State's spend- down provision, an individual enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this  chapter whose income before the deduction of incurred medical expenses  is less than or equal to the applicable December 1, 2009 State spend- down eligibility income level that would have resulted in full benefits  is considered not newly eligible. The FMAP applicable for the medical  assistance expenditures of such an individual is the appropriate FMAP  under Sec.  433.10(b) and (c) as applicable for an individual who is not  newly eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Newly eligible individual. For purposes of a State's spend-down  provision, an individual enrolled under Sec.  435.119 of this chapter  whose income before the deduction of incurred medical expenses is  greater than the applicable State spend-down eligibility income level is  considered newly eligible. The FMAP applicable for the medical  assistance expenditures of such an individual is the appropriate FMAP  under Sec.  433.10(b) and (c) as applicable for an individual who is  newly eligible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Special circumstances. States may submit additional proxy  methodologies to CMS for approval by CMS in accordance with the State  plan requirements outlined in Sec.  433.206(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Threshold methodology State plan requirements. To claim  expenditures at the increased FMAPs described in Sec.  433.210(c)(6) or  (c)(8), the State must amend its State plan under the provisions of  subpart B of part 430 to reflect the threshold methodology the State  implements in accordance with the provisions of this section. The  threshold methodology will be included as an attachment to the State  plan and, explicitly and by reference, must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Specify that the threshold methodology the State implements is  in accordance with this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Specify that the threshold methodology the State implements  accounts for the individuals determined eligible under the adult group  in Sec.  435.119 of this chapter as a newly eligible individual or not  newly eligible individual; and, on that basis, the State implements  appropriate tracking for purpose of claiming Federal Medicaid funding  for the associated medical assistance expenditures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reference the converted MAGI-based December 1, 2009 income  eligibility standards and the associated eligibility groups, describe  how the State will apply such standards and methodologies, and include  other relevant criteria in the assignment of FMAP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Indicate any required provisions, or options and alternatives  the State elects, with respect to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treatment of resources, in accordance with paragraph (d) of this  section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment of enrollment caps or waiting lists, in accordance  with paragraph (e) of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Special circumstances as approved by CMS in accordance with  paragraph (g) of this section.
