(1) A foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more and that has a U.S. branch or U.S. agency must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Be subject on a consolidated basis to a capital stress testing regime by its home-country supervisor that meets the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conduct such stress tests or be subject to a supervisory stress test and meet any minimum standards set by its home-country supervisor with respect to the stress tests; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Provide to the Board the information required under paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The capital stress testing regime of a foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An annual supervisory capital stress test conducted by the foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor or an annual evaluation and review by the foreign banking organization's home-country supervisor of an internal capital adequacy stress test conducted by the foreign banking organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Requirements for governance and controls of stress testing practices by relevant management and the board of directors (or equivalent thereof) of the foreign banking organization;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Information requirements--(1) In general.

If, on a net basis, the U.S. branches and agencies of a foreign banking organization with combined U.S. assets of $50 billion or more provide funding to the foreign banking organization's non-U.S. offices and non-U.S. affiliates, calculated as the average daily position over a stress test cycle for a given year, the foreign banking organization must report the following information to the Board by January 5 of each calendar year, unless such date is extended by the Board:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of the methodologies used in the stress test, including those employed to estimate

losses, revenues, and changes in capital positions;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Estimates of realized losses or gains on available-for-sale and held-to-maturity securities, trading and counterparty losses, if applicable; and loan losses (dollar amount and as a percentage of average portfolio balance) in the aggregate and by material sub-portfolio; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any additional information that the Board requests.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Imposition of additional standards for capital stress tests. (1) Unless the Board otherwise determines in writing, a foreign banking organization that does not meet each of the requirements in paragraph (b)(1) and (2) of this section must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Maintain eligible assets in its U.S. branches and agencies that, on a daily basis, are not less than 108 percent of the average value over each day of the previous calendar quarter of the total liabilities of all U.S. branches and agencies of the foreign banking organization; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> To the extent that a foreign banking organization has not established a U.S. intermediate holding company, conduct an annual stress test of its U.S. subsidiaries to determine whether those subsidiaries have the capital necessary to absorb losses as a result of adverse economic conditions; and report to the Board on an annual basis a summary of the results of the stress test that includes the information required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section and any other information specified by the Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An enterprise-wide stress test that is approved by the Board may meet the stress test requirement of paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Intragroup funding restrictions or liquidity requirements for U.S. operations. If a foreign banking organization does not meet each of the requirements in paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section, the Board may require the U.S. branches and agencies of the foreign banking organization and, if the foreign banking organization has not established a U.S. intermediate holding company, any U.S. subsidiary of the foreign banking organization, to maintain a liquidity buffer or be subject to intragroup funding restrictions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Notice and response. If the Board determines to impose one or more conditions under paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the Board will notify the company before it applies the condition, and describe the basis for imposing the condition.
