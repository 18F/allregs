                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of certification, your vehicle family is considered in compliance with the emission standards in Sec.  1037.105 or Sec.  1037.106 if all vehicle configurations in that family have modeled CO2 emission rates (as specified in subpart F of this part) at or below the applicable standards. See 40 CFR part 86, subpart S, for showing compliance with the standards of Sec.  1037.104. Note that your FELs are considered to be the applicable emission standards with which you must comply if you participate in the ABT program in subpart H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Your vehicle family is deemed not to comply if any vehicle configuration in that family has a modeled CO2 emission rate that is above its FEL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may require you to provide an engineering analysis showing that the performance of your emission controls will not deteriorate during the useful life with proper maintenance. If we determine that your emission controls are likely to deteriorate during the useful life, we may require you to develop and apply deterioration factors consistent with good engineering judgment. For example, you may need to apply a deterioration factor to address deterioration of battery performance for an electric hybrid vehicle. Where the highest useful life emissions occur between the end of useful life and at the low-hour test point, base deterioration factors for the vehicles on the difference between (or ratio of) the point at which the highest emissions occur and the low-hour test point.</p>
