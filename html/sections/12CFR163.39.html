                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. A Federal savings association may enter into an employment contract with its officers and other employees only in accordance with the requirements of this section. All employment contracts shall be in writing and shall be approved specifically by an association's board of directors. An association shall not enter into an employment contract with any of its officers or other employees if such contract would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice. The making of such an employment contract would be an unsafe or unsound practice if such contract could lead to material financial loss or damage to the association or could interfere materially with the exercise by the members of its board of directors of their duty or discretion provided by law, charter, bylaw or regulation as to the employment or termination of employment of an officer or employee of the association. This may occur, depending upon the circumstances of the case, where an employment contract provides for an excessive term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Required provisions. Each employment contract shall provide that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal savings association's board of directors may terminate the officer or employee's employment at any time, but any termination by the association's board of directors other than termination for cause, shall not prejudice the officer or employee's right to compensation or other benefits under the contract. The officer or employee shall have no right to receive compensation or other benefits for any period after termination for cause. Termination for cause shall include termination because of the officer or employee's personal dishonesty, incompetence, willful misconduct, breach of fiduciary duty involving personal profit, intentional failure to perform stated duties, willful violation of any law, rule, or regulation (other than traffic violations or similar offenses) or final cease-and-desist order, or material breach of any provision of the contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the officer or employee is suspended and/or temporarily prohibited from participating in the conduct of the association's affairs by a notice served under section 8(e)(3) or (g)(1) of

the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(3) and (g)(1)), the association's obligations under the contract shall be suspended as of the date of service unless stayed by appropriate proceedings. If the charges in the notice are dismissed, the association may in its discretion (i) pay the officer or employee all or part of the compensation withheld while its contract obligations were suspended, and (ii) reinstate (in whole or in part) any of its obligations which were suspended.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the officer or employee is removed and/or permanently prohibited from participating in the conduct of the association's affairs by an order issued under section 8(e)(4) or (g)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1818(e)(4) or (g)(1)), all obligations of the association under the contract shall terminate as of the effective date of the order, but vested rights of the contracting parties shall not be affected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the savings association is in default (as defined in section 3(x)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act), all obligations under the contract shall terminate as of the date of default, but this paragraph (b)(4) shall not affect any vested rights of the contracting parties: Provided, that this paragraph (b)(4) need not be included in an employment contract if prior written approval is secured from the Comptroller or his or her designee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All obligations under the contract shall be terminated, except to the extent determined that continuation of the contract is necessary for the continued operation of the association;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By the Comptroller, or his or her designee, at the time the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation enters into an agreement to provide assistance to or on behalf of the association under the authority contained in 13(c) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)(A)</em> By the Comptroller or his or her designee, at the time the Comptroller, or his or her designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation of the association or when the association is determined by the Comptroller to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> By the Comptroller or his or her designee, at the time the Comptroller, or his or her designee approves a supervisory merger to resolve problems related to operation of the association or when the association is determined by the Comptroller to be in an unsafe or unsound condition.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Any rights of the parties that have already vested, however, shall not be affected by such action.</p>
