                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Under section 305, a distribution made by a  corporation to its shareholders in its stock or in rights to acquire its  stock is not included in gross income except as provided in section  305(b) and the regulations promulgated under the authority of section  305(c). A distribution made by a corporation to its shareholders in its  stock or rights to acquire its stock which would not otherwise be  included in gross income by reason of section 305 shall not be so  included merely because such distribution was made out of   Treasury stock or consisted of rights to acquire Treasury stock. See  section 307 for rules as to basis of stock and stock rights acquired in  a distribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> and Sec. 1.301-1, is the fair market value of such stock  or rights on the date of distribution. See Example </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of Sec. 1.305- 2(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of Sec. 1.305-2(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For rules for determining the amount of the distribution where  certain transactions, such as changes in conversion ratios or periodic  redemptions, are treated as distributions under section 305(c), see  Examples (6), (8), (9), and (15) of Sec. 1.305-3(e).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adjustment in purchase price. A transfer of stock (or rights to  acquire stock) or an increase or decrease in the conversion ratio or  redemption price of stock which represents an adjustment of the price to  be paid by the distributing corporation in acquiring property (within  the meaning of section 317(a)) is not within the purview of section 305  because it is not a distribution with respect to its stock. For example,  assume that on January 1, 1970, pursuant to a reorganization,  corporation X acquires all the stock of corporation Y solely in exchange  for its convertible preferred class B stock. Under the terms of the  class B stock, its conversion ratio is to be adjusted in 1976 under a  formula based upon the earnings of corporation Y over the 6-year period  ending on December 31, 1975. Such an adjustment in 1976 is not covered  by section 305.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.305-2 through 1.305-7, the term stock includes rights or warrants to  acquire such stock.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 1.305-2 through 1.305-7, the term  shareholder includes a holder of rights or warrants or a holder of  convertible securities.  [T.D. 7281, 38 FR 18532, July 12, 1973; 38 FR 19910, July 25, 1973]</p>
