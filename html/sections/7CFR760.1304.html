                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment under DELAP will only be made to producers, but the  dairy ``operation'' must first qualify its production within limits  provided for in this subpart in order to have the individuals or  entities that qualify as ``producers'' receive payment subject to  whatever additional limits (such as the adjusted gross income provisions  of these regulations) apply. As needed the agency may construe the terms  of this regulation in any manner needed to facilitate and expedite  payments using existing data and records from other assistance programs.  Further, those parties (State and local governments and their political  subdivisions and related agencies) excluded from the MILC program will  not be eligible for DELAP payments notwithstanding any other provision  of these regulation. That said, to be eligible to receive payments under  this subpart, a dairy producer in the United States must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Have produced milk in the United States and commercially  marketed the milk produced any time during February 2009 through July  2009;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be a producer, as defined in Sec. 760.1302;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provide FSA with proof of milk production commercially marketed  by all dairy producers in the dairy operation during February 2009  through July 2009; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Submit an accurate and complete request for benefits as  specified in Sec. 760.1303, if production data is not available in the  FSA county office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To be eligible to receive a payment, each producer in an  eligible dairy operation must meet the average adjusted gross income  eligibility requirements of 7 CFR part 1400. No person or entity will be  eligible to receive any payment or direct or indirect benefit under this  subpart if their annual average adjusted nonfarm income is over $500,000  as determined under 7 CFR part 1400. In the case of indirect benefits,  direct benefits to other parties will be reduced accordingly. This will  mean that all of the attribution rules of part 1400 will apply. For  example if Individual A is over the limit and owns 100 percent of  Corporation C which had a 20 percent interest in Corporation B which had  a 50 percent interest in milk producer Corporation A, the AGI of  Individual A would result in a 10 percent (100 percent times 20 percent  times 50 percent) loss in benefits to Corporation A. For DELAP, the  relevant period for the annual average adjusted nonfarm income is 2005  through 2007.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual dairy producers in a dairy operation that is an  entity are only eligible for a payment based on their share of the dairy  operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> No payment will be made to any other producer based on the share  of any dairy producer who exceeds the income limit or who, because of  the attribution rules, has their payment reduced.</p>
