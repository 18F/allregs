For purposes of part 4 of this chapter, ``Rattlesnake Hills'' is a term of viticultural significance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approved Maps. The appropriate maps for determining the boundaries of the Rattlesnake Hills viticultural area are eight United States Geological Survey 1:24,000 scale topographic maps. They are titled:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Yakima East Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1953, photorevised 1985;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Elephant Mountain Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1953, photorevised 1985;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Granger NW Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1965;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Granger NE Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1964;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Sunnyside Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1965, photorevised 1978;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Granger Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1965;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Toppenish Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1958, photorevised 1985; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Wapato Quadrangle, Washington--Yakima Co., 1958, photorevised 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Boundary. The Rattlesnake Hills viticultural area is located in Yakima County, Washington. The area's boundary is defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The beginning point is on the Yakima East map at the point where a line drawn straight east from the west end of the Wapato Dam on the Yakima River intersects Interstate Highway 82, section 17, T12N/R19E.
