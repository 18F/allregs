                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Farms will be reconstituted in accordance with this subpart when  it is   determined that the land areas are not properly constituted and, to the  extent practicable as determined by county committee, the reconstitution  will be based on the facts and conditions existing at the time the  change requiring the reconstitution occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reconstitutions will be effective for the calendar year if  initiated by August 1 of that year. Any reconstitution initiated after  August 1 will not be effective for that year; it will be effective for  the subsequent year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Deputy Administrator may approve an exception to permit a  reconstitution initiated after August 1 to be effective for the same  year, if FSA determines that the failure is due to administrative  problems as determined by FSA at the local or national level. Producers  have no right to seek an exception under this paragraph. When such  situations exist, FSA will establish procedures under which  reconstitutions will be accepted.
