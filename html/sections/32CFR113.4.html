In any case in which the maximum percentage would be exceeded, garnishments and involuntary allotments for spousal and child support shall take precedence over involuntary allotments authorized under 32 CFR part 112 and this part. Involuntary allotments established under 32 CFR part 112 and this part shall be reduced or stopped as necessary to avoid exceeding the maximum percentage allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Truth in Lending Act (15 U.S.C. 1601 note, 1601-1614, 1631-1646, 1661-1666j, and 1667-1667e) prescribes the general disclosure requirements that must be met by those offering or extending consumer credit and Federal Reserve Board Regulation Z (12 CFR 226) prescribes the specific disclosure requirements for both open-end and installment credit transactions. In place of Federal Government requirements, State regulations apply to credit transactions when the Federal Reserve Board has determined that the State regulations impose substantially similar requirements and provide adequate enforcement measures. Commanding officers, with the assistance of judge advocates, should check regulations of the Federal Reserve Board to determine whether Federal or State laws and regulations govern.</p>
