                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Military service may be creditable under both the Railroad  Retirement and Social Security Acts, but there are provisions under  those Acts to prevent duplicate use of the service. The Railroad  Retirement Board will determine whether an employee's military service  should be used as railroad service or as Social Security service. The  Board's determination is intended to be to the employee's advantage;  however, if the employee does not agree with the Board's determination  for use of the employee's military service, the employee may request  that it be changed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generally, it is to the employee's advantage for the employee's  military service to be creditable as railroad service where any of the  following conditions may be met with the use of the employee's military  service as railroad service:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It gives the employee 10 years of service (120 months), which is  the minimum needed to qualify for an annuity based on age and service or  total disability, as provided for in part 216, subpart B; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> It gives the employee 20 years of service (240 months), which is  the minimum needed to qualify for an occupational disability annuity, as  provided for in Sec. 216.6 of this chapter; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> It gives the employee 25 years of service (300 months), which is  the minimum needed to qualify for a supplemental annuity, as provided  for in part 216, subpart C; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It gives the employee 30 years of service (360 months), which  would allow the employee to retire at age 60 with a full annuity and  will also provide a full annuity to a qualified spouse at age 60, as  provided for in part 216, subparts B and D; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It gives the employee sufficient railroad service to entitle the  employee to vested dual benefit payments, as provided for in part 216,  subpart H.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In certain cases it may be to the employee's advantage for the  employee's military service to be credited under the Social Security  Act. This is generally true under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Crediting the military service under the Social Security Act  would entitle the employee and any eligible children to social security  benefits, since direct benefits are not payable to   children of retired employees under the Railroad Retirement Act; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Crediting the military service under the Social Security Act  would entitle employee to vested dual benefit payments.</p>
