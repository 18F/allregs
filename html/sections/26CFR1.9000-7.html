                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Additions to tax under section 294(d) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939. Any addition to the tax under section 294(d) (relating to  estimated tax) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1939 shall be computed as  if the tax for the year for which the estimate was made were computed  with sections 452 and 462 still applicable to such taxable year. For the  purpose of the preceding sentence, it is not necessary for the taxpayer  actually to have made an election under section 452 or 462; it is only  necessary for the taxpayer to have taken such sections into account in  estimating its tax liability for the year. Thus, if in determining the  amount of estimated tax, the taxpayer computed his estimated tax  liability by applying those sections, that portion of any additions to  tax under section 294(d) resulting from the repeal of sections 452 and  462 shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Additions to tax under section 6654. In the case of an  underpayment of estimated tax, any additions to the tax under section  6654, with respect to installments due before December 15, 1955, shall  be computed without regard to any increase in tax resulting from the  repeal of sections 452 and 462. Any additions to the tax with respect to  installments due on or after December 15, 1955, shall be imposed in  accordance with the applicable provisions of the Code, and as though  sections 452 and 462 had not been enacted. Thus, a taxpayer whose  declaration of estimated tax was based upon an estimate of his taxable  income for the year of the estimate which was determined by taking  sections 452 and 462 into account, must file an amended declaration on  or before the due date of the next installment of estimated tax due on  or after December 15, 1955. Such amended declaration shall reflect an  estimate of the tax without the application of such sections. If the  taxpayer bases his estimate on the tax for the preceding taxable year  under section 6654(d)(1)(A), an amended declaration must be filed on or  before the due date of the next installment due on or after December 15,  1955, if the tax for the preceding taxable year is increased as the  result of the repeal of sections 452 and 462. Similarly, if the taxpayer  bases his estimate on the tax computed under section 6654(d)(1)(B), he  must file an amended declaration on or before the due date of the next  installment due on or after December 15, 1955, taking into account the  repeal of sections 452 and 462 with respect to the preceding taxable  year. Any increase in estimated tax shown on an amended declaration  filed in accordance with this paragraph must be paid in accordance with  section 6153(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Estimated tax of corporations. Corporations required to file a  declaration of estimated tax under section 6016 for taxable years ending  on and after December 31, 1955, shall estimate their tax liability for  such year as if sections   452 and 462 had not been enacted. Thus, if the corporation bases its  estimated tax liability under section 6655(d) (1) or (2) on its  operations for the preceding taxable year, the effect of the repeal of  sections 452 and 462 with respect to such year must be taken into  account.</p>
