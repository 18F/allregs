                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The frequencies assignable to AMTS stations are listed in  subpart H of this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The transmissions from a station of an AMTS geographic area  licensee may not exceed a predicted 38 dBu field strength at the  geographic area border, unless all affected co-channel geographic area  licensees agree to the higher field strength. The predicted 38 dBu field  strength is calculated using the F(50, 50) field strength chart for  Channels 7 through 13 in Sec. 73.699 (Fig. 10) of this chapter, with a  9 dB correction factor for antenna height differential. Geographic area  licensees must coordinate to minimize interference at or near their  geographic area borders, and must cooperate to resolve any instances of  interference in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 80.70(a).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> AMTS frequencies may be used for mobile-to-mobile communications  if written consent is obtained from all affected licensees.
