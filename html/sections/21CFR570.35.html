The failure of any person to come forward with  proof of such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of  filing will constitute a waiver of the right to assert or rely on such  sanction at any later time. The notice of filing will also constitute a  proposal to establish a regulation under this subchapter E,  incorporating the same provisions, in the event that such a regulation  is determined to be appropriate as a result of submission of proof of  such an applicable prior sanction in response to the notice of filing.
