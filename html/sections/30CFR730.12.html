                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Not later than January 3, 1981, for each State in which coal  exploration and surface coal mining and reclamation operations are or  may be conducted on non-Federal and non-Indian land, either a State  program or a Federal program adopted under this subchapter shall be in  effect. However, the inability of a State to take any action the purpose  of which is to prepare, submit or enforce a State program, or any part  thereof, because the action is enjoined by the issuance of an injunction  by any court of competent jurisdiction   shall not result in the imposition of a Federal program for regulation  of surface coal mining and reclamation operations. Regulation of surface  coal mining and reclamation operations covered or to be covered by the  State program subject to an injunction shall be conducted by the State  pursuant to section 502 of the Act until such time as the injunction  terminates or for one year from issuance of the injunction, whichever is  shorter, at which time the requirements of sections 503 and 504 shall  again be fully applicable. States in which no coal exploration or  surface coal mining and reclamation operations are in existence or  planned on January 3, 1981, on non-Federal and non-Indian lands but in  which such exploration or operations may occur at some later date, shall  have a State or Federal program in effect before commencement of any  such exploration or operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State shall notify the Director of the issuance of any  injunction which prevents or prohibits the State from preparing,  submitting or enforcing a State program or portion thereof.
