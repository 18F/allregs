                            <p class="depth0">Section 86.113-15 includes text that specifies requirements that  differ from Sec. 86.113-94. Where a paragraph in Sec. 86.113-94 is  identical and applicable to Sec. 86.113-15, this may be indicated by  specifying the corresponding paragraph and the statement ``[Reserved].  For guidance see Sec. 86.113-94.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> for  vehicles that are not yet subject to testing with the new fuel. You may  use the specified ethanol-blend test fuel anytime earlier than we  specify as long as you use the corresponding procedures for measuring  and calculating emission results. See 40 CFR 600.117 for special  provisions that apply for emission measurements related to fuel economy  and greenhouse gases. Manufacturers must certify using E10 test fuel as  specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subpart H, and service accumulation fuel  meeting applicable specifications as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except as allowed under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, Use  E10 test fuel to demonstrate compliance with the Tier 3 exhaust emission  standards as specified in Sec. 86.1811 and 86.1816, and to demonstrate  compliance with the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards as specified  in Sec. 86.1813.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You may use California test fuels to demonstrate compliance with  Tier 3 emission standards as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For vehicles certified for 50-state sale, you may instead use  California Phase 3 gasoline (E10) as adopted in California's LEV III  program for exhaust emission testing. Through model year 2019, we will  also use this E10 fuel for any low-altitude exhaust emission testing  with such vehicles. Starting in model year 2020, we may use test fuel  meeting either California Phase 3 gasoline (E10) or the gasoline (E10)  test fuel specified in this paragraph (a). For cold temperature testing  and for exhaust emission tests at high-altitude conditions, you may  certify vehicles through model year 2019 based on testing with the  gasoline (E0) test fuel specified in Sec. 86.113-04(a); for such  vehicles, we may use test fuel meeting either the gasoline (E0) test  fuel specified in Sec. 86.113-04(a) or the gasoline (E10) test fuel  specified in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>, use the E10 test fuel specified in 40 CFR  1065.710 for cold temperature testing and high-altitude testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For vehicles certified for 50-state sale, you may instead use  California test fuel for evaporative emission testing as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If you originally certified vehicles in California in model year  2015 or 2016 to PZEV standards with California Phase 2 gasoline, you may  use that data with carryover vehicles to certify to the Tier 3  evaporative emission standards through model year 2019. We will use this  same fuel to measure diurnal, hot soak, running loss, and SHED rig  emissions at low-altitude conditions for such vehicles. For refueling,  spitback, and high-altitude testing, you may use test fuel meeting  either the gasoline (E0) test fuel specified in Sec. 86.113-04(a) or the  gasoline (E10) test fuel specified in this paragraph (a); we may use  either of the specified fuels for our testing. For leak testing, you  must use the gasoline (E10) test fuel specified in this paragraph (a).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If you certify vehicles to LEV III standards with California  Phase 3 gasoline (E10), you may use that collection of data to certify  to the Tier 3 evaporative emission standards. Through model year 2019,  we will use this same fuel to measure diurnal, hot soak, running loss,  SHED rig, and canister bleed emissions (as appropriate) at low-altitude  conditions; starting in model year 2020, we may use either California  Phase 3 gasoline (E10) or the gasoline (E10) test fuel specified in this  paragraph (a) for our testing with such vehicles. For refueling,  spitback, high-altitude, and leak testing, you must use the gasoline  (E10) test fuel specified in this paragraph (a), except that you may  instead use the gasoline (E0) test fuel specified in Sec. 86.113-04(a)  for model year 2015 and 2016; we will use your selected fuel for our  testing. Note that you may no longer certify vehicles to the Tier 3  standards based on California's rig-testing procedures after model year  2021, as described in Sec. 86.1813-17(g).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For evaporative emission testing with California test fuels,  perform tests based on the test temperatures specified by the California  Air Resources Board.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>, use E10 test fuel to demonstrate compliance  with the refueling and spitback emission standards for any vehicles that  must be certified to meet the diurnal plus hot soak standards with E10  test fuel under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section. You may delay  using E10 test fuel until model year 2022 for incomplete heavy-duty  vehicles not certified to refueling emission standards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a vehicle uses E10 test fuel for evaporative emission testing  and E0 is the applicable test fuel for exhaust emission testing, exhaust  measurement and reporting requirements apply over the course of the  evaporative emission test, but the vehicle need not meet the exhaust  emission standards during the evaporative emission test run.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> For service accumulation, use a commercially available fuel,  subject to the additional specification in Sec. 86.1824-08(f) for  evaporative emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> through (g) [Reserved].
