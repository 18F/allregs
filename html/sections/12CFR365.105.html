The examples in this appendix are not all inclusive. They  illustrate only the issue described and do not illustrate any other  issues that may arise under this subpart. For purposes of the examples  below, the term ``loan'' refers to a residential mortgage loan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Taking a loan application. The following examples illustrate  when an employee takes, or does not take, a loan application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Taking an application includes: receiving information provided  in connection with a request for a loan to be used to determine whether  the consumer qualifies for a loan, even if the employee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has received the consumer's information indirectly in order to  make an offer or negotiate a loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Is not responsible for verifying information;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is inputting information into an online application or other  automated system on behalf of the consumer; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is not engaged in approval of the loan, including determining  whether the consumer qualifies for the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Taking an application does not include any of the following  activities performed solely or in combination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Contacting a consumer to verify the information in the loan  application by obtaining documentation, such as tax returns or payroll  receipts;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Receiving a loan application through the mail and forwarding  it, without review, to loan approval personnel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Assisting a consumer who is filling out an application by  clarifying what type of information is necessary for the application or  otherwise explaining the qualifications or criteria necessary to obtain  a loan product;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Describing the steps that a consumer would need to take to  provide information to be used to determine whether the consumer  qualifies for a loan or otherwise explaining the loan application  process;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In response to an inquiry regarding a prequalified offer that a  consumer has received from a bank, collecting only basic identifying  information about the consumer and forwarding the consumer to a mortgage  loan originator; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Receiving information in connection with a modification to the  terms of an existing loan to a borrower as part of the bank's loss  mitigation efforts when the borrower is reasonably likely to default.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Offering or negotiating terms of a loan. The following examples  are designed to illustrate when an employee offers or negotiates terms  of a loan, and conversely, what does not constitute offering or  negotiating terms of a loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Offering or negotiating the terms of a loan includes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Presenting a loan offer to a consumer for acceptance, either  verbally or in writing, including, but not limited to, providing a  disclosure of the loan terms after application under the Truth in  Lending Act, even if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Further verification of information is necessary;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The offer is conditional;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Other individuals must complete the loan process; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Only the rate approved by the bank's loan approval mechanism  function for a specific loan product is communicated without authority  to negotiate the rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Responding to a consumer's request for a lower rate or lower  points on a pending loan application by presenting to the consumer a  revised loan offer, either verbally or in writing, that includes a lower  interest rate or lower points than the original offer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Offering or negotiating terms of a loan does not include solely  or in combination:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Providing general explanations or descriptions in response to  consumer queries regarding qualification for a specific loan product,  such as explaining loan terminology (i.e., debt-to-income ratio);  lending policies (i.e., the loan-to-value ratio policy of the insured  State nonmember bank); or product-related services;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In response to a consumer's request, informing a consumer of  the loan rates that are publicly available, such as on the insured State  nonmember bank's Web site, for specific types of loan products without  communicating to the consumer whether qualifications are met for that  loan product;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Collecting information about a consumer in order to provide  the consumer with information on loan products for which the consumer  generally may qualify, without presenting a specific loan offer to the  consumer for acceptance, either verbally or in writing;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Arranging the loan closing or other aspects of the loan  process, including communicating with a consumer about those  arrangements, provided that communication with the consumer only  verifies loan terms already offered or negotiated;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Providing a consumer with information unrelated to loan terms,  such as the best days of the month for scheduling loan closings at the  bank;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Making an underwriting decision about whether the consumer  qualifies for a loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Explaining or describing the steps or process that a consumer  would need to take in order to obtain a loan offer, including  qualifications or criteria that would need to be met without providing  guidance specific to that consumer's circumstances; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Communicating on behalf of a mortgage loan originator that a  written offer, including disclosures provided pursuant to the Truth in  Lending Act, has been sent to a consumer without providing any details  of that offer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offering or negotiating a loan for compensation or gain. The  following examples illustrate when an employee does or does not offer or  negotiate terms of a loan ``for compensation or gain.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> of this  Appendix in the course of carrying out employment duties, even if the  employee does not receive a referral fee or commission or other special  compensation for the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Offering or negotiating terms of a loan for compensation or gain  does not include engaging in a seller-financed transaction for the  employee's personal property that does not involve the insured State  nonmember bank.</p>
