For freshly manufactured locomotives, a description of the basic locomotive design. For remanufactured locomotives, a description of the basic locomotive designs to which the remanufacture system will be applied. Include in your description, a list of distinguishable configurations to be included in the engine family. Note whether you are requesting a certificate that will or will not cover idle controls.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An explanation of how the emission control system operates, including detailed descriptions of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All emission control system components.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Injection or ignition timing for each notch (i.e., degrees before or after top-dead-center), and any functional

dependence of such timing on other operational parameters (e.g., engine coolant temperature).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Each auxiliary emission control device (AECD).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All fuel system components to be installed on any production or test locomotives.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Diagnostics.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of the test locomotive.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of the test equipment and fuel used. Identify any special or alternate test procedures you used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the operating cycle and the period of operation necessary to accumulate service hours on the test locomotive and stabilize emission levels. You may also include a Green Engine Factor that would adjust emissions from zero-hour engines to be equivalent to stabilized engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A description of all adjustable operating parameters (including, but not limited to, injection timing and fuel rate), including the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The nominal or recommended setting and the associated production tolerances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The intended adjustable range, and the physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The limits or stops used to limit adjustable ranges.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Production tolerances of the limits or stops used to establish each physically adjustable range.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Information relating to why the physical limits or stops used to establish the physically adjustable range of each parameter, or any other means used to inhibit adjustment, are the most effective means possible of preventing adjustment of parameters to settings outside your specified adjustable ranges on in-use engines.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Projected U.S. production information for each configuration. If you are projecting substantially different sales of a configuration than you had previously, we may require you to explain why you are projecting the change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)(i)</em> All test data you obtained for each test engine or locomotive. As described in Sec.  1033.235, we may allow you to demonstrate compliance based on results from previous emission tests, development tests, or other testing information. Include data for NOx, PM, HC, CO, and CO2.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All test data you obtained for each test engine or locomotive.

Small manufacturers/remanufacturers may omit reporting N2O and CH4.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The intended deterioration factors for the engine family, in accordance with Sec.  1033.245. If the deterioration factors for the engine family were developed using procedures that we have not previously approved, you should request preliminary approval under Sec.  1033.210.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The intended useful life period for the engine family, in accordance with Sec.  1033.101(g). If the useful life for the engine family was determined using procedures that we have not previously approved, you should request preliminary approval under Sec.  1033.210.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Copies of your proposed emission control label(s), maintenance instructions, and installation instructions (where applicable).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> An unconditional statement declaring that all locomotives included in the engine family comply with all requirements of this part and the Clean Air Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If we request it, you must supply such additional information as may be required to evaluate the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Provide the information to read, record, and interpret all the information broadcast by a locomotive's onboard computers and electronic control units. State that, upon request, you will give us any hardware, software, or tools we would need to do this. You may reference any appropriate publicly released standards that define conventions for these messages and parameters. Format your information consistent with publicly released standards.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Include the information required by other subparts of this part. For example, include the information required by Sec.  1033.725 if you participate in the ABT program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Include other applicable information, such as information specified in this part or part 1068 of this chapter related to requests for exemptions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Name an agent for service located in the United States.
