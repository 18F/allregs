                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The proprietor must label each bottle or other container of beverage wine prior to removal for consumption or sale. The minimum type size for information required by this section is: 2 millimeters for containers of more than 187 milliliters and 1 millimeter for containers of 187 milliliters or less. The maximum type size for alcohol content statements is 3 millimeters unless the container is larger than 5 liters. The label must be securely affixed and show:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The name and address of the wine premises where bottled or packed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The brand name, if different from above;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The alcohol content as percent by volume or the alcohol content stated in accordance with 27 CFR part 4. For wine with less than 7 percent alcohol by volume stated on the label there is allowed an alcohol content tolerance of plus or minus .75 percent by volume; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The kind of wine, shown as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If the wine contains 7 percent or more alcohol by volume and must have label approval under 27 CFR part 4, the kind of wine is the class, type, or other designation provided in that part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If the wine has an exemption from label approval, an adequate statement of composition may be used instead of the class and type in 27 CFR part 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If the wine contains less than 7 percent alcohol by volume, an adequate statement of composition may be used instead of the class and type in 27 CFR part 4. The rules in 27 CFR part 4 pertaining to label approval and standards of fill do not apply to wine under 7 percent alcohol by volume. The rules in 27 CFR part 16 requiring a Health Warning Statement do apply to all wines over \1/2\ percent alcohol. Except for the rules noted in this section, labeling of wines under 7 percent alcohol is under the jurisdiction of the Food and Drug Administration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The statement of composition must include enough information to identify the tax class when viewed with the alcohol content. First, the wine should be identified by the word ``wine,'' ``mead,'' ``cider'' or ``perry,'' as applicable. If the wine contains more than 0.392 grams of carbon dioxide per 100 milliliters, the word ``sparkling'' or ``carbonated,'' as applicable, must be

included in the statement of composition. If the statement of composition leaves doubt as to the tax class of the wine, the wine must be marked ``tax class 5041(b)(1) IRC'' or an equivalent phrase. For example, a still wine marked ``wine'' and ``16 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(2). A still wine marked ``hard cider'' and ``9 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine marked ``raspberry hard cider'' and ``9 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(1). A still wine eligible for the hard cider tax rate marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' is adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(6). However, if a still wine that is not eligible for the hard cider tax rate is marked ``cider'' or ``hard cider'' and ``6 percent alcohol by volume'' it is not adequately marked to identify its tax class as 5041(b)(1), so the tax class must be shown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The net content of the container unless the net content is permanently marked on the container as provided in 27 CFR part 4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The information shown on any label applied to bottled or packed wine is subject to the recordkeeping requirements of Sec. 24.314. (Sec. 201, Pub. L. 85-859, 72 Stat. 1381, as amended, 1407, as amended (26 U.S.C. 5368, 5388, 5662))</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Use of semi-generic designations--(1) In general. Semi-generic designations may be used to designate wines of an origin other than that indicated by such name only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> There appears in direct conjunction therewith an appropriate appellation of origin, as defined in part 4 of this chapter, disclosing the true place of origin of the wine, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The wine so designated conforms to the standard of identity, if any, for such wine contained in part 4 of this chapter or, if there is no such standard, to the trade understanding of such class or type.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of whether a name is semi-generic--(i) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, a name of geographic significance, which is also the designation of a class or type of wine, shall be deemed to have become semi-generic only if so found by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Certain names treated as semi-generic. The following names shall be treated as semi-generic: Angelica, Burgundy, Claret, Chablis, Champagne, Chianti, Malaga, Marsala, Madeira, Moselle, Port, Rhine Wine or Hock, Sauterne, Haut Sauterne, Sherry, Tokay.
