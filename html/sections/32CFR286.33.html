If a Component believes that ``average'' (mean) processing time is a better measure of performance, then report ``averages'' (means) as well as median values (e.g., with data reflected and plainly labeled on plain bond as an attachment to the report). However, ``average'' (mean) values will not be included in the consolidated DoD report unless all Components report it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Item 6: Number of initial requests received during the fiscal year.
