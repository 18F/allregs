                                Sec. 1710.102  Borrower eligibility for different types of loans.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Insured loans under section 305. Insured loans are normally reserved for the financing of distribution and subtransmission facilities of both distribution and power supply borrowers, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems. In accordance with Sec. 1710.110, the Administrator may require the borrower to obtain no more than 30 percent of the total debt financing required for a proposed project by means of a supplemental loan from another lender without an RUS guarantee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Direct loans under section 4. Direct loans are normally reserved for the financing of distribution and subtransmission facilities of both distribution and power supply borrowers, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy efficiency and energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> One hundred percent loan guarantees under section 306. Both distribution and power supply borrowers are eligible for 100 percent loan guarantees under section 306 of the RE Act for any or all of the purposes set forth in Sec. 1710.106, including, under certain circumstances, the implementation of demand side management, energy conservation programs, and on grid and off grid renewable energy systems. (See 7 CFR part 1712). These guarantees are normally used to finance bulk transmission and generation facilities, but they may also be used to finance distribution and subtransmission facilities. If a borrower applies for a section 306 loan guarantee to finance all or a portion of distribution and subtransmission facilities, such request will not affect the borrower's eligibility for an insured loan to finance any remaining portion of said facilities or for any future insured loan to finance other distribution or subtransmission facilities. A section 306 loan guarantee, however, may not be used to guarantee a supplemental loan required by Sec. 1710.110.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> One hundred percent loan guarantees under section 306A. Under section 306A of the RE Act, both distribution and power supply borrowers are eligible under certain conditions to use an existing section 306 guarantee to refinance advances made on or before July 2, 1986 from a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank. (See 7 CFR part 1786.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Ninety percent guarantees of private-sector loans under section 311. Under section 311 of the RE Act, both distribution and power supply borrowers in the state of Alaska are eligible under certain conditions to obtain from RUS a 90 percent guarantee of a private-sector loan to refinance their Federal Financing Bank loans. (See 7 CFR part 1786.)
