If the Owner does not have a suitable available unit, the PHA must assist the Family in locating other standard housing in the locality within the Family's ability to pay and require the Family to move to such a unit as soon as possible. In no case will a Family be forced to move nor will housing assistance payments under the Contract be terminated unless the Family rejects without good reason the offer of a unit which the PHA judges to be acceptable.</p>
