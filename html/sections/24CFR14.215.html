When the United States appeals the underlying merits of an adversary adjudication to a court, no decision on an application for fees and other expenses in connection with that adversary adjudication shall be made until a final and unreviewable decision is rendered by

the court on the appeal or until the underlying merits of the case have been finally determined pursuant to the appeal.</p>
