                                Sec. 1.1346-1  Recovery of unconstitutional taxes.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A taxpayer who recovers unconstitutional Federal  taxes which were paid or accrued and for which a deduction was allowed  in a prior taxable year may elect, as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section, to exclude the income (exclusive of interest) attributable to  such recovery from his gross income in the taxable year of recovery. Any  such exclusion of income is subject to the requirements of section 1346  and this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If a taxpayer elects to receive the benefits of section 1346,  the income (exclusive of interest) attributable to the recovery of the  unconstitutional Federal tax will be treated as an offset to the  deduction allowed therefor in a prior taxable year (or years). The  taxpayer's return for the prior taxable year (or years) with respect to  which the statutory period for the assessment of a deficiency has  expired will be opened only for the purpose of reducing the deduction  allowed for the unconstitutional Federal tax and assessing the resulting  deficiency or deficiencies, if any. (An election under section 1346 may  be made only if the taxpayer consents in writing to such assessment. See  paragraph (b) of this section.) No other adjustment will be allowed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the disallowance of the deduction allowed in respect of a  prior taxable year results in a deficiency for that year, the deficiency  will be assessed against the taxpayer within the period agreed upon  between the taxpayer and the district director with respect to the  taxable year of the prior deduction, even though the statutory period  for the assessment may have expired prior to the filing of the consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a taxpayer does not elect under the provisions of section  1346 and this section to exclude the tax recovered from gross income in  the taxable year of recovery, the tax recovered shall, from the  standpoint of its inclusion in or exclusion from gross income, be  governed by the provisions of section 111.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Manner of making election. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The election provided for in  paragraph (a) of this section shall be made by the taxpayer filing a  statement in writing   that he elects to treat the deduction allowed in a prior taxable year  for the unconstitutional tax as not having been allowable for such  taxable year. Such a statement must be filed with the taxpayer's return  for the taxable year in which the recovery of the unconstitutional tax  or taxes occurs. No other method of making the election is permitted.  The statement of election must contain a description of the tax  recovered, the date of recovery, the taxable year in which paid or  accrued, and the taxable year for which the deduction was allowed. The  statement of election must also contain a statement signifying the  taxpayer's consent (i) to treat the deduction or portion thereof allowed  in a prior year with respect to the unconstitutional tax as not  allowable for that year and (ii) to the assessment, in respect of the  taxable year for which the deduction was allowed, of any deficiency,  together with interest thereon as provided by law, resulting from  disallowance of the deduction or portion thereof, even though the  statutory period for the assessment of any such deficiency may have  expired before the filing of such consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term recovery, as used in this section, includes not only  refund or credit of taxes previously paid, but also the cancellation of  a purported tax liability which was accrued and deducted for a prior  taxable year but never actually paid.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 12052, Nov. 26, 1960]</p>
