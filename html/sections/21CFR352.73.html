                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The following erythema action spectrum shall be used to  calculate the erythema effective exposure of a solar simulator:  Vi ([lambda]) =1.0 (250 <[lambda] <298 nm) Vi ([lambda]) = 1.00.094 (298 - l) (298 <[lambda]  <328 nanometers) Vi ([lambda]) = 1.00.015 (139 - l) (328 <[lambda]  <400 nanometers)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The data contained in this action spectrum are to be used as  spectral weighting factors to calculate the erythema effective exposure  of a solar simulator as follows: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR21MY99.000</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination of MED of the unprotected skin. A series of UV  radiation exposures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to  the erythema action spectrum calculated according to Sec. 352.73(a)) is  administered to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately  calibrated solar simulator. A series of five exposures shall be  administered to the untreated, unprotected skin to determine the  subject's inherent MED. The doses selected shall be a geometric series  represented by (1.25\n\), wherein each exposure time interval is 25  percent greater than the previous time to maintain the same relative  uncertainty (expressed as a constant percentage), independent of the  subject's sensitivity to UV radiation, regardless of whether the subject  has a high or low MED. Usually, the MED of a person's unprotected skin  is   determined the day prior to testing a product. This MED(US) shall be  used in the determination of the series of UV radiation exposures to be  administered to the protected site in subsequent testing. The MED(US)  should be determined again on the same day as the standard and test  sunscreens and this MED(US) should be used in calculating the SPF.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of individual SPF values. A series of UV radiation  exposures expressed as Joules per square meter (adjusted to the erythema  action spectrum calculated according to Sec. 352.73(a)) is administered  to the subsite areas on each subject with an accurately-calibrated solar  simulator. A series of seven exposures shall be administered to the  protected test sites to determine the MED of the protected skin  (MED(PS)). The doses selected shall consist of a geometric series of  five exposures, where the middle exposure is placed to yield the  expected SPF plus two other exposures placed symmetrically around the  middle exposure. The exact series of exposures to be given to the  protected skin shall be determined by the previously established MED(US)  and the expected SPF of the test sunscreen. For products with an  expected SPF less than 8, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times  0.64X, 0.80X, 0.90X, 1.00X, 1.10X, 1.25X, and 1.56X, where X equals the  expected SPF of the test product. For products with an expected SPF  between 8 and 15, the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.69X, 0.83X,  0.91X, 1.00X, 1.09X, 1.20X, and 1.44X, where X equals the expected SPF  of the test product. For products with an expected SPF greater that 15,  the exposures shall be the MED(US) times 0.76X, 0.87X, 0.93X, 1.00X,  1.07X, 1.15X, and 1.32X, where X equals the expected SPF of the test  product. The MED is the quantity of erythema-effective energy required  to produce the first perceptible, unambiguous redness reaction with  clearly defined borders at 22 to 24 hours postexposure. The SPF value of  the test sunscreen is then calculated from the dose of UV radiation  required to produce the MED of the protected skin and from the dose of  UV radiation required to produce the MED of the unprotected skin  (control site) as follows:</p><p class="depth2">SPF value =the ratio of erythema effective exposure (Joules per  square meter) (MED(PS)) to the erythema effective exposure (Joules per  square meter) (MED(US)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of the test product's SPF value and PCD. Use data  from at least 20 test subjects with n representing the number of  subjects used. First, for each subject, compute the SPF value as stated  in Sec. 352.73(b) and (c). Second, compute the mean SPF value, x, and  the standard deviation, s, for these subjects. Third, obtain the upper  5-percent point from the t distribution table with n-1 degrees of  freedom. Denote this value by t. Fourth, compute ts/ [radic]n. Denote  this quantity by A (i.e., A =ts/ [radic]n). Fifth, calculate the SPF  value to be used in labeling as follows: the label SPF equals the  largest whole number less than x. - A. Sixth and last, the drug product  is classified into a PCD as follows: if 30 + A  Sec. 352.76  Determination if a product is water resistant or very water resistant.</p><p class="depth0">The general testing procedures in Sec. 352.72 shall be used as part  of the following tests, except where modified in this section. An indoor  fresh water pool, whirlpool, and/or jacuzzi maintained at 23 to 32  [deg]C shall be used in these testing procedures. Fresh water is clean  drinking water that meets the standards in 40 CFR part 141. The pool and  air temperature and the relative humidity shall be recorded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure for testing the water resistance of a sunscreen  product. For sunscreen products making the claim of ``water resistant,''  the label SPF shall be the label SPF value determined after 40 minutes  of water immersion using the following procedure for the water  resistance test:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply sunscreen product (followed by the waiting period after  application of the sunscreen product indicated on the product labeling).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 20-minute rest period (do not towel test sites).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Conclude water test (air dry test sites without toweling).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Begin solar simulator exposure to test site areas as described  in Sec. 352.73.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure for testing a very water resistant sunscreen product.  For sunscreen products making the claim of ``very water resistant,'' the  label SPF shall be the label SPF value determined after 80 minutes of  water immersion using the following procedure for the very water  resistant test:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply sunscreen product (followed by the waiting period after  application of the sunscreen product indicated on the product labeling).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> 20-minute rest period (do not towel test sites).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 20-minute rest period (do not towel test sites).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> 20-minute rest period (do not towel test sites).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> 20 minutes moderate activity in water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Conclude water test (air dry test sites without toweling).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Begin solar simulator exposure to test site areas as described  in Sec. 352.73.</p>
