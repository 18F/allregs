                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Indian agricultural land under the jurisdiction of a tribe must  be managed in accordance with the goals and objectives in any  agricultural resource management plan developed by the tribe, or by us  in close consultation with the tribe, under the AIARMA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The ten-year agricultural resource management and monitoring  plan must be developed through public meetings and completed within  three years of the initiation of the planning activity. Such a plan must  be developed through public meetings, and be based on the public meeting  records and existing survey documents, reports, and other research from  federal agencies, tribal community colleges, and land grant  universities. When completed, the plan must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Determine available agricultural resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Identify specific tribal agricultural resource goals and  objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Establish management objectives for the resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Define critical values of the tribe and its members and provide  identified holistic management objectives; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Identify actions to be taken to reach established objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where the regulations in this subpart are inconsistent with a  tribe's agricultural resource management plan, we may waive the  regulations under part 1 of this title, so long as the waiver does not  violate a federal statute or judicial decision or conflict with our  general trust responsibility under federal law.</p>
