                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Samples for official sample-lot inspection service--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Original  official sample-lot inspection service. For original sample-lot  inspection purposes, an official sample shall be obtained by official  personnel; representative of the grain in the lot; and protected from  manipulation, substitution, and improper or careless handling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Official sample-lot reinspection and appeal inspection service.  For an official sample-lot reinspection service or an official appeal  sample-lot inspection service, the sample(s) on which the reinspection  or appeal is determined shall (i) be obtained by official personnel and  (ii) otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this  section. If the reinspection or appeal inspection is determined on the  basis of official file sample(s), the samples shall meet the  requirements of Sec. 800.82(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> New sample. Upon request and if practicable, a new sample shall  be obtained and examined as a part of a reinspection or appeal  inspection. The provision for a new sample shall not apply if obtaining  the new sample involves a change in method of sampling.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Representative sample. A sample shall not be considered  representative unless it (1) has been obtained by official personnel,  (2) is of the size prescribed in the instructions, and (3) has been  obtained, handled, and submitted in accordance with the instructions. A  sample which fails to meet the requirements of this paragraph may, upon  request of the applicant, be inspected as a submitted sample.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Protecting samples. Official personnel shall protect official  samples, warehouseman's samples, and submitted samples from  manipulation, substitution, or improper and careless handling which may  deprive the samples of their representativeness or which may change the  physical or chemical properties of the grain, as appropriate, from the  time of sampling or receipt until the inspection services are completed  and the file samples have been discarded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Restriction on sampling. Official personnel shall not perform an  original inspection or a reinspection service on an official sample or a  warehouseman's sample unless the grain from which the sample was  obtained was located within the area of responsibility assigned to the  agency or field office at the time of sampling, except as provided for  in Sec. 800.117, or on a case-by-case basis as determined by the  Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Disposition of samples--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Excess grain. Any grain in excess of  the quantity specified in the instructions for the requested service,  the file samples, and samples requested by interested persons shall be  returned to the lot from which the grain was obtained or to the owner of  the lot or the owner's order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Inspection samples. Inspection samples, after they have served  their intended purpose, shall be disposed of as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Samples which contain toxic substances or materials shall be  kept out of food and feed channels, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Official personnel shall dispose of samples obtained or  submitted to them according to procedures established by the Service.  Complete and accurate records of disposition shall be maintained.
