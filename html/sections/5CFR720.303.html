These data will be taken from  CPDF. For DVAAP purposes, CPDF data are considered to be the official  record of the status of disabled veteran employment within each  participating agency. Each participating agency is responsible for  assuring that such records are timely, accurate, and complete.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CPDF data must be analyzed by participating agencies to identify  problem areas and deficiencies in the employment and advancement of  disabled veterans. (OPM will establish with each agency not  participating in CPDF, the nature and extent of data to be used in  identifying problems and deficiencies.) Based on this analysis, agencies  shall develop methods to improve the recruitment, hiring, placement, and  advancement of disabled veterans, or revise or redirect existing  methods, as necessary. These methods must then be translated into action  items.</p>
