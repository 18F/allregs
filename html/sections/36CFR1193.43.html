                            <p class="depth0">All information necessary to operate and use the product, including  but not limited to, text, static or dynamic images, icons, labels,  sounds, or incidental operating cues, shall comply with each of the  following, assessed independently:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Availability of visual information. Provide visual information  through at least one mode in auditory form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability of visual information for low vision users. Provide  visual information through at least one mode to users with visual acuity  between 20/70 and 20/200 without relying on audio.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Access to moving text. Provide moving text in at least one  static presentation mode at the option of the user.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Availability of auditory information. Provide auditory  information through at least one mode in visual form and, where  appropriate, in tactile form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Availability of auditory information for people who are hard of  hearing. Provide audio or acoustic information, including any auditory  feedback tones that are important for the use of the product, through at  least one mode in enhanced auditory fashion (i.e., increased  amplification, increased signal-to-noise ratio, or combination). For  transmitted voice signals, provide a gain adjustable up to a minimum of  20 dB. For incremental volume control, provide at least one intermediate  step of 12 dB of gain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Prevention of visually-induced seizures. Visual displays and  indicators shall minimize visual flicker that might induce seizures in  people with photosensitive epilepsy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Availability of audio cutoff. Where a product delivers audio  output through an external speaker, provide an industry standard  connector for headphones or personal listening devices (e.g., phone-like  handset or earcup) which cuts off the speaker(s) when used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Non-interference with hearing technologies. Reduce interference  to hearing technologies (including hearing aids, cochlear implants, and  assistive listening devices) to the lowest possible level that allows a  user to utilize the product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Hearing aid coupling. Where a product delivers output by an  audio transducer which is normally held up to the ear, provide a means  for effective wireless coupling to hearing aids.</p>
