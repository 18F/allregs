                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Default. The Presiding Officer may find a party in default (1)  after motion, upon failure to file a timely answer to the complaint; (2)  after motion or sua sponte, upon failure to comply with a prehearing or  hearing order of the Presiding Officer; or (3) after motion or sua  sponte, upon failure to appear at a conference or hearing without good  cause being shown. No finding of default on the basis of a failure to  appear at a hearing shall be made against the respondent unless the  complainant presents sufficient evidence to the Presiding Officer to  establish a prima facie case against the respondent. Any motion for a  default order shall include a proposed default order and shall be served  upon all parties. The alleged defaulting party shall have twenty (20)  days from service to reply to the motion. Default by respondent  constitutes, for purposes of the pending action only, an admission of  all facts alleged in the complaint and a waiver of respondent's right to  a hearing on such factual allegations. If the complaint is for the  assessment of a civil penalty, the penalty proposed in the complaint  shall become due and payable by respondent without further proceedings  sixty (60) days after a final order issued upon default. If the  complaint is for the revocation or suspension of a permit, the  conditions of revocation or suspension proposed in the complaint shall  become effective without further proceedings on the date designated by  the Presiding Officer in his final order issued upon default. Default by  the complainant shall result in the dismissal of the complaint with  prejudice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedures upon default. When the Presiding Officer finds a  default has occurred, he shall issue a default order against the  defaulting party. This order shall constitute the initial decision, and  shall be filed with the Hearing Clerk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contents of a default order. A default order shall include  findings of fact showing the grounds for the order, conclusions  regarding all material issues of law or discretion, and the penalty  which is recommended, or the terms and conditions of permit revocation  or suspension, or other sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Presiding Officer may set aside a default order for good  cause shown.</p>
