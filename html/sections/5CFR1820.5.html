Once OSC makes a determination to grant a FOIA request for records, or makes an adverse determination denying a request in any respect, it will notify the requester in writing. Adverse determinations, or denials of requests, consist of: A determination to withhold any requested record in whole or in part; a determination that a requested record does not exist or cannot be located; a determination that a record is not readily reproducible in the form or format sought by the requester; a determination that what has been requested is not a record subject to the FOIA; a determination on any disputed fee matter, including a denial of a request for a fee waiver; and a denial of a request for expedited treatment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adverse determinations. A notification to a requester of an adverse determination on a request shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A brief statement of the reason(s) for the denial of the request, including any FOIA exemption applied by OSC in denying the request; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A statement that the denial may be appealed under section 1820.6(a), with a description of the requirements of that subsection.</p>
