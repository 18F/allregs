                            <p class="depth0">At any time during the transitional period, the household may apply for recertification. If a household applies for recertification during its transitional period, the State agency shall observe the following procedures:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The State agency must schedule an interview in accordance with Sec. 273.2(e);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State agency must provide the household with a notice of required verification in accordance with Sec. 273.2(c)(5) and provide the household a minimum of 10 days to provide the required verification in accordance with Sec. 273.2(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Households that have met all of the required application procedures shall be notified of their eligibility or ineligibility as soon as possible, but no later than 30 calendar days following the date the application was filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the State agency does not determine a household's eligibility and provide an opportunity to participate within 30 days following the date the application was filed, the State agency shall continue processing the application while continuing the household's transitional benefits.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the application process cannot be completed due to State agency fault, the State agency must continue to process the application and provide a full month's allotment for the first month of the new certification period.

The State agency shall determine cause for any delay in processing a recertification application in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 273.2(h)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If the application process cannot be completed because the household failed to take a required action, the State agency may deny the application at that time or at the end of the 30 days. If the household is determined to be ineligible for the program, the State agency will deny the household's application for recertification and continue the household's transitional benefits to the end of the transitional benefit period, at which time the State agency will either recertify the household or send a RFC in accordance with Sec. 273.31;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the household is determined eligible for the regular Food Stamp Program but is entitled to a benefit lower than its transitional benefit, the State agency shall encourage the household to withdraw its application for recertification and continue to receive transitional benefits. If the household chooses not to withdraw its application, the State agency has the option to deny the application and allow the transitional period to run its course, or complete the recertification process and issue the household the lower benefit amount beginning with the first month of the new certification period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> If the household is determined eligible for the program, its new certification period will begin with the first day of the month following the month in which the household submitted the application for recertification. The State agency must issue the household full benefits for that month. For example, if the household applied for recertification on the 25th day of the third month of a 5-month transitional period, and the household is determined eligible for the regular Food Stamp Program, the State agency will begin the household's new certification period on the first day of what would have been the fourth month of the transitional period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the household is eligible for the regular Food Stamp Program and entitled to benefits higher than its transitional benefits, and the State agency has already issued the household transitional benefits for the first month of its certification period, the State agency must issue the household a supplement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Applications for recertification submitted in the final month of the transitional period must be processed in accordance with Sec. 273.14.</p>
