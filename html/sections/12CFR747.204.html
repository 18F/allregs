The notice shall contain a statement of the facts  constituting the alleged unsafe or unsound practices or conditions or  violations on which a hearing will be held. Such hearing shall commence  not earlier than 30 days nor later than 60 days after the date of  service of such notice upon the credit union, unless an earlier or later  date is set by the NCUA Board at the request of the credit union.</p>
