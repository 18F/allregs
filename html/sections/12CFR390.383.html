The investment in and indebtedness of and to State savings association subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed balance sheet from amounts for other subsidiaries; and the amount of cash dividends paid to the parent State savings association for each of the last three years by the State savings association subsidiaries shall be stated separately in the condensed income statement from amounts for other subsidiaries.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of the above test, restricted net assets of consolidated subsidiaries shall mean that amount of the State savings association's proportionate share of net assets of consolidated subsidiaries (after intercompany eliminations) which as of the end of the most recent year may not be transferred to the parent company by subsidiaries in the form of loans, advances,

or cash dividends without the consent of a third party (i.e., lender, regulatory agency, foreign government, etc.).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where restrictions on the amount of funds which may be loaned or advanced differ from the amount restricted as to transfer in the form of cash dividends, the amount least restrictive to the subsidiary shall be used. Redeemable preferred stocks (See item I (22) in the appendix to Sec. 390.384) and minority interest (See item I (21) in the appendix to Sec. 390.384) shall be deducted in computing net assets for purposes of this test.</p>
