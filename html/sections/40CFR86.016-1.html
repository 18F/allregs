                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>. Note that this subpart does not apply for light-duty  vehicles, light-duty trucks, or medium-duty passenger vehicles (see  subpart S of this part for requirements that apply for those vehicles).  In some cases, manufacturers of heavy-duty engines and vehicles can  choose whether to meet the requirements of this subpart or the  requirements of subpart S of this part; those provisions are therefore  considered optional, but only to the extent that manufacturers comply  with the other set of requirements. In cases where a provision applies  only for a certain vehicle group based on its model year, vehicle class,  motor fuel, engine type, or other distinguishing characteristics, the  limited applicability is cited in the appropriate section. The  provisions of this subpart apply for certain heavy-duty engines and  vehicles as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this subpart related to exhaust emission  standards apply for diesel-cycle and Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines  installed in vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR; however, these vehicles  may instead be certified under subpart S of this part as specified in  Sec. 86.1801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The provisions of this subpart related to exhaust emission  standards apply for engines that will be installed in incomplete  vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR; however, these vehicles may  instead be certified under subpart S of this part as specified in  Sec. 86.1801.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Diesel-cycle and Otto-cycle complete heavy-duty vehicles at or  below 14,000 pounds GVWR and the corresponding engines are not subject  to the provisions of this subpart related to exhaust emission standards,  except that these provisions are optional for diesel-cycle engines  installed in such vehicles until those vehicles become subject to the  Tier 3 standards under Sec. 86.1816-18.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The provisions of this subpart related to evaporative emission  standards apply for diesel-cycle and Otto-cycle heavy-duty vehicles as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> These provisions do not apply for vehicles at or below 14,000  pounds GVWR.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR must meet evaporative  emission standards as specified in 40 CFR 1037.103. This involves  meeting the standards specified in Secs. 86.008-10(b) and 86.007- 11(b)(3) and (4) until the Tier 3 standards in Sec. 86.1813 start to  apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Note that diesel-fueled vehicles are not subject to  evaporative emissions under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The provisions of this subpart related to onboard diagnostics  apply for diesel-cycle and Otto-cycle heavy-duty engines and vehicles as  follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Engines installed in vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR must meet  the onboard diagnostic requirements specified in Sec. 86.010-18.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Engines installed in vehicles at or below 14,000 pounds GVWR  must meet the onboard diagnostic requirements specified in Sec. 86.1806.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Relationship to subpart S of this part. Unless specified  otherwise, if engines are not subject to provisions of this subpart or  if manufacturers choose not to meet optional provisions of this subpart  as described in paragraph (a) of this section, those engines must be  installed in vehicles meeting the corresponding requirements under  subpart S of this part. If a vehicle and its installed engine comply  with a mix of provisions from this subpart and from subpart S of this  part, the vehicle must be certified under subpart S of this part, and  the engine does not need to be certified separately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Greenhouse gas emission standards. See 40 CFR parts 1036 and  1037 for greenhouse gas emission standards that apply for heavy-duty  engines and vehicles.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Non-petroleum fueled vehicles. The standards and requirements of  this part apply to model year 2016 and later non-petroleum fueled motor  vehicles as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The standards and requirements of this part apply as specified  for vehicles fueled with methanol, natural gas, and LPG.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The standards and requirements of subpart S of this part apply  as specified for light-duty vehicles and light-duty trucks.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The standards and requirements of this part applicable to  methanol-fueled heavy-duty vehicles and engines (including flexible fuel  vehicles and engines) apply to heavy-duty vehicles and engines fueled  with any oxygenated fuel (including flexible fuel vehicles and engines).  Most significantly, this means that the hydrocarbon standards apply as  NMHCE and the vehicles and engines must be tested using the applicable  oxygenated fuel according to the test procedures in 40 CFR part 1065  applicable for oxygenated fuels. For purposes of this paragraph (d),  oxygenated fuel means any fuel containing at least 50 volume percent  oxygenated compounds. For example, a fuel mixture of 85 gallons of  ethanol and 15 gallons of gasoline is an oxygenated fuel, while a fuel  mixture of 15 gallons of ethanol and 85 gallons of gasoline is not an  oxygenated fuel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The standards and requirements of subpart S of this part  applicable to heavy-duty vehicles under 14,000 pounds GVWR apply to all  heavy-duty vehicles powered solely by electricity, including plug-in  electric vehicles and solar-powered vehicles. Use good engineering  judgment to apply these requirements to these vehicles, including  applying these provisions to vehicles over 14,000 pounds GVWR. Electric  heavy-duty vehicles may not generate NOX or PM emission  credits. Heavy-duty vehicles powered solely by electricity are deemed to  have zero emissions of regulated pollutants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The standards and requirements of this part applicable to  diesel-fueled heavy-duty vehicles and engines apply to all other heavy- duty vehicles and engines not otherwise addressed in this paragraph (d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> See 40 CFR parts 1036 and 1037 for requirements related to  greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Manufacturers may voluntarily certify to the standards of  paragraphs (d)(3) through (5) of this section before model year 2016.  Note that other provisions in this part require compliance with the  standards described in paragraphs (d)(1) and (2) of this section for  model years before 2016.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Small volume manufacturers. Special certification procedures are  available for any manufacturer whose projected combined U.S. sales of  light-duty vehicles, light-duty trucks, heavy-duty vehicles, and heavy- duty engines in its product line (including all vehicles and engines  imported under the provisions of 40 CFR 85.1505 and 85.1509) are fewer  than 10,000 units for the model year in which the manufacturer seeks  certification. To certify its product line under these optional  procedures, the small-volume manufacturer must first obtain the  Administrator's approval. The manufacturer must meet the eligibility  criteria specified in Sec. 86.098-14(b) before the Administrator's  approval will be granted. The small-volume manufacturer's certification  procedures are described in Sec. 86.098-14.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Optional procedures for determining exhaust opacity. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The  provisions of subpart I of this part apply to tests which are performed  by the Administrator, and optionally, by the manufacturer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Measurement procedures, other than those described in subpart I  of this part, may be used by the manufacturer provided the manufacturer  satisfies the requirements of Sec. 86.007-23(f).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When a manufacturer chooses to use an alternative measurement  procedure, it has the responsibility to determine whether the results  obtained by the procedure will correlate with the results which would be  obtained from the measurement procedure in subpart I of this part.  Consequently, the Administrator will not routinely approve or disapprove  any alternative opacity   measurement procedure or any associated correlation data which the  manufacturer elects to use to satisfy the data requirements for subpart  I of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a confirmatory test is performed and the results indicate  there is a systematic problem suggesting that the data generated under  an optional alternative measurement procedure do not adequately  correlate with data obtained in accordance with the procedures described  in subpart I of this part, EPA may require that all certificates of  conformity not already issued be based on data obtained from procedures  described in subpart I of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Clean alternative fuel conversions. The provisions of this  subpart also apply for clean alternative fuel conversions as defined in  40 CFR 85.502 of all vehicles described in paragraph (a) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Turbine engines. Turbine engines are deemed to be compression- ignition engines for purposes of this part.  [76 FR 57375, Sept. 15, 2011, as amended at 79 FR 23690, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
