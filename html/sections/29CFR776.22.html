                            <p class="depth0">This subpart, which was adopted before the amendments of 1961 and  1966 to the Fair Labor Standards Act, is limited to discussion of the  traditional general coverage of employees employed in activities of the  character performed in the construction industry, which depends on  whether such employees are, individually, ``engaged in commerce or in  the production of goods for commerce'' within the meaning of the Act.  The 1961 and 1966 amendments broadened coverage by extending it to other  employees of the construction industry on an ``enterprise'' basis, as  explained in Sec. 776.22a. Employees covered under the principles  discussed in this subpart remain covered under the Act as amended;  however, an employee who would not be individually covered under the  principles discussed in this subpart may now be subject to the Act if he  is employed in an enterprise engaged in covered construction as defined  in the amendments.  [35 FR 5543, Apr. 3, 1970]</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise Coverage    Sec. 776.22a  Extension of coverage to employment in certain enterprises.</p><p class="depth0">Whether or not individually covered on the traditional basis, an  employee is covered on an ``enterprise'' basis by the Act as amended in  1961 and 1966 if he is ``employed in an enterprise engaged in commerce  or in the production of goods for commerce'' as defined in section 3  (r), (s), of the Act. ``Enterprise'' is defined generally by section  3(r) to mean ``the related activities performed (either through unified  operation or common control) by any person or persons for a common  business purpose, and includes all such activities whether performed in  one or more establishments or by one or more corporate or other  organizational units.'' If an ``enterprise'' as thus defined is an  ``enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for  commerce'' as defined and described in section 3(s) of the Act as  amended, any employee employed in such enterprise is subject to the  provisions of the Act to the same extent as if he were individually  engaged ``in commerce or in the production of goods for commerce'',  unless specifically exempt, section 3(s), insofar as pertinent to the  construction industry, reads as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Enterprise engaged in commerce or in the production of goods for  commerce means an enterprise which has employees engaged in commerce or  in the production of goods for commerce, including employees handling,  selling, or otherwise working on goods that have been moved in or  produced for commerce by any person, and which:</p><p class="depth0">* * * * *</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Is engaged in the business of construction or reconstruction, or  both.   Questions of ``enterprise coverage'' in the construction industry which  are not answered in published statements of the Department of Labor may  be addressed to the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division,  Department of Labor, Washington, DC 20210, or assistance may be  requested from any of the Regional or District Offices of the Division.  [35 FR 5543, Apr. 3, 1970]</p><p class="depth0">Individual Employee Coverage in the Construction Industry    Sec. 776.22b  Guiding principles.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope of bulletin and general coverage statement. This subpart  contains the opinions of the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division  with respect to the applicability of the Fair Labor Standards Act to  employees engaged in the building and construction industry. The  provisions of the Act expressly make its application dependent on the  character of an employee's activities, that is, on whether he is engaged  ``in commerce'' or in the ``production of goods for commerce including  any closely related process or occupation directly essential to such  production.'' Under either of the two prescribed areas of covered work,  coverage cannot be determined by a rigid or technical formula. The  United States Supreme Court has said of both phases that coverage must  be given ``a liberal construction'' determined ``by practical  considerations, not by technical   conceptions.'' \1\ The Court has specifically rejected the technical  ``new construction'' concept, as a reliable test for determining  coverage under this Act. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., 349 U.S. 427; Kirschbaum Co. v.  Walling, 316 U.S. 517; Alstate Construction Co. v. Durkin, 345 U.S. 13.</p><p class="depth0">\2\ Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante.   So far as construction work specifically is concerned, the courts have  cast the relevant tests for determining the scope of ``in commerce''  coverage in substantially similar language as they have used in  construing the ``production'' phase of coverage. Thus the Act applies to  construction work which is so intimately related to the functioning of  interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of it, as well  as to construction work which has a close and immediate tie with the  process of production. \3\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\3\ Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante; Cf. Armour & Co. v. Wantock,  323 U.S. 126. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Engagement in commerce. The United States Supreme Court has held  that the ``in commerce'' phase of coverage extends ``throughout the  farthest reaches of the channels of interstate commerce,'' and covers  not only construction work physically in or on a channel or  instrumentality of interstate commerce but also construction work ``so  directly and vitally related to the functioning of an instrumentality or  facility of interstate commerce as to be, in practical effect, a part of  it, rather than isolated, local activity.'' \4\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\4\ Mitchell v. Vollmer & Co., ante; Walling v. Jacksonville Paper  Co., 317 U.S. 564; Overstreet v. North Shore Corp., 318 U.S. 125. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Production of goods for commerce. The ``production'' phase of  coverage includes ``any closely related process or occupation directly  essential'' to production of goods for commerce. An employee need not be  engaged in activities indispensable to production in order to be  covered. Conversely, even indispensable or essential activities, in the  sense of being included in the long line of causation which ultimately  results in production of finished goods, may not be covered. The work  must be both closely related and directly essential to the covered  production. \5\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\5\ Armour & Co. v. Wantock, ante; Kirschbaum v. Walling, 316 U.S.  417; Cf. 10 E. 40th St. Co. v. Callus, 325 U.S. 578. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> State and national authority. Consideration must also be given  to the relationship between state and national authority because  Congress intended ``to leave local business to the protection of the  State.'' \6\ Activities which superficially appear to be local in  character, when isolated, may in fact have the required close or  intimate relationship with the area of commerce to which the Act  applies. The courts have stated that a project should be viewed as a  whole in a realistic way and not broken down into its various phases so  as to defeat the purposes of the Act. \7\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., ante; Kirschbaum v. Walling,  ante; Phillips Co. v. Walling, 324 U.S. 490, 497.</p><p class="depth0">\7\ Walling v. Jacksonville Paper Co., ante; Bennett v. V. P. Loftis  Co., 167 F. (2d) 286 (C.A.4); Tobin v. Pennington-Winter Const. Co., 198  F. (2d) 334 (C.A.10), certiorari denied 345 U.S. 915; See General  Coverage Bulletin, Sec. Sec. 776.19 (a), (b), and 776.21(b). ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interpretations. In his task of distinguishing covered from non- covered employees the Administrator will be guided by authoritative  court decisions. To the extent that prior administrative rulings,  interpretations, practices and enforcement policies relating to  employees in the construction industry are inconsistent or in conflict  with the principles stated in this subpart, they are hereby rescinded  and withdrawn.
