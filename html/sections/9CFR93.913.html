                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. All live VHS-regulated fish that are imported from VHS- regulated regions for other than immediate slaughter or research or  laboratory use must be accompanied by a health certificate issued by a  full-time salaried veterinarian of the national government of the  exporting country, or issued by a certifying official and endorsed by  the competent authority of that country. The health certificate must be  written in English or contain an English translation. The health  certificate will be valid for 30 days from the date of issuance. The  health certificate for the live VHS-regulated fish must state that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The live fish were inspected by the veterinarian or certifying  official who issued the certificate within 72 hours prior to shipment,  and were found to be free of any clinical signs of disease consistent  with VHS; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The live fish covered by the health certificate originated in a  region or facility that has demonstrated freedom from VHS through  testing in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Testing. A facility can demonstrate freedom from VHS through  negative testing results by a pathogen detection laboratory approved for  VHS viral assays by the competent authority of that country. Testing  must meet the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Testing must be conducted with a testing sample size that  provides for a 95 percent confidence level of detecting a 2 percent  prevalence of infection in the facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Facilities with cultured fish of VHS-regulated species which can  document a 2-year history of negative testing for VHS virus can conduct  testing at a sampling level to provide a 95 percent confidence level of  detecting a 5 percent prevalence of infection in the facility. Such  testing must be conducted twice a year, with at least 3 months between  tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Facilities with cultured fish of VHS-regulated species which  can document a 4-year history of negative testing for VHS virus can  conduct testing at a sampling level to provide a 95 percent confidence  level of detecting a 10 percent prevalence of infection in the facility.  Such testing must be conducted twice a year, with at least 3 months  between tests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such facilities must be on a secure water source, and document  that any VHS-regulated species in the facility that originated in VHS- regulated States or Canadian provinces originate from facilities of the  same or higher health status.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Tests must include virus isolation or other assays authorized by  the competent authority, using appropriate cell lines to detect VHS  virus, if present. All suspect VHS cytopathic effects must be positively  identified as VHS through molecular assays and/or genetic sequencing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proportional numbers of each VHS-regulated fish species which  might be present in a shipment must be used for testing, if applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Testing must be conducted at water temperatures between 50 and  72 [deg]F, or at other times or under environmental conditions when VHS  virus is most likely to be detected, if present.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When APHIS adds a new species to the list of VHS-regulated  species after a facility has been determined to be free of VHS in  accordance with paragraph (b) of this section, the facility must conduct  additional testing on fish of the newly listed species, if present in  the facility, and the fish must be free of VHS virus for the facility to  retain its free status. VHS testing must be conducted on each newly  listed species with a sample size that provides for a 95 percent  confidence level of detecting a 2 percent prevalence of infection in the  fish facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Shipping containers. Except as provided in Sec. 93.910(e)-(g),  all live fish that are to be shipped to the United States must be  shipped in new containers or in containers that have been cleaned and  disinfected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Cleaning and disinfection of shipping containers must be  monitored by the veterinarian or certifying official who issues the  health certificate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cleaning and disinfection must be sufficient to neutralize any  VHS virus to which shipping containers may have been exposed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The cleaning and disinfection protocols used must be referenced  in the health certificate or in a separate cleaning and disinfection  certificate accompanying the shipment to the U.S. port of entry.
