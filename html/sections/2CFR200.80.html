                            <p class="depth0">Program income means gross income earned by the non-Federal entity that is directly generated by a supported activity or earned as a result of the Federal award during the period of performance except as provided in Sec. 200.307 paragraph (f). (See Sec. 200.77 Period of performance.) Program income includes but is not limited to income from fees for services performed, the use or rental or real or personal property acquired under Federal awards, the sale of commodities or items fabricated under a Federal award, license fees and royalties on patents and copyrights, and principal and interest on loans made with Federal award funds. Interest earned on advances of Federal funds is not program income. Except as otherwise provided in Federal statutes, regulations, or the terms and conditions of the Federal award, program income does not include rebates, credits, discounts, and interest earned on any of them. See also Sec. 200.407 Prior written approval (prior approval). See also 35 U.S.C. 200-212 ``Disposition of Rights in Educational Awards'' applies to inventions made under Federal awards.
