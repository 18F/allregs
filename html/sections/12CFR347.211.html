                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Frequency of on-site examination. Each branch or agency of a  foreign bank shall be examined on-site at least once during each 12- month period (beginning on the date the most recent examination of the  office ended) by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The FRB;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The FDIC, if an insured branch;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The OCC, if the branch or agency of the foreign bank is licensed  by the OCC; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The state supervisor, if the office of the foreign bank is  licensed or chartered by the state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> 18-month cycle for certain small institutions-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Mandatory  standards. The FDIC may conduct a full-scope, on-site examination at  least once during each 18-month period, rather than each 12-month period  as provided in paragraph (a) of this section, if the insured branch:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has total assets of less than $500 million;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has received a composite ROCA supervisory rating (which rates  risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality) of  1 or 2 at its most recent examination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)(A)</em> or (B):</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The foreign bank's most recently reported capital adequacy  position consists of, or is equivalent to, Tier 1 and total risk-based  capital ratios of at least 6 percent and 10 percent, respectively, on a  consolidated basis; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The insured branch has maintained on a daily basis, over the  past three quarters, eligible assets in an amount not less than 108  percent of the preceding quarter's average third party liabilities  (determined consistent with applicable federal and state law) and  sufficient liquidity is currently available to meet its obligations to  third parties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Is not subject to a formal enforcement action or order by the  FRB, FDIC, or the OCC; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Has not experienced a change in control during the preceding 12- month period in which a full-scope, on-site examination would have been  required but for this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Discretionary standards. In determining whether an insured  branch that meets the standards of paragraph (b)(1) of this section  should not be eligible for an 18-month examination cycle pursuant to  this paragraph (b), the FDIC may consider additional factors, including  whether:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any of the individual components of the ROCA supervisory rating  of an insured branch is rated ``3'' or worse;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The results of any off-site monitoring indicate a deterioration  in the condition of the insured branch;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The size, relative importance, and role of a particular  insured branch when reviewed in the context of the foreign bank's entire  U.S. operations otherwise necessitate an annual examination; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The condition of the parent foreign bank gives rise to such a  need.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Authority to conduct more frequent examinations. Nothing in  paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section limits the authority of the FDIC  to examine any insured branch as frequently as it deems necessary.  [70 FR 17560, Apr. 6, 2005; 70 FR 20704, Apr. 21, 2005, as amended at 72  FR 17803, Apr. 10, 2007]</p>
