                                33.214  Alternative dispute resolution (ADR).
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The objective of using ADR procedures is to increase the  opportunity for relatively inexpensive and expeditious resolution of  issues in controversy. Essential elements of ADR include--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Existence of an issue in controversy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A voluntary election by both parties to participate in the ADR  process;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An agreement on alternative procedures and terms to be used in  lieu of formal litigation; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Participation in the process by officials of both parties who  have the authority to resolve the issue in controversy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> or such other specific reasons that ADR procedures are  inappropriate for the resolution of the dispute. In any case where a  contractor rejects a request of an agency for ADR proceedings, the  contractor shall inform the agency in writing of the contractor's  specific reasons for rejecting the request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> ADR procedures may be used at any time that the contracting  officer has authority to resolve the issue in controversy. If a claim  has been submitted, ADR procedures may be applied to all or a portion of  the claim. When ADR procedures are used subsequent to the issuance of a  contracting officer's final decision, their use does not alter any of  the time limitations or procedural requirements for filing an appeal of  the contracting officer's final decision and does not constitute a  reconsideration of the final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When appropriate, a neutral person may be used to facilitate  resolution of the issue in controversy using the procedures chosen by  the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The confidentiality of ADR proceedings shall be protected  consistent with 5 U.S.C. 574.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A solicitation shall not require arbitration as a condition  of award, unless arbitration is otherwise required by law. Contracting  officers should have flexibility to select the appropriate ADR procedure  to resolve the issues in controversy as they arise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An agreement to use arbitration shall be in writing and shall  specify a maximum award that may be issued by the arbitrator, as well as  any other conditions limiting the range of possible outcomes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Binding arbitration, as an ADR procedure, may be agreed to only  as specified in agency guidelines. Such guidelines shall provide advice  on the appropriate use of binding arbitration and when an agency has  authority to settle an issue in controversy through binding arbitration.
