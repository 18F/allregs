The parties shall make their own arrangements with the reporter for copies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Admissibility of evidence shall generally be governed by the Federal Rules of Evidence, subject, however, to the Hearing Officer's discretion. As used in those Rules, the term court shall be deemed to mean ``Hearing Officer.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(1)</em> Conduct of hearings shall generally be governed by Rules 42-44, 44.1, and 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the Hearing Officer may modify those Rules to meet the needs of the parties in a particular case. The terms court, plaintiff, defendant, and action as used in those Rules shall be deemed to have the meaning given them in Sec. 1308.32.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct of hearings shall generally be governed by Rules 42-44, 44.1, and 46 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, except that the Hearing Officer may modify those Rules to meet the needs of the parties in a particular case.

The Hearing Officer as the trier of the facts may then determine them and render a decision against the Contractor, or take the matter under advisement, or decline to render any decision until the close of all the evidence. Any decision rendered under this paragraph shall conform to Sec. 1308.37, and is a decision within the meaning of Sec. 1308.23.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hearings shall be as informal as may be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances, and shall be

held at a time and place to be specified by the Hearing Officer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Evidentiary subpoenas are subject to Subpart E of this part.
