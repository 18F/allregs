Stockholders of a Federal stock association need not authorize by a two-thirds affirmative vote combinations involving an interim Federal savings association or interim state savings association when the resulting Federal stock association is acquired pursuant to Sec. 574.7(a)(2) of this chapter. In those cases, an affirmative vote of 50 percent

of the shares of the outstanding voting stock of the Federal stock association plus one affirmative vote shall be required. If any class of shares is entitled to vote as a class pursuant to Sec. 552.4 of this part, an affirmative vote of 50 percent of the shares of each voting class plus one affirmative vote shall be required. The required votes shall be taken at a meeting of the association.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disclosure.

No combination under this section shall be effective until receipt of any approvals required by the Office. The effective date of a combination in which the resulting institution is a Federal stock association shall be the date of consummation of the transaction or such other later date specified on the endorsement of the articles of combination by the Office. If a disappearing institution combining under this section is a Federal stock association, its charter shall be deemed to be cancelled as of the effective date of the combination and such charter must be surrendered to the Office as soon as practicable after the effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Mergers and consolidations: transfer of assets and liabilities to the resulting institution. Upon the effective date of a merger or consolidation under this section, if the resulting institution is a Federal savings association, all assets and property (real, personal and mixed, tangible and intangible, choses in action, rights, and credits) then owned by each constituent institution or which would inure to any of them, shall, immediately by operation of law and without any conveyance, transfer, or further action, become the property of the resulting Federal savings association.
