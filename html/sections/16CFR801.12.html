                                Sec. 801.12  Calculating percentage of voting securities.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Voting securities. Whenever the act or these rules require  calculation of the percentage of voting securities to be held or  acquired, the issuer whose voting securities are being acquired shall be  deemed the ``acquired persons.''</p><p class="depth2">Example: Person ``A'' is composed of corporation A1 and subsidiary  A2; person ``B'' is composed of corporation B1 and subsidiary B2. Assume  that A2 proposes to sell assets to B1 in exchange for common stock of  B2. Under this paragraph, for purposes of calculating the percentage of  voting securities to be held, the ``acquired person'' is B2. For all  other purposes, the acquired person is ``B.'' (For all purposes, the  ``acquiring persons'' are ``A'' and ``B.'')</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Percentage of voting securities. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Whenever the act or these  rules require calculation of the percentage of voting securities of an  issuer to be held or acquired, the percentage shall be the sum of the  separate ratios for each class of voting securities, expressed as a  percentage. The ratio for each class of voting securities equals:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of votes for directors of the issuer which the  holder of a class of voting securities is presently entitled to cast,  and as a result of the acquisition, will become entitled to cast,  divided by,</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The total number of votes for directors of the issuer which  presently may be cast by that class, and which will be entitled to be  cast by that class after the acquisition, multiplied by,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em></p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The number of directors that class is entitled to elect,  divided by (B) the total number of directors.</p><p class="depth5">Examples: In each of the following examples company X has two  classes of voting securities, class A, consisting of 1000 shares with  each share having one vote, and class B, consisting of 100 shares with  each share having one vote. The class A shares elect four of the ten  directors and the class B shares elect six of the ten directors.</p><p class="depth5">In this situation, Sec. 801.12(b) requires calculations of the  percentage of voting securities held to be made according to the  following formula:</p><p class="depth5">Number of votes of class A held divided by Total votes of class A  times Directors elected by class A stock divided by Total number of  directors   Plus</p><p class="depth5">Number of votes of class B held divided by Total votes of class B  times Directors elected by class B stock divided by Total number of  directors</p><p class="depth5">1. Assume that company Y holds all 100 shares of class B stock and  no shares of class A stock. By virtue of its class B holdings, Y has all  100 of the votes which may be cast by class B stock and can elect six of  company X's ten directors. Applying the formula which results from the  rule, Y calculates that it holds 100/100x6/10 or 60 percent of the  voting securities of company X because of its holdings of class B stock  and no additional percentage derived from holdings of class A stock.  Consequently, Y holds a total of 60 percent of the voting securities of  company X.</p><p class="depth5">2. Assume that company Y holds 500 shares of class A stock and no  shares of class B stock. By virtue of its class A holdings, Y has 500 of  the 1000 votes which may be cast by class A to elect four of company X's  ten directors. Applying the formula, Y calculates that it holds 500/ 1000x4/10 or 20 percent of the voting securities of company X from its  holdings of class A stock and no additional percentage derived from  holdings of class B stock. Consequently, Y holds a total of 20 percent  of the voting securities of company X.</p><p class="depth5">3. Assume that company Y holds 500 shares of class A stock and 60  shares of class B stock. Y calculates that it holds 20 percent of the  voting securities of company X because of its holdings of class A stock  (see example 2). Additionally, as a result of its class B holdings Y has  60 of the 100 votes which may be cast by class B stock to elect six of  company X's ten directors. Applying the formula, Y calculates that it  holds 60/100x6/10 or 36 percent of the voting securities of company X  because of its holdings of class B stock. Since the formula requires  that a person that holds different classes of voting securities of the  same issuer add together the separate percentages calculated for each  class, Y holds a total of 56 percent (20 percent plus 36 percent) of the  voting securities of company X.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorized but unissued voting securities and treasury voting  securities shall not be considered securities presently entitled to vote  for directors of the issuer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For purposes of determining the number of outstanding voting  securities of an issuer, a person may rely upon the most recent  information set forth in filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange  Commission, unless such person knows or has reason to believe that the  information contained therein is inaccurate.</p><p class="depth3">Examples: 1. In the example to paragraph (a), to determine the  percentage of B2's voting securities which will be held by ``A'' after  the transaction, all voting securities of B2 held by ``A,'' the  ``acquiring person'' (including A2 and all other entities included in  person ``A''), must be aggregated. If ``A'' holds convertible securities  of B2 which meet the definition of voting securities in Sec. 801.1(f),  these securities are to be disregarded in calculating the percentage of  voting securities held by ``A.''</p><p class="depth3">2. Under this formula, any votes obtained by means of proxies from  other persons are also disregarded in calculating the percentage of  voting securities to be held or acquired.
