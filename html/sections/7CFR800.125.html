                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Any interested person may request a reinspection or review of weighing service, except as provided for in Sec. 800.86(c)(5). Only one reinspection service or review of weighing service may be performed on any original service. When more than one interested person requests a reinspection or review of weighing service, the first person to file is the applicant of record.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Kind and scope of request. A reinspection or review of weighing service is limited to the kind and scope of the original service. If the request specifies a different kind or scope, the request shall be dismissed but may be resubmitted as a request for original services: Provided, however, that an applicant for service may request a reinspection of a specific factor(s), official grade and factors, or official criteria. In addition, reinspections for grade may include a review of any pertinent factor(s), as deemed necessary by official personnel. Official criteria are considered separately from official grade or official factors when determining the kind and scope. When requested, a reinspection for official grade or official factors and official criteria may be handled separately even though both sets of results are reported on the same certificate. Moreover, a reinspection or review of weighing may be requested on either the inspection or Class X weighing results when both results are reported on a combination inspection and Class X weight certificate.
