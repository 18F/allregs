                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The test procedures prescribed in this subpart are  intended to ensure that IBCs containing hazardous materials can  withstand normal conditions of transportation and are considered minimum  requirements. Each packaging must be manufactured and assembled so as to  be capable of successfully passing the prescribed tests and of  conforming to the requirements of Sec. 173.24 of this subchapter at all  times while in transportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility. It is the responsibility of the IBC manufacturer  to assure that each IBC is capable of passing the prescribed tests. To  the extent that an IBC assembly function, including final closure, is  performed by the person who offers a hazardous material for  transportation, that person is responsible for performing the function  in accordance with Secs. 173.22 and 178.2 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Definitions. For the purpose of this subpart:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> IBC design type refers to an IBC that does not differ in  structural design, size, material of construction, wall thickness,  manner of construction and representative service equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Design qualification testing is the performance of the drop,  leakproofness, hydrostatic pressure, stacking, bottom-lift or top-lift,  tear, topple, righting and vibration tests, as applicable, prescribed in  this subpart, for each different IBC design type, at the start of  production of that packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Periodic design requalification test is the performance of the  applicable tests specified in paragraph (c)(2) of this section on an IBC  design type, in order to requalify the design for continued production  at the frequency specified in paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Production inspection is the inspection that must initially be  conducted on each newly manufactured IBC.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Production testing is the performance of the leakproofness test  in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section on each IBC intended to  contain solids discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Periodic retest and inspection is performance of the applicable  test and inspections on each IBC at the frequency specified in  Sec. 180.352 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Different IBC design type is one that differs from a previously  qualified IBC design type in structural design, size, material of  construction, wall thickness, or manner of construction, but does not  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A packaging which differs in surface treatment;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A rigid plastic IBC or composite IBC which differs with regard  to additives used to comply with Secs. 178.706(c), 178.707(c) or  178.710(c);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A packaging which differs only in its lesser external  dimensions (i.e., height, width, length) provided materials of  construction and material thicknesses or fabric weight remain the same;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A packaging which differs in service equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Design qualification testing. The packaging manufacturer shall  achieve successful test results for the design qualification testing at  the start of production of each new or different IBC design type. The  service equipment selected for this design qualification testing shall  be representative of the type of service equipment that will be fitted  to any finished IBC body under   the design. Application of the certification mark by the manufacturer  shall constitute certification that the IBC design type passed the  prescribed tests in this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Periodic design requalification testing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Periodic design  requalification must be conducted on each qualified IBC design type if  the manufacturer is to maintain authorization for continued production.  The IBC manufacturer shall achieve successful test results for the  periodic design requalification at sufficient frequency to ensure each  packaging produced by the manufacturer is capable of passing the design  qualification tests. Design requalification tests must be conducted at  least once every 12 months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Changes in the frequency of design requalification testing  specified in paragraph (e)(1) of this section are authorized if approved  by the Associate Administrator. These requests must be based on:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Detailed quality assurance programs that assure that proposed  decreases in test frequency maintain the integrity of originally tested  IBC design types; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Demonstrations that each IBC produced is capable of  withstanding higher standards (e.g., increased drop height, hydrostatic  pressure, wall thickness, fabric weight).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Production testing and inspection. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Production testing  consists of the leakproofness test prescribed in Sec. 178.813 of this  subpart and must be performed on each IBC intended to contain solids  discharged by pressure or intended to contain liquids. For this test:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The IBC need not have its closures fitted, except that the IBC  must be fitted with its primary bottom closure.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The inner receptacle of a composite IBC may be tested without  the outer IBC body, provided the test results are not affected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Applicable inspection requirements in Sec. 180.352 of this  subchapter must be performed on each IBC initially after production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Test samples. The IBC manufacturer shall conduct the design  qualification and periodic design requalification tests prescribed in  this subpart using random samples of IBCs, according to the appropriate  test section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Selective testing of IBCs. Variation of a tested IBC design type  is permitted without further testing, provided selective testing  demonstrates an equivalent or greater level of safety than the design  type tested and which has been approved by the Associate Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Approval of equivalent packagings. An IBC differing from the  standards in subpart N of this part, or tested using methods other than  those specified in this subpart, may be used if approved by the  Associate Administrator. Such IBCs must be shown to be equally  effective, and testing methods used must be equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Proof of compliance. Notwithstanding the periodic design  requalification testing intervals specified in paragraph (e) of this  section, the Associate Administrator, or a designated representative,  may at any time require demonstration of compliance by a manufacturer,  through testing in accordance with this subpart, that packagings meet  the requirements of this subpart. As required by the Associate  Administrator, or a designated representative, the manufacturer shall  either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Conduct performance tests or have tests conducted by an  independent testing facility, in accordance with this subpart; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Make a sample IBC available to the Associate Administrator, or a  designated representative, for testing in accordance with this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Coatings. If an inner treatment or coating of an IBC is required  for safety reasons, the manufacturer shall design the IBC so that the  treatment or coating retains its protective properties even after  withstanding the tests prescribed by this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Record retention. Following each design qualification test and  each periodic retest on an IBC, a test report must be prepared.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test report must be maintained at each location where the  packaging is manufactured, certified, and a design qualification test or  periodic retest is conducted as follows:     ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Responsible party                         Duration ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Person manufacturing the packaging.....  As long as manufactured and two</p><p class="depth3">years thereafter. Person performing design testing.......  Design test maintained for a</p><p class="depth3">single or composite packaging</p><p class="depth3">for six years after the test</p><p class="depth3">is successfully performed and</p><p class="depth3">for a combination packaging or</p><p class="depth3">packaging intended for</p><p class="depth3">infectious substances for</p><p class="depth3">seven years after the test is</p><p class="depth3">successfully performed. Person performing periodic retesting...  Performance test maintained for</p><p class="depth3">a single or composite</p><p class="depth3">packaging for one year after</p><p class="depth3">the test is successfully</p><p class="depth3">performed and for a</p><p class="depth3">combination packaging or</p><p class="depth3">packaging intended for</p><p class="depth3">infectious substances for two</p><p class="depth3">years after the test is</p><p class="depth3">successfully performed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The test report must be made available to a user of a packaging  or a representative of the Department upon request. The test report, at  a minimum, must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Name and address of test facility;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Name and address of the person certifying the IBC;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A unique test report identification;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Date of test report;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Manufacturer of the IBC;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Description of the IBC design type (e.g., dimensions,  materials, closures, thickness, representative service equipment, etc.);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Maximum IBC capacity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Characteristics of test contents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Test descriptions and results (including drop heights,  hydrostatic pressures, tear propagation length, etc.); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> The signature of the person conducting the test, and name of  the person responsible for testing.
