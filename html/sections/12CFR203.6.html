Pricing-Related Data</p><p class="depth0">1. Rate Spread</p><p class="depth0">a. For a home-purchase loan, a refinancing, or a dwelling-secured home improvement loan that you originated, report the spread between the annual percentage rate (APR) and the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction if the spread is equal to or greater than 1.5 percentage points for first-lien loans or 3.5 percentage points for subordinate-lien loans. To determine whether the rate spread meets this threshold, use the average prime offer rate in effect for the type of transaction as of the date the interest rate was set, and use the APR for the loan, as calculated and disclosed to the consumer under Sec. 226.6 or 226.18, as applicable, of Regulation Z (12 CFR part 226). Current and historic average prime offer rates are set forth in the tables published on the FFIEC's Web site (http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda) entitled ``Average Prime Offer Rates--Fixed'' and ``Average Prime Offer Rates--Adjustable.'' Use the most recently available average prime offer rate. ``Most recently available'' means the average prime offer rate set forth in the applicable table with the most recent effective date as of the date the interest rate was set. Do not use an average prime offer rate before its effective date.</p><p class="depth0">b. If the loan is not subject to Regulation Z, or is a home improvement loan that is not dwelling-secured, or is a loan that you purchased, enter ``NA.''</p><p class="depth0">c. Enter ``NA'' in the case of an application that does not result in a loan origination.</p><p class="depth0">d. Enter the rate spread to two decimal places, and use a leading zero. For example, enter 03.29. If the difference between the APR and the average prime offer rate is a figure with more than two decimal places, round the figure or truncate the digits beyond two decimal places.</p><p class="depth0">e. If the difference between the APR and the average prime offer rate is less than 1.5 percentage points for a first-lien loan and less than 3.5 percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, enter ``NA.''</p><p class="depth0">2. Date the interest rate was set. The relevant date to use to determine the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction is the date on which the loan's interest rate was set by the financial institution for the final time before closing. If an interest rate is set pursuant to a ``lock-in'' agreement between the lender and the borrower, then the date on which the agreement fixes the interest rate is the date the rate was set. If a rate is re-set after a lock-in agreement is executed (for example, because the borrower exercises a float-down option or the agreement expires), then the relevant date is the date the rate is re-set for the final time before closing. If no lock-in agreement is executed, then the relevant date is the date on which the institution sets the rate for the final time before closing.</p><p class="depth0">3. HOEPA Status</p><p class="depth0">a. For a loan that you originated or purchased that is subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 (HOEPA), as implemented in Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.32), because the APR or the points and fees on the loan exceed the HOEPA triggers, enter Code 1.</p><p class="depth0">b. Enter code 2 in all other cases. For example, enter code 2 for a loan that you originated or purchased that is not subject to the requirements of HOEPA for any reason; also enter code 2 in the case of an application that does not result in a loan origination.</p><p class="depth0">H. Lien Status</p><p class="depth0">Use the following codes for loans that you originate and for applications that do not result in an origination:
Code 1--Secured by a first lien.Code 2--Secured by a subordinate lien.Code 3--Not secured by a lien.Code 4--Not applicable (purchased loan).</p><p class="depth0">a. Use Codes 1 through 3 for loans that you originate, as well as for applications that do not result in an origination (applications that are approved but not accepted, denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness).</p><p class="depth0">b. Use Code 4 for loans that you purchase.</p><p class="depth0">II. Federal Supervisory Agencies</p><p class="depth0">A. You are strongly encouraged to submit your loan/application register via Internet e-mail. If you elect to use this method of

transmission and your institution is regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit Union Administration, or the Office of Thrift Supervision, then you should submit your institution's files to the Internet e-mail address dedicated to that purpose by the Federal Reserve Board, which can be found on the Web site of the FFIEC. If your institution is regulated by one of the foregoing agencies and you elect to submit your data by regular mail, then use the following address: HMDA, Federal Reserve Board, Attention: HMDA Processing, (insert name of your institution's regulatory agency), 20th & Constitution Ave, NW., MS N502, Washington, DC 20551-0001.</p><p class="depth0">B. If your institution is regulated by the Federal Reserve System, you should use the Internet e-mail or regular mail address of your district bank indicated on the Web site of the FFIEC. If your institution is regulated by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, then you should use the Internet e-mail or regular mail address indicated on the Web site of the FFIEC.

The commentary in this supplement is the vehicle by which the Division of Consumer and Community Affairs of the Federal Reserve Board issues formal staff interpretations of Regulation C (12 CFR part 203).</p><p class="depth0">Section 203.1--Authority, Purpose, and Scope</p><p class="depth0">1(c) Scope. 1. General. The comments in this section address issues affecting coverage of institutions and exemptions from coverage.</p><p class="depth0">2. The broker rule and the meaning of ``broker'' and ``investor.'' For the purposes of the guidance given in this commentary, an institution that takes and processes a loan application and arranges for another institution to acquire the loan at or after closing is acting as a ``broker,'' and an institution that acquires a loan from a broker at or after closing is acting as an ``investor.'' (The terms used in this commentary may have different meanings in certain parts of the mortgage lending industry, and other terms may be used in place of these terms, for example in the Federal Housing Administration mortgage insurance programs.) Depending on the facts, a broker may or may not make a credit decision on an application (and thus it may or may not have reporting responsibilities). If the broker makes a credit decision, it reports that decision; if it does not make a credit decision, it does not report. If an investor reviews an application and makes a credit decision prior to closing, the investor reports that decision. If the investor does not review the application prior to closing, it reports only the loans that it purchases; it does not report the loans it does not purchase. An institution that makes a credit decision on an application prior to closing reports that decision regardless of whose name the loan closes in.</p><p class="depth0">3. Illustrations of the broker rule. Assume that, prior to closing, four investors receive the same application from a broker; two deny it, one approves it, and one approves it and acquires the loan. In these circumstances, the first two report denials, the third reports the transaction as approved but not accepted, and the fourth reports an origination (whether the loan closes in the name of the broker or the investor). Alternatively, assume that the broker denies a loan before sending it to an investor; in this situation, the broker reports a denial.</p><p class="depth0">4. Broker's use of investor's underwriting criteria. If a broker makes a credit decision based on underwriting criteria set by an investor, but without the investor's review prior to closing, the broker has made the credit decision. The broker reports as an origination a loan that it approves and closes, and reports as a denial an application that it turns down (either because the application does not meet the investor's underwriting guidelines or for some other reason). The investor reports as purchases only those loans it purchases.</p><p class="depth0">5. Insurance and other criteria. If an institution evaluates an application based on the criteria or actions of a third party other than an investor (such as a government or private insurer or guarantor), the institution must report the action taken on the application (loan originated, approved but not accepted, or denied, for example).</p><p class="depth0">6. Credit decision of agent is decision of principal. If an institution approves loans through the actions of an agent, the institution must report the action taken on the application (loan originated, approved but not accepted, or denied, for example). State law determines whether one party is the agent of another.</p><p class="depth0">7. Affiliate bank underwriting (250.250 review). If an institution makes an independent evaluation of the creditworthiness of an applicant (for example, as part of a preclosing review by an affiliate bank under 12 CFR 250.250, which interprets section 23A of the Federal Reserve Act), the institution is making a credit decision. If the institution then acquires the loan, it reports the loan as an origination whether the loan closes in the name of the institution or its affiliate. An institution that does not acquire the loan but takes some other action reports that action.</p><p class="depth0">8. Participation loan. An institution that originates a loan and then sells partial interests to other institutions reports the loan as an origination. An institution that acquires only a partial interest in such a loan does not report the transaction even if it has participated in the underwriting and origination of the loan.</p><p class="depth0">9. Assumptions. An assumption occurs when an institution enters into a written agreement accepting a new borrower as the obligor on an existing obligation. An institution reports as a home purchase loan an assumption (or an application for an assumption) in the amount of the outstanding principal. If a transaction does not involve a written agreement between a new borrower and the institution, it is not an assumption for HMDA purposes and is not reported.</p><p class="depth0">Section 203.2--Definitions</p><p class="depth0">2(b) Application. 1. Consistency with Regulation B. Board interpretations that appear in the official staff commentary to Regulation B (Equal Credit Opportunity, 12 CFR part 202, Supplement 1) are generally applicable to the definition of an application under Regulation C. However, under Regulation C

the definition of an application does not include prequalification requests.</p><p class="depth0">2. Prequalification. A prequalification request is a request by a prospective loan applicant (other than a request for preapproval) for a preliminary determination on whether the prospective applicant would likely qualify for credit under an institution's standards, or for a determination on the amount of credit for which the prospective applicant would likely qualify. Some institutions evaluate prequalification requests through a procedure that is separate from the institution's normal loan application process; others use the same process. In either case, Regulation C does not require an institution to report prequalification requests on the HMDA/LAR, even though these requests may constitute applications under Regulation B for purposes of adverse action notices.</p><p class="depth0">3. Requests for preapproval. To be a covered preapproval program, the written commitment issued under the program must result from a full review of the creditworthiness of the applicant, including such verification of income, resources and other matters as is typically done by the institution as part of its normal credit evaluation program. In addition to conditions involving the identification of a suitable property and verification that no material change has occurred in the applicant's financial condition or creditworthiness, the written commitment may be subject only to other conditions (unrelated to the financial condition or creditworthiness of the applicant) that the lender ordinarily attaches to a traditional home mortgage application approval. These conditions are limited to conditions such as requiring an acceptable title insurance binder or a certificate indicating clear termite inspection, and, in the case where the applicant plans to use the proceeds from the sale of the applicant's present home to purchase a new home, a settlement statement showing adequate proceeds from the sale of the present home.</p><p class="depth0">2(c) Branch office. 1. Credit union. For purposes of Regulation C, a ``branch'' of a credit union is any office where member accounts are established or loans are made, whether or not the office has been approved as a branch by a federal or state agency. (See 12 U.S.C. 1752.)</p><p class="depth0">2. Depository institution. A branch of a depository institution does not include a loan-production office, the office of an affiliate, or the office of a third party such as a loan broker. (But see Appendix A, paragraph I.C.6, which requires certain depository institutions to report property location even for properties located outside those MSAs or Metropolitan Divisions in which the institution has a home or branch office.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Nondepository institution. For a nondepository institution, ``branch office'' does not include the office of an affiliate or other third party such as a loan broker. (But note that certain nondepository institutions must report property location even in MSAs or Metropolitan Divisions where they do not have a physical location.)</p><p class="depth0">2(d) Dwelling. 1. Coverage. The definition of ``dwelling'' is not limited to the principal or other residence of the applicant or borrower, and thus includes vacation or second homes and rental properties. A dwelling also includes a multifamily structure such as an apartment building.</p><p class="depth0">2. Exclusions. Recreational vehicles such as boats or campers are not dwellings for purposes of HMDA. Also excluded are transitory residences such as hotels, hospitals, and college dormitories--whose occupants have principal residences elsewhere.</p><p class="depth0">2(e) Financial institution. 1. General. An institution that met the test for coverage under HMDA in year 1, and then ceases to meet the test (for example, because its assets fall below the threshold on December 31 of year 2) stops collecting HMDA data beginning with year 3. Similarly, an institution that did not meet the coverage test for a given year, and then meets the test in the succeeding year, begins collecting HMDA data in the calendar year following the year in which it meets the test for coverage. For example, a for-profit mortgage lending institution (other than a bank, savings association, or credit union) that, in year 1, falls below the thresholds specified in Sec. 203.2(e)(2)(ii)(A) and (B), but meets one of them in year 2, need not collect data in year 2, but begins collecting data in year 3.</p><p class="depth0">2. Adjustment of exemption threshold for depository institutions. For data collection in 2011, the asset-size exemption threshold is $40 million. Depository institutions with assets at or below $40 million as of December 31, 2010 are exempt from collecting data for 2011.</p><p class="depth0">3. Coverage after a merger. Several scenarios of data-collection responsibilities for the calendar year of a merger are described below. Under all the scenarios, if the merger results in a covered institution, that institution must begin data collection January I of the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">i. Two institutions are not covered by Regulation C because of asset size. The institutions merge. No data collection is required for the year of the merger (even if the merger results in a covered institution).</p><p class="depth0">ii. A covered institution and an exempt institution merge. The covered institution is the surviving institution. For the year of the merger, data collection is required for the covered institution's transactions. Data collection is optional for transactions handled in offices of the previously exempt institution.</p><p class="depth0">iii. A covered institution and an exempt institution merge. The exempt institution is

the surviving institution, or a new institution is formed. Data collection is required for transactions of the covered institution that take place prior to the merger. Data collection is optional for transactions taking place after the merger date.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Two covered institutions merge. Data collection is required for the entire year. The surviving or resulting institution files either a consolidated submission or separate submissions for that year.</p><p class="depth0">4. Originations. HMDA coverage depends in part on whether an institution has originated home purchase loans. To determine whether activities with respect to a particular loan constitute an origination, institutions should consult, among other parts of the staff commentary, the discussion of the broker rule under Sec. Sec. 203.1(c) and 203.4(a).</p><p class="depth0">5. Branches of foreign banks--treated as banks. A federal branch or a state-licensed insured branch of a foreign bank is a ``bank'' under section 3(a)(1) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813(a)), and is covered by HMDA if it meets the tests for a depository institution found in Sec. 203.2(e)(1) of Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">6. Branches and offices of foreign banks--treated as for-profit mortgage lending institutions. Federal agencies, state-licensed agencies, state-licensed uninsured branches of foreign banks, commercial lending companies owned or controlled by foreign banks, and entities operating under section 25 or 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, 12 U.S.C. 601 and 611 (Edge Act and agreement corporations) are not ``banks'' under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. These entities are nonetheless covered by HMDA if they meet the tests for a for-profit nondepository mortgage lending institution found in Sec. 203.2(e)(2) of Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">2(g) Home improvement loan. 1. Classification requirement for loans not secured by a lien on a dwelling. An institution has ``classified'' a loan that is not secured by a lien on a dwelling as a home improvement loan if it has entered the loan on its books as a home improvement loan, or has otherwise coded or identified the loan as a home improvement loan. For example, an institution that has booked a loan or reported it on a ``call report'' as a home improvement loan has classified it as a home improvement loan. An institution may also classify loans as home improvement loans in other ways (for example, by color-coding loan files).</p><p class="depth0">2. Improvements to real property. Home improvements include improvements both to a dwelling and to the real property on which the dwelling is located (for example, installation of a swimming pool, construction of a garage, or landscaping).</p><p class="depth0">3. Commercial and other loans. A home improvement loan may include a loan originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending division (such as a loan to improve an apartment building made through the commercial loan department).</p><p class="depth0">4. Mixed-use property. A loan to improve property used for residential and commercial purposes (for example, a building containing apartment units and retail space) is a home improvement loan if the loan proceeds are used primarily to improve the residential portion of the property. If the loan proceeds are used to improve the entire property (for example, to replace the heating system), the loan is a home improvement loan if the property itself is primarily residential. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use of the property, such as by square footage or by the income generated. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis. If the loan is unsecured, to report the loan as a home improvement loan the institution must also have classified it as such.</p><p class="depth0">5. Multiple-category loans. If a loan is a home improvement loan as well as a refinancing, an institution reports the loan as a home improvement loan.</p><p class="depth0">2(h) Home purchase loan. 1. Multiple properties. A home purchase loan includes a loan secured by one dwelling and used to purchase another dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">2. Mixed-use property. A dwelling-secured loan to purchase property used primarily for residential purposes (for example, an apartment building containing a convenience store) is a home purchase loan. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use of the property, such as by square footage or by the income generated. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">3. Farm loan. A loan to purchase property used primarily for agricultural purposes is not a home purchase loan even if the property includes a dwelling. An institution may use any reasonable standard to determine the primary use of the property, such as by reference to the exemption from Regulation X (Real Estate Settlement Procedures, 24 CFR 3500.5(b)(1)) for a loan on property of 25 acres or more. An institution may select the standard to apply on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth0">4. Commercial and other loans. A home purchase loan may include a loan originated outside an institution's residential mortgage lending division (such as a loan for the purchase of an apartment building made through the commercial loan department).</p><p class="depth0">5. Construction and permanent financing. A home purchase loan includes both a combined construction/permanent loan and the permanent financing that replaces a construction-only loan. It does not include a construction-only loan, which is considered ``temporary financing'' under Regulation C and is not reported.</p><p class="depth0">6. Second mortgages that finance the downpayments on first mortgages. If an institution making a first mortgage loan to a home

purchaser also makes a second mortgage loan to the same purchaser to finance part or all the home purchaser's downpayment, the institution reports each loan separately as a home purchase loan.</p><p class="depth0">7. Multiple-category loans. If a loan is a home purchase loan as well as a home improvement loan, or a refinancing, an institution reports the loan as a home purchase loan.</p><p class="depth0">2(i) Manufactured home. 1. Definition of a manufactured home. The definition in Sec. 203.2(i) refers to the federal building code for factory-built housing established by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). The HUD code requires generally that housing be essentially ready for occupancy upon leaving the factory and being transported to a building site. Modular homes that meet all of the HUD code standards are included in the definition because they are ready for occupancy upon leaving the factory. Other factory-built homes, such as panelized and pre-cut homes, generally do not meet the HUD code because they require a significant amount of construction on site before they are ready for occupancy. Loans and applications relating to manufactured homes that do not meet the HUD code should not be identified as manufactured housing under HMDA.</p><p class="depth0">2(j) Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Metropolitan Divisions. 1. Use of terms ``Metropolitan Statistical Area'' and ``Metropolitan Division.'' The U.S. Office of Management and Budget defines Metropolitan Statistical Areas and Metropolitan Divisions to provide nationally consistent definitions for collecting, tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics for a set of geographic areas. OMB divides every Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) with a population of 2.5 million or more into Metropolitan Divisions (MDs); MSAs with populations under 2.5 million population are not so divided. 67 FR 82228 (December 27, 2000). For all purposes under Regulation C, if an MSA is divided by OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic unit to be used is the MD; if an MSA is not so divided by OMB into MDs, the appropriate geographic unit to be used is the MSA.</p><p class="depth0">Section 203.4--Compilation of Loan Data</p><p class="depth0">4(a) Data Format and Itemization. 1. Reporting requirements.</p><p class="depth0">i. An institution reports data on loans that it originated and loans that it purchased during the calendar year described in the report. An institution reports these data even if the loans were subsequently sold by the institution.</p><p class="depth0">ii. An institution reports the data for loan applications that did not result in originations--for example, applications that the institution denied or that the applicant withdrew during the calendar year covered by the report.</p><p class="depth0">iii. In the case of brokered loan applications or applications forwarded through a correspondent, the institution reports as originations the loans that it approved and subsequently acquired per a pre-closing arrangement (whether or not they closed in the institution's name). Additionally, the institution reports the data for all applications that did not result in originations--for example, applications that the institution denied or that the applicant withdrew during the calendar year covered by the report (whether or not they would have closed in the institution's name). For all of these loans and applications, the institution reports the required data regarding the borrower's or applicant's ethnicity, race, sex, and income.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Loan originations are to be reported only once. If the institution is the loan broker or correspondent, it does not report as originations the loans that it forwarded to another lender for approval prior to closing, and that were approved and subsequently acquired by that lender (whether or not they closed in the institution's name).</p><p class="depth0">v. An institution reports applications that were received in the previous calendar year but were acted upon during the calendar year covered by the current register.</p><p class="depth0">vi. A financial institution submits all required data to its supervisory agency in one package, with the prescribed transmittal sheet. An officer of the institution certifies to the accuracy of the data.</p><p class="depth0">vii. The transmittal sheet states the total number of line entries contained in the accompanying data transmission.</p><p class="depth0">2. Updating--agency requirements. Certain state or federal regulations, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's regulations, may require an institution to update its data more frequently than is required under Regulation C.</p><p class="depth0">3. Form of quarterly updating. An institution may maintain the quarterly updates of the HMDA/LAR in electronic or any other format, provided the institution can make the information available to its regulatory agency in a timely manner upon request.</p><p class="depth0">4. Transition rules for applications received before January 1, 2004, when final action is taken on or after January 1, 2004. For applications received before January 1, 2004, on which final action is taken on or after January 1, 2004, data must be collected and reported on the HMDA/LAR under the revisions to Regulation C that take effect on January 1, 2004, subject to the exceptions for property type, loan purpose, requests for preapproval, applicant information, and rate spread set forth in this comment.</p><p class="depth0">i. Property type. Lenders need not determine whether an application received before January 1, 2004, involves a manufactured home, and may report the property type as 1-to 4-family.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Loan purpose. For applications received before January 1, 2004, lenders may use the definitions of a home improvement loan and a refinancing that were in effect in 2003. For example, a lender need not report data on an application received before January 1, 2004, for a dwelling-secured loan made for the purpose of home improvement, if the lender did not classify the loan as a home improvement loan. Similarly, a lender may report data on an application for a refinancing received in 2003, where the new obligation will be, but the existing obligation was not, secured by a lien on a dwelling.</p><p class="depth0">iii. Requests for preapproval. For requests received before January 1, 2004, lenders need not report requests for preapproval (as that term is defined in Sec. 203.2(b)(2) of the revised Regulation C) that do not result in a traditional loan application. Lenders may, at their option, report requests for preapproval that are denied or that are approved but not accepted. In addition, lenders need not specify whether an application for a home purchase loan involved a request for preapproval, and should use code 3 (Not Applicable) in the preapproval field on the HMDA/LAR.</p><p class="depth0">iv. Applicant information. For applications received before January 1, 2004, lenders must collect data on race or national origin using the categories in effect in 2003, and must convert the data to the codes in effect in 2004 for reporting, using the following conversion guide:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Ethnicity. The revised Regulation C requires lenders to request an applicant's ethnicity first (Hispanic or Latino, Not Hispanic or Latino), and then to request the applicant's race. The HMDA/LAR has been revised accordingly, so that ethnicity and race are distinct fields.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as Hispanic (code 4) in 2003, use code 1 (Hispanic or Latino) for reporting ethnicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian or Pacific Islander, Black, White, Other, or Not Applicable (codes 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, or 8) in 2003, use code 4 (Not Applicable) for reporting ethnicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the applicant did not provide information on race in a mail, Internet, or telephone application (code 7) in 2003, use code 3 (information not provided by applicant in mail, Internet, or telephone application) for reporting ethnicity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Race.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as American Indian or Alaskan Native, Black, or White in 2003, use the corresponding code for 2004. For example, if the applicant's race was identified as Black (code 3) in 2003, use code 3 (Black or African-American) for reporting race in 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as Asian or Pacific Islander in 2003, use code 2 (Asian).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as Hispanic in 2003, use code 7 (Not Applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as Other in 2003, use code 7 (Not Applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the applicant did not provide information on race in a mail, Internet, or telephone application (code 7) in 2003, use code 6 (Information not provided by applicant in mail, Internet, or telephone application).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the applicant's race was identified as Not Applicable (code 8) in 2003, use code 7 (Not Applicable).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Sex. For applications received before January 1, 2004, in which there is no co-applicant, the lender may use code 4 (Not Applicable) in the field provided for the co-applicant's sex.</p><p class="depth0">v. Rate Spread. For applications received before January 1, 2004, in which the rate lock occurred before January 1, 2004, lenders may report NA (Not Applicable) for rate spread. For applications received before January 1, 2004, for which the rate lock occurred after January 1, 2004, lenders must calculate and report the rate spread in accordance with the rules set forth in new section 202.4(a)(12) (see 67 FR 7222 (Feb. 15, 2002); 67 FR 43223 (June 27, 2002)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Example: Assume an application is received on December 1, 2003; the rate lock occurs on December 26, 2003, and the loan is originated on January 15, 2004. The lender may report NA (Not Applicable) for rate spread.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Example: Assume an application is received on December 15, 2003; the rate lock occurs on January 3, 2004, and the loan is originated on January 15, 2004. The lender must calculate and report the rate spread in accordance with the rules in new section 202.4(a)(12) (see 67 FR 7222 (Feb. 15, 2002); 67 FR 43223 (June 27, 2002)).</p><p class="depth0">4(a)(1) Application number and application date. 1. Application date--consistency. In reporting the date of application, an institution reports the date the application was received or the date shown on the application. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans).</p><p class="depth0">2. Application date--application forwarded by a broker. For an application forwarded by a broker, an institution reports the date the application was received by the broker, the date the application was received by the institution, or the date shown on the application. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one

approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans).</p><p class="depth0">3. Application date--reinstated application. If, within the same calendar year, an applicant asks an institution to reinstate a counteroffer that the applicant previously did not accept (or asks the institution to reconsider an application that was denied, withdrawn, or closed for incompleteness), the institution may treat that request as the continuation of the earlier transaction or as a new transaction. If the institution treats the request for reinstatement or reconsideration as a new transaction, it reports the date of the request as the application date.</p><p class="depth0">4. Application or loan number. An institution must ensure that each identifying number is unique within the institution. If an institution's register contains data for branch offices, for example, the institution could use a letter or a numerical code to identify the loans or applications of different branches, or could assign a certain series of numbers to particular branches to avoid duplicate numbers. Institutions are strongly encouraged not to use the applicant's or borrower's name or social security number, for privacy reasons.</p><p class="depth0">5. Application--year action taken. An institution must report an application in the calendar year in which the institution takes final action on the application.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(3) Purpose.</p><p class="depth0">1. Purpose--statement of applicant. An institution may rely on the oral or written statement of an applicant regarding the proposed use of loan proceeds. For example, a lender could use a check-box, or a purpose line, on a loan application to determine whether or not the applicant intends to use loan proceeds for home improvement purposes.</p><p class="depth0">2. Purpose--multiple-purpose loan. If a loan is a home purchase loan as well as a home improvement loan, or a refinancing, an institution reports the loan as a home purchase loan. If a loan is a home improvement loan as well as a refinancing, an institution reports the loan as a home improvement loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(6) Occupancy.</p><p class="depth0">1. Occupancy--multiple properties. If a loan relates to multiple properties, the institution reports the owner occupancy status of the property for which property location is being reported. (See the comments to paragraph 4(a)(9), Property location.)</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(7) Loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">1. Loan amount--counteroffer. If an applicant accepts a counteroffer for an amount different from the amount initially requested, the institution reports the loan amount granted. If an applicant does not accept a counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the loan amount initially requested.</p><p class="depth0">2. Loan amount--multiple-purpose loan. Except in the case of a home-equity line of credit, an institution reports the entire amount of the loan, even if only a part of the proceeds is intended for home purchase or home improvement.</p><p class="depth0">3. Loan amount--home-equity line. An institution that has chosen to report home-equity lines of credit reports only the part that is intended for home-improvement or home-purchase purposes.</p><p class="depth0">4. Loan amount--assumption. An institution that enters into a written agreement accepting a new party as the obligor on a loan reports the amount of the outstanding principal on the assumption as the loan amount.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(8) Type of action taken and date.</p><p class="depth0">1. Action taken--counteroffers. If an institution makes a counteroffer to lend on terms different from the applicant's initial request (for example, for a shorter loan maturity or in a different amount) and the applicant does not accept the counteroffer or fails to respond, the institution reports the action taken as a denial on the original terms requested by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0">2. Action taken--rescinded transactions. If a borrower rescinds a transaction after closing, the institution may report the transaction either as an origination or as an application that was approved but not accepted.</p><p class="depth0">3. Action taken--purchased loans. An institution reports the loans that it purchased during the calendar year, and does not report the loans that it declined to purchase.</p><p class="depth0">4. Action taken--conditional approvals. If an institution issues a loan approval subject to the applicant's meeting underwriting conditions (other than customary loan commitment or loan-closing conditions, such as a clear-title requirement or an acceptable property survey) and the applicant does not meet them, the institution reports the action taken as a denial.</p><p class="depth0">5. Action taken date--approved but not accepted. For a loan approved by an institution but not accepted by the applicant, the institution reports any reasonable date, such as the approval date, the deadline for accepting the offer, or the date the file was closed. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans).</p><p class="depth0">6. Action taken date--originations. For loan originations, an institution generally reports the settlement or closing date. For loan originations that an institution acquires through a broker, the institution reports either the settlement or closing date, or the date the institution acquired the loan from the broker. If the disbursement of funds takes place on a date later than the settlement or closing date, the institution may use the date of disbursement. For a construction/permanent loan, the institution reports

either the settlement or closing date, or the date the loan converts to the permanent financing. Although an institution need not choose the same approach for its entire HMDA submission, it should be generally consistent (such as by routinely using one approach within a particular division of the institution or for a category of loans). Notwithstanding this flexibility regarding the use of the closing date in connection with reporting the date action was taken, the year in which an origination goes to closing is the year in which the institution must report the origination.</p><p class="depth0">7. Action taken--pending applications. An institution does not report any loan application still pending at the end of the calendar year; it reports that application on its register for the year in which final action is taken.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(9) Property location.</p><p class="depth0">1. Property location--multiple properties (home improvement/refinance of home improvement). For a home improvement loan, an institution reports the property being improved. If more than one property is being improved, the institution reports the location of one of the properties or reports the loan using multiple entries on its HMDA/LAR (with unique identifiers) and allocating the loan amount among the properties.</p><p class="depth0">2. Property location--multiple properties (home purchase/refinance of home purchase). For a home purchase loan, an institution reports the property taken as security. If an institution takes more than one property as security, the institution reports the location of the property being purchased if there is just one. If the loan is to purchase multiple properties and is secured by multiple properties, the institution reports the location of one of the properties or reports the loan using multiple entries on its HMDA/LAR (with unique identifiers) and allocating the loan amount among the properties.</p><p class="depth0">3. Property location--loans purchased from another institution. The requirement to report the property location by census tract in an MSA or Metropolitan Division where the institution has a home or branch office applies not only to loan applications and originations but also to loans purchased from another institution. This includes loans purchased from an institution that did not have a home or branch office in that MSA or Metropolitan Division and did not collect the property-location information.</p><p class="depth0">4. Property location--mobile or manufactured home. If information about the potential site of a mobile or manufactured home is not available, an institution reports using the code for ``not applicable.''</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(10) Applicant and income data.</p><p class="depth0">1. Applicant data--completion by applicant. An institution reports the monitoring information as provided by the applicant. For example, if an applicant checks the ``Asian'' box the institution reports using the ``Asian'' code.</p><p class="depth0">2. Applicant data--completion by lender. If an applicant fails to provide the requested information for an application taken in person, the institution reports the data on the basis of visual observation or surname.</p><p class="depth0">3. Applicant data--application completed in person. When an applicant meets in person with a lender to complete an application that was begun by mail, Internet, or telephone, the institution must request the monitoring information. If the meeting occurs after the application process is complete, for example, at closing, the institution is not required to obtain monitoring information.</p><p class="depth0">4. Applicant data--joint applicant. A joint applicant may enter the government monitoring information on behalf of an absent joint applicant. If the information is not provided, the institution reports using the code for ``information not provided by applicant in mail, Internet, or telephone application.''</p><p class="depth0">5. Applicant data--video and other electronic-application processes. An institution that accepts applications through electronic media with a video component treats the applications as taken in person and collects the information about the ethnicity, race, and sex of applicants. An institution that accepts applications through electronic media without a video component (for example, the Internet or facsimile) treats the applications as accepted by mail.</p><p class="depth0">6. Income data--income relied on. An institution reports the gross annual income relied on in evaluating the creditworthiness of applicants. For example, if an institution relies on an applicant's salary to compute a debt-to-income ratio but also relies on the applicant's annual bonus to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution reports the salary and the bonus to the extent relied upon. Similarly, if an institution relies on the income of a cosigner to evaluate creditworthiness, the institution includes this income to the extent relied upon. But an institution does not include the income of a guarantor who is only secondarily liable.</p><p class="depth0">7. Income data--co-applicant. If two persons jointly apply for a loan and both list income on the application, but the institution relies only on the income of one applicant in computing ratios and in evaluating creditworthiness, the institution reports only the income relied on.</p><p class="depth0">8. Income data--loan to employee. An institution may report ``NA'' in the income field for loans to its employees to protect their privacy, even though the institution relied on their income in making its credit decisions.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(11) Purchaser.</p><p class="depth0">1. Type of purchaser--loan-participation interests sold to more than one entity. An institution that originates a loan, and then sells it to more than one entity, reports the ``type of

purchaser'' based on the entity purchasing the greatest interest, if any. If an institution retains a majority interest, it does not report the sale.</p><p class="depth0">2. Type of purchaser--swapped loans. Loans ``swapped'' for mortgage-backed securities are to be treated as sales; the purchaser is the type of entity receiving the loans that are swapped.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(12) Rate spread information.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(12)(ii).</p><p class="depth0">1. Average prime offer rate. Average prime offer rates are annual percentage rates derived from average interest rates, points, and other loan pricing terms offered to borrowers by a representative sample of lenders for mortgage loans that have low-risk pricing characteristics. Other pricing terms include commonly used indices, margins, and initial fixed-rate periods for variable-rate transactions. Relevant pricing characteristics include a consumer's credit history and transaction characteristics such as the loan-to-value ratio, owner-occupant status, and purpose of the transaction. To obtain average prime offer rates, the Board uses a survey of lenders that both meets the criteria of Sec. 203.4(a)(12)(ii) and provides pricing terms for at least two types of variable-rate transactions and at least two types of non-variable-rate transactions. An example of such a survey is the Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey [supreg].</p><p class="depth0">2. Comparable transaction. The rate spread reporting requirement applies to a reportable loan with an annual percentage rate that exceeds by the specified margin (or more) the average prime offer rate for a comparable transaction as of the date the interest rate is set. The tables of average prime offer rates published by the Board (see comment 4(a)(12)(ii)-3) indicate how to identify the comparable transaction.</p><p class="depth0">3. Board tables. The Board publishes on the FFIEC's Web site (http://www.ffiec.gov/hmda), in table form, average prime offer rates for a wide variety of transaction types. The Board calculates an annual percentage rate, consistent with Regulation Z (see 12 CFR 226.22 and part 226, appendix J), for each transaction type for which pricing terms are available from the survey described in comment 4(a)(12)(ii)-1. The Board estimates annual percentage rates for other types of transactions for which direct survey data are not available based on the loan pricing terms available in the survey and other information. The Board publishes on the FFIEC's Web site the methodology it uses to arrive at these estimates.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(a)(14) Lien status.</p><p class="depth0">1. Determining lien status for applications and loans originated. i. Lenders are required to report lien status for loans they originate and applications that do not result in originations. Lien status is determined by reference to the best information readily available to the lender at the time final action is taken and to the lender's own procedures. Thus, lenders may rely on the title search they routinely perform as part of their underwriting procedures--for example, for home purchase loans. Regulation C does not require lenders to perform title searches solely to comply with HMDA reporting requirements. Lenders may rely on other information that is readily available to them at the time final action is taken and that they reasonably believe is accurate, such as the applicant's statement on the application or the applicant's credit report. For example, where the applicant indicates on the application that there is a mortgage on the property or where the applicant's credit report shows that the applicant has a mortgage--and that mortgage is not going to be paid off as part of the transaction--the lender may assume that the loan it originates is secured by a subordinate lien. If the same application did not result in an origination--for example, because the application is denied or withdrawn--the lender would report the application as an application for a subordinate-lien loan.</p><p class="depth0">ii. Lenders may also consider their established procedures when determining lien status for applications that do not result in originations. For example, a consumer applies to a lender to refinance a $100,000 first mortgage; the consumer also has a home equity line of credit for $20,000. If the lender's practice in such a case is to ensure that it will have first-lien position--through a subordination agreement with the holder of the mortgage on the home equity line--then the lender should report the application as an application for a first-lien loan.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(c)(3) Optional data--home-equity lines of credit.</p><p class="depth0">1. An institution that opts to report home-equity lines reports the disposition of all applications, not just originations.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 4(d) Excluded data.</p><p class="depth0">1. Mergers, purchases in bulk, and branch acquisitions. If a covered institution acquires loans in bulk from another institution (for example, from the receiver for a failed institution) but no merger or acquisition of the institution, or acquisition of a branch, is involved, the institution reports the loans as purchased loans.</p><p class="depth0">Section 203.5(a)--Disclosure and Reporting</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(a) Reporting to agency.</p><p class="depth0">1. Submission of data. Institutions submit data to their supervisory agencies in an automated, machine-readable form. The format must conform to that of the HMDA/LAR. An institution should contact its federal supervisory agency for information regarding procedures and technical specifications for automated data submission; in some cases, agencies also make software available for automated data submission.

The data are edited before submission, using the edits included in the agency-supplied software or equivalent edits in software available from vendors or developed in-house.</p><p class="depth0">2. Submission in paper form. Institutions that report twenty-five or fewer entries on their HMDA/LAR may collect and report the data in paper form. An institution that submits its register in nonautomated form sends two copies that are typed or computer printed and must use the format of the HMDA/LAR (but need not use the form itself). Each page must be numbered along with the total number of pages (for example, ``Page 1 of 3'').</p><p class="depth0">3. Procedures for entering data. The required data are entered in the register for each loan origination, each application acted on, and each loan purchased during the calendar year. The institution should decide on the procedure it wants to follow--for example, whether to begin entering the required data, when an application is received, or to wait until final action is taken (such as when a loan goes to closing or an application is denied).</p><p class="depth0">4. Options for collection. An institution may collect data on separate registers at different branches, or on separate registers for different loan types (such as for home purchase or home improvement loans, or for loans on multifamily dwellings). Entries need not be grouped on the register by MSA or Metropolitan Division, or chronologically, or by census tract numbers, or in any other particular order.</p><p class="depth0">5. Change in supervisory agency. If the supervisory agency for a covered institution changes (as a consequence of a merger or a change in the institution's charter, for example), the institution must report data to its new supervisory agency beginning with the year of the change.</p><p class="depth0">6. Subsidiaries. An institution is a subsidiary of a bank or savings association (for purposes of reporting HMDA data to the parent's supervisory agency) if the bank or savings association holds or controls an ownership interest that is greater than 50 percent of the institution.</p><p class="depth0">7. Transmittal sheet--additional data submissions. If an additional data submission becomes necessary (for example, because the institution discovers that data were omitted from the initial submission, or because revisions are called for, that submission must be accompanied by a transmittal sheet.</p><p class="depth0">8. Transmittal sheet--revisions or deletions. If a data submission involves revisions or deletions of previously submitted data, it must state the total of all line entries contained in that submission, including both those representing revisions or deletions of previously submitted entries, and those that are being resubmitted unchanged or are being submitted for the first time. Depository institutions must provide a list of the MSAs or Metropolitan Divisions in which they have home or branch offices.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(b) Public disclosure of statement.</p><p class="depth0">1. Business day. For purposes of Sec. 203.5, a business day is any calendar day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal public holiday.</p><p class="depth0">2. Format. An institution may make the disclosure statement available in paper form or, if the person requesting the data agrees, in automated form (such as by PC diskette or CD Rom).</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(c) Public disclosure of modified loan/application register.</p><p class="depth0">1. Format. An institution may make the modified register available in paper or automated form (such as by PC diskette or computer tape). Although institutions are not required to make the modified register available in census tract order, they are strongly encouraged to do so in order to enhance its utility to users.</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 5(e) Notice of availability.</p><p class="depth0">1. Poster--suggested text. An institution may use any text that meets the requirements of the regulation. Some of the federal financial regulatory agencies and HUD provide HMDA posters that an institution can use to inform the public of the availability of its HMDA data, or the institution may create its own posters. If an institution prints its own, the following language is suggested but is not required:</p><p class="depth0">Home Mortgage Disclosure Act Notice</p><p class="depth0">The HMDA data about our residential mortgage lending are available for review. The data show geographic distribution of loans and applications; ethnicity, race, sex, and income of applicants and borrowers; and information about loan approvals and denials. Inquire at this office regarding the locations where HMDA data may be inspected.</p><p class="depth0">2. Additional language for institutions making the disclosure statement available on request. An institution that posts a notice informing the public of the address to which a request should be sent could include the following sentence, for example, in its general notice: ``To receive a copy of these data send a written request to [address].''</p><p class="depth0">Section 203.6--Enforcement</p><p class="depth0">Paragraph 6(b) Bona fide errors.</p><p class="depth0">1. Bona fide error--information from third parties. An institution that obtains the property-location information for applications and loans from third parties (such as appraisers or vendors of ``geocoding'' services)

is responsible for ensuring that the information reported on its HMDA/LAR is correct.
