                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart provides the requirements necessary for a PHA to participate in the Capital Fund Financing Program (CFFP), under which the PHA may obtain HUD approval to borrow private capital and pledge a portion of its annual Capital Fund grant or public housing assets and other public housing property of the public housing agency as security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Under the CFFP, PHAs are permitted to borrow private capital to finance public housing development or modernization activities. A PHA may use a portion of its Capital Fund for debt service payments and usual and customary financing costs associated with public housing development or modernization (including public housing in mixed-finance developments). A PHA that undertakes such financing activities may, subject to HUD's written approval, grant a security interest in its future annual Capital Fund grants, which shall be subject to the appropriation of those funds by Congress. The PHA's financing activities are not obligations or liabilities of the Federal Government. The Federal Government does not assume any liability with respect to any such pledge of future appropriations, and the Federal Government neither guarantees nor provides any full faith and credit for these financing transactions.</p>
