                            <p class="depth0">All definitions in subpart K of this part, and the following:</p><p class="depth0">Accessible environment means any point outside of the controlled  area, including:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The atmosphere (including the atmosphere above the surface area  of the controlled area);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Land surfaces;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Surface waters;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Oceans; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> The lithosphere.</p><p class="depth0">Aquifer means a water-bearing underground geological formation,  group of formations, or part of a formation (excluding perched water  bodies) that can yield a significant amount of ground water to a well or  spring.</p><p class="depth0">Controlled area means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The surface area, identified by passive institutional controls,  that encompasses no more than 300 square kilometers. It must not extend  farther:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> South than 36[deg]40[min]13.6661[sec] North latitude, in the  predominant direction of ground-water flow; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(ii)</em> Than five kilometers from the repository footprint in any other  direction; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> The subsurface underlying the surface area.</p><p class="depth0">Disposal means the emplacement of radioactive material into the  Yucca Mountain disposal system with the intent of isolating it for as  long as reasonably possible and with no intent of recovery, whether or  not the design of the disposal system permits the ready recovery of the  material. Disposal of radioactive material in the Yucca Mountain  disposal system begins when all of the ramps and other openings into the  Yucca Mountain repository are sealed.</p><p class="depth0">Ground water means water that is below the land surface and in a  saturated zone.</p><p class="depth0">Human intrusion means breaching of any portion of the Yucca Mountain  disposal system, within the repository footprint, by any human activity.</p><p class="depth0">Passive institutional controls means:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Markers, as permanent as practicable, placed on the Earth's  surface;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Public records and archives;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Government ownership and regulations regarding land or resource  use; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Other reasonable methods of preserving knowledge about the  location, design, and contents of the Yucca Mountain disposal system.</p><p class="depth2">Peak dose means the highest annual dose projected to be received by  the reasonably maximally exposed individual.</p><p class="depth2">Period of geologic stability means the time during which the  variability of geologic characteristics and their future behavior in and  around the Yucca Mountain site can be bounded, that is, they can be  projected within a reasonable range of possibilities. This period is  defined to end at 1 million years after disposal.</p><p class="depth2">Plume of contamination means that volume of ground water in the  predominant direction of ground-water flow that contains radioactive  contamination from releases from the Yucca Mountain repository. It does  not include releases from any other potential sources on or near the  Nevada Test Site.</p><p class="depth2">Repository footprint means the outline of the outermost locations of  where the waste is emplaced in the Yucca Mountain repository.</p><p class="depth2">Slice of the plume means a cross-section of the plume of  contamination with sufficient thickness parallel to the prevalent  direction of flow of the plume that it contains the representative  volume.</p><p class="depth2">Total dissolved solids means the total dissolved (filterable) solids  in water as determined by use of the method specified in 40 CFR part  136.</p><p class="depth2">Undisturbed performance means that human intrusion or the occurrence  of unlikely natural features, events, and processes do not disturb the  disposal system.</p><p class="depth2">Undisturbed Yucca Mountain disposal system means that the Yucca  Mountain disposal system is not affected by human intrusion.</p><p class="depth2">Waste means any radioactive material emplaced for disposal into the  Yucca Mountain repository.</p><p class="depth2">Well-capture zone means the volume from which a well pumping at a  defined rate is withdrawing water from an aquifer. The dimensions of the  well-capture zone are determined by the pumping rate in combination with  aquifer characteristics assumed for calculations, such as hydraulic  conductivity, gradient, and the screened interval.</p><p class="depth2">Yucca Mountain disposal system means the combination of underground  engineered and natural barriers within the controlled area that prevents  or substantially reduces releases from the waste.
