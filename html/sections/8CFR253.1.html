                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. When a crewman is paroled into the United States pursuant to the provisions of this part under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act, he shall be given Form I-94 (see Sec. 1.4), reflecting the terms of parole. A notice on Form I-259 shall be served upon the agent, and, if available, upon the owner and master or commanding officer of the vessel or aircraft, which shall specify the purpose of the parole and the conditions under which the alien crewman is paroled into the United States. The Form I-259 shall also specify the Service office to which the alien crewman is to be presented for inspection upon termination of the parole. The guarantee of payment for medical and other related expenses required by section 253 of the Act shall be executed by the owner, agent, consignee, commanding officer or master on Form I-510.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Afflicted crewman. Any alien crewman afflicted with feeblemindedness, insanity, epilepsy, tuberculosis in any form, leprosy, or any dangerous contagious disease, or an alien crewman suspected of being so afflicted shall upon arrival at the first port of call in the United States, be paroled to the medical institution designated by the district director in whose district the port is located, in the custody (other than during the period of time he is in such medical institution) of the agent of the vessel or aircraft on which such alien arrived in the United States and at the expense of the transportation line for a period initially not to exceed

thirty days, for treatment and observation, under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act. Unless the Public Health Surgeon at the first port certifies that such parole be effected immediately for emergent reasons, the district director may defer execution of parole to a subsequent port of the United States to which the vessel or aircraft will proceed, if facilities not readily available at the first port are readily available at such subsequent port of call. Notice to remove an afflicted alien crewman shall be served by the examining immigration officer upon the master or agent of the vessel or aircraft on Form I-259 and shall specify the date when and the place to which such alien crewman shall be removed and the reasons therefor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disabled crewman. Any alien crewman who becomes disabled in any port of the United States, whom the master or agent of the vessel or aircraft is obliged under foreign law to return to another country, may be paroled into the United States under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time and under the conditions set by the district director in whose district the port is located, in the custody of the agent of the vessel or aircraft for the purpose of passing through the United States and transferring to another vessel or aircraft for departure to such foreign country, by the most direct and expeditious route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Shipwrecked or castaway seamen or airmen. A shipwrecked or castaway alien seaman or airman who is rescued by or transferred at sea to a vessel or aircraft destined directly for the United States and who is brought to the United States on such vessel or aircraft other than as a member of its crew shall be paroled into the United States under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time and under the conditions set by the district director in whose district the port is located, in the custody of the appropriate foreign consul or the agent of the aircraft or vessel which was wrecked or from which such seaman or airman was removed, for the purpose of treatment or observation in a hospital, if such is required, and for departure to the appropriate foreign country by the most direct and expeditious route.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Medical treatment or observation. Any alien crewman denied a conditional landing permit or whose conditional landing permit issued under Sec. 252.1(d)(1) of this chapter is revoked may, upon the request of the master or agent, be paroled into the United States under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act in the custody of the agent of the vessel or aircraft and at the expense of the transportation line for medical treatment or observation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Crewman, stowaway, or alien removable under section 235(c) alleging persecution or torture. Any alien crewman, stowaway, or alien removable under section 235(c) of the Act who alleges that he or she cannot return to his or her country of nationality or last habitual residence (if not a national of any country) because of fear of persecution in that country on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion, or because of fear of torture is eligible to apply for asylum or withholding of removal under 8 CFR part 208. Service officers shall take particular care to ensure that the provisions of Sec. 208.5(b) of this chapter regarding special duties toward aliens aboard certain vessels are closely followed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Other crewmen. In the discretion of the district director, any alien crewman not within the purview of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section may for other emergent reasons or for reasons deemed strictly in the public interest be paroled into the United States under the provisions of section 212(d)(5) of the Act for the period of time and under the conditions set by the district director having jurisdiction over the area where the alien crewman is located.
