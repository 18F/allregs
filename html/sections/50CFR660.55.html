                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. An allocation is the apportionment of a harvest  privilege for a specific purpose, to a particular person, group of  persons, or fishery sector. The opportunity to harvest Pacific Coast  groundfish is allocated among participants in the fishery when the ACLs  for a given year are established in the biennial harvest specifications.  For any stock that has been declared overfished, any formal allocation  may be temporarily revised for the duration of the rebuilding period.  For certain species, primarily trawl-dominant species, beginning with  the 2011-2012 biennial specifications process, separate allocations for  the trawl and nontrawl fishery (which for this purpose includes limited  entry fixed gear, directed open access, and recreational fisheries) will  be established biennially or annually using the standards and procedures  described in Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP. Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP provides  the allocation structure and percentages for species allocated between  the trawl and nontrawl fisheries. Also, for those species not subject to  the trawl and nontrawl allocations specified under Amendment 21 and in  paragraph (c)(1) of this section, separate allocations for the limited  entry and open access fisheries may be established using the procedures  described in Chapters 6 and 11 of the PCGFMP and this subpart.  Allocation of sablefish north of 36[deg] N. lat. is described in  paragraph (h) of this section and in the PCGFMP. Allocation of Pacific  whiting is described in paragraph (i) of this section and in the PCGFMP.  Allocation of black rockfish is described in paragraph (l) of this  section. Allocation of Pacific halibut bycatch is described in paragraph  (m) of this section. Allocations not specified in the PCGFMP are  established in regulation through the biennial harvest specifications  and are listed in Tables 1 a through d and Tables 2 a through d of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Fishery harvest guidelines and reductions made prior to fishery  allocations. Prior to the setting of fishery allocations, the TAC, ACL,  or ACT when specified, is reduced by the Pacific Coast treaty Indian  Tribal harvest (allocations, set-asides, and estimated harvest under  regulations at Sec. 660.50); projected scientific research catch of all  groundfish species, estimates of fishing mortality in non-groundfish  fisheries and, as necessary, deductions   for EFPs. The remaining amount after these deductions is the fishery  harvest guideline or quota. (note: recreational estimates are not  deducted here).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Pacific Coast treaty Indian tribal allocations, set-asides, and  regulations are specified during the biennial harvest specifications  process and are found at Sec. 660.50 and in Tables 1a and 2a of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scientific research catch results from scientific research  activity as defined in regulations at Sec. 600.10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Estimates of fishing mortality in non-groundfish fisheries are  based on historical catch and projected fishing activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> EFPs are authorized and governed by regulations at Sec.

(1) Beginning with the 2011-2012  biennial specifications process, the fishery harvest guideline or quota,  may be divided into allocations for groundfish trawl and nontrawl  (limited entry fixed gear, open access, and recreational) fisheries. IFQ  species not listed in the table below will be allocated between the  trawl and nontrawl fisheries through the biennial harvest specifications  process. Species/species groups and areas allocated between the trawl  and nontrawl fisheries listed in Chapter 6, Table 6-1 of the PCGFMP are  allocated based on the percentages that follow:</p><p class="depth0">Allocation Percentages for Limited Entry Trawl and Non-Trawl Sectors</p><p class="depth0">Specified for FMP Groundfish Stocks and Stock Complexes ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">All non-treaty LE  All non-treaty non-</p><p class="depth0">Stock or complex            trawl sectors %     trawl sectors % ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Lingcod.........................  45................  55 Pacific Cod.....................  95................  5 Sablefish S. of 36[deg] N. lat..  42................  58 PACIFIC OCEAN PERCH.............  95................  5 WIDOW...........................  91................  9 Chilipepper S. of 40[deg]10[min]  75................  25</p><p class="depth0">N. lat..

The allocation for the limited entry  trawl fishery is derived by applying the trawl allocation percentage by  species/species group and area as specified in paragraph (c) of this  section and as specified during the biennial harvest specifications  process to the fishery harvest guideline for that species/species group  and area. For IFQ species other than darkblotched rockfish, Pacific  Ocean Perch, and widow rockfish, the trawl allocation will be further  subdivided among the trawl sectors (MS, C/P, and IFQ) as specified in  Sec. Sec. 660.140, 660.150, and 660.160 of subpart D. For darkblotched  rockfish, Pacific Ocean Perch, and widow rockfish, the trawl allocation  is further subdivided among the trawl sectors (MS, C/P, and IFQ) as  follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Darkblotched rockfish. Allocate 9 percent or 25 mt, whichever is  greater, of the total trawl allocation of darkblotched rockfish to the  whiting fisheries (MS, C/P, and IFQ combined). The distribution of the  whiting trawl allocation of darkblotched to each sector (MS, C/P, and  IFQ) will be done pro rata relative to the sectors' whiting allocation.  After deducting allocations for the whiting fisheries, allocate the   remainder of the trawl allocation to the nonwhiting fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pacific Ocean Perch (POP). Allocate 17 percent or 30 mt,  whichever is greater, of the total trawl allocation of Pacific ocean  perch to the whiting fisheries (MS, C/P, and IFQ combined). The  distribution of the whiting trawl allocation of POP to each sector (MS,  C/P, and IFQ) will be done pro rata relative to the sectors' whiting  allocation. After deducting allocations for the whiting fisheries,  allocate the remainder of the trawl allocation to the nonwhiting  fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Widow rockfish. Allocate 52 percent of the total trawl  allocation of widow rockfish to the whiting sectors if the stock is  under rebuilding or 10 percent of the total trawl allocation or 500 mt  of the trawl allocation to the whiting sectors, whichever is greater, if  the stock is rebuilt. The latter allocation scheme automatically kicks  in when widow rockfish is declared rebuilt. The distribution of the  whiting trawl allocation of widow to each sector (MS, C/P, and IFQ) will  be done pro rata relative to the sectors' whiting allocation. After  deducting allocations for the whiting fisheries, allocate the remainder  of the trawl allocation to the nonwhiting fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Nontrawl fishery allocation. The allocation for the nontrawl  fishery is the fishery harvest guideline minus the allocation of the  species/species group and area to the trawl fishery. These amounts will  equal the nontrawl allocation percentage or amount by species for  species listed in paragraph (c) of this section and the nontrawl  allocation percentage from the biennial harvest specifications for other  IFQ species. The nontrawl allocation will be shared between the limited  entry fixed gear, open access, and recreational fisheries as specified  through the biennial harvest specifications process and consistent with  allocations in the PCGFMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Commercial harvest guidelines. Beginning with the 2011-2012  biennial specifications process, to derive the commercial harvest  guideline, the fishery harvest guideline is further reduced by the  recreational set-asides. The commercial harvest guideline is then  allocated between the limited entry fishery (both trawl and fixed gear)  and the directed open access fishery, as appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Limited entry (LE)/open access (OA) allocations--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> LE/OA  allocation percentages. The allocations between the limited entry and  open access fisheries are based on standards from the PCGFMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Species with LE/OA allocations. For species with LE/OA  allocations that are not subject to Amendment 21 allocations, the  allocation between the limited entry (both trawl and fixed gear) and the  open access fisheries is determined by applying the percentage for those  species with a LE/OA allocation to the commercial harvest guideline plus  the amount set-aside for the non-groundfish fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Limited entry allocation. The allocation for the limited entry  fishery is the commercial harvest guideline minus any allocation to the  directed open access fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Open access allocation. The allocation for the open access  fishery is derived by applying the open access allocation percentage to  the annual commercial harvest guideline or quota plus the non-groundfish  fishery (i.e., incidental open access fishery) amount described in  paragraph (b) of this section. The result is the total open access  allocation. The portion that is set-aside for the non-groundfish  fisheries is deducted and the remainder is the directed open access  portion. For management areas or stocks for which quotas or harvest  guidelines for a stock are not fully utilized, no separate allocation  will be established for the open access fishery until it is projected  that the allowable catch for a species will be reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Open access allocation percentage. For each species with a  harvest guideline or quota, the initial open access allocation  percentage is calculated by:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Computing the total catch for that species during the window  period (July 11, 1984 through August 1, 1988) for the limited entry  program by any vessel that did not initially receive a limited entry  permit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Dividing that amount by the total catch during the window period  by all gear.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The guidelines in this paragraph apply to recalculation of the  open access allocation percentage. Any recalculated allocation  percentage will be used in calculating the following biennial fishing  period's open access allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Between the trawl and nontrawl fisheries--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catch accounting  for the trawl allocation. Any groundfish caught by a vessel registered  to a limited entry trawl-endorsed permit will be counted against the  trawl allocation while they are declared in to a groundfish limited  entry trawl fishery and while the applicable trawl fishery listed in  subpart D of this part for that vessel's limited entry permit is open.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catch accounting for the nontrawl allocation. All groundfish  caught by a vessel not registered to a limited entry permit and not  fishing in the non-groundfish fishery will be counted against the  nontrawl allocation. All groundfish caught by a vessel registered to a  limited entry permit when the fishery for a vessel's limited entry  permit has closed or they are not declared in to a limited entry  fishery, will be counted against the nontrawl allocation, unless they  are declared in to a non-groundfish fishery. Catch by vessels fishing in  the non-groundfish fishery, as defined at Sec. 660.11, will be  accounted for in the estimated mortality in the non-groundfish fishery  that is deducted from the ACL or ACT when specified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The commercial harvest guideline for Pacific whiting is  allocated among three sectors, as follows: 34 percent for the C/P Coop  Program; 24 percent for the MS Coop Program; and 42 percent for the  Shore based IFQ Program. No more than 5 percent of the Shore based IFQ  Program allocation may be taken and retained south of 42[deg] N. lat.  before the start of the primary Pacific whiting season north of 42[deg]  N. lat. Specific sector allocations for a given calendar year are found  in Tables 1a through c and 2a through c of this subpart. Set asides for  other species for the at-sea whiting fishery for a given calendar year  are found in Tables 1d and 2d of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Recreational fisheries. Recreational fishing for groundfish is  outside the scope of, and not affected by, the regulations governing  limited entry and open access fisheries. Certain amounts of groundfish  will be set aside for the recreational fishery during the biennial  specifications process. These amounts will be estimated prior to  dividing the commercial harvest guideline between the limited entry and  open access fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> of this section are specified in Chapter 6 of the PCGFMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tribal/nontribal allocation. The sablefish allocation to Pacific  coast treaty Indian tribes is identified at Sec. 660.50(f)(2), subpart  C. The remainder is available to the nontribal fishery (limited entry,  open access (directed and incidental), and research).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Between the limited entry and open access fisheries. The  allocation of sablefish after tribal deductions is further reduced by  the estimated total mortality of sablefish in research and incidental  catch in non-groundfish fisheries (incidental open access); the  remaining yield (nontribal share) is divided between open access and  limited entry fisheries. The limited entry fishery allocation is 90.6  percent and the open access allocation is 9.4 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Between the limited entry trawl and limited entry fixed gear  fisheries. The limited entry sablefish allocation is further allocated  58 percent to the trawl fishery and 42 percent to the limited entry  fixed gear (longline and pot/trap) fishery.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Between the limited entry fixed gear primary season and daily  trip limit fisheries. Within the limited entry fixed   gear fishery allocation, 85 percent is reserved for the primary season  described in Sec. 660.231, subpart E, leaving 15 percent for the  limited entry daily trip limit fishery described in Sec. 660.232,  subpart E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Ratios between tiers for sablefish-endorsed limited entry  permits. The Regional Administrator will biennially or annually  calculate the size of the cumulative trip limit for each of the three  tiers associated with the sablefish endorsement such that the ratio of  limits between the tiers is approximately 1:1.75:3.85 for Tier 3:Tier  2:Tier 1, respectively. The size of the cumulative trip limits will vary  depending on the amount of sablefish available for the primary fishery  and on estimated discard mortality rates within the fishery. The size of  the cumulative trip limits for the three tiers in the primary fishery  will be announced in Sec. 660.231(b)(3), subpart E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pacific whiting allocation. The allocation structure and  percentages for Pacific whiting are described in the PCGFMP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Annual treaty tribal Pacific whiting allocations are provided in  Sec. 660.50, subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The fishery harvest guideline for Pacific whiting is allocated  among three sectors, as follows: 34 percent for the C/P Coop Program; 24  percent for the MS Coop Program; and 42 percent for the Shore based IFQ  Program. No more than 5 percent of the Shore based IFQ Program  allocation may be taken and retained south of 42[deg] N. lat. before the  start of the primary Pacific whiting season north of 42[deg] N. lat.  Specific sector allocations for a given calendar year are found in  Tables 1a through c and 2a through c of this subpart. Set-asides for  other species for the at-sea whiting fishery for a given calendar year  are found in Tables 1D and 2D of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Fishery set-asides. Annual set-asides are not formal allocations  but they are amounts which are not available to the other fisheries  during the fishing year. For Pacific Coast treaty Indian fisheries, set- asides will be deducted from the TAC, OY, ACL, or ACT when specified.  For the catcher/processor and mothership sectors of the at-sea Pacific  whiting fishery, set-asides will be deducted from the limited entry  trawl fishery allocation. Set-aside amounts will be specified in Tables  1a through 2d of this subpart and may be adjusted through the biennial  harvest specifications and management measures process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(k)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(l)</em> Black rockfish harvest guideline. The commercial tribal harvest  guideline for black rockfish off Washington State is specified at Sec.  660.50(f)(1), subpart C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(m)</em> Pacific halibut bycatch allocation. The Pacific halibut fishery  off Washington, Oregon and California (Area 2A in the halibut  regulations) is managed under regulations at 50 CFR part 300, subpart E.  The PCGFMP sets the trawl bycatch mortality limit at 15 percent of the  Area 2A total constant exploitation yield (TCEY) for legal size halibut  (net weight), not to exceed 130,000 pounds annually for legal size  halibut (net weight) for 2012 through 2014 and, beginning in 2015, not  to exceed 100,000 pounds annually for legal size halibut (net weight).  The TCEY used for these calculations will be the best estimate of the  TCEY available from the International Pacific Halibut Commission at the  time of the calculation. For the purpose of this paragraph, the term  ``legal sized'' halibut refers to halibut with a total length of 32  inches and above, or O32, and the term ``sublegal sized'' halibut refers  to halibut under 32 inches in total length, or U32. To determine the  trawl bycatch mortality limit, the pounds of halibut available to the  trawl fleet will be expanded from the legal sized halibut mortality (net  weight) to a round weight legal and sublegal sized amount. To convert  from net weight to round weight, multiply by the conversion factor used  by the International Pacific Halibut Commission at the time of  calculation for net weight to round weight. To convert from legal sized  halibut to legal and sublegal sized halibut, multiply by the conversion  factor from the NMFS trawl fishery bycatch report as reported to the  International Pacific Halibut Commission at the time of calculation for  legal sized to legal and sublegal sized   halibut. The bycatch allocation percent can be adjusted downward or  upward through the biennial specifications and management measures  process but the upper bound on the maximum pounds of allocation can only  be changed though an FMP amendment. Part of the overall total mortality  limit is a set-aside of 10 mt of Pacific halibut (legal and sublegal,  round weight), to accommodate bycatch in the at-sea Pacific whiting  fishery and in the shorebased trawl fishery south of 40[deg]10[min] N.  lat. (estimated to be approximately 5 mt each). This set-aside can be  adjusted through the biennial specifications and management measures  process.
