                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 3221(d) provides an exception from the excise tax imposed by section 3221(c). Under this exception, the excise tax imposed by section 3221(c) does not apply to an employer with respect to employees who are covered by a supplemental pension plan, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, that is established pursuant to an agreement reached through collective bargaining between the employer and employees, within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of supplemental pension plan--(1) In general. A plan is a supplemental pension plan covered by the section 3221(d) exception described in paragraph (a) of this section only if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A plan is a supplemental pension plan covered by the section 3221(d) exception described in paragraph (a) of this section only if it meets the requirements of paragraphs (b)(2) through (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pension benefit requirement. A plan is a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this section only if the plan is a pension plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(i) of this chapter. Thus, a plan is a supplemental pension plan only if the plan provides for the payment of definitely determinable benefits to employees over a period of years, usually for life, after retirement. A plan need not be funded through a qualified trust that meets the requirements of section 401(a) or an annuity contract that meets the requirements of section 403(a) in order to meet the requirements of this paragraph (b)(2). A plan that is a profit-sharing plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(ii) of this chapter or a stock bonus plan within the meaning of Sec. 1.401-1(b)(1)(iii) of this chapter is not a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Railroad Retirement Board determination with respect to the plan. A plan is a supplemental pension plan within the meaning of this paragraph (b) with respect to an employee only during any period for which the Railroad Retirement Board has made a determination under 20 CFR 216.42(d) that the plan is a private pension, the payments from which will result in a reduction in the employee's supplemental annuity payable under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b). A plan is not a supplemental pension plan for any time period before the Railroad Retirement Board has made such a determination, or after that determination is no longer in force.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Other requirements. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Collective bargaining agreement. A plan is established pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement with respect to an employee only if, in accordance with the rules of Sec. 1.410(b)-6(d)(2) of this chapter, the employee is included in a unit of employees covered by an agreement that the Secretary of Labor finds to be a collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers, provided that there is evidence that retirement benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between employee representatives and the employer or employers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Substitute section 3221(d) excise tax. Section 3221(d) imposes an excise tax on any employer who has been excepted from the excise tax imposed under section 3221(c) by the application of section 3221(d) and paragraph (a) of this section with respect to an employee. The excise tax is equal to the amount of the supplemental annuity paid to that employee under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b), plus a percentage thereof determined by the Railroad Retirement Board to be sufficient to cover the administrative costs attributable to such payments under 45 U.S.C. 231a(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Effective date--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this section applies beginning on October 1, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, this section applies beginning on October 1, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Delayed effective date for collective bargaining agreement provisions.

Sec. 31.3231(b)-1  Who are employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. (1) An individual who is in the service of one or more employers for compensation is an employee within the meaning of the act. (For definitions of the terms ``employer'', ``service'', and ``compensation'', see subsections (a), (d), and (e), respectively, of section 3231.) An individual is in the service of an employer, with respect to

services rendered for compensation, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An individual who is in the service of one or more employers for compensation is an employee within the meaning of the act. (For definitions of the terms ``employer'', ``service'', and ``compensation'', see subsections (a), (d), and (e), respectively, of section 3231.) An individual is in the service of an employer, with respect to

services rendered for compensation, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> He is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner in which he renders such services; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> He is rendering professional or technical services and is integrated into the staff of the employer; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> He is rendering, on the property used in the employer's operations, other personal services the rendition of which is integrated into the employer's operations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In order that an individual may be in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section, it is not necessary that the employer actually direct or control the manner in which the services are rendered; it is sufficient if the employer has the right to do so. The right of an employer to discharge an individual is also an important factor indicating that the individual is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of the services. Other factors indicating that an individual is subject to the continuing authority of the employer to supervise and direct the manner of rendition of the services are the furnishing of tools and the furnishing of a place to work by the employer to the individual who renders the services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In general, if an individual is subject to the control or direction of an employer merely as to the result to be accomplished by the work and not as to the means and methods for accomplishing the result, he is an independent contractor. On individual performing services as an independent contractor is not, as to such services, in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this section. However, an individual performing services as an independent contractor may be, as to such services, in the service of an employer within the meaning of paragraph (a)(1) (ii) or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Whether or not an individual is an employee will be determined upon an examination of the particular facts of the case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If an individual is an employee, it is of no consequence that he is designated as a partner, coadventurer, agent, independent contractor, or otherwise, or that he performs services on a part-time basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> No distinction is made between classes or grades of employees. Thus, superintendents, managers, and other supervisory personnel are employees within the meaning of the act. An officer of an employer is an employee, but a director as such is not.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In determining whether an individual is an employee with respect to services rendered within the United States, the citizenship or residence of the individual, or the place where the contract of service was entered into is immaterial.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If an individual performs services for an employer (other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer) which does not conduct the principal part of its business within the United States, such individual shall be deemed to be in the service of such employer only to the extent that he performs services for it in the United States. Thus, with respect to services rendered for such employer outside the United States, such individual is not in the service of an employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If an individual performs services for an employer (other than a local lodge or division or a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer) which conducts the principal part of its business within the United States, he is in the service of such employer whether his services are rendered within or without the United States. In the case of an individual, not a citizen or resident of the United States, rendering services in a place outside the United States to an employer which is required under the laws applicable in such place to employ, in whole or in part, citizens or residents thereof, such individual shall not be deemed to be in the service of an employer with respect to services so rendered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> The term ``employee'' does not include any individual while he is engaged in the physical operations consisting of the mining of coal, the preparation of coal, the handling (other than movement by rail with standard railroad locomotives) of coal not beyond

the mine tipple, or the loading of coal at the tipple.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Employees of local lodges or divisions of railway-labor-organization employers.

However, an individual shall not be deemed to have been in the employment relation to a carrier on August 29, 1935, if before that date he was granted a pension or gratuity on the basis of which a pension was awarded to him pursuant to section 6 of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (45 U.S.C. 228f), or if during the last payroll period before August 29, 1935, in which he rendered service to a carrier he was not, with respect to any service in such payroll period, in the service of an employer (see paragraph (a) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Employees of general committees of railway-labor-organization employers. An individual is in the service of a general committee of a railway-labor-organization employer (see paragraph (a)(6) of Sec. 31.3231(a)-1) only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> He is representing a local lodge or division described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All, or substantially all, the individuals represented by such general committee are employees of an employer conducting the principal part of its business in the United States; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> He acts in the capacity of a general chairman or an assistant general chairman of a general committee which represents individuals rendering service in the United States to an employer. In such case, if his office or headquarters is not located in the United States and the individuals represented by such general committee are employees of an employer not conducting the principal part of its business in the United States, only a part of his remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation. The part of his remuneration regarded as compensation shall be in the same proportion to his total remuneration as the mileage in the United States under

the jurisdiction of such general committee bears to the total mileage under its jurisdiction, unless such mileage formula is inapplicable, in which case such other formula as the Railroad Retirement Board may have prescribed pursuant to section 1(c) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 (45 U.S.C. 228a) shall be applicable. However, no part of his remuneration for such service shall be regarded as compensation if the application of such mileage formula, or such other formula as the Railroad Retirement Board may have prescribed, would result in his compensation for the service being less than 10 percent of his remuneration for such service.


Sec. 31.3231(c)-1  Who are employee representatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An employee representative within the meaning of the act is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any officer or official representative of a railway labor organization which is not included as an employer under section 3231(a) who--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Was in the service of an employer either before or after June 29, 1937, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Is duly authorized and designated to represent employees in accordance with the Railway Labor Act.
