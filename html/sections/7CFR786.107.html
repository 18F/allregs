States not regulated under a Marketing Order  will be assigned a payment rate based on contiguous or nearby State's  Mailbox milk price.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Note: Calculations are rounded to 7 decimal places. * Payment rates for 2007 are currently unavailable, but will be based on the annual average Mailbox milk price</p><p class="depth2">for the Marketing Order, applicable to the State where the eligible disaster county is located, as reported by</p><p class="depth2">the Agricultural Marketing Service, consistent with payment rates provided for 2005 and 2006.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subject to the availability of funds, each eligible dairy  operation's payment is calculated by multiplying the applicable payment  rate under paragraph (a) of this section by the operation's total  eligible losses as adjusted pursuant to this part. Where there are  multiple producers in the dairy operation, individual producers'  payments are disbursed according to each producer's share of the dairy  operation's production as specified in the application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the total value of losses claimed nationwide under paragraph  (b) of this section exceeds the $16 million available for the DDAP-III,  less any reserve that may be created under paragraph (e) of this  section, total eligible losses of individual dairy operations that, as  calculated as an overall percentage for   each full disaster claim period applicable to the disaster declaration,  are greater than 20 percent of the total base annual production will be  paid at the maximum rate under paragraph (a) of this section to the  extent available funding allows. A loss of over 20 percent in only one  or two months during the applicable disaster claim period does not of  itself qualify for the maximum per-pound payment. Rather, the priority  level must be reached as an average over the whole disaster claim period  for the relevant calendar year. Total eligible losses for a producer, as  calculated under Sec. 786.106, of less than or equal to 20 percent  during the eligible claim period will then be paid at a rate, not to  exceed the rate allowed in paragraph (a) of this section, determined by  dividing the eligible losses of less than 20 percent by the funds  remaining after making payments for all eligible losses above the 20- percent threshold.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In no event will the payment exceed the value determined by  multiplying the producer's total eligible loss times the average price  received for commercial milk production in the producer's area as  defined in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> No participant will receive disaster benefits under this part  that in combination with the value of production not lost would result  in an amount that exceeds 95 percent of the value of the expected  production for the relevant period as estimated by the Secretary. Unless  otherwise program funds would not be fully expended, the sum of the  value of the production not lost, if any; and the disaster payment  received under this part, cannot exceed 95 percent of what the  production's value would have been if there had been no loss. In no  case, however, may the value of production and the payment exceed the  value the milk would have without the loss.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A reserve may be created to handle pending or disputed claims,  but claims will not be payable once the available funding is expended.</p>
