                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. (1) The provisions of this section prescribe the rules relating to the treatment of excess contributions made under a qualified pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan on behalf of a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.401-10). Paragraph (b) of this section defines the term ``excess contribution''. Paragraph (c) of this section describes an exception to the definition of an excess contribution in the case of contributions which are applied to pay premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the effect of making an excess contribution which is not determined to have been willfully made, and paragraph (e) of this section describes the effect of making an excess contribution which is determined to have been willfully made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The provisions of this section prescribe the rules relating to the treatment of excess contributions made under a qualified pension, annuity, or profit-sharing plan on behalf of a self-employed individual who is an owner-employee (as defined in paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.401-10). Paragraph (b) of this section defines the term ``excess contribution''. Paragraph (c) of this section describes an exception to the definition of an excess contribution in the case of contributions which are applied to pay premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. Paragraph (d) of this section describes the effect of making an excess contribution which is not determined to have been willfully made, and paragraph (e) of this section describes the effect of making an excess contribution which is determined to have been willfully made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Under section 401(c)(1), certain self-employed individuals are treated as employees for purposes of section 401. In addition, under section 401(c)(4), a proprietor is treated as his own employer, and the partnership is treated as the employer of the partners. Under section 404, certain contributions on behalf of a self-employed individual are treated as deductible and taken into consideration in determining the amount allowed as a deduction under section 404(a). Such contributions are treated under section 401 and the regulations thereunder as employer contributions on behalf of the self-employed individual. However, in some cases, additional contributions may be made on behalf of a self-employed individual. Such contributions are not taken into consideration in determining the amount deductible under section 404 and are not taken into consideration in computing the amount allowed as a deduction under section 404(a). For purposes of section 401 and the regulations thereunder, such contributions are treated as employee contributions by the self-employed individual. If a self-employed individual is an owner-employee within the meaning of section 401(c)(3) and paragraph (d) of Sec. 1.401-10, then this section prescribes the rules applicable if contributions are made in excess of those permitted to be made under section 401.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Excess contributions defined. (1)(i) Except as provided in paragraph (c) relating to contributions which are applied to pay premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, an excess contribution is any amount described in subparagraphs (2) through (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) relating to contributions which are applied to pay premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, an excess contribution is any amount described in subparagraphs (2) through (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (c) relating to contributions which are applied to pay premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, an excess contribution is any amount described in subparagraphs (2) through (4) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of determining if the amount of any contribution made under the plan on behalf of an owner-employee is an excess contribution, the amount of any contribution made under the plan which is allocable to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance is not taken into account. The amount of any contribution which is allocable to the cost of insurance protection is determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (f) of Sec. 1.404 (e)-1 and paragraph (b) of Sec. 1.72-16.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> In the case of a taxable year of the plan for which employer contributions are made on behalf of only owner-employees, an excess contribution is the amount of any contribution for such taxable year on behalf of such owner-employee which is not deductible under section 404 (determined without regard to section 404(a)(10)). This rule applies irrespective of whether the plan provides for contributions on behalf of common-law employees, or self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, when such employees or individuals become eligible for coverage under the plan, and irrespective of whether contributions are in fact made for such employees or such individuals for other taxable years of the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a taxable year of the plan for which employer contributions are made on behalf of only owner-employees, an excess contribution is the amount of any contribution for such taxable year on behalf of such owner-employee which is not deductible under section 404 (determined without regard to section 404(a)(10)). This rule applies irrespective of whether the plan provides for contributions on behalf of common-law employees, or self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, when such employees or individuals become eligible for coverage under the plan, and irrespective of whether contributions are in fact made for such employees or such individuals for other taxable years of the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In the case of a taxable year of the plan for which employer contributions are made on behalf of both owner-employees and either common-law employees or self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, an excess contribution is the amount of any employer contribution on behalf of any owner-employee for such taxable year which exceeds the amount deductible under section 404 (determined without regard to section 404(a)(10)) unless such amount may be treated as an employee contribution under the plan in accordance with the rules of paragraph (d)(3) of Sec. 1.401-11 and is a permissible employee contribution under subparagraph (3) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> In the case of a taxable year of the plan for which employer contributions are made on behalf of both an owner-employee and either common-law employees or self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, employee contributions on behalf of an owner-employee may be made for such taxable year of the plan. How-ever, the amount of such contributions, if any, which is described in subdivisions (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subparagraph is an excess contribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In the case of a taxable year of the plan for which employer contributions are made on behalf of both an owner-employee and either common-law employees or self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, employee contributions on behalf of an owner-employee may be made for such taxable year of the plan. How-ever, the amount of such contributions, if any, which is described in subdivisions (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this subparagraph is an excess contribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An excess contribution is the amount of any employee contribution made on behalf of any owner-employee during a taxable year of the plan at a rate in excess of the rate of contributions which may be made as employee contributions by common-law employees, or by self-employed individuals who are not owner-employees, during such taxable year of the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> An excess contribution is the amount of any employee contribution made on behalf of an owner-employee which exceeds the lesser of $2,500 or 10 percent of the earned income (as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.401-10) of such owner-employee for his taxable year in which such contributions are made.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> In the case of a taxable year of an owner-employee in which contributions are made on behalf of such owner-employee under more than one plan, an excess contribution is the amount of any employee contribution made on behalf of such owner-employee under all such plans during such taxable year which exceeds $2,500. If such an excess contribution is made, the amount of the excess contribution made on behalf of the owner-employee with respect to any one of such plans is the amount by which the employee contribution on his behalf under such plan for the year exceeds an amount which bears the same ratio to $2,500 as the earned income of the owner-employee derived from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established bears to his earned income derived from the trades or businesses with respect to which all such plans are established.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An excess contribution is the amount of any contribution on behalf of an owner-employee for any taxable year of the plan with respect to which the plan is treated, under section 401(e)(2), as not meeting the requirements of section 401(d) with respect to such owner-employee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contributions for premiums on certain annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts. (1) The term ``excess contribution'' does not include the amount of any employer contributions on behalf of an owner-employee which, under the provisions of the plan, is expressly required to be applied (either directly or through a trustee) to pay the premiums or other consideration for one or more annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, if--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term ``excess contribution'' does not include the amount of any employer contributions on behalf of an owner-employee which, under the provisions of the plan, is expressly required to be applied (either directly or through a trustee) to pay the premiums or other consideration for one or more annuity, endowment, or life insurance contracts, if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer contributions so applied meet the requirements of subparagraphs (2) through (4) of this paragraph, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total employer contributions required to be applied annually to pay premiums on behalf of any owner-employee for contracts described in this paragraph do not exceed $2,500. For purposes of computing such $2,500 limit, the total employer contributions includes amounts which are allocable to the purchase of life, accident, health, or other insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> The employer contributions must be paid under a plan which satisfies all the requirements for qualification. Accordingly, for example, contributions can be paid under the plan for life insurance protection only to the extent otherwise permitted under sections 401 through 404 and the regulations thereunder. However, certain of the requirements for qualification are

modified with respect to a plan described in this paragraph (see section 401(a)(10)(A)(ii) and (d)(5)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The employer contributions must be paid under a plan which satisfies all the requirements for qualification. Accordingly, for example, contributions can be paid under the plan for life insurance protection only to the extent otherwise permitted under sections 401 through 404 and the regulations thereunder. However, certain of the requirements for qualification are

modified with respect to a plan described in this paragraph (see section 401(a)(10)(A)(ii) and (d)(5)).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A plan described in this paragraph is not disqualified merely because a contribution is made on behalf of an owner-employee by his employer during a taxable year of the employer for which the owner-employee has no earned income. On the other hand, a plan will fail to qualify if a contribution is made on behalf of an owner-employee which results in the discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) as modified by section 401(a)(10)(A)(ii) (see paragraph (f)(3) of Sec. 1.401-12).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The employer contributions must be applied to pay premiums or other consideration for a contract issued on the life of the owner-employee. For purposes of this subparagraph, a contract is not issued on the life of an owner-employee unless all the proceeds which are, or may become, payable under the contract are payable directly, or through a trustee of a trust described in section 401(a) and exempt from tax under section 501(a), to the owner-employee or to the beneficiary named in the contract or under the plan. Accordingly, for example, a nontransferable face-amount certificate (as defined in section 401(g) and the regulations thereunder) is considered an annuity on the life of the owner-employee if the proceeds of such contract are payable only to the owner-employee or his beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)(i)</em> For any taxable year of the employer, the amount of contributions by the employer on behalf of the owner-employee which is applied to pay premiums under the contracts described in this paragraph must not exceed the average of the amounts deductible under section 404 (determined without regard to section 404(a)(10)) by such employer on behalf of such owner-employee for the most recent three taxable years of the employer (ending prior to the date the latest contract was entered into or modified to provide additional benefits), in which the owner-employee derived earned income from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established. However, if such owner-employee has not derived earned income for at least three taxable years preceding such date, then, in determining the ``average of the amounts deductible'', only so many of such taxable years as such owner-employee was engaged in such trade or business and derived earned income therefrom are taken into account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For any taxable year of the employer, the amount of contributions by the employer on behalf of the owner-employee which is applied to pay premiums under the contracts described in this paragraph must not exceed the average of the amounts deductible under section 404 (determined without regard to section 404(a)(10)) by such employer on behalf of such owner-employee for the most recent three taxable years of the employer (ending prior to the date the latest contract was entered into or modified to provide additional benefits), in which the owner-employee derived earned income from the trade or business with respect to which the plan is established. However, if such owner-employee has not derived earned income for at least three taxable years preceding such date, then, in determining the ``average of the amounts deductible'', only so many of such taxable years as such owner-employee was engaged in such trade or business and derived earned income therefrom are taken into account.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the purpose of making the computation described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, the taxable years taken into account include those years in which the individual derived earned income from the trade or business but was not an owner-employee with respect to such trade or business. Furthermore, taxable years of the employer preceding the taxable year in which a qualified plan is established are taken into account. If such taxable years began prior to January 1, 1963, the amount deductible is determined as if section 404 included section 404(a) (8), (9), (10), and (e).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The amount of any employer contribution which is not deductible but which is not treated as an excess contribution because of the provisions of this paragraph shall be taken into account as an employee contribution made on behalf of the owner-employee during the owner-employee's taxable year with, or within which, the taxable year of the person treated as his employer under section 401(c)(4) ends. However, such contribution is only treated as an employee contribution made on behalf of the owner-employee for the purpose of determining whether any other employee contribution made on behalf of the owner-employee during such period is an excess contribution described in paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Effect of an excess contribution which is not willfully made. (1) If an excess contribution (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) is made on behalf of an owner-employee, and if such contribution is not willfully made, then the provisions of this paragraph describe the effect of such an excess contribution. However, if the excess contribution made on behalf of an owner-employee is determined to have been willfully made, then the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to such contribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If an excess contribution (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) is made on behalf of an owner-employee, and if such contribution is not willfully made, then the provisions of this paragraph describe the effect of such an excess contribution. However, if the excess contribution made on behalf of an owner-employee is determined to have been willfully made, then the provisions of paragraph (e) of this section are applicable to such contribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(i)</em> This paragraph does not apply to an excess contribution if the net amount of such excess contribution (as

defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and the net income attributable to such amount are repaid to the owner-employee on whose behalf the excess contribution was made at any time before the end of six months beginning on the day on which the district director sends notice (by certified or registered mail) of the amount of the excess contribution to the trust, insurance company, or other person to whom such excess contribution was paid. The net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution is the aggregate of the amounts of net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution for each year of the plan beginning with the taxable year of the plan within which the excess contribution is made and ending with the close of the taxable year of the plan immediately preceding the taxable year of the plan in which the net amount of the excess contribution is repaid. The amount of net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution for each year is the amount of net income earned under the plan during the year which is allocated in a reasonable manner to the net amount of the excess contribution. For example, the amount of net income earned under the plan for the year which is attributable to the net amount of an excess contribution can be computed as the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the ``net income attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan'' for such taxable year (determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (5)(ii) of this paragraph) as the net amount of the excess contribution bears to the aggregate amount standing to the account of the owner-employee at the end of that year (including the net amount of any excess contribution).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> This paragraph does not apply to an excess contribution if the net amount of such excess contribution (as

defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and the net income attributable to such amount are repaid to the owner-employee on whose behalf the excess contribution was made at any time before the end of six months beginning on the day on which the district director sends notice (by certified or registered mail) of the amount of the excess contribution to the trust, insurance company, or other person to whom such excess contribution was paid. The net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution is the aggregate of the amounts of net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution for each year of the plan beginning with the taxable year of the plan within which the excess contribution is made and ending with the close of the taxable year of the plan immediately preceding the taxable year of the plan in which the net amount of the excess contribution is repaid. The amount of net income attributable to the net amount of the excess contribution for each year is the amount of net income earned under the plan during the year which is allocated in a reasonable manner to the net amount of the excess contribution. For example, the amount of net income earned under the plan for the year which is attributable to the net amount of an excess contribution can be computed as the amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of the ``net income attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan'' for such taxable year (determined in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (5)(ii) of this paragraph) as the net amount of the excess contribution bears to the aggregate amount standing to the account of the owner-employee at the end of that year (including the net amount of any excess contribution).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The notice described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph shall not be mailed prior to the time that the amount of the tax under chapter 1 of the Code of the owner-employee to whom the excess contribution is to be repaid has been finally determined for his taxable year in which such excess contribution was made. For purposes of this subdivision, a final determination of the amount of tax liability of the owner-employee includes--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em>1 A decision by the Tax Court of the United States, or a judgment, decree, or other order by any court of competent jurisdiction, which has become final;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> A closing agreement authorized by section 7121; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The expiration of the period of limitation on suits by the taxpayer for refund, unless suit is instituted prior to the expiration of such period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph, an amount is treated as repaid to an owner-employee if an adequate adjustment is made to the account of the owner-employee. An adequate adjustment is made to the account of an owner-employee, for example, if the amount of the excess contribution (without any reduction for any loading or other administrative charge) and the net income attributable to such amount is taken into account as a contribution under the plan for the current year. In such a case, the gross income of the owner-employee for his taxable year in which such adjustment is made includes the amount of the net income attributable to the excess contribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the net amount of the excess contribution and the net income attributable thereto is repaid, within the period described in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph, to the owner-employee on whose behalf such contribution was made, then the net income attributable to the excess contribution is, pursuant to section 61(a), includible in the gross income of the owner-employee for his taxable year in which such amount is distributed, or made available, to him. However, such amount is not a distribution to which section 402 or 403 and section 72 apply (see subparagraph (6) of this paragraph).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> If the net amount of any excess contribution (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and the net income attributable to that excess contribution are not repaid to the owner-employee on whose behalf the excess contribution was made before the end of the six-month period described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph,

the plan under which the excess contribution has been made is considered, for purposes of section 404, as not satisfying the requirements for qualification with respect to such owner-employee for all taxable years of the plan described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. However, such disqualification only applies to the interest of the owner-employee on whose behalf an excess contribution has been made and does not disqualify the plan with respect to the other participants thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the net amount of any excess contribution (as defined in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph) and the net income attributable to that excess contribution are not repaid to the owner-employee on whose behalf the excess contribution was made before the end of the six-month period described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph,

the plan under which the excess contribution has been made is considered, for purposes of section 404, as not satisfying the requirements for qualification with respect to such owner-employee for all taxable years of the plan described in subdivision (ii) of this subparagraph. However, such disqualification only applies to the interest of the owner-employee on whose behalf an excess contribution has been made and does not disqualify the plan with respect to the other participants thereunder.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The taxable years referred to in subdivision (i) of this subparagraph include the taxable year of the plan within which the excess contribution is made and each succeeding taxable year of the plan until the beginning of the taxable year of the plan in which the trust, insurance company, or other person to whom such excess contribution was paid repays to such owner-employee--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The net amount of the excess contribution, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The amount of income attributable to his interest under the plan which is includible in his gross income for any taxable year by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph, the net amount of an excess contribution is the amount of such excess contribution, as defined in paragraph (b) of this section, reduced by the amount of any loading charge or other administrative charge ratably allocable to such excess contribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)(i)</em> If a plan is considered as not meeting the requirements for qualification with respect to an owner-employee by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for any taxable year of the plan, such owner-employee's gross income for any of his taxable years with or within which such taxable year of the plan ends shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, include the portion of the net income earned under the plan for such taxable year of the plan which is attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a plan is considered as not meeting the requirements for qualification with respect to an owner-employee by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph for any taxable year of the plan, such owner-employee's gross income for any of his taxable years with or within which such taxable year of the plan ends shall, for purposes of chapter 1 of the Code, include the portion of the net income earned under the plan for such taxable year of the plan which is attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this subparagraph, the term ``net income'' means the net income earned under the plan determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied, and the ``net income attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan'' is the amount which bears the same ratio to the aggregate amount of net income earned under the plan for the taxable year of the plan as the amount standing to the account of the owner-employee at the end of that year (including the amount of any excess contribution which is credited to his account) bears to the aggregate amount of all funds under the plan for all employees at the end of that year (including the aggregate amount of excess contributions credited to the accounts of all owner-employees for that year).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The provisions of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. A is an owner-employee covered under the X Employees' Pension Trust who files his return on the basis of a calendar year. An excess contribution was made on behalf of A during the plan year beginning on January 1, 1966. The net amount of the excess contribution and the net income attributable thereto was not repaid to A before the end of the six-month period described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph. Accordingly, the net income earned under the plan during 1966 which is attributable to A's interest is to be included in his gross income for 1966. Assume that the trust which forms a part of the pension plan of the X Company also files its returns on a calendar year basis, and that during 1966 the trust had a gross income of $4,000 (including a long-term capital gain of $2,500) and expenses of $500. Assume, further, that the amount standing to A's account on December 31, 1966 (including the amount of the excess contribution), was $20,000, and that on that date the amount funded under the plan for all employees (including A) is $140,000. Then the net income of the trust for 1966 is $3,500 ($4,000-$500). The net income attributable to the interest of A under the plan is $500 (the amount which bears the same ratio to $3,500 as $20,000 bears to $140,000). Accordingly, $500 is included in A's gross income in accordance with the provisions of section 401(e)(2)(B) as the ``net income attributable to the interest of the owner-employee under the plan''.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The provisions of section 402 or 403 and section 72 do not apply to any amount distributed, or made available, to an owner-employee which is described in this paragraph. Accordingly, for example, the provisions of section

72(m)(5)(A)(i), relating to amounts subject to the penalty tax imposed by section 72(m), do not apply to the amount of the net income attributable to the interest of an owner-employee (as defined in subparagraph (5)(ii) of this paragraph) which is includible in his gross income. Furthermore, in such a case, the provisions of section 401(d)(5)(C) do not apply to such amount.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Certain adjustments will be required with respect to the interest of an owner-employee after any amount previously allocated to his account has been returned to him pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph. For example, if the determination of whether life insurance benefits provided under the plan are incidental is made, in part, with regard to the contributions allocated to the accounts of the participants covered under the plan, an adjustment may have to be made with respect to the life insurance purchased under the plan for any owner-employee after any amount previously allocated to his account has been repaid to him. Furthermore, if, for example, an owner-employee has received annuity payments which were taxable under the exclusion ratio rule of section 72, and if such exclusion ratio took into account any amount credited to the account of the owner-employee which is subsequently repaid to him, then such exclusion ratio must be recomputed after the adjustment in such owner-employee's account has taken place.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Notwithstanding any other provision of law, in any case in which the plan is treated as not satisfying the requirements for qualification with respect to any owner-employee by reason of the provisions of section 401(e), the period for assessing, with respect to such owner-employee, any deficiency arising by reason of--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The disallowance of any deduction under section 404 by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (3) of this paragraph, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The inclusion of amounts in the gross income of the owner-employee by reason of the provisions of subparagraph (5) of this paragraph,
shall not expire prior to 18 months after the day the district director mails the notice with respect to the excess contribution (described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph) which gives rise to such disallowance or inclusion. Thus, for example, notwithstanding the provisions of section 6212(c) (relating to the restriction on the determination of additional deficiencies), if, after a final determination by the Tax Court of the income tax liability of an owner-employee for a taxable year in which an excess contribution was made, the amount of such excess contribution and the net income attributable thereto is not paid to the owner-employee before the end of the six-month period described in subparagraph (2)(i) of this paragraph, an additional deficiency assessment may be made for such taxable year with respect to such excess contribution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Effect of an excess contribution which is determined to have been willfully made. If an excess contribution (as defined in paragraph (b) of this section) on behalf of an owner-employee is determined to have been willful ly made, then--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only the provisions of this paragraph apply to such contribution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There shall be distributed to the owner-employee on whose behalf such contribution was willfully made his entire interest in all plans in which he is a participant as an owner-employee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount distributed under each such plan is an amount to which section 72 does apply (see section 72(m)(5)(A)(iii)); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of section 404, no plan in which such individual is covered as an owner-employee shall be considered as meeting the requirements for qualification with respect to such owner-employee for any taxable year of the plan beginning with or within the calendar year in which it is determined that the excess contribution has been willfully made and with or within the five calendar years following such year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Years to which this section applies. This section applies to contributions made in taxable years of employers beginning before January 1, 1976. Thus, for example, in the case of willful contributions made in taxable years of employers beginning before January 1, 1976, paragraphs (e) (1), (2), and (3) of this section apply to such taxable

years beginning on or after such date. However, in such a case, because the application of paragraph (e)(4) of this section affects contributions made in taxable years of employers beginning on or after January 1, 1976, paragraph (e)(4) of this section does not apply to such taxable years; see paragraph (c) of Sec. 1.401(e)-4 (relating to transitional rules for excess contributions).
