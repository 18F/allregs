                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If a maturing installment on an RUS note or a note which has  been guaranteed by RUS is not received by its due date, funds will be  withdrawn from the borrower's cushion of credit account and applied as  of the installment due date beginning with the oldest of such notes as  follows: first, to current interest then due on all notes; second, to  the accumulated interest due, if any, on all notes; and third, to the  principal then due on all notes. In those instances where a borrower has  prior to October 2, 1987, maintained an advance payment account with  RUS, its cushion of credit account will be applied in accordance with  the provisions of this section prior to using any balance remaining in  its advance payment account to pay interest and principal installments  on notes. Computations required under this section have been made by RUS  as of October 2, 1987; however, on or before May 25, 1989 any borrower  may make a one time irrevocable election to have all such computations  made as of April 5, 1989, by filing written notice to that effect with  Robert D. Ruddy, Director, Fiscal Accounting Division, Rural Utilities  Service, Washington, DC 20250-1500.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A borrower may reduce the balance of its cushion of credit  account only if the amount obtained from the reduction is used to make  scheduled payments on loans made or guaranteed under the Act.
