                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure. If it becomes apparent at any time that a case is not  appropriate for Simplified Proceedings, the Judge assigned to the case  may, upon motion by any party or upon the Judge's own motion,  discontinue Simplified Proceedings and order the case to continue under  conventional rules. Before discontinuing Simplified Proceedings, the  Judge will consult with the Chief Administrative Law Judge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Party motion. At any time during the proceedings any party may  request that Simplified Proceedings be discontinued and that the matter  continue under conventional procedures. A motion to discontinue must be  in writing and explain why the case is inappropriate for Simplified  Proceedings. All other parties will have 7 days from the filing of the  motion to state their agreement or disagreement and their reasons. Joint  motions to return a case to conventional proceedings shall be granted by  the Judge and do not require a showing of good cause.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ruling. If Simplified Proceedings are discontinued, the Judge  may issue such orders as are necessary for an orderly continuation under  conventional rules.
