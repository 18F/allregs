                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The boundaries of a metropolitan planning area (MPA) shall be  determined by agreement between the MPO and the Governor. At a minimum,  the MPA boundaries shall encompass the entire existing urbanized area  (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) plus the contiguous area  expected to become urbanized within a 20-year forecast period for the  metropolitan transportation plan. The MPA boundaries may be further  expanded to encompass the entire metropolitan statistical area or  combined statistical area, as defined by the Office of Management and  Budget.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> An MPA boundary may encompass more than one urbanized area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> MPA boundaries may be established to coincide with the geography  of regional economic development and growth forecasting areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Identification of new urbanized areas within an existing  metropolitan planning area by the Bureau of the Census shall not require  redesignation of the existing MPO.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where the boundaries of the urbanized area or MPA extend across  two or more States, the Governors with responsibility for a portion of  the multistate area, MPO(s), and the public   transportation operator(s) are strongly encouraged to coordinate  transportation planning for the entire multistate area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The MPA boundaries shall not overlap with each other.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Where part of an urbanized area served by one MPO extends into  an adjacent MPA, the MPOs shall, at a minimum, establish written  agreements that clearly identify areas of coordination and the division  of transportation planning responsibilities among and between the MPOs.  Alternatively, the MPOs may adjust their existing boundaries so that the  entire urbanized area lies within only one MPA. Boundary adjustments  that change the composition of the MPO may require redesignation of one  or more such MPOs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> The MPA boundaries shall be reviewed after each Census by the  MPO (in cooperation with the State and public transportation  operator(s)) to determine if existing MPA boundaries meet the minimum  statutory requirements for new and updated urbanized area(s), and shall  be adjusted as necessary. As appropriate, additional adjustments should  be made to reflect the most comprehensive boundary to foster an  effective planning process that ensures connectivity between modes,  reduces access disadvantages experienced by modal systems, and promotes  efficient overall transportation investment strategies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Following MPA boundary approval by the MPO and the Governor, the  MPA boundary descriptions shall be provided for informational purposes  to the FHWA and the FTA. The MPA boundary descriptions shall be  submitted either as a geo-spatial database or described in sufficient  detail to enable the boundaries to be accurately delineated on a map.</p>
