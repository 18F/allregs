                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose.

This includes informing soldiers of Army policy and of their  responsibility to provide adequate support for all family members and to  comply with all court orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> First level field grade commanders will monitor all instances of  soldiers' repeated failure to meet the requirements of this regulation  that are brought to their attention. They will take action, when proper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Immediate commanders will--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Ensure that soldiers are informed of the DA policy on support of  family members and that they comply with court orders. They will also  inform soldiers of the possible consequences of failing to fulfill  financial obligations. This information will be included during  inprocessing and outprocessing briefings, particularly during processing  for mobilization and oversea movement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Process nonsupport complaints, child custody complaints, and  paternity claims per this regulation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Counsel soldiers when complaints and claim are received. If  the soldier is suspected of criminal conduct, self-incrimination  protections (article 31, Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ) and  rights advisement) must be provided. (See Sec. 584.2(g)(4).)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Answer all correspondence received from CG, USACFSC and other  DA officials. In answering this correspondence, the commander will--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Furnish complete details regarding nonsupport complaints, child  custody complaints, and paternity claims.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Reveal whether or not the soldier authorized the release outside  the Department of Defense (DOD) of information obtained from a system of  records. His or her decision should be recorded on DA Form 5459-R  (Authorization to Release Information from Army Records on Nonsupport/ Child Custody/Paternity Complaints).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Answer all correspondence received directly from family members,  legal assistance attorneys, and others. Normally, replies will not  include information obtained from a system of records without the  soldier's written consent. (See Sec. 584.1(f).) Commanders may  coordinate responses with the Staff Judge Advocate (SJA). Also, the  commander will ask the SJA for guidance in unusual or difficult  situations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Inform the first level field grade commander of all instances  of the soldier's repeated failure to meet the requirements of this  regulation or to comply with court orders. Also, point out actions taken  or contemplated to correct instances of nonsupport of family members or  continuing violations of court orders.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Refer correspondence or queries received from news media  organizations to the unit, installation, or command public affairs  officer for response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> (A) through (E). Failure to comply  with the minimum support requirements (Sec. 584.2(d)) or the child  custody provisions (Sec. 584.2(e)) of this regulation may be charged as  violations of article 92, UCMJ. Article 132, UCMJ, prohibits the making  of false claims. Article 133, UCMJ, covers conduct unbecoming an  officer. Article 134, UCMJ, concerns   dishonorable failure to pay debts and conduct of a nature to bring  discredit upon the Armed Forces. Also, the criminal laws of some States  prohibit the abduction of children by a parent or the nonsupport of  family members in violation of existing court orders. These laws may  also apply against soldiers under article 134, UCMJ, and Assimilative  Crimes Act, section 13, title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 13).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Denial of reenlistment for enlisted members (AR 601-280).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Letter of reprimand for filing in a soldier's Military Personnel  Records Jacket or Official Military Personnel File (AR 600-37).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Administrative separation from the service (AR 635-100 or AR  635-200).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Nonjudicial punishment under article 15, UCMJ.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Court-martial.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Urge soldiers to provide additional financial support beyond  the required minimum whether the needs of the family so require.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> After coordination with the SJA and appropriate command  representatives, and under applicable State, Federal, and host country  laws, take remedial steps to assist in the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Elimination of continuing violations of court orders and this  regulation on child custody.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Return of such children to the parent or guardian entitled to  custody.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The unit, installation, or command public affairs officer will--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Answer correspondence and queries received from news media  organizations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Coordinate with the SJA before making any response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Policy. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soldiers of the Army are required to manage their  personal affairs statisfactorily. This responsibility includes--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Providing adequate and continuous support to or for family  members. (See Sec. 584.2.)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complying with all court orders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Army has an interest in the welfare of both soldiers and  their families. This is recognized by numerous laws and programs  authorizing the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Family housing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Living and travel allowances.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Medical care.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Child care and development.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Community support services.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Because of military duty, soldiers and their families often live  in States in which they have not established domicile. Frequently, they  reside in foreign nations. This often places soldiers beyond the  judicial process of State courts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Army recognizes the transient nature of military duty. This  regulation prohibits the use of a soldier's military status or  assignment to deny financial support to family members or to evade court  orders on child support or custody. Commanders have a responsibility to  ensure that soldiers provide for the welfare of their families. Before  recommending approval of requests for, or extensions of, oversea  assignments, commanders should consider whether the soldier's oversea  assignment will adversely affect the legal rights of family members in  pending court actions against the soldier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The policy in this regulation regarding the financial support of  family members is solely intended as an interim measure until the  parties--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arrive at a mutually satisfactory agreement, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Resolve their differences in court.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Soldiers are entitled to the same legal rights and privileges in  State courts as civilians. This includes determining the extent and  amount of their support obligations to family members. This regulation  is not intended to be used as a guide by courts in determining the  following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The existence of support obligations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The amount of past, present, or future support obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Release of information. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Soldiers will be provided the  opportunity of completing DA Form 5459-R before being questioned about  compliants or claims under this regulation. Information voluntarily  provided by soldiers may be used by commanders to answer inquiries.  Replies normally will not include information obtained from a system of  records without the soldier's written consent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and AR 340-21, para 3-3), information may be released,  if required, under the Freedom of Information Act. Under 5 U.S.C.  552(b)(6) and AR 340-17, chapter III, information from personnel and  other similar files may be released if it does not constitute a  ``clearly unwarranted invasion of privacy.'' The information released  must be in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The type of information that may be released from a system of  records without the soldier's consent will vary from case to case. In  each case, the public interest of having soldiers support their families  and obey court orders must be balanced against the sensitivity of the  privacy interests involved. Army policy favors permanent resolution of  support and custody matters in court. The denial of information that  hinders such resolution is not in the public interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Before releasing information from a system of records without  the soldier's consent, commanders may consult the SJA. Generally, the  types of information shown below may be released to the complaining  family member entitled to support or those authorized by the family  member to act in his or her behalf (for example, legal assistance  attorneys, Member of Congress, courts, Government welfare agencies).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Present unit of assignment, including port calls and future duty  assignments, permanent or temporary, if known.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Scheduled separation and retirement dates from the Service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Rank and authorized pay and allowances for that grade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Allotments authorized or being authorized for or in behalf of  the family member entitled to support.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The soldier's stated intentions, if any, regarding resolution of  the complaint.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The general whereabouts of the soldier's children, if known.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The SJA should be consulted for legal advice before the  residential address of a soldier or family member is released.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Any information released should be pertinent to the inquiry. The  soldier's relationship, if any, to the person making the inquiry, should  be considered. Consistent with the purpose of this regulation,  information that unduly invades the privacy of the soldier or his or her  family should not be released.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Penalties. Compliance with the minimum support requirements  Sec. 584.2(d)) and child custody provisions (Sec. 584.2(e)) of this  regulation will be enforced by administrative and criminal remedies as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Basic allowance for quarters. A summary of the rules regarding  entitlements to basic allowance for quarters (BAQ) is in Sec. 584.7.  The minimum support requirements of this regulation are stated in  amounts equal to a soldier's BAQ at the ``with dependents'' rate.  However, a soldier's entitlement or lack of entitlement to such  allowances has no relationship to the obligation under this regulation  to support family members. Except for Sec. 584.2(f)(2)(ii)(B), the  actual receipt or nonreceipt of BAQ also has no relationship to that  obligation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Entitlement of variable housing allowance. Soldiers entitled to  BAQ at the ``with'' or ``without dependents'' rate may be entitled to  variable housing allowance (VHA). Terms for receiving VHA are set forth  in the Joint Travel Regulations, M4550 through M4557. Soldiers may use  VHA to defray housing costs for family members.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Garnishment. A summary of the rules regarding garnishment of  Federal wages is in Sec. 584.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Involuntary allotments. A summary of the rules regarding  involuntary allotments from pay and allowances is in Sec. 584.9.</p>
