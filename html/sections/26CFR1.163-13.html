                                Sec. 1.163-13  Treatment of bond issuance premium.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>. In general, the  issuer determines its interest deduction by offsetting the interest  allocable to an accrual period with the bond issuance premium allocable  to that period. Bond issuance premium is allocable to an accrual period  based on a constant yield. The use of a constant yield to amortize bond  issuance premium is intended to generally conform the treatment of debt  instruments having bond issuance premium with those having original  issue discount. Unless otherwise provided, the terms used in this  section have the same meaning as those terms in section 163(e), sections  1271 through 1275, and the corresponding regulations. Moreover, unless  otherwise provided, the provisions of this section apply in a manner  consistent with those of section 163(e), sections 1271 through 1275, and  the corresponding regulations. In addition, the anti-abuse rule in Sec.  1.1275-2(g) applies for purposes of this section. For rules dealing with  the treatment of bond premium by a holder, see Sec. Sec. 1.171-1  through 1.171-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Exceptions. This section does not apply to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A debt instrument described in section 1272(a)(6)(C) (regular  interests in a REMIC, qualified mortgages held by a REMIC, and certain  other debt instruments, or pools of debt instruments, with payments  subject to acceleration); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A debt instrument to which Sec. 1.1275-4 applies (relating to  certain debt instruments that provide for contingent payments).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Bond issuance premium. Bond issuance premium is the excess, if  any, of the issue price of a debt instrument over its stated redemption  price at maturity. For purposes of this section, the issue price of a  convertible bond (as defined in Sec. 1.171-1(e)(1)(iii)(C)) does not  include an amount equal to the value of the conversion option (as  determined under Sec. 1.171-1(e)(1)(iii)(A)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Offsetting qualified stated interest with bond issuance  premium--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An issuer amortizes bond issuance premium by  offsetting the qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period  with the bond issuance premium allocable to the accrual period. This  offset occurs when the issuer takes the qualified stated interest into  account   under its regular method of accounting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Qualified stated interest allocable to an accrual period. See  Sec. 1.446-2(b) to determine the accrual period to which qualified  stated interest is allocable and to determine the accrual of qualified  stated interest within an accrual period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>. Within an accrual period, the bond issuance premium  allocable to the period accrues ratably.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Step three: Determine the bond issuance premium allocable to  the accrual period. The bond issuance premium allocable to an accrual  period is the excess of the qualified stated interest allocable to the  accrual period over the product of the adjusted issue price at the  beginning of the accrual period and the yield. In performing this  calculation, the yield must be stated appropriately taking into account  the length of the particular accrual period. Principles similar to those  in Sec. 1.1272-1(b)(4) apply in determining the bond issuance premium  allocable to an accrual period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Bond issuance premium in excess of qualified stated interest-- </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ordinary income. If the bond issuance premium allocable to an  accrual period exceeds the qualified stated interest allocable to the  accrual period, the excess is treated as ordinary income by the issuer  for the accrual period. However, the amount treated as ordinary income  is limited to the amount by which the issuer's total interest deductions  on the debt instrument in prior accrual periods exceed the total amount  treated by the issuer as ordinary income on the debt instrument in prior  accrual periods.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Carryforward. If the bond issuance premium allocable to an  accrual period exceeds the sum of the qualified stated interest  allocable to the accrual period and the amount treated as ordinary  income for the accrual period under paragraph (d)(4)(i) of this section,  the excess is carried forward to the next accrual period and is treated  as bond issuance premium allocable to that period. If a carryforward  exists on the date the debt instrument is retired, the carryforward is  treated as ordinary income on that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Variable rate debt instruments. An issuer  determines bond issuance premium on a variable rate debt instrument by  reference to the stated redemption price at maturity of the equivalent  fixed rate debt instrument constructed for the variable rate debt  instrument. The issuer also allocates any bond issuance premium among  the accrual periods by reference to the equivalent fixed rate debt  instrument. The issuer constructs the equivalent fixed rate debt  instrument, as of the issue date, by using the principles of Sec.  1.1275-5(e).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inflation-indexed debt instruments. An issuer determines bond  issuance premium on an inflation-indexed debt instrument by assuming  that there will be no inflation or deflation over the term of the  instrument. The issuer also allocates any bond issuance premium among  the accrual periods by assuming that there will be no inflation or  deflation over the term of the instrument. The bond issuance premium  allocable to an accrual period offsets qualified stated interest  allocable to the period. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(4) of this  section, if the bond issuance premium allocable to an accrual period  exceeds the qualified stated interest allocable to the period, the  excess is treated as a deflation adjustment under Sec. 1.1275- 7(f)(1)(ii). See Sec. 1.1275-7 for other rules relating to inflation- indexed debt instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain debt instruments subject to contingencies--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. Except as provided in paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, the  rules of Sec. 1.1272-1(c) apply to determine a debt instrument's  payment schedule for purposes of this section. For example, an issuer  uses the payment schedule determined under Sec. 1.1272-1(c) to  determine the amount, if any, of bond issuance premium on the   debt instrument, the yield and maturity of the debt instrument, and the  allocation of bond issuance premium to an accrual period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Mandatory sinking fund provision. Notwithstanding paragraph  (e)(3)(i) of this section, if a debt instrument is subject to a  mandatory sinking fund provision described in Sec. 1.1272-1(c)(3), the  issuer must determine the payment schedule by assuming that a pro rata  portion of the debt instrument will be called under the sinking fund  provision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Remote and incidental contingencies. For purposes of determining  the amount of bond issuance premium and allocating bond issuance premium  among accrual periods, if a bond provides for a contingency that is  remote or incidental (within the meaning of Sec. 1.1275-2(h)), the  issuer takes the contingency into account under the rules for remote and  incidental contingencies in Sec. 1.1275-2(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules of this  section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On February 1, 1999, X issues for $110,000 a  debt instrument maturing on February 1, 2006, with a stated principal  amount of $100,000, payable at maturity. The debt instrument provides  for unconditional payments of interest of $10,000, payable on February 1  of each year. X uses the calendar year as its taxable year, X uses the  cash receipts and disbursements method of accounting, and X decides to  use annual accrual periods ending on February 1 of each year. X's  calculations assume a 30-day month and 360-day year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Amount of bond issuance premium. The issue price of the debt  instrument is $110,000. Because the interest payments on the debt  instrument are qualified stated interest, the stated redemption price at  maturity of the debt instrument is $100,000. Therefore, the amount of  bond issuance premium is $10,000 ($110,000-$100,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Bond issuance premium allocable to the first accrual period.  Based on the payment schedule and the issue price of the debt  instrument, the yield of the debt instrument is 8.07 percent, compounded  annually. (Although, for purposes of simplicity, the yield as stated is  rounded to two decimal places, the computations do not reflect this  rounding convention.) The bond issuance premium allocable to the accrual  period ending on February 1, 2000, is the excess of the qualified stated  interest allocable to the period ($10,000) over the product of the  adjusted issue price at the beginning of the period ($110,000) and the  yield (8.07 percent, compounded annually). Therefore, the bond issuance  premium allocable to the accrual period is $1,118.17 ($10,000- $8,881.83).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Premium used to offset interest. Although X makes an interest  payment of $10,000 on February 1, 2000, X only deducts interest of  $8,881.83, the qualified stated interest allocable to the period  ($10,000) offset with the bond issuance premium allocable to the period  ($1,118.17).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section applies to debt instruments issued  on or after March 2, 1998.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Accounting method changes--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Consent to change. An issuer  required to change its method of accounting for bond issuance premium to  comply with this section must secure the consent of the Commissioner in  accordance with the requirements of Sec. 1.446-1(e). Paragraph (h)(2)  of this section provides the Commissioner's automatic consent for  certain changes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> applies provided--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The change is made to comply with this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The change is made for the first taxable year for which the  issuer must account for a debt instrument under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The issuer attaches to its federal income tax return for the  taxable year containing the change a statement that it has changed its  method of accounting under this section.  [T.D. 8746, 62 FR 68176, Dec. 31, 1997, as amended by T.D. 8838, 64 FR  48547, Sept. 7, 1999]    Sec. 1.163(d)-1  Time and manner for making elections under the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Description. Section 163(d)(4)(B)(iii), as added by section  13206(d) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (Pub. L. 103- 66, 107 Stat. 467), allows an electing taxpayer to take all or a portion  of certain   net capital gain attributable to dispositions of property held for  investment into account as investment income. Section 163(d)(4)(B), as  amended by section 302(b) of the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief  Reconciliation Act of 2003 (Pub. L. 108-27, 117 Stat. 762), allows an  electing taxpayer to take all or a portion of qualified dividend income,  as defined in section 1(h)(11)(B), into account as investment income. As  a consequence, the net capital gain and qualified dividend income taken  into account as investment income under these elections are not eligible  to be taxed at the capital gains rates. An election may be made for net  capital gain recognized by noncorporate taxpayers during any taxable  year beginning after December 31, 1992. An election may be made for  qualified dividend income received by noncorporate taxpayers during any  taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002, but before January 1,  2009.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Time and manner for making the elections. The elections for net  capital gain and qualified dividend income must be made on or before the  due date (including extensions) of the income tax return for the taxable  year in which the net capital gain is recognized or the qualified  dividend income is received. The elections are to be made on Form 4952,  ``Investment Interest Expense Deduction,'' in accordance with the form  and its instructions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Revocability of elections. The elections described in this  section are revocable with the consent of the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date. The rules set forth in this section regarding  the net capital gain election apply beginning December 12, 1996. The  rules set forth in this section regarding the qualified dividend income  election apply to any taxable year beginning after December 31, 2002,  but before January 1, 2009.
