Subject to the  applicable procedures for issuing, reviewing and enforcing directives  set forth in subpart L of part 747 of this chapter, the NCUA Board may,  by directive, take one or more of the following actions with respect to  any ``significantly undercapitalized'' credit union, or a director,  officer or employee of such credit union, if it determines that those  actions are necessary to carry out the purpose of this part:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Restricting transactions with and ownership of CUSO.
