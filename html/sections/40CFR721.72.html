                            <p class="depth0">Whenever a substance is identified in subpart E of this part as being subject to this section, a significant new use of that substance is any manner or method of manufacture, import, or processing associated with any use of that substance without establishing a hazard communication program as described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Written hazard communication program. Each employer shall develop and

implement a written hazard communication program for the substance in each workplace. The written program will, at a minimum, describe how the requirements of this section for labels, MSDSs, and other forms of warning material will be satisfied. The employer must make the written hazard communication program available, upon request, to all employees, contractor employees, and their designated representatives. The employer may rely on an existing hazard communication program, including an existing program established under the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1900.1200), to comply with this paragraph provided that the existing hazard communication program satisfies the requirements of this paragraph. The written program shall include the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A list of each substance identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section known to be present in the work area. The list must be maintained in the work area and must use the identity provided on the appropriate MSDS for each substance required under paragraph (c) of this section. The list may be compiled for the workplace or for individual work areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The methods the employer will use to inform employees of the hazards of non-routine tasks involving the substance, for example, the cleaning of reactor vessels, and the hazards associated with the substance contained in unlabeled pipes in their work area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The methods the employer will use to inform contractors of the presence of the substance in the employer's workplace and of the provisions of this part applicable to the substance if employees of the contractor work in the employer's workplace and are reasonably likely to be exposed to the substance while in the employer's workplace.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Labeling. (1) Each employer shall ensure that each container of the substance in the workplace is labeled in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each employer shall ensure that each container of the substance in the workplace is labeled in accordance with this paragraph (b)(1).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The label shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> A statement of health hazard(s) and precautionary measure(s) for the substance, if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The identity by which the substance may be commonly recognized.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> A statement of environmental hazard(s) and precautionary measure(s) for the substance, if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> A statement of exposure and precautionary measure(s), if any, identified in subpart E of this part or by the employer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employer may use signs, placards, process sheets, batch tickets, operating procedures, or other such written materials in lieu of affixing labels to individual stationary process containers, as long as the alternative method identifies the containers to which it is applicable and conveys information specified by paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section. Any written materials must be readily accessible to the employees in their work areas throughout each work shift.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The employer need not label portable containers into which the substance is transferred from labeled containers, and which are intended only for the immediate use of the employee who performs the transfer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The employer shall not remove or deface an existing label on incoming containers of the substance unless the container is immediately relabeled with the information specified in paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each employer shall ensure that each container of the substance leaving its workplace for distribution in commerce is labeled in accordance with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The label shall, at a minimum, contain the following information:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The information required under paragraph (b)(1)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The name and address of the manufacturer or a responsible party who can provide additional information on the substance for hazard evaluation and any appropriate emergency procedures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The label shall not conflict with the requirements of the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act (18 U.S.C. 1801 et. seq.) and regulations issued under that Act by the Department of Transportation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The label, or alternative forms of warning, shall be legible and prominently displayed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The label, or alternative forms of warning, shall be in English; however, the information may be repeated in other languages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the label or alternative form of warning is to be applied to a mixture containing a substance identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section in combination with another substance identified in subpart E of this part and/or a substance defined as a ``hazardous chemical'' under the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) Hazard Communication Standard (29 CFR 1900.1200), the employer may prescribe on the label, MSDS, or alternative form of warning, the measures to control worker exposure or environmental release which the employer determines provide the greatest degree of protection. However, should these control measures differ from the applicable measures required under subpart E of this part, the employer must seek a determination of equivalency for such alternative control measures pursuant to Sec. 721.30 before prescribing them under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Material safety data sheets. (1) Each employer must obtain or develop a MSDS for the substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each employer must obtain or develop a MSDS for the substance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Each MSDS shall contain, at a minimum, the following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The identity used on the container label of the substance under this section, and, if not claimed confidential, the chemical and common name of the substance. If the chemical and common name are claimed confidential, a generic chemical name must be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Physical and chemical characteristics of the substance known to the employer (such as vapor pressure, flash point).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The physical hazards of the substance known to the employer, including the potential for fire, explosion, and reactivity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The potential human and environmental hazards as specified in subpart E of this part for the substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Signs and symptoms of exposure, and any medical conditions which are expected to be aggravated by exposure to the substance known to the employer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The primary routes of exposure to the substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Precautionary measures to control worker exposure and/or environmental release identified in subpart E of this part for the substance, or alternative control measures which EPA has determined under Sec. 721.30 provide substantially the same degree of protection as the identified control measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Any generally applicable precautions for safe handling and use of the substance which are known to the employer, including appropriate hygienic practices, protective measures during repair and maintenance of contaminated equipment, and procedures for response to spills and leaks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Any generally applicable control measures which are known to the employer, such as appropriate engineering controls, work practices, or personal protective equipment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Emergency first aid procedures known to the employer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> The date of preparation of the MSDS or of its last revision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xii)</em> The name, address, and telephone number of the individual preparing or distributing the MSDS, or a responsible party who can provide additional information on the substance for hazard evaluation and any appropriate emergency procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If no relevant information is found or known for any given category on the MSDS, the employer must mark the MSDS to indicate that no applicable information was found.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Where multiple mixtures containing the substance have similar compositions (i.e., the chemical ingredients are essentially the same, but the specific composition varies from mixture to mixture) and similar hazards, the employer may prepare one MSDS to apply to all of these multiple mixtures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the employer becomes aware of any significant new information regarding the hazards of the substance or ways to protect against the hazards, this new information must be added to the MSDS within 3 months from the time the employer becomes aware of the new information. If the substance

is not currently being manufactured, imported, processed, or used in the employer's workplace, the employer must add the new information to the MSDS before the substance is reintroduced into the workplace.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The employer must ensure that persons receiving the substance from the employer are provided an appropriate MSDS with their initial shipment and with the first shipment after an MSDS is revised. The employer may either provide the MSDS with the shipped containers or send it to the person prior to or at the time of shipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The employer must maintain a copy of the MSDS in its workplace, and must ensure that it is readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> The MSDS may be kept in any form, including as operating procedures, and may be designed to cover groups of substances in a work area where it may be more appropriate to address the potential hazards of a process rather than individual substances. However, in all cases, the required information must be provided for each substance and must be readily accessible during each work shift to employees when they are in their work areas.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> The MSDS must be printed in English; however, the information may be repeated in other languages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Employee information and training. Each employer must ensure that employees are provided with information and training on the substance identified in subpart E of this part. This information and training must be provided at the time of each employee's initial assignment to a work area containing the substance and whenever the substance subject to this section is introduced into the employee's work area for the first time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information provided to employees under this paragraph shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any operations in the work area where the substance is present.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The location and availability of the written hazard communication program required under paragraph (a) of this section, including the list of substances identified in subpart E of this part as subject to this section, and MSDSs required by paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training provided to employees shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Methods and observations that may be used to detect the presence or release of the substance in or from an employee's work area (such as monitoring conducted by the employer, continuous monitoring devices, visual appearance, or odor of the substance when being released).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The potential human health and environmental hazards of the substance as specified in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The measures employees can take to protect themselves and the environment from the substance, including specific procedures the employer has implemented to protect employees and the environment from exposure to the substance, including appropriate work practices, emergency procedures, personal protective equipment, engineering controls, and other measures to control worker exposure and/or environmental release required under subpart E of the part, or alternative control measures which EPA has determined under Sec. 721.30 provide substantially the same degree of protection as the specified control measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The requirements of the hazard communication program developed by the employer under this section, including an explanation of the labeling system and the MSDS required by this section and guidance on obtaining and using appropriate hazard information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Low concentrations in mixtures. If a substance identified in subpart E of this part is present in the work area only as a mixture, an employer is exempt from the provisions of this section if the concentration of the substance in the mixture does not exceed a concentration set in subpart E of this part. The exemption does not apply if the employer has reason to believe that during intended use or processing in the work area, the substance in the mixture may be concentrated above the level set in subpart E of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Existing hazard communication program. The employer need not take additional actions if existing programs and procedures satisfy the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Human health, environmental hazard, exposure, and precautionary statements. Whenever referenced in subpart E of this part for a substance, the following human health and environmental hazard, exposure, and precautionary statements shall appear on each label as specified in paragraph (b) of this section and the MSDS as specified in paragraph (c) of this section. Additional statements may be included as long as they are true and do not alter the meaning of the required statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Human health hazard statements: This substance may cause:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Skin irritation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Respiratory complications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Central nervous system effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Internal organ effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Birth defects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Reproductive effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Cancer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Immune system effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Developmental effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Human health hazard precautionary statements: When using this substance:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Avoid skin contact.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Avoid breathing substance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Avoid ingestion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Use respiratory protection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Use skin protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Environmental hazard statements: This substance may be:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Toxic to fish.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Toxic to aquatic organisms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Environmental hazard precautionary statements: Notice to users:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Disposal restrictions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Spill clean-up restrictions apply.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Do not release to water.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Each human health or environmental hazard precautionary statement identified in subpart E of this part for the label on the substance container must be followed by the statement, ``See MSDS for details.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Human health, environmental hazard exposure and precautionary statements.
