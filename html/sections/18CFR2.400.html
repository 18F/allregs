Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section,  natural gas with a heating value of 300 Btu per standard cubic foot  (scf) or below will be considered unmarketable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Category 2. In determining whether natural gas with a heating  value above 300 Btu but not more than 800 Btu per scf and natural gas  produced in the Moxa Arch area is unmarketable, the Commission will  consider the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The percentages of the chemical components of the gas, the  wellhead pressure, and the flow rate;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Whether the applicant offered the gas to all potential buyers  located within 20 miles of the wellhead under terms and conditions  commensurate with those prevailing in the region and that such potential  buyers refused to buy the gas; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A study, which may be submitted by an applicant, that evaluates  the economics of upgrading the gas for sale and transporting the gas to  a pipeline. The study should include estimates of the revenues which  could be derived from the sale of the gas and the fixed and variable  costs of upgrading.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Category 3. In determining whether natural gas with a heating  value above 800 Btu per scf is marketable, the Commission will consider  the information included in paragraph (b) of this section and whether:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The gas has actually been flared, vented to the atmosphere, or  continuously injected into a non-producing zone for a period of one  year, pursuant to legal authority; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The gas has been certified as waste, i.e., suitable for  disposal, by an appropriate state authority.
