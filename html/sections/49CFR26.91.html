                                Sec. 26.91  What actions do recipients take following DOT certification
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you are the recipient from whose action an appeal under Sec.  26.89 is taken, the decision is binding. It is not binding on other  recipients.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you are a recipient to which a DOT determination under Sec.  26.89 is applicable, you must take the following action:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Department determines that you erroneously certified a  firm, you must remove the firm's eligibility on receipt of the  determination, without further proceedings on your part. Effective on  the date of your receipt of the Department's determination, the  consequences of a removal of eligibility set forth in Sec. 26.87(i)  take effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Department determines that you erroneously failed to find  reasonable cause to remove the firm's eligibility, you must  expeditiously commence a proceeding to determine whether the firm's  eligibility should be removed, as provided in Sec. 26.87.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the Department determines that you erroneously declined to  certify or removed the eligibility of the firm, you must certify the  firm, effective on the date of your receipt of the written notice of  Department's determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the Department determines that you erroneously determined  that the presumption of social and economic disadvantage either should  or should not be deemed rebutted, you must take appropriate corrective  action as determined by the Department.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> If the Department affirms your determination, no further action  is necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where DOT has upheld your denial of certification to or removal  of eligibility from a firm, or directed the removal of a firm's  eligibility, other recipients with whom the firm is certified may  commence a proceeding to remove the firm's eligibility under Sec.  26.87. Such recipients must not remove the firm's eligibility absent  such a proceeding. Where DOT has reversed your denial of certification  to or removal of eligibility from a firm, other recipients must take the  DOT action into account in any certification action involving the firm.  However, other recipients are not required to certify the firm based on  the DOT decision.</p>
