                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. This section requires a transmission organization with  one or more organized electricity markets (administered either by it or  by another entity) to make available long-term firm transmission rights,  pursuant to section 217(b)(4) of the Federal Power Act, that satisfy  each of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. This  section does not require that a specific type of long-term firm  transmission right be made available, and is intended to permit  transmission organizations flexibility in satisfying the guidelines set  forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. As used in this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transmission Organization means a Regional Transmission  Organization, Independent System Operator, independent transmission  provider, or other independent transmission organization finally  approved by the Commission for the operation of transmission facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Load serving entity means a distribution utility or an electric  utility that has a service obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Service obligation means a requirement applicable to, or the  exercise of authority granted to, an electric utility under Federal,  State, or local law or under long-term contracts to provide electric  service to end-users or to a distribution utility.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Organized Electricity Market means an auction-based day ahead  and real time wholesale market where a single entity receives offers to  sell and bids to buy electric energy and/or ancillary services from  multiple sellers and buyers and determines which sales and purchases are  completed and at what prices, based on formal rules contained in  Commission-approved tariffs, and where the prices are used by a  transmission organization for establishing transmission usage charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Every public utility that is a transmission  organization and that owns, operates or controls facilities used for the  transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce   and has one or more organized electricity markets (administered either  by it or by another entity) must file with the Commission, no later than  January 29, 2007, one of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tariff sheets and rate schedules that make available long-term  firm transmission rights that satisfy each of the guidelines set forth  in paragraph (d) of this section; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An explanation of how its current tariff and rate schedules  already provide for long-term firm transmission rights that satisfy each  of the guidelines set forth in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any transmission organization approved by the Commission for  operation after January 29, 2007 that has one or more organized  electricity markets (administered either by it or by another entity)  will be required to satisfy this general rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Filings made in compliance with this paragraph (c) must explain  how the transmission organization's transmission planning and expansion  procedures will accommodate long-term firm transmission rights,  including but not limited to how the transmission organization will  ensure that allocated long-term firm transmission rights remain feasible  over their entire term.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Each transmission organization subject to this general rule must  also make its transmission planning and expansion procedures and plans  publicly available, including (but not limited to) both the actual plans  and any underlying information used to develop the plans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Guidelines for Design and Administration of Long-term Firm  Transmission Rights. Transmission organizations subject to paragraph (c)  of this section must make available long-term firm transmission rights  that satisfy the following guidelines:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The long-term firm transmission right should specify a source  (injection node or nodes) and sink (withdrawal node or nodes), and a  quantity (MW).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The long-term firm transmission right must provide a hedge  against day-ahead locational marginal pricing congestion charges or  other direct assignment of congestion costs for the period covered and  quantity specified. Once allocated, the financial coverage provided by a  financial long-term right should not be modified during its term (the  ``full funding'' requirement) except in the case of extraordinary  circumstances or through voluntary agreement of both the holder of the  right and the transmission organization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Long-term firm transmission rights made feasible by transmission  upgrades or expansions must be available upon request to any party that  pays for such upgrades or expansions in accordance with the transmission  organization's prevailing cost allocation methods for upgrades or  expansions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Long-term firm transmission rights must be made available with  term lengths (and/or rights to renewal) that are sufficient to meet the  needs of load serving entities to hedge long-term power supply  arrangements made or planned to satisfy a service obligation. The length  of term of renewals may be different from the original term.  Transmission organizations may propose rules specifying the length of  terms and use of renewal rights to provide long-term coverage, but must  be able to offer firm coverage for at least a 10 year period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Load serving entities must have priority over non-load serving  entities in the allocation of long-term firm transmission rights that  are supported by existing capacity. The transmission organization may  propose reasonable limits on the amount of existing capacity used to  support long-term firm transmission rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A long-term transmission right held by a load serving entity to  support a service obligation should be re-assignable to another entity  that acquires that service obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The initial allocation of the long-term firm transmission rights  shall not require recipients to participate in an auction.</p>
