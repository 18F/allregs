                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Treatment as an excise tax. The fee is treated as an excise tax for purposes of subtitle F (sections 6001-7874). Thus, references in subtitle F to ``taxes imposed by this title,'' ``internal revenue tax,'' and similar references, are also references to the fee. For example, the

fee is assessed (section 6201), collected (sections 6301, 6321, and 6331), enforced (section 7602), and subject to examination and summons (section 7602) in the same manner as taxes imposed by the Code.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Deficiency procedures. The deficiency procedures of sections 6211-6216 do not apply to the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Limitation on assessment. The IRS must assess the amount of the fee for any fee year within three years of September 30th of that fee year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Application of section 275. The fee is treated as a tax described in section 275(a)(6) (relating to taxes for which no deduction is allowed).</p>
