Licensees must choose site locations that are a  sufficient distance from co-channel and adjacent channel TV and DTV  stations, and/or must use reduced transmitting power or transmitting  antenna height such that the following minimum desired signal-to- undesired signal ratios (D/U ratios) are met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The minimum D/U ratio for co-channel stations is:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> 40 dB at the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m)  (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the TV station;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For transmitters operating in the 698-746 MHz frequency band,  23 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour (41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5  kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For transmitters operating in the 746-758 MHz, 775-788 MHz,  and 805-806 MHz frequency bands, 17 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour  (41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The minimum D/U ratio for adjacent channel stations is 0 dB at  the hypothetical Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55  miles)) of the TV station or -23 dB at the equivalent Grade B contour  (41 dB[micro]V/m) (88.5 kilometers (55 miles)) of the DTV station.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> TV stations and calculation of contours. The methods used to  calculate TV contours and antenna heights above average terrain are  given in Sec. Sec. 73.683 and 73.684 of this chapter. Tables to  determine the necessary minimum distance from the 698-758 MHz, 775-788  MHz, and 805-806 MHz station to the TV/DTV station, assuming that the  TV/DTV station has a hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contour of 88.5  kilometers (55 miles), are located in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter and  labeled as Tables B, D, and E. The locations of existing and proposed  TV/DTV stations during the period of transition from analog to digital  TV service are given in part 73 of this chapter and in the final  proceedings of MM Docket No. 87-268.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Licensees of stations operating within the ERP and HAAT limits  of Sec. 27.50 must select one of four methods to meet the TV/DTV  protection requirements, subject to Commission approval:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Utilize the geographic separation specified in Tables B, D, and  E of Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, as appropriate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> When station parameters are greater than those indicated in the  tables, calculate geographic separation in accordance with the required  D/U ratios, as provided in paragraph (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Submit an engineering study justifying the proposed  separations based on the parameters of the land mobile station and the  parameters, including authorized and/or applied for facilities, of the  TV/DTV station(s) it is trying to protect; or,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Obtain written concurrence from the applicable TV/DTV  station(s). If this method is chosen, a copy of the agreement must be  submitted with the application.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following is the method for geographic separations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Base  and fixed stations that operate in the 746-758 MHz and 775-787 MHz bands  having an antenna height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford  protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in  accordance with the values specified in Table B (co-channel frequencies  based on 40 dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies  based on 0 dB protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. Base and  fixed stations that operate in the 698-746 MHz band having an antenna  height (HAAT) less than 152 m. (500 ft.) shall afford protection to  adjacent channel DTV stations in accordance with the values specified in  Table E in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter, shall afford protection to co- channel DTV stations by providing 23 dB protection to such stations'  equivalent Grade B contour (41 dB[micro]V/m), and shall afford  protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV stations in accordance  with the values specified in Table B (co-channel frequencies based on 40  dB protection) and Table E (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB  protection) in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. For base and fixed stations  having an antenna height (HAAT) between 152-914 meters (500-3,000 ft.)  the effective radiated power must be reduced below 1 kilowatt in  accordance with the values shown in the power reduction graph in Figure  B in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter. For heights of more than 152 m. (500  ft.) above average terrain, the distance to the radio path horizon will  be calculated assuming smooth earth. If the distance so determined  equals or exceeds the distance to the hypothetical or equivalent Grade B  contour of a co-channel TV/DTV station (i.e., it exceeds the distance  from the appropriate Table in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter to the  relevant TV/DTV station), an authorization will not be granted unless it  can be shown in an engineering study (see paragraph (b)(1)(iii) of this  section) that actual terrain considerations are such as to provide the  desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m for TV  and 41 dB[micro]V/m for DTV stations) or unless the effective radiated  power will be further reduced so that, assuming free space attenuation,  the desired protection at the actual Grade B contour (64 dB[micro]V/m  for TV and 41 dB[micro]V/m coverage contour for DTV stations) will be  achieved. Directions for calculating powers, heights, and reduction  curves are listed in Sec. 90.309 of this chapter for land mobile  stations. Directions for calculating coverage contours are listed in  Sec. 73.683 through 73.685 of this chapter for TV stations and in Sec.  73.625 of this chapter for DTV stations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables) that  operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and mobile  stations (including portables) that operate in the 698-757 MHz and 776- 787 MHz bands are limited in height and power and therefore shall afford  protection to co-channel and adjacent channel TV/DTV stations in the  following manner:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables)  that operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and  mobile stations (including portables) that operate in the 746-757 MHz  and 776-787 MHz bands, co-channel protection shall be afforded in  accordance with the values specified in Table D (co-channel frequencies  based on 40 dB protection for TV stations and 17 dB for DTV stations) in  Sec. 90.309 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> For control and mobile stations (including portables) that  operate in the 698-746 MHz band, co-channel protection shall be afforded  to TV stations in accordance with the values specified   in Table D (co-channel frequencies based on 40 dB protection) and to DTV  stations by providing 23 dB protection to such stations' equivalent  Grade B contour (41 dB[micro]V/m).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For control, fixed, and mobile stations (including portables)  that operate in the 787-788 MHz and 805-806 MHz bands and control and  mobile stations (including portables) that operate in the 698-757 MHz  and 776-787 MHz bands, adjacent channel protection shall be afforded by  providing a minimum distance of 8 kilometers (5 miles) from all adjacent  channel TV/DTV station hypothetical or equivalent Grade B contours  (adjacent channel frequencies based on 0 dB protection for TV stations  and -23 dB for DTV stations).</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Since control, fixed, and mobile stations may affect different  TV/DTV stations than the associated base or fixed station, particular  care must be taken by applicants/licensees to ensure that all  appropriate TV/DTV stations are considered (e.g., a base station may be  operating within TV Channel 62 and the mobiles within TV Channel 67, in  which case TV Channels 61, 62, 63, 66, 67 and 68 must be protected).  Control, fixed, and mobile stations shall keep a minimum distance of  96.5 kilometers (60 miles) from all adjacent channel TV/DTV stations.  Since mobiles and portables are able to move and communicate with each  other, licensees must determine the areas where the mobiles can and  cannot roam in order to protect the TV/DTV stations.</p><p class="depth5">Note to Sec. 27.60: The 88.5 km (55mi) Grade B service contour (64  dB[micro]V/m) is based on a hypothetical TV station operating at an  effective radiated power of one megawatt, a transmitting antenna height  above average terrain of 610 meters (2000 feet) and the Commission's R- 6602 F(50,50) curves. See Sec. 73.699 of this chapter. Maximum  facilities for TV stations operating in the UHF band are 5 megawatts  effective radiated power at an antenna HAAT of 610 meters (2,000 feet).  See Sec. 73.614 of this chapter. The equivalent contour for DTV  stations is based on a 41 dB[micro]V/m signal strength and the distance  to the F(50,90) curve. See Sec. 73.625 of this chapter.
