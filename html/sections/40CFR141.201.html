                            <p class="depth0">Public water systems in States with primacy for the public water  system supervision (PWSS) program must comply with the requirements in  this subpart no later than May 6, 2002 or on the date the State-adopted  rule becomes effective, whichever comes first. Public water systems in  jurisdictions where EPA directly implements the PWSS program must comply  with the requirements in this subpart on October 31, 2000. Prior to  these dates, public water systems must continue to comply with the  public notice requirements in Sec.  141.32 of this part. The term  ``primacy agency'' is used in this subpart to refer to either EPA or the  State or the Tribe in cases where EPA, the State, or the Tribe exercises  primary enforcement responsibility for this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Who must give public notice? Each owner or operator of a public  water system (community water systems, non-transient non-community water  systems, and transient non-community water systems) must give notice for  all violations of national primary drinking water regulations (NPDWR)  and for other situations, as listed in Table 1. The term ``NPDWR  violations'' is used in this subpart to include violations of the  maximum contaminant level (MCL), maximum residual disinfection level  (MRDL), treatment technique (TT), monitoring requirements, and testing  procedures in this part 141. Appendix A to this subpart identifies the  tier assignment for each specific violation or situation requiring a  public notice.</p><p class="depth0">Table 1 to Sec.   141.201--Violation Categories and Other Situations</p><p class="depth0">Requiring a Public Notice ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> NPDWR violations:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to comply with an applicable maximum contaminant level</p><p class="depth0"><em>(MCL)</em> or maximum residual disinfectant level (MRDL).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Failure to comply with a prescribed treatment technique (TT).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Failure to perform water quality monitoring, as required by the</p><p class="depth0">drinking water regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Failure to comply with testing procedures as prescribed by a</p><p class="depth0">drinking water regulation.

Public notice requirements are divided into three tiers, to  take into account the seriousness of the violation or situation and of  any potential adverse health effects that may be involved. The public  notice requirements for each violation or situation listed in Table 1 of  this section are determined by the tier to which it is assigned. Table 2  of this section provides the definition of each tier. Appendix A of this  part identifies the tier assignment for each specific violation or  situation.</p><p class="depth0">Table 2 to Sec.   141.201--Definition of Public Notice Tiers ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Tier 1 public notice--required for NPDWR violations and situations</p><p class="depth0">with significant potential to have serious adverse effects on human</p><p class="depth0">health as a result of short-term exposure. (2) Tier 2 public notice--required for all other NPDWR violations and</p><p class="depth0">situations with potential to have serious adverse effects on human</p><p class="depth0">health. (3) Tier 3 public notice--required for all other NPDWR violations and</p><p class="depth0">situations not included in Tier 1 and Tier 2. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Who must be notified? (1) Each public water system must provide  public notice to persons served by the water system, in accordance with  this subpart. Public water systems that sell or otherwise provide  drinking water to other public water systems (i.e., to consecutive  systems) are required to give public notice to the owner or operator of  the consecutive system; the consecutive system is responsible for  providing public notice to the persons it serves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If a public water system has a violation in a portion of the  distribution system that is physically or hydraulically isolated from  other parts of the distribution system, the primacy agency may allow the  system to limit distribution of the public notice to only persons served  by that portion of the system which is out of compliance. Permission by  the primacy agency for limiting distribution of the notice must be  granted in writing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A copy of the notice must also be sent to the primacy agency, in  accordance with the requirements under Sec.  141.31(d).</p>
