No tariff shall be published until a license is issued, if applicable, and proof of financial responsibility is provided. No license will be issued until the Commission is in receipt of valid proof of financial responsibility from the applicant. Should the applicant not file the requisite proof of financial responsibility within 120 days of notification, the Commission will consider the application to be invalid.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Branch offices.

Failure to adhere to this requirement may result in revocation of the license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Optional bond rider.
