                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> of Sec. 301.7507-9.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Tax computation. The fact that earnings of a given year may be  wholly or partly unavailable under section 7507 for collection of taxes  does not exempt the income for that year, or any part thereof, from tax  liability. The section affects collectibility only, and is not concerned  with taxability. Accordingly, the taxpayer's income tax return shall  correctly compute the tax liability, even though in the opinion of the  taxpayer it is immune from tax collection under the section. The tax  shall be determined with respect to the   entire gross income and not merely with respect to the portion of the  earnings out of which tax may be collected. As to establishment of  immunity from tax collection see Sec. 301.7507-7.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An agreement, executed in the year 1954 between a bank  and its depositors, provides (i) that certain assets are to be  segregated for the benefit of the depositors who have waived (as claims  against unsegregated assets of the bank) a percentage of the deposits;  (ii) that 40 percent of the bank's net earnings, for years beginning  with 1954, from unsegregated assets, shall be paid to the depositors  until the portion of their claims waived with respect to unsegregated  assets of the bank has been paid; and (iii) that the unsegregated assets  shall not be subject to depositors' claims. The net income of the bank  for the calendar year 1954 is $10,000, $4,000 produced by the  segregated, and $6,000 produced by the unsegregated assets. Such amount  shall be considered the net earnings for the purpose of section 7507 in  computing the portion of the earnings to be paid to depositors. The bank  has an outstanding tax liability for prior years of $7,000. The income  tax liability of the bank for 1954 is 30 percent of $10,000, or $3,000,  making a total outstanding tax liability of $10,000. The portion of the  earnings of the bank for 1954 remaining after provision for depositors  is $3,600 ($6,000 less 40 percent thereof, or $2,400). It will be  assumed that of the total outstanding tax liability of $10,000, $3,600  may be assessed and collected, leaving $6,400 to be collected from any  excess of the segregated assets after claims of depositors against such  segregated assets have been paid in full. No part of the $6,400 immune  from collection from 1954 earnings may be collected thereafter from  unsegregated assets of the bank or earnings therefrom, so that except  for any possible surplus of the segregated assets the $6,400 is  uncollectible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the year 1955, the earnings are again $10,000, $4,000 from  segregated and $6,000 from unsegregated assets, as in 1954. However, the  return filed shows income of $5,000 and a tax liability of $1,500. An  investigation shows the true income to be $10,000, on which the tax is  $3,000. The full $3,000 will be assumed to be collectible. The $600  difference between $3,600 (the excess of earnings from unsegregated  assets over the amount going to the depositors), and the $3,000 tax for  1955, is not available for collection of the tax for prior years, which  became immune as described above, but may be available for collection of  tax for subsequent years.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> No significance attaches to the selection of the years 1954 and  1955 in the example set forth in paragraph (b) of this section. The  rules indicated by the example are equally applicable to subsequent or  prior years not excluded by limitations.</p>
