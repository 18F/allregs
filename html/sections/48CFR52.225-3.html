Cost of components does not include any costs associated with the manufacture of the end product.</p><p class="depth0">Domestic end product means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An unmanufactured end product mined or produced in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An end product manufactured in the United States, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The cost of its components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all its components. Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind as those that the agency determines are not mined, produced, or manufactured in sufficient and reasonably available commercial quantities of a satisfactory quality are treated as domestic.
