                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An Insular Area shall use the funds it receives under a consolidated grant to carry out, in its jurisdiction, one or more of the programs included in the grant.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Assume that Guam applies for a consolidated grant under the Vocational Education Act, the Handicapped Preschool and School Programs-Incentive Grants, and the Adult Education Act and that the sum of the allocations under these programs is $700,000. Guam may choose to allocate this $700,000 among all of the programs authorized under the three programs. Alternatively, it may choose to allocate the entire $700,000 to one or two of the programs; for example, the Adult Education Act Program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An Insular Area shall comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to each program under which funds from the consolidated grant are expended.</p><p class="depth2">Example. Assume that American Samoa uses part of the funds under a consolidated grant for the State program under the Adult Education Act. American Samoa need not submit to the Secretary a State plan that requires policies and procedures to assure all students equal access to adult education programs. However, in carrying out the program, American Samoa must meet and be able to demonstrate compliance with this equal access requirement.
