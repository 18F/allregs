If the formula is approved for drawback, the ingredient shall be treated as a finished nonbeverage product for purposes of this part, rather than as an intermediate product, notwithstanding its use by the manufacturer. (For example, see Sec. 17.152(d).) If the formula is disapproved for drawback, the ingredient may be treated as an intermediate product in accordance with this part. Requirements pertaining to intermediate products are found in Sec. 17.185(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If there is a change in the composition of an intermediate product, the manufacturer shall submit an amended or revised formula, as provided in Sec. 17.122.</p>
