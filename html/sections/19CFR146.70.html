                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred to Customs territory only for entry for exportation, for entry for transportation and exportation, for warehousing pending exportation, for destruction (except destruction of distilled spirits, wines and fermented malt liquors), for transfer from one zone to another, or for delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft or as ground equipment of a qualified aircraft under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317), unless the Board has ruled that the return of the merchandise to Customs territory for domestic consumption is in the public interest. With Board approval (See 15 CFR part 400), that merchandise may be entered for consumption, for warehousing, for immediate transportation without appraisement, or under any other provision of the Customs laws, unless the Board has specified the form of entry to be made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For consumption. If the return of zone-restricted merchandise to Customs territory for consumption has been ruled by the Board to be in the public interest, the entry shall be endorsed by the port director to show the authority under which it was made, and that the merchandise is subject to the provisions of Chapter 98, Subchapter I, Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> For warehousing. Zone-restricted merchandise may be transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse for storage pending exportation. The Customs Form 7501 shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise may not be withdrawn for consumption. In the case of zone-restricted merchandise transported in bond to another port for warehousing and exportation, Customs Form 7512 shall be endorsed by the port director to show that the merchandise is foreign trade zone merchandise in zone-restricted status, which shall be entered for warehouse with proper endorsement on Customs Form 7501, and which may not be withdrawn for consumption. Zone-restricted merchandise transferred from a zone to a Customs bonded warehouse may not be manipulated, except for packing or unpacking incidental to exportation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For other purposes. Upon acceptance of an entry or withdrawal for zone-restricted merchandise for any purpose other than that described in a Board order, the entry shall be endorsed by the person making entry to show that actual exportation of the merchandise is required by the fourth proviso to section 3 of the Act, as amended, or the entry endorsed to require delivery to a qualified vessel or aircraft, under section 309 or 317, Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1309, 1317).
