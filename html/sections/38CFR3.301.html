                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Line of duty. Direct service connection may be granted only when  a disability or cause of death was incurred or aggravated in line of  duty, and not the result of the veteran's own willful misconduct or, for  claims filed after October 31, 1990, the result of his or her abuse of  alcohol or drugs.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Willful misconduct. Disability pension is not payable for any  condition due to the veteran's own willful misconduct.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1521)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(3)</em> of this section  are subject to the provisions of Sec.  3.302 of this part where  applicable.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Venereal disease. The residuals of venereal disease are not to  be considered the result of willful misconduct. Consideration of service  connection for residuals of venereal disease as having been incurred in  service requires that the initial infection must have occurred during  active service. Increase in service of manifestations of venereal  disease will usually be held due to natural progress unless the facts of  record indicate the increase in manifestations was precipitated by  trauma or by the conditions of the veteran's service, in which event  service connection may be established by aggravation. Medical principles  pertaining to the incubation period and its relation to the course of  the disease; i.e., initial or acute manifestation, or period and course  of secondary and late residuals manifested, will be considered when time  of incurrence of venereal disease prior to or after entry into service  is at issue. In the issue of service connection, whether the veteran  complied with service regulations and directives for reporting the  disease and undergoing treatment is immaterial after November 14, 1972,  and the service department characterization of acquisition of the  disease as willful misconduct or as not in line of duty will not govern.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The simple drinking of alcoholic beverage is not of itself  willful misconduct. The deliberate drinking of a known poisonous  substance or under conditions which would raise a presumption to that  effect will be considered willful misconduct. If, in the drinking of a  beverage to enjoy its intoxicating effects, intoxication results  proximately and immediately in disability or death, the disability or  death will be considered the result of the person's willful misconduct.  Organic diseases and disabilities which are a secondary result of the  chronic use of alcohol as a beverage, whether out of compulsion or  otherwise, will not be considered of willful misconduct origin. (See  Sec. Sec.  21.1043, 21.5041, and 21.7051 of this title regarding the  disabling effects of chronic alcoholism for the purpose of extending  delimiting periods under education or rehabilitation programs.)   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Drug usage. The isolated and infrequent use of drugs by itself  will not be considered willful misconduct; however, the progressive and  frequent use of drugs to the point of addiction will be considered  willful misconduct.   Where drugs are used to enjoy or experience their effects and the  effects result proximately and immediately in disability or death, such  disability or death will be considered the result of the person's  willful misconduct. Organic diseases and disabilities which are a  secondary result of the chronic use of drugs and infections coinciding  with the injection of drugs will not be considered of willful misconduct  origin. (See paragraph (d) of this section regarding service connection  where disability or death is a result of abuse of drugs.) Where drugs  are used for therapeutic purposes or where use of drugs or addiction  thereto, results from a service-connected disability, it will not be  considered of misconduct origin.   (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 105, 1110, 1121, 1131, 1301, and 1521(a))</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Line of duty; abuse of alcohol or drugs. An injury or disease  incurred during active military, naval, or air service shall not be  deemed to have been incurred in line of duty if such injury or disease  was a result of the abuse of alcohol or drugs by the person on whose  service benefits are claimed. For the purpose of this paragraph, alcohol  abuse means the use of alcoholic beverages over time, or such excessive  use at any one time, sufficient to cause disability to or death of the  user; drug abuse means the use of illegal drugs (including prescription  drugs that are illegally or illicitly obtained), the intentional use of  prescription or non-prescription drugs for a purpose other than the  medically intended use, or the use of substances other than alcohol to  enjoy their intoxicating effects.
