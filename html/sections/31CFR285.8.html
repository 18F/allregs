                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Debt means past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation  or unemployment compensation debt unless otherwise indicated.</p><p class="depth0">Debtor means a person who owes a debt.</p><p class="depth0">Fiscal Service means the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, a bureau of  the Department of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0">IRS means the Internal Revenue Service, a bureau of the Department  of the Treasury.</p><p class="depth0">Past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation means a  debt which resulted from:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A judgment rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction which  has determined an amount of State income tax to be due,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A determination after an administrative hearing which has  determined an amount of state income tax to be due and which is no  longer subject to judicial review, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A State income tax assessment (including self-assessments) which  has become final in accordance with State law but not collected and  which has not been delinquent for more than 10 years.</p><p class="depth0">State means the several States of the United States. The term  ``State'' also includes the District of Columbia, American Samoa, Guam,  the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern  Mariana Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth0">State income tax obligation means State income tax obligations as  determined under State law. For purposes of this section, State income  tax obligation includes any local income tax administered by the chief  tax administration agency of the State.</p><p class="depth0">Tax refund offset means withholding or reducing a tax refund  overpayment by an amount necessary to satisfy a debt owed by the  payee(s).</p><p class="depth0">Tax refund payment means any overpayment of Federal taxes to be  refunded to the person making the overpayment after the IRS makes the  appropriate credits as provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402(a) and 26 CFR 6402- 3(a)(6)(i) for any liabilities for any Federal tax on the part of the  person who made the overpayment.</p><p class="depth0">Unemployment compensation debt has the same meaning as the term  ``covered unemployment debt'' as defined in 26 U.S.C. 6402(f)(4), and  means--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A past-due debt for erroneous payment of unemployment  compensation due to fraud or the person's failure to report earnings  which has become final under the law of a State certified by the  Secretary of Labor pursuant to 26 U.S.C. 3304 and which remains  uncollected;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Contributions due to the unemployment fund of a State for which  the State has determined the person to be liable and which remain  uncollected; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any penalties and interest assessed on such debt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fiscal Service will offset tax refunds to  collect debt under this section in accordance with 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) and  (f) and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Fiscal Service will compare tax refund payment records, as  certified by the IRS, with records of debts submitted to Fiscal Service.  A match will occur when the taxpayer identifying number (as that term is  used in 26 U.S.C. 6109) and name on a payment certification record are  the same as the taxpayer identifying number and name (or derivative of  the name) on a delinquent debt record. When a match occurs and all other  requirements for tax refund offset have been met, Fiscal Service will  reduce the amount of any tax refund payment payable to a debtor by the  amount of any past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation  or unemployment compensation debt owed by the debtor. Any amounts not  offset will be paid to the payee(s) listed in the payment certification  record.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fiscal Service will only offset a tax refund payment for a State  income tax obligation if the address shown on the Federal tax return for  the taxable year of the overpayment is an address within the State  seeking the offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notification of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax  obligations or unemployment compensation debts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Notification. States  shall notify Fiscal Service of debts in the manner and format prescribed  by Fiscal Service. The notification of liability must be accompanied by  a certification that the debt is past due and legally enforceable and  that the State has complied with the requirements contained in paragraph  (c)(3) of this section and with all Federal or State requirements  applicable to the collection of debts under this section. With respect  to State income tax obligations only, the certification must  specifically state that none of the debts submitted for collection by  offset are debts owed by an individual who has claimed immunity from  State taxation by reason of being an enrolled member of an Indian tribe  who lives on a reservation and derives all of his or her income from  that reservation unless such claim has been adjudicated de novo on its  merits in accordance with paragraph (c)(3). Fiscal Service may reject a  notification that does not comply with the requirements of this section.  Upon notification of the rejection and the reason for rejection, the  State may resubmit a corrected notification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Minimum amount of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax  obligations that may be submitted. Fiscal Service only will accept  notification of past-due, legally enforceable State income tax  obligations of $25 or more or such higher amounts as determined by  Fiscal Service. States will be notified annually of any changes in the  minimum debt amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Advance notification to the debtor of the State's intent to  collect by Federal tax refund offset. The State is required to provide a  written notification to the debtor informing the debtor that the State  intends to refer the debt for collection by tax refund offset. The  notice must give the debtor at least 60 days to present evidence, in  accordance with procedures established by the State, that all or part of  the debt is not past due or not legally enforceable, or, in the case of  a covered unemployment compensation debt, the debt is not due to fraud  or the debtor's failure to report earnings. In the case of a State  income tax obligation, the notice must be sent certified mail, return  receipt requested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determination. The State must, in accordance with procedures  established by the State, consider any evidence presented by a debtor in  response to the notice described in paragraph (c)(3)(i) of this section  and determine   whether an amount of such debt is past due and legally enforceable and,  in the case of a covered unemployment compensation debt, the debt is due  to fraud or the debtor's failure to report earnings. With respect to  State income tax obligations only, where the debtor claims that he or  she is immune from State taxation by reason of being an enrolled member  of an Indian tribe who lives on a reservation and derives all of his or  her income from that reservation, State procedures shall include de novo  review on the merits, unless such claims have been previously  adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction. States shall, upon  request from the Secretary of the Treasury, make such procedures  available to the Secretary of the Treasury for review.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reasonable efforts. Prior to submitting a debt to Fiscal  Service for collection by tax refund offset the State must make  reasonable efforts to collect the debt. Reasonable efforts include  making written demand on the debtor for payment and complying with any  other prerequisites to offset established by the State.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Correcting and updating notification. The State shall, in the  manner and in the time frames provided by Fiscal Service, notify Fiscal  Service of any deletion or decrease in the amount of past-due, legally  enforceable State income tax obligation or unemployment compensation  debt referred to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset. The  State may notify Fiscal Service of any increases in the amount of the  debt referred to Fiscal Service for collection by tax refund offset  provided that the State has complied with the requirements of paragraph  (c)(3) of this section with regard to those debts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Priorities for offset. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> As provided in 26 U.S.C. 6402, a tax  refund payment shall be reduced first by the amount of any past-due  support being enforced under section 464 of the Social Security Act  which is to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(c); second by the amount of  any past-due, legally enforceable debt owed to a Federal agency which is  to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(d); and third by any past-due, legally  enforceable debt owed to a State (other than past-due support) which is  to be offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or 26 U.S.C. 6402(f).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reduction of the tax refund payment pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  6402(a), (c), (d), (e) and (f) shall occur prior to crediting the  overpayment to any future liability for an internal revenue tax. Any  amount remaining after tax refund offset under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a), (c),  (d), (e) and (f) shall be refunded to the taxpayer, or applied to  estimated tax, if elected by the taxpayer pursuant to IRS regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If Fiscal Service receives notice from a State of more than one  debt subject to this section that is owed by a debtor to the State, any  overpayment by the debtor shall be applied against such debts in the  order in which such debts accrued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Post-offset notice. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> When an offset occurs, Fiscal Service  shall notify the debtor in writing of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The amount and date of the offset and that the purpose of the  offset was to satisfy a past-due, legally enforceable State income tax  obligation or unemployment compensation debt;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The State to which this amount has been paid or credited; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> A contact point within the State that will handle concerns or  questions regarding the offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The notice in paragraph (e)(1) of this section also will advise  any non-debtor spouse who may have filed a joint return with the debtor  of the steps which the non-debtor spouse may take in order to secure his  or her proper share of the tax refund. See paragraph (f) of this  section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Fiscal Service will advise States of the names, mailing  addresses, and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom  amounts of State income tax obligations or unemployment compensation  debts were collected, and of the amounts collected from each debtor  through tax refund offset.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At least weekly, Fiscal Service will notify the IRS of the names  and taxpayer identifying numbers of the debtors from whom amounts owed  for past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations or  unemployment compensation debts were collected from tax refund offsets  and the amounts collected from each debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Offset made with regard to a tax refund payment based upon joint  return. If the person filing a joint return with a debtor owing the  past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligation or  unemployment compensation debt takes appropriate action to secure his or  her proper share of a tax refund from which an offset was made, the IRS  will pay the person his or her share of the refund and request that  Fiscal Service deduct that amount from future amounts payable to the  State or that Fiscal Service otherwise obtain the funds back from the  State. Fiscal Service, or the appropriate State, will adjust their  debtor records accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Disposition of amounts collected. Fiscal Service will transmit  amounts collected for debts, less fees charged under paragraph (h) of  this section, to the appropriate State. If Fiscal Service learns that an  erroneous offset payment is made to any State, Fiscal Service will  notify the appropriate State that an erroneous offset payment has been  made. Fiscal Service may deduct the amount of the erroneous offset  payment from future amounts payable to the State. Alternatively, upon  Fiscal Service' request, the State shall return promptly to the affected  taxpayer or Fiscal Service an amount equal to the amount of the  erroneous payment (unless the State previously has paid such amounts, or  any portion of such amounts, to the affected taxpayer). States shall  notify Fiscal Service any time a State returns an erroneous offset  payment to an affected taxpayer. Fiscal Service, or the appropriate  State, will adjust their debtor records accordingly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Fees. The State will pay a fee to Fiscal Service to cover the  full cost of offsets taken. The fee will be established annually in such  amount as Fiscal Service determines to be sufficient to reimburse Fiscal  Service for the full cost of the offset procedure. Fiscal Service will  deduct the fees from amounts collected prior to disposition and transmit  a portion of the fees deducted to reimburse the IRS for its share of the  cost of administering the tax refund offset program for purposes of  collecting past-due, legally enforceable State income tax obligations or  unemployment compensation debts reported to Fiscal Service by the  States. Fees will be charged only for actual tax refund offsets  completed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Review of tax refund offsets. In accordance with 26 U.S.C.  6402(g), any reduction of a taxpayer's refund made pursuant to 26 U.S.C.  6402(e) or (f) shall not be subject to review by any court of the United  States or by the Secretary of the Treasury, Fiscal Service or IRS in an  administrative proceeding. No action brought against the United States  to recover the amount of this reduction shall be considered to be a suit  for refund of tax. This subsection does not preclude any legal,  equitable, or administrative action against the State to which the  amount of such reduction was paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Access to and use of confidential tax information. Access to and  use of confidential tax information in connection with the tax refund  offset program is permitted to the extent necessary in establishing  appropriate agency records, locating any person with respect to whom a  reduction under 26 U.S.C. 6402(e) or (f) is sought for purposes of  collecting the debt, and in the defense of any litigation or  administrative procedure ensuing from a reduction made under section  6402(e) or (f).
