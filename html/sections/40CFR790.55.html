                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. Any test sponsor who wishes to modify the test  schedule for the mandatory testing conditions or requirements (i.e.,  ``shall statements'') in the test standard for any test required by a  test rule must submit an application in accordance with this paragraph.  Application for modification must be made by the method specified in  Sec. 790.5(b). Applications must include an appropriate explanation and  rationale for the modification. Where a   test sponsor requests EPA to provide guidance or to clarify a non- mandatory testing requirement (i.e., ``should statements'') in a test  standard, the test sponsor must submit these requests to EPA by the  method format specified in Sec. 790.5(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adoption. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Where EPA concludes that the requested  modification of a test standard or schedule for a test required under a  test rule is appropriate, EPA will proceed in accordance with this  paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> shall apply only to the test sponsor who  applied for the modification under this paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section and provide a brief rationale of why the  modification was granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (b), a requested modification of  a test standard or schedule for a test required under a test rule would  alter the scope of the test or significantly change the schedule for  completing the test if the modification would:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Change the test species.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Change the route of administration of the test chemical.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Change the period of time during which the test species is  exposed to the test chemical.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b)(3) of this section, extend  the final reporting deadline more than 12 months from the date specified  in the final rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Disapproval. Where EPA concludes that the requested modification  of a test standard or schedule for a test required under a test rule is  not appropriate, EPA will so notify the test sponsor in writing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Timing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Test sponsors should submit all applications for  test schedule modifications at least 60 days before the reporting  deadline for the test in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> EPA will not normally approve any test schedule extensions  submitted less than 30 days before the reporting deadline for the test  in question.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> of this section, EPA may  grant extensions for up to 1 year but will normally limit extensions to  a period of time equal to the in-life portion of the test plus 60 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> EPA will normally approve only one deadline extension for each  test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test sponsors should submit requests for test standard  modifications as soon as they determine that the test cannot be  successfully completed according to the test standard specified in the  rule.
