                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If EPA believes that a claim is an appropriate candidate for  arbitration, EPA will notify all identified PRPs for the facility  concerned and provide such PRPs with an opportunity to discuss referral  of one or more issues arising in the claim for resolution pursuant to  the procedures established by this part. Alternatively, one or more PRPs  at a facility may propose to EPA use of arbitration, after receipt of a  demand by EPA for payment of a claim, but prior to commencement of civil  litigation of the claim. Where practicable, before an agreement to refer  a claim for arbitration is made final under this alternative, either the  PRPs or EPA shall notify the other PRPs at the facility of the potential  use of arbitration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Administrator and one or more PRPs associated with a  facility may submit to the Association a joint request for arbitration  of one or more issues arising in an EPA claim concerning the facility.  The joint request shall be signed by all of the parties and shall  include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A brief description of the facility, the EPA response action  taken at the facility, the EPA claim, and the parties;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A statement of the issues arising in the claim that are being  submitted   by the parties for resolution by arbitration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A statement that the parties consent to resolution of the  issues jointly submitted pursuant to the procedures established by this  part by an Arbitrator appointed pursuant to Sec. 304.22 of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A statement that the parties agree to be bound by the final  decision on all issues jointly submitted by the parties for resolution  and to pay any award made in the final decision, subject to the right to  challenge the final decision solely on the grounds and in the manner  prescribed by Sec. 304.40(c) of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> A statement that the parties agree that the award made in the  final decision may be enforced pursuant to Sec. 304.40(c) of this part;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> A statement that the parties agree that the final decision  shall be binding only with respect to the response costs at issue in the  claim submitted for arbitration;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A statement that the parties agree that the statute of  limitations governing the EPA claim submitted shall be extended for a  time period equal to the number of days from the date the joint request  for arbitration is submitted to the Association to the date of  resolution of any enforcement action relating to the final decision; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> A statement that each signatory to the joint request is  authorized to enter into the arbitration and to bind legally the party  represented by him or her to the terms of the joint request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The joint request shall also include the name, address and  telephone number of each party, and, if a party is represented by an  attorney, the attorney's name, address and telephone number. A party  changing any of this information must promptly communicate the change in  writing to the Association and all other parties. A party who fails to  furnish such information or any changes thereto is deemed to have waived  his or her right to notice and service under this part until such time  as the party furnishes the missing information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any party may move to modify the joint request for arbitration  to include one or more additional issues arising in the referred claim.  To be effective, any such modification must be signed by the Arbitrator  and all other parties. The joint request for arbitration may also be  modified to add one or more additional parties, if such intervention is  permitted by Sec. 304.24(a) of this part. To be effective, any such  modification must be signed by the Arbitrator, the intervening party or  parties, and all other parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The statute of limitations governing the EPA claim submitted for  arbitration shall be extended for a time period equal to the number of  days from the date the joint request for arbitration is submitted to the  Association to the date of resolution of any enforcement action relating  to the final decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> of this part.  Arbitrations agreed upon pursuant to this paragraph shall be governed by  the procedures established by this part, except for those procedures  which pertain specifically to the duties of the Association. All duties  of the Association shall be performed in a manner agreed upon by all of  the parties.</p>
