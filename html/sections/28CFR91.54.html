                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Major Federal action. NEPA's requirements apply to any proposal  for legislation or other major federal action that might significantly  impact the quality of the human environment. The CEQ regulations in 40  CFR 1508.18 define ``major federal actions'' as actions with effects  that may be major and which are potentially subject to Federal control  and responsibility. The CEQ regulations categorize ``major federal  actions'' as, among other things, the ``[a]pproval of specific projects,  such as construction or management activities located in a defined  geographic area. Projects include actions approved by permit or other  regulatory decision as well as Federal and Federally assisted  activities.'' (40 CFR 1508.18(b)(4)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> VOI/TIS construction grants subject to NEPA. This subpart  applies to all proposed, new and partially completed VOI/TIS projects  (including projects on tribal lands) initiated by state or local units  of government with grant funding from OJP that involve construction,  expansion, renovation, facility planning, site selection, site  preparation, security or facility upgrades or other activities that may  significantly impact the environment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Projects. Although VOI/TIS money cannot be used for a project's  operations expenses, the definition of ``project'' or ``proposal'' for  NEPA review purposes is defined as both the construction and the long- term operation of correctional facilities and related components such as  all off-site projects to accommodate the needs of the correctional  facilities project (e.g., road and utility construction or expansion,  projects offered to the affected community as an incentive to accept the  correctional facility construction or expansion, and other reasonably  foreseeable future actions regardless of what agency or third party  undertakes such action). Reasonably foreseeable actions include future  prison construction phases, especially when either current acreage  requirements or design capacities for utilities are based on needs  stemming from future phases.</p>
