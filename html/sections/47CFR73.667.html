                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em>, (b), and (c)). Subsidiary  communications include, but are not limited to, services such as  functional music, specialized foreign language programs, radio reading  services, utility load management, market and financial data and news,  paging and calling, traffic control signal switching, and point-to-point  or multipoint messages.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> TV subsidiary communications services that are common carrier or  private radio in nature are subject to common carrier or private radio  regulation. Licensees operating such services are required to apply to  the FCC for the appropriate authorization and to comply with all  policies and rules applicable to the service. Responsibility for making  the initial determinations of whether a particular activity requires  separate authority rests with the TV station licensee or permittee.  Initial determinations by licensees or permittees are subject to FCC  examination and may be reviewed at the FCC's discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subsidiary communications services are of a secondary nature  under the authority of the TV station authorization, and the authority  to provide such communications services may not be retained or  transferred in any manner separate from the station's authorization. The  grant or renewal of a TV station permit or license is not furthered or  promoted by proposed or past subsidiary communications services. The  permittee or licensee must establish that the broadcast operation is in  the public interest wholly apart from the subsidiary communications  services provided.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The station identification, delayed recording, and sponsor  identification announcement required by Sec. Sec.  73.1201, 73.1208, and  73.1212 are not applicable to leased communications services transmitted  via services that are not of a general broadcast nature.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The licensee or permittee must retain control over all material  transmitted in a broadcast mode via the station's facilities, with the  right to reject any material that it deems inappropriate or undesirable.
