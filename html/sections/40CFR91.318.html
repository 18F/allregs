                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Calibrate the chemiluminescent oxides of nitrogen analyzer as  described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial and periodic interference. Prior to its introduction  into service, and monthly thereafter, check the chemiluminescent oxides  of nitrogen analyzer for NO2 to NO converter efficiency.  Figure 2 in appendix B of this subpart is a reference for the following  paragraphs:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Follow good engineering practices for instrument start-up and  operation. Adjust the analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with purified synthetic air  or zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Connect the outlet of the NOX generator to the sample  inlet of the oxides of nitrogen analyzer which has been set to the most  common operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Introduce into the NOX generator analyzer-system an  NO-in-nitrogen (N2) mixture with an NO concentration equal to  approximately 80 percent of the most common operating range. The  NO2 content of the gas mixture must be less than 5 percent of  the NO concentration.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> With the oxides of nitrogen analyzer in the NO mode, record the  concentration of NO indicated by the analyzer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Turn on the NOX generator O2 (or air)  supply and adjust the O2 (or air) flow rate so that the NO  indicated by the analyzer is about 10 percent less than indicated in  paragraph (b)(5) of this section. Record the concentration of NO in this  NO+O2 mixture as value ``c.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Switch the NOX generator to the generation mode and  adjust the generation rate so that the NO measured on the analyzer is 20  percent of that measured in paragraph (b)(5) of this section. There must  be at least 10 percent unreacted NO at this point. Record the  concentration of residual NO as value ``d.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Switch the oxides of nitrogen analyzer to the NOX  mode and measure total NOX. Record this value as ``a.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Switch off the NOX generator but maintain gas flow  through the system.   The oxides of nitrogen analyzer will indicate the NOX in the  NO+O2 mixture. Record this value as ``b.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Turn off the NOX generator O2 (or air)  supply. The analyzer will now indicate the NOX in the  original NO-in-N2 mixture. This value should be no more than  5 percent above the value indicated in paragraph (b)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Calculate the efficiency of the NOX converter by  substituting the concentrations obtained into the following equation:  percent efficiency = (1 + (a - b)/(c - d)) x 100 Where:  a=concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(8) of this section, b=concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(9) of this section, c=concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(6) of this section, d=concentration obtained in paragraph (b)(7) of this section.</p><p class="depth3">If converter efficiency is not greater than 90 percent, corrective  action is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Initial and periodic calibration. Prior to its introduction into  service, and monthly thereafter, calibrate the chemiluminescent oxides  of nitrogen analyzer on all normally used instrument ranges. Use the  same flow rate as when analyzing samples. Proceed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Adjust analyzer to optimize performance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Zero the oxides of nitrogen analyzer with zero-grade air or  zero-grade nitrogen.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Calibrate on each normally used operating range with NO-in- N2 calibration gases with nominal concentrations between 10  and 90 percent of that range. A minimum of six evenly spaced points  covering at least 80 percent of the 10 to 90 percent range (64 percent)  is required (see following table).  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Example calibration points (percent)      Acceptable for calibration? ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70....................  No, range covered is 50</p><p class="depth3">percent, not 64 percent. 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90............  Yes. 10, 25, 40, 55, 70, 85....................  Yes. 10, 30, 50, 70, 90........................  No, though equally spaced</p><p class="depth3">and entire range covered, a</p><p class="depth3">minimum of six points is</p><p class="depth3">needed. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Additional calibration points may be generated. For each range  calibrated, if the deviation from a least-squares best-fit straight line  is two percent or less of the value at each data point, concentration  values may be calculated by use of a single calibration factor for that  range. If the deviation exceeds two percent at any point, use the best- fit non-linear equation which represents the data to within two percent  of each test point to determine concentration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The initial and periodic interference, system check, and  calibration test procedures specified in 40 CFR part 1065, subparts C  and D, may be used in lieu of the procedures specified in this section.
