                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Payment for benefits from a non-Federal headwater project. Any  billing procedures and payments determined between a non-Federal  headwater project owner and a downstream project owner will occur  according to the agreement of those parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Charges and payment for benefits from a Federal headwater  project--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Interim charges. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the Commission has not established  a final charge and an investigation is pending, the Commission will  issue a downstream project owner a bill for the interim charge and costs  and a staff report explaining the calculation of the interim charge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An interim charge will be a percentage of the estimate by the  Commission staff of what the final charge will be, as follows:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> 100 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission  previously has completed an investigation of the project for which it is  assessed; or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> 80 percent of the estimated final charge if the Commission has  not completed an investigation of the project for which it is assessed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> When a final charge is established for a period for which an  interim charge was paid, the Commission will apply the amount paid to  the final charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Preliminary assessment of a final charge. Unless the project  owner was assessed a final charge in the previous year, the Commission  will issue to the downstream project owner a preliminary assessment of  any final charge when it is determined. A staff technical report  explaining the basis of the assessment will be enclosed with the  preliminary assessment. Copies of the preliminary assessment will be  mailed to all parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Opportunity to respond. After issuance of a preliminary  assessment of a final charge, parties may respond in writing within 60  days after the preliminary assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Order and bill. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After the opportunity for written response  by the parties to the preliminary assessment of a final charge, the  Commission will issue to the downstream project owner an order  establishing the final charge. Copies of the order will be mailed to all  parties. A bill will be issued for the amount of the final charge and  costs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a final charge is not established prospectively under  paragraph (b)(5) of this section, the Commission will issue an order and  a bill for the final charge and costs each year until prospective final  charges are established. After the Commission issues an order  establishing a prospective final charge, a bill will be issued annually  for the amount of the final charge and costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Prospective final charges. When the Commission determines that  historical data, including the hydrology, development, and other  characteristics of the river basin, demonstrate sufficient stability to  project average energy gains and section 10(f) costs, the Commission  will issue to the downstream project owner an order establishing the  final charge from future years. Copies of the order will be mailed to  all parties. The prospective final charge will remain in effect until a  new investigation is initiated under Sec. 11.15(d)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Payment under protest. Any payment of a final charge required by  this section may be made under protest if a party is also appealing the  final charge pursuant to Sec. 385.1902, or requesting rehearing. If  payment is made under protest, that party will avoid any penalty for  failure to pay under Sec. 11.21.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Accounting for payments pending appeal or rehearing. The  Commission will retain any payment received for final charges from bills  issued pursuant to this section in a special account. No disbursements  to the U.S. Treasury will be made from the account until 31   days after the bill is issued. If an appeal under Sec. 385.1902 or a  request for rehearing is filed by any party, no disbursements to the  U.S. Treasury will be made until final disposition of the appeal or  request for rehearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Charges for costs of determinations of headwater benefits  charges. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any owner of a downstream project that benefits from a  Federal headwater project must pay to the United States the cost of  making any investigation, study, or determination relating to the  assessment of the relevant headwater benefits charge under this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If any owner of a headwater or downstream project requests that  the Commission determine headwater benefits charges for benefits  provided by non-Federal headwater projects, the headwater project owners  must pay a pro rata share of 50 percent of the cost of making the  investigation and determination, in proportion to the benefits provided  by their projects, and the downstream project owners must pay a pro rata  share of the remaining 50 percent in proportion to the energy gains  received by their projects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any charge assessed under this paragraph is separate from and  will be added to, any final or interim charge under this subpart.</p>
