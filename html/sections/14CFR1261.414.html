                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designated NASA officials (see Sec. Sec. 1261.402 and 1261.403)  may compromise claims for money or property arising out of the  activities of the agency where the claim, exclusive of interest,  penalties, and administrative costs, does not exceed $20,000, prior to  the referral of such claims to the General Accounting Office, or to the  Department of Justice for litigation. The Comptroller General may  exercise such compromise authority with respect to claims referred to  the General Accounting Office (GAO) prior to their further referral for  litigation. Only the Comptroller General may effect the compromise of a  claim that arises out of an exception made by the GAO in the account of  an accountable officer, including a claim against the payee, prior to  its referral by the GAO for litigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em>. Claims for which the gross amount is over  $200,000 shall be referred to the Commercial Litigation Branch, Civil  Division, Department of Justice, Washington, DC 20530. Claims for which  the gross original amount is $200,000 or less shall be referred to the  United States Attorney in whose judicial district the debtor can be  found. The referral should specify the reasons for the agency's  recommendation. If NASA has a debtor's firm written offer of compromise  which is substantial in amount and the agency is uncertain as to whether  the offer should be accepted, it may refer the offer, the supporting  data, and particulars concerning the claim to the General Accounting  Office or to the Department of Justice. The General Accounting Office or  the Department of Justice may act upon such an offer or return it to the  agency with instructions or advice. If NASA wishes to reject the  compromise, GAO or Department of Justice approval is not required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A claim may be compromised pursuant to this section if NASA  cannot collect the full amount because of the debtor's inability to pay  the full amount within a reasonable time, or the refusal of the debtor  to pay the claim in full and the Government's inability to enforce  collection in full within a reasonable time by enforced collection  proceedings. In determining the debtor's inability or refusal to pay,  the following factors, among others, may be considered:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Age and health of the debtor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Present and potential income;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Inheritance prospects;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The possibility that assets have been concealed or improperly  transferred by the debtor;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The availability of assets or income which may be realized by  enforced collection proceedings; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The applicable exemptions available to the debtor under State  and Federal law in determining the Government's ability to enforce  collection. Uncertainty as to the price which collateral or other  property will bring at forced sale may properly be considered in  determining the Government's ability to enforce collection. The  compromise should be for an amount which bears a reasonable relation to  the amount which can be recovered by enforced collection procedures,  having regard for the exemptions available to the debtor and the time  which collection will take.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A claim may be compromised if there is a real doubt concerning  the Government's ability to prove its case in court for the full amount  claimed, either because of the legal issues involved or a bona fide  dispute as to the facts. The amount accepted in compromise in such cases  should fairly reflect the probability of prevailing on the legal  question involved, the probabilities with respect to full or partial  recovery of a judgment, paying due regard to the availability of  witnesses and other evidentiary support for the Government claim, and  related pragmatic considerations. In determining the litigative risks  involved, proportionate weight should be given to the probable amount of  court costs and attorney fees pursuant to the Equal Access to Justice  Act which may be assessed against the Government if it is unsuccessful  in litigation. See 28 U.S.C. 2412.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A claim may be compromised if the cost of collecting the claim  does not justify the enforced collection of the full amount. The amount  accepted in compromise in such cases may reflect an appropriate discount  for the administrative and litigative costs of collection, paying heed  to the time which it will take to effect collection. Costs of collecting  may be a substantial factor in the settlement of small claims, but  normally will not carry great weight in the settlement of large   claims. In determining whether the cost of collecting justifies enforced  collection of the full amount, it is legitimate to consider the positive  effect that enforced collection of some claims may have on the  collection of other claims. Since debtors are more likely to pay when  first requested to do so if an agency has a policy of vigorous  collection of all claims, the fact that the cost of collection of any  one claim may exceed the amount of the claim does not necessarily mean  that the claim should be compromised. The practical benefits of vigorous  collection of a small claim may include a demonstration to other debtors  that resistance to payment is not likely to succeed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Enforcement policy. Statutory penalties, forfeitures, or debts  established as an aid to enforcement and to compel compliance may be  compromised pursuant to this part if the agency's enforcement policy in  terms of deterrence and securing compliance, both present and future,  will be adequately served by acceptance of the sum to be agreed upon.  Mere accidental or technical violations may be dealt with less severely  than willful and substantial violations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Compromises payable in installments are to be discouraged.  However, if payment of a compromise by installments is necessary, a  legally enforceable agreement for the reinstatement of the prior  indebtedness less sums paid thereon and acceleration of the balance due  upon default in the payment of any installment should be obtained,  together with security in the manner set forth in Sec. 1261.411, in  every case in which this is possible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the agency's files do not contain reasonably up-to-date  credit information as a basis for assessing a compromise proposal, such  information may be obtained from the individual debtor by obtaining a  statement executed under penalty of perjury showing the debtor's assets  and liabilities, income, and expenses. Forms such as Department of  Justice Form OBD-500 or OBD-500B may be used for this purpose. Similar  data may be obtained from corporate debtors using a form such as  Department of Justice Form OBD-500C or by resort to balance sheets and  such additional data as seems required. Samples of the Department of  Justice forms are available from the Office of the NASA General Counsel.  Neither a percentage of a debtor's profits nor stock in a debtor  corporation will be accepted in compromise of a claim. In negotiating a  compromise with a business concern, consideration should be given to  requiring a waiver of the tax-loss-carry-back rights of the debtor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Joint and several liability. When two or more debtors are  jointly and severally liable, collection action will not be withheld  against one such debtor until the other or others pay their  proportionate shares. NASA will not attempt to allocate the burden of  paying such claims as between the debtors but will proceed to liquidate  the indebtedness as quickly as possible. Care should be taken that a  compromise agreement with one such debtor does not release the agency's  claim against the remaining debtors. The amount of a compromise with one  such debtor shall not be considered a precedent or as morally binding in  determining the amount which will be required from other debtors jointly  and severally liable on the claim.</p>
