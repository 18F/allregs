Project owners  eligible for retroactive payments, as described in Sec. 888.301(c), may  request a one-time Contract Rent determination, to be effective as  described in paragraph (c) of this section. The request for a one-time   rent determination must be made when submitting a request for  retroactive payments, as described in Sec. 888.315. If no claim for  retroactive payments is made, an owner may submit only the request for a  one-time rent determination, provided the owner is eligible for  retroactive payments. The new Contract Rent under this provision will be  the greater of:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Contract Rent currently approved by HUD (or the Contract  Administrator); or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An amount equal to the applicable AAF multipled by the Contract  Rent minus debt service, calculated for each year from October 1, 1979,  to May 31, 1991.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Currently approved rent. The Contract Rent currently approved by  HUD (or the Contract Administrator) is the Contract Rent stated in the  most recent amendment to the HAP Contract signed by both HUD (or the  Contract Administrator) and the owner, or as shown on HUD Form 92458  (Rental Schedule) if the most recent amendment to the HAP Contract  cannot be located.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective date of new Contract Rent. The new Contract Rent,  determined under paragraph (a) of this section, will be effective on May  31, 1991.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  2505-0042)</p>
