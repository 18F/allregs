The check may not exceed the amount of the letter of credit. Each letter of credit must be an original or clearly state on its face that reproductions of the original document may be considered as an original document, and clearly state that requests for payment will be honored at any time they are presented by the selling agency. Selling agents will reject letters of credit with an expiration date. In addition, the minimum criteria required for acceptance of letters of credit are to state clearly that it is a commercial letter of credit (it need not say it is irrevocable, but it cannot say it is revocable); be on bank stationery; state the maximum amount guaranteed; state the name and address of the company or individual submitting the bid; state the sales offering number and opening date; and be signed by the issuer (authorized signature of bank official).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Uncertified personal or company checks in the amount of $25.00 or less when submitted for ancillary charges (e.g., debt payment, storage charge, liquidated damages, interest).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any form of payment received from a NAF instrumentality or a State or local government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Acceptable country currencies and information on exchange rates used must be provided in the sales offering and be incorporated into the sales offering.

Where U.S. dollars are not available, the acceptance of foreign currency is authorized subject to these conditions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Payments exceeding the equivalent of $5,000 U.S. in individual sale transactions (that is, for the total of all items offered in a single sale, not for individual items included in a sale) may be accepted only after obtaining prior approval from the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS). When required, DFAS will submit the requests through the chain of command to DoS and Department of Treasury for approval. In countries where a considerable amount of FEPP may be available for sale and it may be necessary to accept foreign currency, the selling agency will request from DFAS an annual authorization, on a calendar year basis, to accept foreign currency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Payments of up to the equivalent of $5,000 U.S. for individual transactions, at the rate of exchange applicable to the USG, may be accepted without further consultation if assurance has been obtained through the local DoS representative that such currency may be used in payment of any or all USG expenditures in the country whose currency is accepted. This provision is applicable only when annual authorizations have not been received; it is not feasible to sell for U.S. dollars or to ship the property to a country (other than the United States, except where property is a type authorized for return) where it may be sold for U.S. dollars or a freely convertible foreign currency; the currency is not that of a country whose assets in the United States are blocked by Department of Treasury regulations; the currency is that of a country with which the United States maintains diplomatic relations; and foreign currency accepted need not be the currency of the country of sale if the currency offered is otherwise acceptable to DoS and Department of Treasury and can be accepted pursuant to U.S. and host government agreements governing the sale of FEPP. In this connection, the sales offerings will indicate the foreign currencies that will be accepted for a particular sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Transfer of title.

For instance:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Upon removal from the exact location specified in the sales offering.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Upon certification and signature by the government that all required demilitarization has been accomplished in accordance with DoD Instruction 4160.28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> By providing certifications required from the buyer prior to a transfer of title. An SF 97, ``Certificate of Release of a Motor Vehicle,'' (available at http://www.gsa.gov/forms) is required for the sale of vehicles. Selling agencies must provide internal guidance on how the transfer will occur and what documentation is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Defaults. If a purchaser breaches a contract by failure to make payment within the time allowed or by failure to remove the property as required, or breaches other contractual provisions, the purchaser is in default. The selling agency representative will give the purchaser a written notice of default and a period of time to cure the default.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If the purchaser fails to cure the default, the selling agency is entitled to collect or retain liquidated damages as specified in the sales offer or contract.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If a bid deposit was required and the bidder secured the deposit with a deposit bond, the selling agency must issue the notice of default to the bidder and the surety company.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Disputes.

(i) As a rule, selling agencies may accept bids from any person, representative, or agent from any entity. To be considered eligible for award of a sales contract, the bidder must be of legal age and not be debarred, suspended, or indebted to the USG, or from a denied area. Any exceptions must be authorized by the selling agency head, who has determined that there is a compelling reason to make the award.

(A) DLA Disposition Services will electronically report to designated ICPs those assets with valid NSNs meeting dollar value and condition code criteria established by each DoD Component. The notification will be sent electronically to the recorded DoD wholesale manager (ICP or IMM) concurrently with recording the excess in the DLA Disposition Services system for accounting for excess property in DoD. Component IMMs may view the NSNs they requested during the first 5 days of the accumulation period before the items become available to other DoD activities. The ICPs must send their request to:</p><p class="depth0">DLA Disposition Services, Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, 74 North Washington Avenue, Suite 2429, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The DoD ICP or IMM will screen these notifications to determine if needs exist.

HAP allows DoD to make available, prepare, and transport non-lethal, excess DoD property for distribution by DOS for humanitarian reasons. The program is managed by the DSCA Office of Humanitarian Assistance and Demining.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In most instances, property issues will be from DLA Disposition Services inventories. The most commonly requested types of property are medical equipment, field gear, tools, clothing, rations, light vehicles, construction, and engineering equipment. DLA Disposition Services sites will issue all property destined for the HAP, with the exception of drugs and biologicals (Federal Supply Classification Code (FSC) 6505), which may be issued directly by the Military Departments. HAP orders and issues will be documented on DD Form 1348-1A ``Issue Release/Receipt Document.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> LEAs. In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2576a, DLA has established an office to permit civil police authority to acquire excess DoD property, and the Web site https://www.dispositionservices.dla.mil/rtd03/leso/index.shtml provides information to assist with the process. LEAs can contact DLA Disposition Services at:</p><p class="depth0">DLA Disposition Services, Hart-Dole-Inouye Federal Center, 74 North Washington Avenue, Suite 2429, Battle Creek, Michigan 49037, Toll free: 1-877-DLA-CALL, DSN: 61-7766, Commercial/FTS 269-961-7766.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 10 U.S.C. 2576a authorizes the Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy, and DOJ, to transfer excess DoD property, including small arms, light weapons, and ammunition, to federal and State LEAs, including counterdrug and counterterrorism activities. The federal program is known as the 1033 Program. The DLA Disposition Services has managerial responsibilities in support of such transfers and will establish business relationships with participating States by memorandum of agreement (MOA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> LEAs will return sensitive or controlled DEMIL-required property originally ordered from DLA Disposition Services when no longer needed. DEMIL-required equipment that is the responsibility of the LEA must be demilitarized in accordance with DoD 4160.28-M Volumes 1-3. Due to constant changes and development of new technology, Table 4 of this section is only a partial list of NSNs that may contain

radioactive components as identified for Army Navy (AN) night vision equipment codes in DoD 4160.28-M, Volume 2. These NSNs and many others should not be transferred to DLA Disposition Services sites.

The CAP and its members are strictly prohibited from selling, donating, or bartering aircraft obtained from a Military Department under any circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The CAP units will use assigned DoDAACs beginning in ``FG'' to transfer and order excess personal property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> CAP members will identify themselves for pickup of property as stated in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(M)</em> Federal Civilian Agencies (FCAs). (1) These organizations include any non-defense executive agency or any member of the legislative or judicial branch of the government.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The processes discussed in this section apply to FCAs transferring to and ordering excess DoD property from DLA Disposition Services sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> FCAs that want to use DLA Disposition Services for disposition management instead of GSA are required to review and follow instructions provided on the DLA Disposition Services Web site and to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Comply with 31 U.S.C. 1535 (also known as the Economy Act).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Initiate an Economy Act Order with DLA Disposition Services Comptroller for establishing financial transactions. Final acceptance of the Economy Act Order constitutes authority for FCAs to use DLA Disposition Services. The Economy Act Order must be renewed on October 1 of each year. DLA Disposition Services transaction activity billing (TAB) rates, sales rates, and actual disposal rates are used for billing FCAs. TAB rates are available on the DLA Disposition Services Web site. DLA Disposition Services will bill and the FCA will pay all costs for services rendered. Billing documentation will include contract line item number, administrative, and services costs, and will be processed quarterly.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure all laws and regulations are properly met prior to initiating a transfer transaction. Use DoD Instruction 4160.28; 41 CFR chapters 101 and 102; 48 CFR subpart 9.4 and 48 CFR 45.602-1, 52.233-1, and 14.407 of the FAR, current edition; and 5 U.S.C. 552, Volume 11a, Chapter 5 of DoD 7000.14-R, and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-76, ``Performance of Commercial Activities'' (available at http://

Schedule turn-ins with the DLA Disposition Services site and assume responsibility for delivering usable and scrap property to DLA Disposition Services sites. Non-hazardous property may be received in-place using the standard DoD receipt in-place processes. Hazardous property cannot be physically accepted at the DLA Disposition Services site and will be processed in-place only, in accordance with paragraphs (c)(3)(viii)(M)(3)(vi) and (vii) of this section. Property will normally be turned in as individual line items; however, batchlotting by FSC of non-hazardous items with a combined acquisition value of up to $800 is permitted. Identify the transaction by using their officially assigned FCA activity address code (AAC). The first position of the AAC begins with 1 through 9. Annotate ``XP'' funding code in blocks 52 and 53 and a disposal authority code of ``F'' in position 64 of the DTID. Annotate the DLA Disposition Services Economy Act Order Assigned Number in block 27. Include appropriate hazardous property documents containing the required information found in Volume 4 of DoD 4160.21-M. Ensure that no radioactive material, waste, or other excluded hazardous property is turned in to the DLA Disposition Services site. Cover costs associated with substantiated sale contracts claims, if negligence or fault is established. Contact the appropriate DLA Disposition Services site for procedures to use when inventory discrepancies surface for property that the FCA is designated the custodian. The FCA will research and provide a report of the lost, damaged, or destroyed property. Procedures are contained in accordance with Volume 12, Chapter 7 of DoD 7000.14-R.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Work with DLA Disposition Services to obtain HW disposal contract support, pursuant to the provisions of the FAR; for hazardous property, FCAs will define disposal service requirements for HW disposal and provide a yearly estimate of HW streams that may be generated and placed on DLA Disposition Services disposal service contracts; cover costs associated with substantiated contracts claims, if negligence or fault is established; maintain physical custody of hazardous property; provide a designated FCA representative to act as a CO's technical representative during pickup of hazardous property, and identify who

will be trained and authorized to release the property for shipment, including signing shipping documents according to the procedures provided in 49 CFR part 172, subpart H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Comply with the following liability provisions. Should any DLA HW disposal contractors' actions on behalf of the FCA result in a notice of potential liability to DLA or the FCA under 42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq. (also known as the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act), 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq. (also known as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act), or any other provision of federal or State law, immediate notification will be provided to DLA Disposition Services or the FCA. The FCA retains ultimate liability for hazardous property; FCAs will be responsible for environmental response costs attributable to their generated hazardous property. FCA is considered the generator for reporting purposes in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq. and 9601 et seq.; according to the terms of DLA Disposition Services HW disposal contracts, DLA Disposition Services disposal contractors are responsible for spills or leaks during the performance of their contracts, which result from the actions of the contractors' agents or employees; at no time will the DLA Disposition Services site dispose FCA excess DoD property or any provision of a HW contract for FCA property be interpreted or construed to require that funds be obligated or paid in violation of 31 U.S.C. 1341 or any other provisions of law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> FCAs will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Work with DLA Disposition Services for DEMIL-required disposal support in accordance with the provisions of DoD Instruction 4160.28.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reimburse DLA Disposition Services for A/D-related services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Continue to turn in PM-bearing property at no charge in support of the DoD PMRP according to the procedures in Enclosure 5 to DoD Manual 4160.21, Volume 2.

(This will indicate to DLA Disposition Services sites that receipt of excess property from the requesting FCA is authorized.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A provisional copy or signed copy of a DD Form 1348-1A is the instant at which accountability for the FCA property (non-hazardous or hazardous) is transferred to a DLA Disposition Services site.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If at any time any issue requires resolution, a team approach will be used at the turn-in activity and DLA Disposition Services site level. Disputes that cannot be resolved will be elevated to the next corresponding level of the FCA and the DLA Disposition Services. If necessary, alternative dispute resolution will be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> DLA Disposition Services sites will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reserve the right to refuse any turn-in due to workload or resource constraints if support would seriously impair the DLA mission for the DoD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Receive and screen FCA property using the same method used for excess DoD property, except property will not be made available to those special program organizations who, because of enabling legislation, may only obtain excess DoD property; e.g., HAP, law enforcement support offices, and SEAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> Sales proceeds, if any, will be deposited into the U.S. Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, unless otherwise

specified by law. No reimbursement of proceeds will be made to the FCA. Contract claims resulting from the sale of federal property may be the responsibility of the FCA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(10)</em> For hazardous property, DLA Disposition Services will notify FCAs of any:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> New procedures pertaining to the disposal process or funding changes. HW contracts may be modified by mutual written consent of the parties. Modifications requiring resource changes may be given with enough advance notification for revisions or adjustments to be made during the budget formulation process and the hazardous disposal service contract process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Proposed changes to administrative support costs at least 60 days in advance of a change.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(11)</em> DLA Disposition Services will ensure DEMIL-required property and property that may require export controls are processed appropriately. Property requiring DEMIL may be shipped to an alternate location either by DLA Disposition Services or by an FCA. These charges are included in the TAB rates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(12)</em> FCAs desiring to order excess DoD property from DLA Disposition Services sites will follow the GSA procedures for acquiring property through GSAXcess. Once excess DoD property is physically obtained from DLA Disposition Services, the property belongs to and must be disposed by the FCA. This includes property that is DEMIL or mutilation required. Turn-in of previously ordered property from the DLA Disposition Services will be accepted from only those FCAs that have established an Economy Act Order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(13)</em> FCAs may continue to participate in the DoD PMRP at no charge, in accordance with Enclosure 5 to DoD Manual 4160.21, Volume 2. These transactions are accomplished via an ISSA between DLA Disposition Services and FCAs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(O)</em> U.S. Postal Service (USPS). (1) USPS is not authorized to dispose excess DoD property through DLA Disposition Services without an FCA intragovernmental agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If such an agreement is executed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Items of a strictly postal nature, such as a carrier satchel embossed ``U.S. Mail,'' postal scales, or other equipment so similar in nature or design to official USPS equipment as to cause confusion may not be turned in to DLA Disposition Services sites, sold, or disposed to the general public until the USPS has been notified of the intended disposition and offered an opportunity to inspect the equipment. DLA Disposition Services sites will notify local post office inspectors of the existence of this property and arrange for its inspection if the USPS wants to prevent it from falling into the hands of unauthorized persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> DoD purchased or owned postal equipment with official postal identification markings may be transferred to the USPS through DLA Disposition Services site processing, under the standard transfer policies in 41 CFR chapter 101. If transferred from DoD Components without going through an official DLA Disposition Services site, the DoD activity will negotiate with USPS for fair market reimbursement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Property not transferred that contains markings that would tend to confuse this property with official USPS equipment will have the markings removed before release for DLA Disposition Services site processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Excess DoD postal equipment loaned to DoD Components by the USPS will be returned to the USPS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(P)</em> American National Red Cross. Property that was processed or donated by the American National Red Cross to a Military Department and becomes excess DoD property may not be disposed without notice to and consultation with the American National Red Cross. This property will be returned without reimbursement to the American National Red Cross upon request, if that organization pays packing and shipping costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(Q)</em> DoD Computers for Learning (CFL). The DoD CFL program implements Executive Order 12999, ``Educational Technology: Ensuring Opportunity for All Children in the Next Century'' and enables DoD to transfer excess IT equipment to pre-kindergarten through grade 12 schools and educational non-profit organizations through a DLA

Disposition Services Web-based program. The DLA Disposition Services program replaces the DoD Computers for School, Educational Institution Partnership Program that was overseen by the Defense Information Systems Agency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Eligible educational organizations serve pre-kindergarten through grade 12 students and are public, private, or parochial schools or educational nonprofits classified as tax-exempt under section 501c of the United States tax code. Schools and educational nonprofits must be located within the United States and its territories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Schools must register in the DLA Disposition Services Web-based CFL program and complete all point of contact and profile information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Schools must ensure that IT equipment transferred will be used for student and faculty training to augment existing IT equipment, to strengthen their infrastructure, or for other academic-related programs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All costs incurred in connection with the transfer of equipment through the CFL will be the responsibility of the school and include: Expenses in connection with the school's inspection of the IT equipment at DoD sites; cost of packing, crating, marking, and loading the equipment on the carrier's conveyance for transportation; and cost of transportation from DoD sites.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> DoD IT equipment FSG 70 with a DEMIL Code of A and DEMIL Code of Q with an Integrity Code of 6 that is located in CONUS and has been accepted to a DLA Disposition Services site's accountability records is eligible for transfer within DoD CFL once DoD screening is complete and the inventory is not requisitioned by DoD.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> IT equipment is available on an ``as-is'' basis, without warranties from DoD as to the condition of the equipment. Eligible equipment includes mainframes, minicomputers, microcomputers, modems, disk drives, printers, and items that are defined within the FSG 70 and are appropriate for use in CFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> After the DoD excess screening is completed, providing there are no DoD requests, DLA Disposition Services will:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Make provisions for schools to receive information concerning DoD IT equipment that is available for transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Notify the schools of available equipment that matches the profile submitted by the school.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> ``Freeze'' the equipment when the school verifies a need so that other schools cannot be offered the same equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Review, approve, and notify generating activities to transfer to a school by generating a MRO from DLA Disposition Services system for accounting for excess surplus property in DoD to decrement quantity and preclude transmission to the FEDS.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> While holding for transfer to schools, the following applies: 7-day accumulation (DoD can order anytime) and 14-day DoD screening (DoD can order anytime).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> On day 14, if still available, DLA Disposition Services will freeze the property and create a MILSTRIP initiating a transfer to school transaction. DLA Disposition Services will send MILSTRIP to the generating activity, who will arrange for the school to remove the item. Schools authorized a transfer are responsible for arranging the pickup or shipping of IT equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> The IT equipment not designated to schools during the DoD CFL timeframe will be transmitted to GSAXcess for FCAs and donees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Generating activities can specify a school for intended transfer once DLA Disposition Services has accountability of the equipment, through the DLA Disposition Services Web-based CFL program. From the DLA Disposition Services Home Page, the user may click on Property Search for Military, Federal, State, and Special Programs, then click on ``Computers for Learning.'' The CFL Program enables the generating activity to view the IT equipment that was turned in under their DoDAAC and then designate that equipment to approved schools. The generating activity has 7 days to make this selection; otherwise, the equipment can be viewed by any eligible educational activity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Equipment not identified by a generating activity for a specific

school will be made available to schools and educational non-profit organizations that are approved within CFL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> The authorized school is responsible for coordinating with the generating activity for the removal of equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> The authorized school has 14 days after receipt of authorization to remove the equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> If the school does not remove the equipment within the 14 days, the generating activity will notify the DLA Disposition Services site of the non-removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> Upon receipt of notification, the DLA Disposition Services site will notify DLA Disposition Services to cancel the order.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(R)</em> Firefighter Transfer Program. The DoD has authorized the U.S. Department of Agriculture Forestry Service (USDA FS) to manage DoD firefighting property transfers provided for in accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2576b. Title to all Firefighter Property Transfer Program property will pass to the State upon:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State taking possession of the equipment (such as removing or having the equipment removed from a DLA Disposition Services site).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The State receiving a DD 1348, ``DoD Single Line Item Requisition System Document (Manual),'' or SF 97 or both for the equipment. The DD Form 1348 or SF 97 will indicate which property requires DEMIL (DEMIL Codes C, D, and F).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The USDA FS will track all equipment requiring DEMIL until final disposition and require the State to ensure that such equipment is either transferred to another DoD agency authorized to receive it or is returned to a DLA Disposition Services site when no longer required. USDA FS will require the State coordinate any such transfers and returns with the Distribution Reutilization Policy Directorate at DLA prior to the transfer. The recipients are responsible for funding shipment or removal.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Expedited processing (EP). (A) EP is the approved reduction of screening timeframes.
