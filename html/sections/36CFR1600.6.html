                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Foundation shall make requested records available to the public to the greatest extent possible in keeping with the FOIA, except that the following records are exempt from the disclosure requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Records specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and which are, in fact, properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Records related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of the Foundation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than 5 U.S.C. 552(b)), provided that such statute requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue or that the statute establishes particular criteria for withholding information or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld. An example that applies to the Foundation is the confidentiality protection for dispute resolution communications provided by the Administrative Dispute Resolution Act of 1996 (ADRA, 5 U.S.C. 571-574).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Records containing trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Interagency or intra-agency memoranda or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the Foundation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and in the case of a recorded or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Records contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Geological or geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If a requested record contains exempted material along with nonexempted material, all reasonable segregable nonexempt material shall be disclosed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Even if an exemption described in paragraph (a) of this section may be reasonably applicable to a requested record, or portion thereof, the Foundation may elect under the circumstances of any particular request not to apply the exemption to such requested record, or portion thereof, subject to the provisions in Sec. 1600.7 for confidential commercial information. The fact that the exemption is not applied by the Foundation to any requested

record, or portion thereof, has no precedential significance as to the application or non-application of the exemption to any other requested record, or portion thereof, no matter when the request is received.</p>
