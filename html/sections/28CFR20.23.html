                            <p class="depth0">Within 90 days of the receipt of the plan, OJARS shall approve or disapprove the adequacy of the provisions of the plan and certification. Evaluation of the plan by OJARS will be based upon whether the procedures set forth will accomplish the required objectives. The evaluation of the certification(s) will be based upon whether a good faith effort has been shown to initiate and/or further compliance with the plan and regulations. All procedures in the approved plan must be fully operational and implemented by March 1, 1978. A final certification shall be submitted on March 1, 1978.
Where a State finds it is unable to provide final certification that all required procedures as set forth in Sec.  20.21 will be operational by March 1, 1978, a further extension of the deadline will be granted by OJARS upon a showing that the State has made a good faith effort to implement these regulations to the maximum extent feasible. Documentation justifying the request for the extension including a proposed timetable for full compliance must be submitted to OJARS by March 1, 1978. Where a State submits a request for an extension, the implementation date will be extended an additional 90 days while OJARS reviews the documentation for approval or disapproval. To be approved, such revised schedule must be consistent with the timetable and procedures set out below:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> July 31, 1978--Submission of certificate of compliance with:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Individual access, challenge, and review requirements;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administrative security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Physical security to the maximum extent feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Thirty days after the end of a State's next legislative session--Submission to OJARS of a description of State policy on dissemination of criminal history record information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Six months after the end of a State's legislative session--Submission to OJARS of a brief and concise description of standards and operating procedures to be followed by all criminal justice agencies covered by OJARS regulations in complying with the State policy on dissemination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Eighteen months after the end of a State's legislative session--Submission to OJARS of a certificate attesting to the conduct of an audit of the State central repository and of a random number of other criminal justice agencies in compliance with OJARS regulations.
