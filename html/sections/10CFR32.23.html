The probabilities have been expressed in general terms to  emphasize the approximate nature of the estimates which are to be made.  The following values may be used as guides in estimating compliance with  the criteria:</p><p class="depth2">Low--not more than one such failure per year for each 10,000 exempt  units distributed.</p><p class="depth2">Negligible--not more than one such failure per year for each 1  million exempt units distributed.
