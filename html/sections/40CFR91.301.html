                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This subpart describes the equipment required in order to  perform exhaust emission tests on new marine gasoline-fueled spark- ignition propulsion engines subject to the provisions of subpart A of  this part 91.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Exhaust gases are sampled while the test engine is operated  using a steady state test cycle on an engine dynamometer. Exhaust gas  sampling may be performed using either the raw gas sampling method or  the constant volume sampling (CVS) method. The exhaust gases receive  specific component analysis determining concentration of pollutant,  exhaust volume, the fuel flow, and the power output during each mode.  Emissions are reported on a gram per brake-kilowatt hour (g/kW-hr). See  subpart E of this part for a complete description of the test procedure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Additional information about system design, calibration  methodologies, and so forth, for raw gas sampling can be found in 40 CFR  part 1065. Examples for system design, calibration methodologies, and so  forth, for dilute sampling can be found in 40 CFR part 1065.  [61 FR 52102, Oct. 4, 1996, as amended at 70 FR 40451, July 13, 2005]</p>
