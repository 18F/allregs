                                Sec. 301.89-16  Compensation for grain storage facilities, flour millers, equipment owners or lessees for the 1999-2000 and subsequent crop seasons.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Owners of grain storage facilities, flour millers, and participants  in the National Karnal Bunt Survey are eligible to receive compensation  from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) for the 1999- 2000and subsequent crop seasons to mitigate   losses or expenses incurred because of the Karnal bunt regulations and  emergency actions, as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Decontamination of grain storage facilities. Owners of grain  storage facilities that are in States where the Secretary has declared  an extraordinary emergency, and who have decontaminated their grain  storage facilities pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification  (PPQ Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector  ordering decontamination of the facilities, are eligible to be  compensated, on a one time only basis for each facility for each covered  crop year wheat, for up to 50 percent of the direct cost of  decontamination. However, compensation will not exceed $20,000 per grain  storage facility (as defined in Sec. 301.89-1). General clean-up,  repair, and refurbishment costs are excluded from compensation.  Compensation payments will be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation,  the owner of the grain storage facility must submit to an inspector  records demonstrating that decontamination was performed on all  structures, conveyances, or materials ordered by APHIS to be  decontaminated. The records must include a copy of the Emergency Action  Notification or the letter from an inspector ordering decontamination,  contracts with individuals or companies hired to perform the  decontamination, receipts for equipment and materials purchased to  perform the decontamination, time sheets for employees of the grain  storage facility who performed activities connected to the  decontamination, and any other documentation that helps show the cost to  the owner and that decontamination has been completed. Claims for  compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on  or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001  crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year following  that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines upon  written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen  circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting  compensation on or before these dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Flour millers. Flour millers who, in accordance with a  compliance agreement with APHIS, heat treat millfeed that is required by  APHIS to be heat treated are eligible to be compensated at the rate of  $35.00 per short ton of millfeed. The amount of millfeed compensated  will be calculated by multiplying the weight of wheat from the regulated  area received by the miller by 25 percent (the average percent of  millfeed derived from a short ton of grain). Compensation payments will  be issued by APHIS. To claim compensation, the miller must submit to an  inspector verification as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the  wheat (such as a copy of a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill  of lading for the wheat, if the actual weight appears on those  documents, or other verification). Flour millers must also submit  verification that the millfeed was heat treated (such as a copy of the  limited permit under which the wheat was moved to a treatment facility  and a copy of the bill of lading accompanying that movement; or a copy  of PPQ Form 700 (which includes certification of processing) signed by  the inspector who monitors the mill). Claims for compensation for the  1999-2000 crop season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4,  2001. Claims for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond  must be received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The  Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in  specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that  prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before  these dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National Karnal Bunt Survey participants. If a grain storage  facility participating in the National Karnal Bunt Survey tests positive  for Karnal bunt, the facility will be regulated, and may be ordered  decontaminated, pursuant to either an Emergency Action Notification (PPQ  Form 523) issued by an inspector or a letter issued by an inspector  ordering decontamination of the facility. If the Secretary has declared  an extraordinary emergency in the State in which the grain storage  facility is located, the owner will be eligible for compensation as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loss in value of positive wheat. The owner of the grain storage  facility will   be compensated for the loss in value of positive wheat. Compensation  will equal the estimated market price for the relevant class of wheat  minus the actual price received for the wheat. The estimated market  price will be calculated by APHIS for each class of wheat, taking into  account the prices offered by relevant terminal markets (animal feed,  milling, or export) during the relevant time period for that facility,  with adjustments for transportation and other handling costs. However,  compensation will not exceed $1.80 per bushel under any circumstances.  Compensation payments for loss in value of wheat will be issued by the  Farm Service Agency (FSA). To claim compensation, the owner of the  facility must submit to the local FSA office a Karnal Bunt Compensation  Claim form, provided by FSA. The owner of the facility must also submit  to FSA a copy of the Emergency Action Notification or letter from an  inspector under which the facility is or was quarantined; verification  as to the actual (not estimated) weight of the wheat (such as a copy of  a facility weigh ticket or a copy of the bill of lading for the wheat,  if the actual weight appears on those documents, or other verification);  and a copy of the receipt for the final sale of the wheat, showing the  total bushels sold and the total price received by the owner of the  grain storage facility. Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop  season must be received by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims  for compensation for the 2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be  received by March 1 of the year following that crop season. The  Administrator may extend these deadlines upon written request in  specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen circumstances occur that  prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting compensation on or before  these dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Decontamination of grain storage facilities. The owner of the  facility will be compensated on a one time only basis for each grain  storage facility for each covered crop year wheat for the direct costs  of decontamination of the facility at the same rate described under  paragraph (a) of this section (up to 50 per cent of the direct costs of  decontamination, not to exceed $20,000 per grain storage facility).  Compensation payments for decontamination of grain storage facilities  will be issued by APHIS, and claims for compensation must be submitted  in accordance with the provisions in paragraph (a) of this section.  Claims for compensation for the 1999-2000 crop season must be received  by APHIS on or before December 4, 2001. Claims for compensation for the  2000-2001 crop season and beyond must be received by March 1 of the year  following that crop season. The Administrator may extend these deadlines  upon written request in specific cases, when unusual and unforeseen  circumstances occur that prevent or hinder a claimant from requesting  compensation on or before these dates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> will be issued by  APHIS. Claims for compensation should be sent to Plant Protection and  Quarantine, APHIS, USDA, 304 West Main Street, Olney, TX 76374.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Custom harvesters. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cleaning and disinfection of mechanized  harvesting equipment. Custom harvesters who harvested host crops that an  inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown  in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000- 2001 crop season are eligible to receive compensation for the cost of  cleaning and disinfecting their mechanized harvesting equipment as  required by Sec. 301.89-12(a). Compensation for the cost of cleaning  and disinfection mechanized harvesting equipment used to harvest Karnal  bunt-infected host crops will be either   the actual cost or $750 per cleaned machine, whichever is less. To claim  compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or  other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton,  or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior  to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or  an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement  to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the  2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a  regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the  custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540  certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting  equipment from a regulated area after it had been used to harvest host  crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and  had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and a receipt showing the  cost of the cleaning and disinfection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Contracts lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Custom  harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be  infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor,  Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season  are also eligible to be compensated for the revenue lost if they lost  one contract due to downtime necessitated by cleaning and disinfection,  if the contract to harvest Karnal bunt-infected host crops in a  previously nonregulated area was signed before the area was declared a  regulated area for Karnal bunt. Compensation will only be provided for  one contract lost due to cleaning and disinfection. Compensation for any  contract that was lost due to cleaning and disinfection will be either  the full value of the contract or $23.48 for each acre that was to have  been harvested under the contract, whichever is less. To claim  compensation, a custom harvester must provide copies of a contract or  other signed agreement for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton,  or Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season, signed on a date prior  to the designation of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, or  an affidavit stating that the custom harvester entered into an agreement  to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during the  2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation of the county as a  regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the customer with whom the  custom harvester entered into the agreement; a copy of the PPQ-540  certificate issued to allow the movement of mechanized harvesting  equipment from a regulated area after it has been used to harvest host  crops that an inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt and  had been subsequently cleaned and disinfected; and the contract for  harvesting in an area not regulated for Karnal bunt that had been lost  due to time lost to cleaning and disinfecting harvesting equipment,  signed on a date prior to the designation of the relevant county as a  regulated area for Karnal bunt, for which the custom harvester will  receive compensation, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester  entered into an agreement to harvest in an area not regulated for Karnal  bunt prior to the designation of the county as a regulated area for  Karnal bunt and stating the number of acres that were to have been  harvested and the amount the custom harvester was to have been paid  under the agreement, signed by the customer with whom the custom  harvester entered into the agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Fixed costs incurred during cleaning and disinfection. Custom  harvesters who harvested host crops that an inspector determined to be  infected with Karnal bunt and that were grown in Archer, Baylor,  Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season  who do not apply for compensation for a contract lost due to cleaning  and disinfection as described in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section  are eligible for compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning  and disinfection. Compensation for fixed costs incurred during cleaning  and disinfection will be $2,000. To claim compensation, a custom  harvester must provide copies of a contract or other signed agreement  for harvesting in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or Young County during  the 2000-2001 crop season,   signed on a date prior to the designation of the county as a regulated  area for Karnal bunt, or an affidavit stating that the custom harvester  entered into an agreement to harvest in Archer, Baylor, Throckmorton, or  Young County during the 2000-2001 crop season prior to the designation  of the county as a regulated area for Karnal bunt, signed by the  customer with whom the custom harvester entered into the agreement; and  a copy of the PPQ-540 certificate issued to allow the movement of  mechanized harvesting equipment from a regulated area after it has been  used to harvest host crops that an inspector determined to be infected  with Karnal bunt and has been subsequently cleaned and disinfected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other equipment; cleaning and disinfection. Owners or lessees of  equipment other than mechanized harvesting equipment and seed  conditioning equipment that came into contact with host crops that an  inspector determined to be infected with Karnal bunt in Archer, Baylor,  Throckmorton, or Young Counties, TX, during the 2000-2001 crop season  and that was required by an inspector to be cleaned and disinfected are  eligible for compensation for the cost of cleaning and disinfection.  Compensation for the cleaning and disinfection of such equipment will be  $100.
