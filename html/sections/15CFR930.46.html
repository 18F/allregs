                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For proposed Federal agency activities that were previously determined by the State agency to be consistent with the management program, but which have not yet begun, Federal agencies shall further coordinate with the State agency and prepare a supplemental consistency determination if the proposed activity will affect any coastal use or resource substantially different than originally described. Substantially different coastal effects are reasonably foreseeable if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Federal agency makes substantial changes in the proposed activity that are relevant to management program enforceable policies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are significant new circumstances or information relevant to the proposed activity and the proposed activity's effect on any coastal use or resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substantial changes were made to the activity during the period of the State agency's initial review and the State agency did not receive notice of the substantial changes during its review period, and these changes are relevant to management program enforceable policies and/or affect coastal uses or resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The State agency may notify the Federal agency and the Director of proposed activities which the State agency believes should be subject to supplemental coordination. The State agency's notification shall include information supporting a finding of substantially different coastal effects than originally described and the relevant enforceable policies, and may recommend modifications to the proposed activity (if any) that would allow the Federal agency to implement the proposed activity consistent with the enforceable policies of the management program. State agency notification under this paragraph (b) does not remove the requirement under paragraph (a) of this section for Federal agencies to notify State agencies.
