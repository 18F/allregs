In the case of partitioning, applicants and licensees must file FCC Form 603 pursuant to section 1.948 and list the partitioned service area on a schedule to the application. The geographic coordinates must be specified in degrees, minutes, and seconds to the nearest second of latitude and longitude and must be based upon the 1983 North American Datum (NAD83).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partitioning.

The Commission will consider requests for partial assignment of licenses that propose combinations of partitioning and disaggregation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Signal levels. For purposes of partitioning and disaggregation, part 27 systems must be designed so as not to exceed the signal level specified for the particular spectrum block in Sec. 27.55 at the licensee's service area boundary, unless the affected adjacent service area licensees have agreed to a different signal level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> License term. The license term for a partitioned license area and for disaggregated spectrum shall be the remainder of the original licensee's license term as provided for in Sec. 27.13.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Compliance with construction requirements--(1) Partitioning.

Parties to partitioning agreements have two options for satisfying the construction requirements set forth in Sec. 27.14. Under the first option, the partitioner and partitionee each certifies that it will independently satisfy the substantial service requirement for its respective partitioned area. If a licensee subsequently fails to meet its substantial service requirement, its license will be subject to automatic cancellation without further Commission action. Under the second option, the partitioner certifies that it has met or will meet the substantial service requirement for the entire, pre-partitioned geographic service area. If the partitioner subsequently fails to meet its substantial service requirement, only its license will be subject to automatic cancellation without further Commission action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Partitioning.
