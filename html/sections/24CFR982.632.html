                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The PHA may establish requirements for financing purchase of a home to be assisted under the homeownership option. Such PHA requirements may include requirements concerning qualification of lenders (for example, prohibition of seller financing or case-by-case approval of seller financing), or concerning terms of financing (for example, a prohibition of balloon payment mortgages, establishment of a minimum homeowner equity requirement from personal resources, or provisions required to protect borrowers against high cost loans or predatory loans). A PHA may not require that families acquire financing from one or more specified lenders, thereby restricting the family's ability to secure favorable financing terms.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the purchase of the home is financed with FHA mortgage insurance, such financing is subject to FHA mortgage insurance requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The PHA may establish requirements or other restrictions concerning debt secured by the home.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The PHA may review lender qualifications and the loan terms before authorizing homeownership assistance. The PHA may disapprove proposed financing, refinancing or other debt if the PHA determines that the debt is unaffordable, or if the PHA determines that the lender or the loan terms do not meet PHA qualifications. In making this determination, the PHA may take into account other family expenses, such as child care, unreimbursed medical expenses, homeownership expenses, and other family expenses as determined by the PHA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> All PHA financing or affordability requirements must be described in the PHA administrative plan.
