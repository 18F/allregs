                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Swap transaction and pricing information shall be reported to a registered swap data repository so that the registered swap data repository can publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in real-time in accordance with this part, including the manner described in this section and appendix A to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Public dissemination of data fields. Any registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall publicly disseminate the information described in appendix A to this part, as applicable, for any publicly reportable swap transaction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Additional swap information. A registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time may require reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities and designated contract markets to report to such registered swap data repository, such information that is necessary to compare the swap transaction and pricing data that was publicly disseminated in real-time to the data reported to a registered swap data repository pursuant to Section 2(a)(13)(G) of the Act or to confirm that parties to a swap have reported in a timely manner pursuant to Sec.  43.3 of this part. Such additional information shall not be publicly disseminated by the registered swap data repository.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Anonymity of the parties to a publicly reportable swap transaction--(1) In general. Swap transaction and pricing data that is publicly disseminated in real-time shall not disclose the identities of the parties to the swap or otherwise facilitate the identification of a party to a swap. A registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates swap transaction and pricing data in real-time shall not publicly disseminate such data in a manner that discloses or otherwise facilitates the identification of a party to a swap.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Actual product description reported to registered swap data repository. Reporting parties, registered swap execution facilities and designated contract

markets shall provide a registered swap data repository with swap transaction and pricing data that includes an actual description of the underlying asset(s). This requirement is separate from the requirement that a reporting party, registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall report swap data to a registered swap data repository pursuant to Section 2(a)(13)(G) of the Act and the Commission's regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Public dissemination of the actual description of underlying asset(s). Notwithstanding the anonymity protection for certain swaps in the other commodity asset class in Sec.  43.4(d)(4)(ii), a registered swap data repository shall publicly disseminate the actual underlying asset(s) of all publicly reportable swap transactions in the interest rate, credit, equity and foreign exchange asset classes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Public dissemination of the underlying asset(s) for certain swaps in the other commodity asset class. A registered swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data in the other commodity asset class as described in this subsection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A registered swap data repository shall publicly disseminate swap transaction and pricing data for publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class in the manner described in paragraphs (d)(4)(ii) and (d)(4)(iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual underlying asset(s) shall be publicly disseminated for the following publicly reportable swap transactions in the other commodity asset class:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any publicly reportable swap transaction that references one of the contracts described in appendix B to this part;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any publicly reportable swap transaction that is economically related to one of the contracts described in appendix B of this part; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The underlying assets of swaps in the other commodity asset class that are not described in paragraph (d)(4)(ii) of this section shall be publicly disseminated by limiting the geographic detail of the underlying assets. The identification of any specific delivery point or pricing point associated with the underlying asset of such other commodity swap shall be publicly disseminated pursuant to appendix E of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Any publicly reportable swap transaction executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Unique product identifier. If a unique product identifier is developed that sufficiently describes one or more of the swap transaction and pricing data fields for real-time reporting described in appendix A to this part, then such unique product identifier may be publicly disseminated in lieu of the data fields that it describes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Reporting of notional or principal amounts to a registered swap data repository--(1) Off-facility swaps. The reporting party shall report the actual notional or principal amount of any off-facility swap to a registered swap data repository that accepts and publicly disseminates such data pursuant to part 43.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market. (i) A registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall transmit the actual notional or principal amount for all swaps executed on or pursuant to the rules of such registered swap execution facility or designated contract market, to a registered swap data repository that accepts swaps in the asset class.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual notional or principal amount for any block trade executed pursuant to the rules of a registered swap execution facility or designated contract market shall be reported to the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market pursuant to the rules of the registered swap execution facility or designated contract market.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Public dissemination of rounded notional or principal amounts. The notional or principal amount of a publicly reportable swap transaction, as described in appendix A to this part, shall be rounded and publicly disseminated by a registered swap data repository as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than one thousand, round to nearest five, but in no case

shall a publicly disseminated notional or principal amount be less than five;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than ten thousand but equal to or greater than one thousand, round to nearest one hundred;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 thousand but equal to or greater than ten thousand, round to nearest one thousand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than one million but equal to or greater than 100 thousand, round to nearest ten thousand;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 million but equal to or greater than one million, round to the nearest one million;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than 500 million but equal to or greater than 100 million, round to the nearest ten million;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than one billion but equal to or greater than 500 million, round to the nearest 50 million;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> If the notional or principal amount is less than 100 billion but equal to or greater than one billion, round to the nearest one billion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(9)</em> If the notional or principal amount is greater than 100 billion, round to the nearest 50 billion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Cap sizes--(1) Initial cap sizes. Prior to the effective date of a Commission determination to establish an applicable post-initial cap size for a swap category as determined pursuant to paragraph (h)(2) of this section, the initial cap sizes for each swap category shall be equal to the greater of the initial appropriate minimum block size for the respective swap category in appendix F of this part or the respective cap sizes in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section. If appendix F of this part does not provide an initial appropriate minimum block size for a particular swap category, the initial cap size for such swap category shall be equal to the appropriate cap size as set forth in paragraphs (h)(1)(i) through (h)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For swaps in the interest rate asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> USD 250 million for swaps with a tenor greater than zero up to and including two years;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> USD 100 million for swaps with a tenor greater than two years up to and including ten years; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> USD 75 million for swaps with a tenor greater than ten years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For swaps in the credit asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be USD 100 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> For swaps in the equity asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be USD 250 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> For swaps in the foreign exchange asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be USD 250 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For swaps in the other commodity asset class, the publicly disseminated notional or principal amount for a swap subject to the rules in this part shall be USD 25 million.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Post-initial cap sizes. Pursuant to the process described in Sec.  43.6(f)(1), the Commission shall establish post-initial cap sizes using reliable data collected by registered swap data repositories, as determined by the Commission, based on the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A one-year window of swap transaction and pricing data corresponding to each relevant swap category recalculated no less than once each calendar year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The 75-percent notional amount calculation described in Sec.  43.6(c)(3) applied to the swap transaction and pricing data described in paragraph (h)(2)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Commission publication of post-initial cap sizes. The Commission shall publish post-initial cap sizes on its Web site at http://www.cftc.gov.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Effective date of post-initial cap sizes. Unless otherwise indicated on the Commission's Web site, the post-initial cap sizes shall be effective on the first day of the second month following the date of publication.
