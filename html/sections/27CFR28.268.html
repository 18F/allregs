                            <p class="depth0">Where liquors are withdrawn or removed for use on vessels or  aircraft, the exporter shall procure and forward to the appropriate TTB  officer, a receipt executed under the penalties of perjury by the master  or other authorized officer of the vessel, steamship company, or  airline, as the case may be. The receipt shall give the number of  containers, the serial numbers of the containers (if any), and the  quantity received, and shall show that the liquors are in customs  custody and have been or will be laden on board the vessel or aircraft,  that they will be lawfully used on board the vessel or aircraft, and  that no portion of the shipment has been or will be unladen in the  United States or any of its territories or possessions. A receipt is not  required, in the case of any shipment for use on vessels, when the  liquors are laden on vessels of war, or, in cases other than supplies  for vessels employed in the fisheries, where the amount of the tax on  the liquors does not exceed $200. In the case of supplies for vessels  employed in the fisheries, compliance with the provisions of Sec. 28.22  is also required.
