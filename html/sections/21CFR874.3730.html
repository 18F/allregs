A laryngeal prosthesis (Taub design) is a device  intended to direct pulmonary air flow to the pharynx in the absence of  the larynx, thereby permitting esophageal speech. The device is  interposed between openings in the trachea and the esophagus and may be  removed and replaced each day by the patient. During phonation, air from  the lungs is directed to flow through the device and over the esophageal  mucosa to provide a sound source that is articulated as speech.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classification.
