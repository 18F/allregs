                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To make proper determinations of an employee's entitlement to  benefits, OWCP may verify the earnings reported by the employee through  a variety of means, including but not limited to computer matches with  the Office of Personnel Management and inquiries to the Social Security  Administration. Also, OWCP may perform computer matches with records of  State agencies, including but not limited to workers' compensation  administrations, to determine whether private employers are paying  workers' compensation insurance premiums for recipients of benefits  under the FECA.</p>
