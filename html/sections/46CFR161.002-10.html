                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The fire detecting system control unit shall consist of  a dripproof enclosed panel containing visible and audible fire alarm  signalling devices, visible and audible trouble alarm signalling  devices, visible and audible power failure alarm devices, power supply  transfer switch, charging equipment when employed, and overcurrent  protection for power supplies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Fire alarms--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. The operation of a fire detecting and  alarm system must cause automatically--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The sounding of a vibrating type fire bell with a gong diameter  not smaller than 15 cm (6 inches) or other   audible alarm that has an equivalent sound level and that is mounted at  the control unit and at the remote annunciator panel, when provided;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The sounding of a vibrating type fire bell with a gong diameter  not smaller than 20 cm (8 inches) or other audible alarm that has an  equivalent sound level and that is located in the engine room; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> an indication of the fire detecting zone from which the signal  originated, visible at the control unit and at the remote annunciator  panel, when provided;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintaining alarm. The audible and visible alarms resulting from  the operation of a fire detector having self-restoring contacts shall be  maintained automatically by the control unit until a resetting device is  operated manually.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Silencing audible alarm. Manual means shall be provided at the  control unit to silence the audible fire alarms, but operation of the  audible fire alarm device shall permit the visible fire alarm to remain  until manually reset as described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Non-interference. The control unit shall be so arranged as to  permit one or any number of fire alarms simultaneously, and an alarm on  one circuit shall not interfere with the normal operation of any other  circuit, except that the audible fire alarms, when silenced by the means  provided by paragraph (b)(3) of this section, need not sound upon  receipt of succeeding sensor signals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Source of energy. The source of energy for the alarms referred  to in this paragraph shall be the ``normal source''. On a system  supplied by duplicate storage batteries, the ``normal source'' shall be  construed to mean that part of the supply circuit on the load side of  the battery transfer switch and fuses. On a system supplied by a branch  circuit the ``normal source'' shall be construed to mean the load side  of any transformer or rectifier employed to modify the nature or  magnitude of the supply potential.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Electrical supervision--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circuits. The circuits formed by  conductors extending from the control unit to the fire detectors of each  zone shall be electrically supervised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Normal source. The normal source of energy to the control unit  shall be electrically supervised.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Audible fire alarms. The engine room audible fire alarm shall be  electrically supervised.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Power failure alarms--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Loss of potential. The loss of  potential from a supervised normal source of energy automatically shall  be indicated at the control unit by the sounding of an audible power  failure alarm. The source of energy for the alarm shall be the emergency  power source. The source of energy for the alarm of a system supplied by  duplicate storage batteries shall be the storage battery being charged.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Silencing audible alarm. Means shall be provided at the control  unit to silence the audible power failure alarm by transferring the  signal to a visible indicator which shall remain until the silencing  means is restored to its normal position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Trouble alarms--(1) Open Circuit. An open circuit occurring in  either supervised circuit covered by paragraph (c) </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> or (3) of this  section shall automatically be indicated at the control unit by the  sounding of an audible trouble alarm and by a visual indicator showing  the circuit or zone from which the signal originated except that on  systems employing closed-circuit series connected detectors, an open  circuit in the zone wiring may cause a fire alarm.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Silencing audible alarm. Manual means shall be provided at the  control unit to silence the audible alarm. Operation of the silencing  means shall permit the visible alarm to remain until the trouble has  been corrected.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Non-interference. The control unit shall be so arranged as to  permit one or any number of trouble alarms simultaneously, and an alarm  on one circuit shall not interfere with the normal operation of any  other circuit, except that the audible trouble alarm, when silenced by  the means provided by paragraph (e)(2) of this section, need not sound  on receipt of succeeding trouble signals.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Source of energy. The source of energy for the trouble alarms  required by   this paragraph shall be the normal source as defined in paragraph (b)(5)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Circuit testing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fire alarm and trouble alarm test. Means  shall be provided at the control unit for individually testing each fire  detecting zone circuit. The testing means shall be capable of simulating  a fire condition and a trouble condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ground test. Means shall be provided at the control unit for  manual testing of each individual fire detecting zone circuit for the  presence of grounds. Systems whose normal source of supply is derived  from a circuit from the ship's alternating-current temporary emergency  bus shall be provided with a two-winding transformer in the supply  circuit and located in the control unit to isolate electrically the fire  detecting system from the ship's electrical system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Power supply transfer switch. An automatic transfer switch with  no ``off'' position shall be provided in the control unit for selecting  the source of power, except that systems employing duplicate storage  batteries may be provided with a manual transfer switch.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Automatic transfer switch. Upon reduction of potential from the  normal power source of 15 to 20 percent, the automatic fire detection  system shall automatically be disconnected from the normal source and  connected to the emergency source. Upon restoration of potential from  the normal source of 85 to 95 percent of normal values, the automatic  fire detection system shall automatically be transferred back to normal  source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Manual transfer switch. Automatic fire detecting systems  employing duplicate storage batteries as the power supplies shall be  provided with a manual transfer switch with no ``off'' position to  select the battery to supply the system and the battery to be charged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Automatic fire detecting system, battery charging and control-- </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. Automatic fire detecting systems employing duplicate  storage batteries as the power supply shall be provided with battery  charging and control facilities as specified by this paragraph.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Voltmeter and voltmeter switch. A voltmeter and a voltmeter  switch shall be provided at the control unit and connected to read (i)  voltage of battery supplying system and (ii) voltage of battery on  charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ammeter. An ammeter shall be provided to indicate the charging  current to the battery on charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Reverse current protection. An undervoltage or reverse current  relay shall be provided to disconnect the battery on charge from the  charging source in the event of loss of potential from the charging  source unless reverse current flow is effectively blocked by a  rectifier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Resistors. Fixed and variable resistors shall be provided to  regulate the charging rate, together with a two-position switch to  select between a normal charging rate and a high charging rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Overcurrent protection. The batteries shall be protected against  overcurrent by fuses rated at not less than 150 percent and not more  than 200 percent of the maximum normal battery load.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Location. The equipment required by this paragraph shall be  located in or adjacent to the control unit.
