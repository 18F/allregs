                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Quassin is the bitter principle of quassia wood (occurring as a mixture of two isomeric forms). It shall be a good commercial grade of purified amorphous quassin, standardized as to bitterness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bitterness. An aqueous solution of quassin shall be distinctly bitter at a 1 to 250,000 dilution. To test: Dissolve 0.1 gram of quassin in 100 ml of 95 percent alcohol, then dilute 4 ml of the solution to 1,000 ml with distilled water, mix well and taste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Identification test. Dissolve about 0.5 gram of quassin in 10 ml of 95 percent alcohol and filter. To 5 ml of the

filtrate, add 5 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 mg of phloroglucinol and mix well. A red color develops.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Optical assay. When 1 gram of quassin (in solution in a small amount of 95 percent alcohol) is dissolved in 10,000 ml of water, the absorbance of the solution in a 1 cm cell at a wavelength of 258 millimicrons shall not be less than 0.400.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Solubility. When 0.5 gram of quassin is added to 25 ml of 190 proof alcohol, it shall dissolve completely.
