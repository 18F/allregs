The loan quantity  for the warehouse-stored loan cannot exceed 110 percent of the loan  quantity transferred from the farm-stored loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any amounts due the producer shall be disbursed by the FSA  county service center.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon request by the producer before the transfer, the county  committee may approve the transfer of a warehouse-stored loan or part  thereof to a farm-stored loan at any time during the marketing  assistance loan period. Quantities pledged as collateral for a farm- stored loan shall be based on a measurement or a calculation of average  production of wool and mohair, such measurement or calculation to be  made by a representative of the county office before approving the farm- stored loan. The producer must immediately repay the amount by which the  farm-stored loan is less than the warehouse-stored loan and charges plus  interest on the shortage. The maturity date of the farm-stored loan  shall be the maturity date applicable to the warehouse-stored loan that  was transferred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Upon the filing of the Reconcentration Agreement and Trust  Receipt by the producer and warehouse operator, CCC may, during the  marketing assistance loan period, approve the reconcentration in another  authorized warehouse for all or part of a commodity that is pledged as  collateral for a warehouse-stored loan. Any such approval shall be  subject to the terms and conditions in the Reconcentration Agreement and  Trust Receipt. A producer may, before the new warehouse receipt is  delivered to CCC, pay CCC:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The principal amount of the marketing assistance loan and  charges plus interest and applicable charges; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If CCC so announces, an amount less than the principal amount of  the marketing assistance loan and charges plus interest under the terms  and conditions specified by CCC at the time the producer redeems the  commodity   pledged as collateral for such marketing assistance loan.
