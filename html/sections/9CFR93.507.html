All swine  found to be free from communicable disease and not to have been exposed  thereto within 60 days prior to their exportation to the United States  shall be admitted subject to the other provisions in this part; all  other swine shall be refused entry. Swine refused entry, unless exported  within a time fixed in each case by the Administrator, and in accordance  with other provisions he or she may require in each case for their  handling shall be disposed of as the Administrator may direct. Such  portions of the transporting vessel, and of its cargo, which have been  exposed to any such swine or their emanations shall be disinfected in  such manner as may be considered necessary by the inspector in charge at  the port of entry, to prevent the introduction or spread of livestock or  poultry disease, before the cargo is allowed to land.
