The description must include geologic,  geotechnical, hydrologic, meteorologic, climatologic, and biotic  features of the disposal site and vicinity.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A description of the design features of the land disposal  facility and the disposal units. For near-surface disposal, the  description must include those design features related to infiltration  of water; integrity of covers for disposal units; structural stability  of backfill, wastes, and covers; contact of wastes with standing water;  disposal site drainage; disposal site closure and stabilization;  elimination to the extent practicable of long-term disposal site  maintenance; inadvertent intrusion; occupational exposures; disposal  site monitoring; and adequacy of the size of the buffer zone for  monitoring and potential mitigative measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A description of the principal design criteria and their  relationship to the performance objectives.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A description of the design basis natural events or phenomena  and their relationship to the principal design criteria.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A description of codes and standards which the applicant has  applied to the design and which will apply to construction of the land  disposal facilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A description of the construction and operation of the land  disposal facility. The description must include as a minimum the methods  of construction of disposal units; waste emplacement; the procedures for  and areas of waste segregation; types of intruder barriers; onsite  traffic and drainage systems; survey control program; methods and areas  of waste storage; and methods to control surface water and groundwater  access to the wastes. The description must also include a description of  the methods to be employed in the handling and disposal of wastes  containing chelating agents or other non-radiological substances that  might affect meeting the performance objectives in subpart C of this  part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A description of the disposal site closure plan, including those  design features which are intended to facilitate disposal site closure  and to eliminate the need for ongoing active maintenance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An identification of the known natural resources at the disposal  site, the exploitation of which could result in inadvertent intrusion  into the low-level wastes after removal of active institutional control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> A description of the kind, amount, classification and  specifications of the radioactive material proposed to be received,  possessed, and disposed of at the land disposal facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A description of the quality assurance program, tailored to LLW  disposal, developed and applied by the applicant for the determination  of natural disposal site characteristics and   for quality assurance during the design, construction, operation, and  closure of the land disposal facility and the receipt, handling, and  emplacement of waste.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> A description of the radiation safety program for control and  monitoring of radioactive effluents to ensure compliance with the  performance objective in Sec. 61.41 of this part and occupational  radiation exposure to ensure compliance with the requirements of part 20  of this chapter and to control contamination of personnel, vehicles,  equipment, buildings, and the disposal site. Both routine operations and  accidents must be addressed. The program description must include  procedures, instrumentation, facilities, and equipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> A description of the environmental monitoring program to provide  data to evaluate potential health and environmental impacts and the plan  for taking corrective measures if migration of radionuclides is  indicated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> A description of the administrative procedures that the  applicant will apply to control activities at the land disposal  facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> A description of the facility electronic recordkeeping system as  required in Sec. 61.80.
