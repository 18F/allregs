                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. FDA is committed to resolving differences between  applicants and FDA reviewing divisions with respect to technical  requirements for applications or abbreviated applications as quickly and  amicably as possible through the cooperative exchange of information and  views.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Administrative and procedural issues. When administrative or  procedural disputes arise, the applicant should first attempt to resolve  the matter with the division responsible for reviewing the application  or abbreviated application, beginning with the consumer safety officer  assigned to the application or abbreviated application. If resolution is  not achieved, the applicant may raise the matter with the person  designated as ombudsman, whose function shall be to investigate what has  happened and to facilitate a timely and equitable resolution.  Appropriate issues to raise with the ombudsman include resolving  difficulties in scheduling meetings, obtaining timely replies to  inquiries, and obtaining timely completion of pending reviews. Further  details on this procedure are contained in a staff manual guide that is  publicly available under FDA's public information regulations in part  20.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Scientific and medical disputes. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Because major scientific  issues are ordinarily communicated to applicants in a complete response  letter pursuant to Sec. 314.110, the ``end-of-review conference''  described in Sec. 314.102(d) will provide a timely forum for discussing  and resolving, if possible, scientific and medical issues on which the  applicant disagrees with the agency. In addition, the ``ninety-day  conference'' described in Sec. 314.102(c) will provide a timely forum  for discussing and resolving, if possible, issues identified by that  date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When scientific or medical disputes arise at other times during  the review process, applicants should discuss the matter directly with  the responsible reviewing officials. If necessary, applicants may  request a meeting with the appropriate reviewing officials and  management representatives in order to seek a resolution. Ordinarily,  such meetings would be held first with the Division Director, then with  the Office Director, and finally with the Center Director if the matter  is still unresolved. Requests for such meetings shall be directed to the  director of the division responsible for reviewing the application or  abrreviated application. FDA will make every attempt to grant requests  for meetings that involve important issues and that can be scheduled at  mutually convenient times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In requesting a meeting designed to resolve a scientific or  medical dispute, applicants may suggest that FDA seek the advice of  outside experts, in which case FDA may, in its discretion, invite to the  meeting one or more of its advisory committee members or other  consultants, as designated by the agency. Applicants may also bring  their own consultants. For major scientific and medical policy issues  not resolved by informal meetings, FDA may refer the matter to one of  its standing advisory committees for its consideration and  recommendations.
