The securities will  be issued in an amount not to exceed, in any case, the amount for which  the financial agents are authorized. The securities are non-marketable  Treasury securities that will be utilized to compensate financial  agents, in whole or in part, for services performed on behalf of the  Department of the Treasury. The financial agents will be compensated  from the interest earned on the securities. This offering will continue  until terminated by the Secretary. The Fiscal Assistant Secretary is  authorized to act on behalf of the Secretary upon all matters contained  in these regulations.</p>
