                            <p class="depth0">Pet rules promulgated by project owners and PHAs may include, but are not limited to, consideration of the following factors:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions of ``common household pet''--(1) For Public Housing programs. The pet rules established by a PHA may contain a reasonable definition of a common household pet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For Public Housing programs. The pet rules established by a PHA may contain a reasonable definition of a common household pet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Housing programs. Project owners wishing to define ``common household pet'' in their pet rules must use the Housing programs definition of the term in Sec. 5.306.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Density of tenants and pets. (1)(i) The pet rules established under this section may take into account tenant and pet density. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each dwelling unit. In the case of group homes, the pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each home.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(i)</em> The pet rules established under this section may take into account tenant and pet density. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each dwelling unit. In the case of group homes, the pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The pet rules established under this section may take into account tenant and pet density. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each dwelling unit. In the case of group homes, the pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the number of common household pets that may be allowed in each home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For Housing programs. Under these rules, project owners may limit the number of four-legged, warm-blooded pets to one pet in each dwelling unit or group home.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Other than the limitations described in this paragraph (b)(1), the pet rules may not limit the total number of pets allowed in the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As used in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the term ``group home'' means:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of Housing programs. A small, communal living arrangement designed specifically for individuals

who are chronically mentally ill, developmentally disabled, or physically disabled who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of Public Housing programs. A dwelling or dwelling unit for the exclusive residential use of elderly persons or persons with disabilities who are not capable of living completely independently and who require a planned program of continual supportive services or supervision (other than continual nursing, medical or psychiatric care).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Pet size and pet type. The pet rules may place reasonable limitations on the size, weight, and type of common household pets allowed in the project.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Potential financial obligations of tenants--(1) Pet deposits. The pet rules may require tenants who own or keep pets in their units to pay a refundable pet deposit. In the case of project owners, this pet deposit shall be limited to those tenants who own or keep cats or dogs in their units. This deposit is in addition to any other financial obligation generally imposed on tenants of the project. The project owner or PHA may use the pet deposit only to pay reasonable expenses directly attributable to the presence of the pet in the project, including (but not limited to) the cost of repairs and replacements to, and fumigation of, the tenant's dwelling unit and, for project owners, the cost of animal care facilities under Sec. 5.363. The project owner or PHA shall refund the unused portion of the pet deposit to the tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant moves from the project or no longer owns or keeps a pet (or a cat or dog in the case of project owners) in the dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pet deposits.

In the case of project owners, this pet deposit shall be limited to those tenants who own or keep cats or dogs in their units. This deposit is in addition to any other financial obligation generally imposed on tenants of the project.

The project owner or PHA shall refund the unused portion of the pet deposit to the tenant within a reasonable time after the tenant moves from the project or no longer owns or keeps a pet (or a cat or dog in the case of project owners) in the dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit. (i) Pet deposits for the following tenants shall not exceed an amount periodically fixed by HUD through notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pet deposits for the following tenants shall not exceed an amount periodically fixed by HUD through notice.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Tenants whose rents are subsidized (including tenants of a HUD-owned project, whose rents were subsidized before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Tenants who live in a project assisted (including tenants who live in a HUD-owned project that was assisted before HUD acquired it) under one of the programs identified by HUD through notice.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> For all other tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities, the pet deposit shall not exceed one month's rent at the time the pet is brought onto the premises.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> In establishing the maximum amount of pet deposit under paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, HUD will consider factors such as:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Projected, estimated expenses directly attributable to the presence of pets in the project;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ability of project owners to offset such expenses by use of security deposits or HUD-reimbursable expenses; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The low income status of tenants of projects for the elderly or persons with disabilities.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner through an initial payment not to exceed $50 when the pet is brought onto the premises, and subsequent monthly payments not to exceed $10 per month until the amount of the deposit is reached.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For pet deposits subject to paragraphs (d)(2)(i)(B) and (C) of this section, the pet rules may provide for gradual accumulation of the deposit by the pet owner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The project owner may (subject to the HUD-prescribed limits) increase the amount of the pet deposit by amending the house pet rules in accordance with Sec. 5.353.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> For pet deposits subject to paragraph (d)(2)(i)(A) of this section, the house pet rules shall provide for gradual accumulation of any such increase not to exceed $10 per month for all deposit amounts that are being accumulated.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any pet deposit that is established within the parameters set forth by paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall be deemed reasonable for purposes of this subpart C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Public Housing programs: Maximum pet deposit. The maximum amount of pet deposit that may be charged by the

PHA, on a per dwelling unit basis, shall not exceed the higher of the Total Tenant Payment (as defined in 24 CFR 913.102) or such reasonable fixed amount as the PHA may require. The pet rules may permit gradual accumulation of the pet deposit by the pet owner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Housing programs: Waste removal charge. The pet rules may permit the project owner to impose a separate waste removal charge of up to five dollars ($5) per occurrence on pet owners that fail to remove pet waste in accordance with the prescribed pet rules. Any pet waste removal charge that is within this five dollar ($5) limitation shall be deemed to be a reasonable amount for the purposes of this subpart C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The pet deposit (for Housing and Public Housing programs) and waste removal charge (for Housing programs) are not part of the rent payable by the tenant. Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section for Housing programs and, paragraph (d) of this section and 24 CFR 966.4(b) for Public Housing programs, project owners or PHAs may not prescribe pet rules that impose additional financial obligations on pet owners that are designed to compensate the project owner or PHA for costs associated with the presence of pets in the project, including (but not limited to) requiring pet owners:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To obtain liability or other insurance to cover damage caused by the pet;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To agree to be strictly liable for all damages caused by the pet where this liability is not otherwise imposed by State or local law, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To indemnify the project owner for pet-related litigation and attorney's fees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Standards of pet care. The pet rules may prescribe standards of pet care and handling, but must be limited to those necessary to protect the condition of the tenant's unit and the general condition of the project premises, or to protect the health or safety of present tenants, project employees, and the public. The pet rules may not require pet owners to have any pet's vocal cords removed. Permitted rules may:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bar pets from specified common areas (such as lobbies, laundry rooms, and social rooms), unless the exclusion will deny a pet reasonable ingress and egress to the project or building.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Require the pet owner to control noise and odor caused by a pet.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Housing programs: Project owners may also:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Require pet owners to have their dogs and cats spayed or neutered; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Limit the length of time that a pet may be left unattended in a dwelling unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pet licensing. The pet rules may require pet owners to license their pets in accordance with applicable State and local laws and regulations. (Failure of the pet rules to contain this requirement does not relieve the pet owner of responsibility for complying with applicable State and local pet licensing requirements.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Public Housing programs: Designated pet areas. (1) PHAs may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings as no-pet areas where pets generally may not be permitted. Similarly, the pet rules may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings for residency generally by pet-owning tenants. The PHA may direct such initial tenant moves as may be necessary to establish pet and no-pet areas. The PHA may not refuse to admit (or delay admission of) an applicant for tenancy on the grounds that the applicant's admission would violate a pet or no-pet area. The PHA may adjust the pet and no-pet areas or may direct such additional moves as may be necessary (or both) to accommodate such applicants for tenancy or to meet the changing needs of existing tenants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> PHAs may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings as no-pet areas where pets generally may not be permitted. Similarly, the pet rules may designate buildings, floors of buildings, or sections of buildings for residency generally by pet-owning tenants.

The pet rules may exclude from the project pets not owned by a tenant that are to be kept temporarily on the project premises. For the purposes of paragraph (h) of this section, pets are to be kept ``temporarily'' if they are to be kept in the tenant's dwelling accommodations for a period of less than 14 consecutive days and nights. HUD, however, encourages project owners

and PHAs to permit the use of a visiting pet program sponsored by a humane society, or other nonprofit organization.</p>
