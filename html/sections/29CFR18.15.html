If the judge is unable to complete  a hearing, a successor judge designated pursuant to Sec. 18.12 may  proceed upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that  the case may be completed without prejudice to the parties. The  successor judge must, at a party's request, recall any witness whose  testimony is material and disputed and who is available to testify again  without undue burden. The successor judge may also recall any other  witness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Substitution following hearing. If the judge is unable to  proceed after the hearing is concluded, the successor judge appointed  pursuant to Sec. 18.12 may issue a decision and order based upon the  existing record after notifying the   parties and giving them an opportunity to respond. Within 14 days of  receipt of the judge's notice, a party may file an objection to the  judge issuing a decision based on the existing record. If no objection  is filed, the objection is considered waived. Upon good cause shown, the  judge may order supplemental proceedings.</p>
