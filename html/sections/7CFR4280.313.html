                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. The following provisions apply to each type of grant offered under this program unless otherwise specified annually in a Federal Register notice. Competition for these funds will occur as a part of the application and qualification process of becoming a microlender. Failure to meet scoring benchmarks will preclude an applicant from receiving loan and/or grant dollars. Once an MDO is participating as a microlender, grant funds will be made available automatically based on lending and the availability of funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant amounts.(i) The maximum TA grant amount for a microlender is 25 percent of the first $400,000 of outstanding microloans owed to the microlender under this program, plus an additional 5 percent of the outstanding loan amount owed by the microborrowers to the lender under this program over $400,000 up to and including $2.5 million. This calculation leads to a maximum grant of $205,000 annually for any microlender to provide technical assistance to its clients. These grants will be awarded annually.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The maximum TA grant amount for a microlender is 25 percent of the first $400,000 of outstanding microloans owed to the microlender under this program, plus an additional 5 percent of the outstanding loan amount owed by the microborrowers to the lender under this program over $400,000 up to and including $2.5 million. This calculation leads to a maximum grant of $205,000 annually for any microlender to provide technical assistance to its clients. These grants will be awarded annually.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The maximum amount of a TA-only grant under this program will not exceed 10 percent of the amount of funding available for TA-only grants. The amount of funding available for TA funding will be announced annually and will be based on the availability of funds. In no case will funding for the TA-only grants exceed 10 percent of the amount appropriated for the program each Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Matching requirement. The MDO is required to provide a match of not less than 15 percent of the total amount of the grant in the form of matching funds, indirect costs, or in-kind goods or services. Unless specifically permitted by laws other than the statute authorizing RMAP, matching contributions must be made up of non-Federal funding.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Administrative expenses. Not more than 10 percent of a grant received by a MDO for a Federal fiscal year (FY) may be used to pay administrative expenses. MDOs must submit an annual budget of proposed administrative expenses for Agency approval. The Agency has the right to deny the 10 percent and to fund administration expenses at a lower level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ineligible grant purposes. Grant funds, matching funds, indirect costs, and in-kind goods and services may not be used for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Grant application preparation costs;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Costs incurred prior to the obligation date of the grant;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Capital improvements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Political or lobbying activities;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Assistance to any ineligible entity;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Payment of any judgment or debt owed; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Payment of any costs other than those allowed in paragraphs (b)(1) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Changes in key personnel. Before any additions are made to key personnel, the microlender must notify and the Agency must approve such changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Grants to assist microentrepreneurs (Microlender Technical Assistance (TA) Grants). The capacity of a microlender to provide an integrated program of

microlending and technical assistance will be evaluated during the scoring process. An eligible MDO selected to be a microlender will be eligible to receive a microlending TA grant if it receives funding to provide microloans under this program.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Purpose. The Agency shall make microlender TA grants to microlenders to assist them in providing marketing, management, and other technical assistance to rural microentrepreneurs and microenterprises that have received or are seeking one or more microloans from the microlender.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Grant amounts. Microlender TA grants will be limited to an amount equal to not more than 25 percent of the total outstanding balance of microloans made under this program and active by the microlender as of the date the grant is awarded for the first $400,000 plus an additional 5 percent of the loan amount owed by the microborrowers to the lender under this program over $400,000 up to and including $2.5 million. Funds cannot be used to pay off the loans. During the first year of operation, the percentage will be determined based on the amount of the loan to the microlender, but will be disbursed on a quarterly basis based on the amount of microloans made. Any grant dollars obligated, but not spent, from the initial grant, will be subtracted from the subsequent year grant to ensure that obligations cover only microloans made and active.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> TA grant fund uses and limitations. The microlender will agree to use TA grant funding exclusively for providing technical assistance and training to eligible microentrepreneurs and microenterprises, with the exception that up to 10 percent of the grant funds may be used to cover the microlender's administrative expenses, except as may be reduced as provided under Sec. 4280.313(a)(4). The following limitations will apply to TA grant funding:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Administrative expenses should be kept to a minimum. As such, the applicant MDO is required, in the application materials, to provide an administrative budget plan indicating the amount of funding it will need for administrative purposes. Applicants will be scored accordingly, with those using less than 10 percent of the funding for administrative purposes being scored higher than those using 10 percent of the funding for administrative purposes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> While operating the program, the selected microlender will be expected to adhere to the estimates it provides in the application. If for any reason, the microlender cannot meet the expectations of the application, it must contact the Agency in writing to request a budget adjustment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> At no time will it be appropriate for the microlender to expend more than 10 percent of its grant funding on administrative expenses. Microlenders that go over 10 percent will be considered in performance default and may be subject to forfeiting funding.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Budget adjustments will be considered within the 10 percent limitation and approved or denied on a case-by-case basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> TA-only grants. Grants will be competitively made to MDOs for the purpose of providing technical assistance and training to prospective microborrowers. Technical assistance-only grants will be provided to eligible MDOs that seek to provide business-based technical assistance and training to eligible microentrepreneurs and microenterprises, but do not seek funding for an RMRF. Entities receiving microlending TA grants will not be eligible to apply for TA-only grants.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Grant term. TA-only grants will have a grant term not to exceed 12 months from the date the grant agreement is signed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Funding level. The maximum amount of a TA-only grant under this program will not exceed 10 percent of the amount of funding available for TA-only grants. In no case will funding for the TA-only grants exceed 10 percent of the amount appropriated for the program each Federal fiscal year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Loan referencing. TA-only grantees will be required to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Refer clients to internal or external non-program funded lenders for loans of $50,000 or less and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Collect data regarding such clients. TA-only grantees will be considered successful if a minimum of 1- in-5 TA clients are referred for a microloan and are operating a business within 18

months of receiving technical assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Facilitation of access to capital. Technical assistance-only grantees will be expected to provide training and technical assistance services to the extent that access to capital for eligible microentrepreneurs and microenterprises is facilitated by referral to either an internal or external non-program loan fund so that these clients may take advantage of available financing programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Microlender funding. No entity will receive grant funding as both a microlender and a TA-only provider; that is, RMAP microlenders are not eligible for TA-only funding and an MDO receiving TA-only funding are not eligible for microlender funding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Grant agreement. For any grant to an MDO or microlender, the Agency will notify the approved applicant in writing, using an Agency-approved grant agreement setting out the conditions under which the grant will be made. The form will include those matters necessary to ensure that the proposed grant is completed in accordance with the proposed project, that grant funds are expended for authorized purposes, and that the applicable requirements prescribed in the relevant Department regulations are complied with.
