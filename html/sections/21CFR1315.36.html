                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> An import quota authorizes the registered importer to import up  to the set quantity of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or  phenylpropanolamine and distribute the chemical or drug products on the  DEA Form 488. An importer must apply to change the quantity to be  imported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any person to whom an import quota has been issued may at any  time request an increase in the quota quantity by applying to the  Administrator with a statement showing the need for the adjustment. The  application must be filed with the Drug & Chemical Evaluation Section,  Drug Enforcement Administration. See the Table of DEA Mailing Addresses  in Sec. 1321.01 of this chapter for the current mailing address. The  Administrator may increase the import quota of the person if and to the  extent that he determines that the approval is necessary to provide for  medical, scientific, or other legitimate purposes regarding the  chemical. The Administrator shall specify a period of time for which the  approval is in effect or shall provide that the approval is in effect  until the Administrator notifies the applicant in writing that the  approval is terminated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to the application under paragraph (b) of this  section, the Administrator shall approve or deny the application within  60 days of receiving the application. If the Administrator does not  approve or deny the application within 60 days of receiving it, the  application is deemed to be approved and the approval remains in effect  until the Administrator notifies   the applicant in writing that the approval is terminated.
