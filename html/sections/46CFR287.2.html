                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Applicability of regulations. The regulations prescribed in this  part--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Apply to gain realized from the sale or loss of vessels,  earnings from the operation of vessels, and interest (or otherwise) with  respect to amounts previously deposited in the construction reserve  fund, for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1964, and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Apply to the expenditure, obligation, or withdrawal, during a  taxable year beginning after December 31, 1964, of any deposits of gain,  earnings, and interest (or otherwise) of the character referred to in  paragraph (a)(1) of this section without regard to the taxable year in  which the deposits were made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonrecognition and accumulation. Section 511 of the Act  provides, under conditions specified, for the nonrecognition, for income  and excess-profits tax purposes, of the gain realized from the sale or  indemnification for loss of certain vessels including certain vessels in  the course of construction, or shares therein. It also permits the  accumulation of the proceeds of such sales or indemnification and of  certain earnings without liability under part I (section 531 and  following), subchapter G, chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of  1954, and the regulations thereunder (26 CFR 1.531 through 1.537-1  (Income Tax Regulations)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability of benefits. The benefits of section 511 of the Act  are available to any citizen as defined in paragraph (a)(4) of Sec.  287.1, who, during any taxable year owns, in whole or in part, a vessel  or vessels within the scope of Sec. 287.3. A citizen operating such a  vessel or vessels owned by any other person or persons can derive no  benefit from the provisions relating to the nonrecognition of gain from  the sale or loss of such vessel or vessels so owned, but may establish a  construction reserve fund in which he may deposit earnings from the  operation of such vessel or vessels.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Applicability of section 511. Section 511 of the Act applies  only with respect to sales or losses of vessels within the scope of  Sec. 287.3 or in respect of earnings derived from the operation of such  vessels. A loss to be within section 511 of the Act must be an actual or  constructive total loss. Whether there is a total loss, actual or  constructive, will be determined by the Administration.</p>
