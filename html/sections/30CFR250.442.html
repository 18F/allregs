                            <p class="depth0">When you drill with a subsea BOP system, you must install the BOP system before drilling below the surface casing. The District Manager may require you to install a subsea BOP system before drilling below the conductor casing if proposed casing setting depths or local geology indicate the need. The table in this paragraph outlines your requirements.
