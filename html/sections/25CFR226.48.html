                            <p class="depth0">The lessee or his/her contractor may, with the approval of the Superintendent, use water from streams and natural water courses to the extent that such use does not diminish the supply below the requirements of the surface owner from whose land the water is taken. Similarly, the lessee or his/her contractor may use water from reservoirs formed by the impoundment of water from such streams and natural water courses, if such use does not exceed the quantity to which they originally would have been entitled had the reservoirs not been constructed. The lessee or his/her contractor may install necessary lines and other equipment within the Osage mineral estate to obtain such water. Any damage resulting

from such installation must be settled as provided in Sec. 226.41.</p>
