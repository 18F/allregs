                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by a written brief of the points and authorities relied upon. Motions by a respondent must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served upon the Director through the Office of Chief Counsel and with any other party respondent or respondent's representative, unless otherwise directed by the Administrative Law Judge. Motions by the Director must be filed with the Administrative Law Judge and served upon each party respondent or respondent's representative. All written motions must be served in accordance with, and otherwise meet the requirements of, Sec. 501.705. The Administrative Law Judge may order that an oral motion be submitted in writing. No oral argument shall be heard on any motion unless the Administrative Law Judge otherwise directs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Opposing and reply briefs. Except as provided in Sec. 501.741(e), briefs in opposition to a motion shall be filed not later than 15 days after service of the motion. Reply briefs shall be filed not later than 3 days after service of the opposition. The failure of a party to oppose a written motion or an oral motion made on the record shall be deemed a waiver of objection by that party to the entry of an order substantially in the form of any proposed order accompanying the motion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Dilatory motions. Frivolous, dilatory, or repetitive motions are prohibited. The filing of such motions may form the basis for sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Length limitation. Except as otherwise ordered by the Administrative Law Judge, a brief in support of, or in opposition to, a motion shall not exceed 15 pages, exclusive of pages containing any table of contents, table of authorities, or addendum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time as determined by the Administrative Law Judge, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and, if applicable, specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such conditions as may be appropriate, the Administrative Law Judge, at any time prior to the filing of his or her decision, or the Secretary's designee, at any time during the review process, may for good cause shown set aside a default.</p>
