The State has continued to adopt Federal standards, amendments and corrections as noted in separate standards approval notices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In accordance with 29 CFR 1956.43(c), Connecticut promulgated rules for inspections, citations, and proposed penalties (Administrative Regulation Section 31-371-1 through 20) parallel to 29 CFR part 1903; recording and reporting occupational injuries and illness (Administrative Regulation Section 31-374-1 through 15 parallel to 29 CFR part 1904; rules of practices for variances (Administrative Regulation Section 31-372-1 through 51) parallel to 29 CFR part 1905; and review commission procedures (Administrative Regulation Section 31-376-1 through 61) parallel to 29 CFR part 2200.

discharge its responsibilities under the plan. The Connecticut Public Employee Only State plan provides for three (3) safety compliance officers and one (1) health compliance officer as set forth in the Connecticut Fiscal Year 1986 grant. This staffing level meets the ``fully effective'' benchmarks established for Connecticut for both safety and health.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> In accordance with Sec. 1956.23 of this chapter, the Connecticut occupational safety and health public employee only plan was certified effective August 19, 1986 as having completed all developmental steps specified in the plan as approved October 2, 1978, on or before October 2, 1979. This certification attests to the structured completeness of the plan, but does not render judgment on adequacy of performance.
