Similarly, the activities of ``first processing, canning, or packing of such marine products at sea as an incident to, or in conjunction with, such fishing operations'' are subject to the natural factors mentioned above. The ``loading and unloading'' of such aquatic products when performed at sea are also subject to the natural forces.</p>
