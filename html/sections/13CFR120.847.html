                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. PCLP CDCs must establish and maintain a LLRF (or  multiple accounts which together constitute one LLRF) which complies  with paragraphs (b) through (g) of this section. A PCLP CDC must use the  LLRF or other funds to reimburse the SBA for 10 percent of any loss  sustained by SBA as a result of a default in the payment of principal or  interest on a Debenture it issued under the PCLP (``PCLP Debenture''). A  CDC that is participating in the PCLP as of January 1, 2004, and a CDC  that has participated in the PCLP in the past but which does not have  PCLP status as of that date, must establish a LLRF within 30 days of  that date to cover potential losses for all 504 loans made in connection  with PCLP Debentures that remain outstanding as of that date. A CDC that  receives PCLP status after that date must establish and maintain a LLRF  prior to closing any 504 loans processed under its PCLP status. The LLRF  is the accumulation of deposits that a PCLP CDC must establish and  maintain for each PCLP Debenture that it issues. PCLP CDCs must  coordinate with their Lead SBA Office to ensure that the LLRF is  properly established, that all necessary documentation is executed and  delivered by all parties in a timely fashion, and that all required  deposits are made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> PCLP CDC Exposure and LLRF deposit requirements. A PCLP CDC's  ``Exposure'' is defined as its reimbursement obligation to SBA with  respect to default in the payment of any PCLP Debenture. The amount of a  PCLP CDC's Exposure is 10 percent of any loss (including attorney's  fees; litigation costs; and care of collateral, appraisal and other  liquidation costs and expenses) sustained by SBA as a result of a  default in the payment of principal or interest on a PCLP Debenture. For  each PCLP Debenture a PCLP CDC issues, it must establish and maintain an  LLRF equal to one percent of the original principal amount (the face  amount) of the PCLP Debenture. The amount the PCLP CDC must maintain in  the LLRF for each PCLP Debenture remains the same even as the principal  balance of the PCLP Debenture is paid down over time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Establishing a LLRF. The LLRF must be a deposit account (or  accounts) with a federally insured depository institution selected by  the PCLP CDC. A ``deposit account'' is a demand, time, savings, or  passbook account, including a certificate of deposit (CD) which is  either uncertificated or, if certificated, non-transferable. A ``deposit  account'' is not an investment account and must not contain securities  or other investment properties. A deposit account may contain only cash  and CDs credited to that account. A PCLP CDC may pool its deposits for  multiple PCLP Debentures in a single account in one institution. The  LLRF must be segregated from the PCLP CDC's other operating accounts.  The PCLP CDC is responsible for all fees, costs and expenses incurred in  connection with establishing, managing and maintaining the LLRF,  including fees associated with transferring funds or early withdrawal of  CDs, and related income tax expenses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Creating and perfecting a security interest in a LLRF. A PCLP  CDC must give SBA a first priority, perfected security interest in the  LLRF to secure the PCLP CDC's obligation to reimburse SBA for the PCLP  CDC's Exposure under all of its outstanding PCLP Debentures. (If a PCLP  CDC's LLRF is comprised of multiple deposit accounts, it must give SBA  this security interest with respect to each such account.) The PCLP CDC  must grant to SBA the security interest in the LLRF pursuant to a  security agreement between the PCLP CDC and SBA, and a control agreement  between the PCLP CDC, SBA, and the applicable depository institution.  The control agreement must include provisions requiring the depository  institution to follow SBA instructions regarding withdrawal from the  account without a requirement for obtaining further consent from the  PCLP CDC, and must restrict the PCLP CDC's ability to make withdrawals  from the account without SBA   consent. When establishing the LLRF, a PCLP CDC must coordinate with its  Lead SBA Office to execute and deliver the required documentation. The  PCLP CDC must provide to the Lead SBA Office a fully executed original  of the security and control agreements. All documents must be  satisfactory to SBA in both form and substance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Schedule for contributions to a LLRF. The PCLP CDC must  contribute to the LLRF the required deposits for each PCLP Debenture in  accordance with the following schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least 50 percent of the required deposits to the LLRF on or  about the date that it issues the PCLP Debenture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At least an additional 25 percent of the required deposits to  the LLRF no later than one year after it issues the PCLP Debenture.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any remainder of the required deposits to the LLRF no later than  two years after it issues the PCLP Debenture.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> LLRF reporting requirements. Each PCLP CDC must periodically  report to SBA the amount in the LLRF in a form that will readily  facilitate reconciliation of the amount maintained in the LLRF with the  amount required to meet a PCLP CDC's Exposure for its entire portfolio  of PCLP Debentures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Withdrawal of excess funds. Interest and other funds in the LLRF  that exceed the required minimums as set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section, within the time frames set forth in paragraph (e) of this  section, accrue to the benefit of the PCLP CDC. PCLP CDCs are authorized  to withdraw excess funds, including interest, from the LLRF if such  funds exceed the required minimums set forth in paragraph (b) of this  section. The PCLP CDC must forward requests for withdrawals to the Lead  SBA Office, which will verify the existence and amount of excess funds  and notify the financial institution to transfer the excess funds to the  PCLP CDC.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Determining SBA loss. When a PCLP CDC has concluded the  liquidation of a defaulted 504 loan made with the proceeds of a PCLP  Debenture and has submitted a liquidation wrap-up report to SBA, or when  SBA otherwise determines that the PCLP CDC has exhausted all reasonable  collection efforts with respect to that 504 loan, SBA will determine the  amount of the loss to SBA. SBA will notify the PCLP CDC of the amount of  its reimbursement obligation to SBA (if any) and will explain how SBA  calculated the loss.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the PCLP CDC agrees with SBA's calculations of the loss, it  must reimburse SBA for ten percent of the amount of that loss no later  than 30 days after SBA's notification to the PCLP CDC of the CDC's  reimbursement obligation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the PCLP CDC disputes SBA's calculations, it must reimburse  SBA for ten percent of any loss amount that is not in dispute no later  than 30 days after SBA's notification to the PCLP CDC of the CDC's  reimbursement obligation. No later than 30 days after SBA's  notification, the PCLP CDC may submit to the D/FA or his or her delegate  a written appeal of any disagreement regarding the calculation of SBA's  loss. The PCLP CDC must include with that appeal an explanation of its  reasons for the disagreement. Upon the D/FA's final decision as to the  disputed amount of the loss, the PCLP CDC must promptly reimburse SBA  for ten percent of that amount.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Reimbursing SBA for loss. A PCLP CDC may use funds in the LLRF  or other funds to reimburse SBA for the PCLP CDC's Exposure on a  defaulted PCLP Debenture. If a PCLP CDC does not satisfy the entire  reimbursement obligation within 30 days after SBA's notification to the  PCLP CDC's of its reimbursement obligation, SBA may cause funds in the  LLRF to be transferred to SBA in order to cover the PCLP CDC's Exposure,  unless the PCLP CDC has filed an appeal under paragraph (h)(2) of this  section. If the PCLP CDC has filed such an appeal, SBA may cause such a  transfer of funds to SBA 30 days after the D/FA's or his or her  delegate's decision. If the LLRF does not contain sufficient funds to  reimburse SBA for any unpaid Exposure with respect to any PCLP  Debenture, the PCLP CDC must pay SBA the difference within 30 days after  demand for payment by SBA.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Insufficient funding of LLRF. A PCLP CDC must diligently monitor  the   LLRF to ensure that it contains sufficient funds to cover its Exposure  for its entire portfolio of PCLP Debentures. If, at any time, the LLRF  does not contain sufficient funds, the PCLP CDC must, within 30 days of  the earlier of the date it becomes aware of this deficiency or the date  it receives notification from SBA of this deficiency, make additional  contributions to the LLRF to make up this difference.
