                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Bar admission and disciplinary matters. A covered attorney, in connection with any application for bar admission, appointment as a judge advocate, employment as a civilian USG attorney, certification by the JAG or his designee, or in connection with any disciplinary matter, shall not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Knowingly make a false statement of fact; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by the person to have arisen in the matter, or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from an admissions or disciplinary authority,

except that this section does not require disclosure of information otherwise protected by Sec. 776.25 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The duty imposed by this section extends to covered attorneys and other attorneys seeking admission to a bar, application for appointment as a covered USG attorney (military or civilian) or certification by the JAG or his designee. Hence, if a person makes a false statement in connection with an application for admission or certification (e.g., misstatement by a civilian attorney before a military judge regarding qualifications under Rule for Courts-Martial 502), it may be the basis for subsequent disciplinary action if the person is admitted or certified, and in any event may be relevant in a subsequent admission application. The duty imposed by this section applies to a covered attorney's own admission or discipline as well as that of others. Thus, it is a separate professional offense for a covered attorney to make a knowing misrepresentation or omission in connection with a disciplinary investigation of the covered attorney's own conduct. This section also requires affirmative clarification of any misunderstanding on the part of the admissions, certification, or disciplinary authority of which the person involved becomes aware.</p>
