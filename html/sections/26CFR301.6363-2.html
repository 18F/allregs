                                Sec. 301.6363-2  Withdrawal from State agreements.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> By notification. If a State which has entered into a State agreement desires to withdraw from the agreement, its Governor shall file a notice of withdrawal with the Secretary or his delegate. A notice of withdrawal shall include the following documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Request by the Governor. A request by the Governor of the State that the State agreement cease to be effective with respect to taxable years beginning on or after a specified January 1, except as provided in paragraph (b)(2) of Sec. 301.6365-2 with respect to withholding in the case of fiscal year taxpayers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Legislative approval of withdrawal. A certified copy of an act or Resolution of the legislature of the State in which the legislature affirmatively expresses its approval of the State's withdrawal from the State agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Identification of State official. A written identification of the State official or officials with whom the Secretary or his delegate should coordinate in connection with the State's withdrawal from the State agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> By change in State law. If any law of a State which has entered into a State agreement is enacted pertaining to individual income taxes (including the collection or administration of such taxes, and the prosecution of alleged civil or criminal violations with respect to such taxes), and if the Secretary or his delegate determines that as a result of such law the State no longer has a qualified tax, then such change in the State law shall be treated as a notification of withdrawal from the agreement. The Secretary shall notify the Governor in writing when a change is to be so treated. Such notification shall have the same effect as if, on the effective date of the disqualifying change in the law, the Governor had filed with the Secretary or his delegate a valid and sufficient notice of withdrawal requesting that the State agreement cease to be effective with respect to taxable years beginning on or after the first January 1 which is more than 6 months thereafter, subject to the exception with respect to withholding in the case of fiscal-year taxpayers. However, the cessation of effectiveness may be deferred to a subsequent January 1 if the Governor so requests and if the Secretary or his delegate in his discretion determines that the date of cessation provided in the preceding sentence would subject the State or its taxpayers to undue hardship. In addition, the Governor may request the Secretary or his delegate to permit the State's early withdrawal from the agreement, pursuant to paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Until the date of cessation of effectiveness of the State agreement, the change in State law which was treated as a notification of withdrawal, and any other such subsequent change that would be similarly treated, shall not be given effect for purposes of the Federal collection and administration of the State taxes. Similarly, such changes shall not be given effect for such purposes during the period of litigation if the State seeks judicial review of the action of the Secretary or his delegate pursuant to section 6363(d) or Sec. 301.6363-4, even if such changes are ultimately found by the court not to disqualify the State's qualified tax. However, a change in State law which would be treated as a notice of withdrawal in the absence of this sentence shall not be so treated if, prior to the last November 1 preceding the January 1 on which the cessation of effectiveness of the State agreement is to occur, either such change in State law is retroactively repealed, or the State law is retroactively modified and the Secretary or his delegate determines that with such modification the State has a qualified tax.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Rules relating to time of withdrawal--(1) General rule. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c), a notice of withdrawal shall not be valid unless the January 1 specified therein is not earlier than the first January 1 which is more than 6 months subsequent to the date on which the notice is received by the Secretary or his delegate. Thus, for example, if the notice specifies January 1, 1980, for withdrawal, the notice must be received no later than June 30, 1979.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph (c), a notice of withdrawal shall not be valid unless the January 1 specified therein is not earlier than the first January 1 which is more than 6 months subsequent to the date on which the notice is received by the Secretary or his delegate. Thus, for example, if the notice specifies January 1, 1980, for withdrawal, the notice must be received no later than June 30, 1979.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Early withdrawal. The Secretary or his delegate may, in his discretion

and upon written request by a Governor of a State who has filed a notice of withdrawal, waive the 6-months requirement of section 6363(b)(1) and subparagraph (1) of this paragraph (c), if the Secretary determines that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The State will suffer a hardship if required to meet such requirement, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The early withdrawal requested by the Governor would be practicable from the standpoint of orderly collection of the qualified tax and administration of the State law by the Federal Government.
