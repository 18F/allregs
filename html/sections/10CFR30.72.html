[54 FR 14061, Apr. 7, 1989, as amended at 61 FR 9902, Mar. 12, 1996; 72  FR 55926, Oct. 1, 2007]    Sec. Appendix A to Part 30--Criteria Relating to Use of Financial Tests</p><p class="depth0">and Parent Company Guarantees for Providing Reasonable Assurance of</p><p class="depth0">Funds for Decommissioning</p><p class="depth0">I. Introduction</p><p class="depth0">An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable assurance of the  availability of funds for decommissioning based on obtaining a parent  company guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs  and on a demonstration that the parent company passes a financial test.  This appendix establishes criteria for passing the financial test and  for obtaining the parent company guarantee.</p><p class="depth0">II. Financial Test</p><p class="depth0">A. To pass the financial test, the parent company must meet the  criteria of either paragraph A.1 or A.2 of this section. For purposes of  applying the Appendix A criteria, tangible net worth must be calculated  to exclude all intangible assets and the net book value of the nuclear  facility and site, and total net worth, which may include intangible  assets, must be calculated to exclude the net book value and goodwill of  the nuclear facility and site.</p><p class="depth0">1. The parent company must have:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Two of the following three ratios: A ratio of total liabilities  to total net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus  depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater  than 0.1; and a ratio of current assets to current liabilities greater  than 1.5; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Net working capital and tangible net worth each at least six  times the amount of decommissioning funds being assured by a parent  company guarantee for the total of all nuclear facilities or parts  thereof (or prescribed amount if a certification is used); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $21 million; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90  percent of the total assets or at least six times the current  decommissioning cost estimates for the total of all facilities or parts  thereof (or prescribed amount if a certification is used), or, for a  power reactor licensee, at least six times the amount of decommissioning  funds being assured by a parent company guarantee for the total of all  reactor units or parts thereof.</p><p class="depth0">2. The parent company must have:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A current rating for its most recent uninsured,  uncollateralized, and unencumbered bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB  (including adjustments of + and -) as issued by Standard and Poor's or  Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa (including adjustment of 1, 2, or 3) as issued by  Moody's; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Total net worth at least six times the amount of  decommissioning funds being assured by a parent company guarantee for  the total of all nuclear facilities or parts thereof (or prescribed  amount if a certification is used); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tangible net worth of at least $21 million; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Assets located in the United States amounting to at least 90  percent of the total assets or at least six times the current  decommissioning cost estimates for the total of all facilities or parts  thereof (or prescribed amount if a certification is used), or, for a  power reactor licensee, at least six times the amount of decommissioning  funds being assured by a parent company guarantee for the total of all  reactor units or parts thereof.</p><p class="depth0">B. The parent company's independent certified public accountant must  compare the data used by the parent company in the financial test, which  is derived from the independently audited, year-end financial statements  for the latest fiscal year, with the amounts in such financial  statement. The accountant must evaluate the parent company's off-balance  sheet transactions and provide an opinion on whether those transactions  could materially adversely affect the parent company's ability to pay  for decommissioning costs. The accountant must verify that a bond  rating, if used to demonstrate passage of the financial test, meets the  requirements of paragraph A of this section. In connection with the  auditing procedure, the licensee must inform the NRC within 90 days of  any matters coming to the auditor's attention which cause the auditor to  believe that the data specified in the financial test should be adjusted  and that the company no longer passes the test.</p><p class="depth0">C.1. After the initial financial test, the parent company must  annually pass the test   and provide documentation of its continued eligibility to use the parent  company guarantee to the Commission within 90 days after the close of  each succeeding fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">2. If the parent company no longer meets the requirements of  paragraph A of this section, the licensee must send notice to the  Commission of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as  specified in the Commission's regulations. The notice must be sent by  certified mail within 90 days after the end of the fiscal year for which  the year end financial data show that the parent company no longer meets  the financial test requirements. The licensee must provide alternate  financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0">III. Parent Company Guarantee</p><p class="depth0">The terms of a parent company guarantee which an applicant or  licensee obtains must provide that:</p><p class="depth0">A. The parent company guarantee will remain in force unless the  guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the licensee  and the Commission. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120  days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by  both the licensee and the Commission, as evidenced by the return  receipts.</p><p class="depth0">B. If the licensee fails to provide alternate financial assurance as  specified in the Commission's regulations within 90 days after receipt  by the licensee and Commission of a notice of cancellation of the parent  company guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide  alternative financial assurance that meets the provisions of the  Commission's regulations in the name of the licensee.</p><p class="depth0">C. The parent company guarantee and financial test provisions must  remain in effect until the Commission has terminated the license,  accepted in writing the parent company's alternate financial assurances,  or accepted in writing the licensee's financial assurances.</p><p class="depth0">D. A standby trust to protect public health and safety and the  environment must be established for decommissioning costs before the  parent company guarantee agreement is submitted. The trustee and trust  must be acceptable to the Commission. An acceptable trustee includes an  appropriate State or Federal Government agency or an entity which has  the authority to act as a trustee, whose trust operations are regulated  and examined by a Federal or State agency. The Commission has the right  to change the trustee. An acceptable trust will meet the regulatory  criteria established in these regulations that govern the issuance of  the license for which the guarantor has accepted the obligation to pay  for decommissioning costs.</p><p class="depth0">E. The guarantor must agree that it would be subject to Commission  orders to make payments under the guarantee agreement.</p><p class="depth0">F. The guarantor must agree that if the guarantor admits in writing  its inability to pay its debts generally, or makes a general assignment  for the benefit of creditors, or any proceeding is instituted by or  against the guarantor seeking to adjudicate it as bankrupt or insolvent,  or seeking dissolution, liquidation, winding-up, reorganization,  arrangement, adjustment, protection, relief or composition of it or its  debts under any law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency, or  reorganization or relief of debtors, or seeking the entry of an order  for relief or the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian, or  other similar official for the guarantor or for any substantial part of  its property, or the guarantor takes any action to authorize or effect  any of the actions stated in this paragraph, then the Commission may:</p><p class="depth0">1. Declare that the financial assurance guaranteed by the parent  company guarantee agreement is immediately due and payable to the  standby trust set up to protect the public health and safety and the  environment, without diligence, presentment, demand, protest or any  other notice of any kind, all of which are expressly waived by  guarantor; and</p><p class="depth0">2. Exercise any and all of its other rights under applicable law.</p><p class="depth0">G. 1. The guarantor must agree to notify the NRC, in writing,  immediately following the filing of a voluntary or involuntary petition  for bankruptcy under any chapter of title 11 (Bankruptcy) of the United  States Code, or the occurrence of any other event listed in paragraph F  of this Appendix, by or against:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The guarantor;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The licensee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An entity (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(14))  controlling the licensee or listing the license or licensee as property  of the estate; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> An affiliate (as that term is defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(2)) of  the licensee.</p><p class="depth0">2. This notification must include:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the event, including major creditors, the  amounts involved, and the actions taken to assure that the amount of  funds guaranteed by the parent company guarantee for decommissioning  will be transferred to the standby trust as soon as possible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a petition of bankruptcy was filed, the identity of the  bankruptcy court in which the petition for bankruptcy was filed; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The date of filing of any petitions.
