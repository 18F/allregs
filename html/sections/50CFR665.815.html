                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)</em> of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Side-setting. Owners and operators of vessels opting to side-set  under this section must fish according to the following specifications:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The mainline must be deployed as far forward on the vessel as  practicable, and at least 1 m (3.3 ft) forward from the stern of the  vessel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The mainline and branch lines must be set from the port or the  starboard side of the vessel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If a mainline shooter is used, the mainline shooter must be  mounted as far forward on the vessel as practicable, and at least 1 m  (3.3 ft) forward from the stern of the vessel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Branch lines must have weights with a minimum weight of 45 g  (1.6 oz);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> One weight must be connected to each branch line within 1 m (3.3  ft) of each hook;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When seabirds are present, the longline gear must be deployed  so that baited hooks remain submerged and do not rise to the sea  surface; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> A bird curtain must be deployed. Each bird curtain must  consist of the following three components: a pole that is fixed to the  side of the vessel aft of the line shooter and which is at least 3 m  (9.8 ft) long; at least three main streamers that are attached at  regular intervals to the upper 2 m (6.6 ft) of the pole and each of  which has a minimum diameter of 20 mm (0.8 in); and branch streamers  attached to each main streamer at the end opposite from the pole, each  of which is long enough to drag on the sea surface in the absence of  wind, and each of which has a minimum diameter 10 mm (0.4 in).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Alternative to side-setting. Owners and operators of vessels  that do not side-set must do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Discharge fish, fish parts (offal), or spent bait while setting  or hauling longline gear, on the opposite side of the vessel from where  the longline gear is being set or hauled, when seabirds are present;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Retain sufficient quantities of fish, fish parts, or spent bait  between the setting of longline gear for the purpose of strategically  discharging it in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remove all hooks from fish, fish parts, or spent bait prior to  its discharge in accordance with paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Remove the bill and liver of any swordfish that is caught,  sever its head from the trunk and cut it in half vertically and  periodically discharge the butchered heads and livers in accordance with  paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When using basket-style longline gear north of 23[deg] N. lat.,  ensure that the main longline is deployed slack to maximize its sink  rate;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Use completely thawed bait that has been dyed blue to an  intensity level specified by a color quality control card issued by  NMFS;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Maintain a minimum of two cans (each sold as 0.45 kg or 1 lb  size) containing blue dye on board the vessel; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Follow the requirements in paragraphs (a)(3) and (a)(4) of  this section, as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Deep-setting requirements. The following additional requirements  apply to vessels engaged in deep-setting using a monofilament main  longline north of 23[deg] N. lat. that do not side-set. Owners and  operators of these vessels must do the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Employ a line shooter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Attach a weight of at least 45 g (1.6 oz) to each branch line  within 1 m (3.3 ft) of the hook.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Shallow-setting requirement. In addition to the requirements set  forth in paragraphs (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section, owners and  operators of vessels engaged in shallow-setting that do not side-set  must begin the deployment of longline gear at least 1 hour after local  sunset and complete the deployment no later than local sunrise, using  only the minimum vessel lights to conform with navigation rules and best  safety practices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Short-tailed albatross handling techniques. If a short-tailed  albatross is hooked or entangled by a vessel registered for use under a  Hawaii longline limited access permit, owners and operators must ensure  that the following actions are taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the  bird on board the vessel using a dip net;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cover the bird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils or  damage while being handled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remove any entangled lines from the bird; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Determine if the bird is alive or dead.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If dead, freeze the bird immediately with an identification tag  attached directly to the specimen listing the species, location and date  of mortality, and band number if the bird has   a leg band. Attach a duplicate identification tag to the bag or  container holding the bird. Any leg bands present must remain on the  bird. Contact NMFS, the USCG, or the USFWS at the numbers listed on the  Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the NMFS  protected species workshop, inform them that you have a dead short- tailed albatross on board, and submit the bird to NMFS within 72 hours  following completion of the fishing trip.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If alive, handle the bird in accordance with paragraphs (b)(5)  through (11) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Place the bird in a safe enclosed place;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Immediately contact NMFS, the USCG, or the USFWS at the numbers  listed on the Short-tailed Albatross Handling Placard distributed at the  NMFS protected species workshop and request veterinary guidance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Follow the veterinary guidance regarding the handling and  release of the bird;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If the bird is externally hooked and no veterinary guidance is  received within 24-48 hours, handle the bird in accordance with  paragraphs (c)(4) and (c)(5) of this section, and release the bird only  if it meets the following criteria:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Able to hold its head erect and respond to noise and motion  stimuli;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Able to breathe without noise;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Capable of flapping and retracting both wings to normal folded  position on its back;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Able to stand on both feet with toes pointed forward; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Feathers are dry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Any seabird that is released in accordance with paragraph (b)(8)  of this section or under the guidance of a veterinarian must be placed  on the sea surface;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> If the hook has been ingested or is inaccessible, keep the bird  in a safe, enclosed place and submit it to NMFS immediately upon the  vessel's return to port. Do not give the bird food or water; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Complete the short-tailed albatross recovery data form issued  by NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Non-short-tailed albatross seabird handling techniques. If a  seabird other than a short-tailed albatross is hooked or entangled by a  vessel registered for use under a Hawaii longline limited access permit  owners and operators must ensure that the following actions are taken:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Stop the vessel to reduce the tension on the line and bring the  seabird on board the vessel using a dip net;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cover the seabird with a towel to protect its feathers from oils  or damage while being handled;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Remove any entangled lines from the seabird;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Remove any external hooks by cutting the line as close as  possible to the hook, pushing the hook barb out point first, cutting off  the hook barb using bolt cutters, and then removing the hook shank;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cut the fishing line as close as possible to ingested or  inaccessible hooks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Leave the bird in a safe enclosed space to recover until its  feathers are dry; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> After recovered, release seabirds by placing them on the sea  surface.</p>
