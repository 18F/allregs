                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the  meaning given them in the Act, or in subpart A or subpart V of part 61.</p><p class="depth0">Bulk terminal means any facility which receives liquid product  containing benzene by pipelines, marine vessels, tank trucks, or  railcars, and loads the product for further distribution into tank  trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.</p><p class="depth0">Car-sealed means having a seal that is placed on the device used to  change the position of a valve (e.g., from open to closed) such that the  position of the valve cannot be changed without breaking the seal and  requiring the replacement of the old seal, once broken, with a new seal.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means all equipment used for recovering or oxidizing  benzene vapors displaced from the affected facility.</p><p class="depth0">Incinerator means any enclosed combustion device that is used for  destroying organic compounds and that does not extract energy in the  form of steam or process heat. These devices do not rely on the heating  value of the waste gas to sustain efficient combustion. Auxiliary fuel  is burned in the device and the heat from the fuel flame heats the waste  gas to combustion temperature. Temperature is controlled by controlling  combustion air or fuel.</p><p class="depth0">Leak means any instrument reading of 10,000 ppmv or greater using  Method 21 of 40 CFR part 60, appendix A.</p><p class="depth0">Loading cycle means the time period from the beginning of filling a  tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel until flow to the control device  ceases, as measured by the flow indicator.</p><p class="depth0">Loading rack means the loading arms, pumps, meters, shutoff valves,  relief valves, and other piping and valves necessary to fill tank  trucks, railcars, or marine vessels.</p><p class="depth0">Marine vessel means any tank ship or tank barge which transports  liquid product such as benzene.</p><p class="depth0">Nonvapor tight means any tank truck, railcar, or marine vessel that  does not pass the required vapor-tightness test.</p><p class="depth0">Process heater means a device that transfers heat liberated by  burning fuel to fluids contained in tubes, except water that is heated  to produce steam.</p><p class="depth0">Steam generating unit means any enclosed combustion device that uses  fuel energy in the form of steam.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor collection system means any equipment located at the affected  facility used for containing benzene vapors displaced during the loading  of tank trucks, railcars, or marine vessels. This does not include the  vapor collection system that is part of any tank truck, railcar, or  marine vessel vapor collection manifold system.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor-tight marine vessel means a marine vessel with a benzene  product tank that has been demonstrated within the preceding 12 months  to have no leaks. This demonstration shall be made using Method 21 of  part 60, appendix A, during the last 20 percent of loading and during a  period when the vessel is being loaded at its maximum loading rate. A  reading of greater than 10,000 ppm as methane shall constitute a leak.  As an alternative, a marine vessel owner or operator may use the vapor- tightness test described in Sec. 61.304(f) to demonstrate vapor  tightness. A marine vessel operated at negative pressure is assumed to  be vapor-tight for the purpose of this standard.</p><p class="depth0">Vapor-tight tank truck or vapor-tight railcar means a tank truck or  railcar for which it has been demonstrated within the preceding 12  months that its   product tank will sustain a pressure change of not more than 750 pascals  within 5 minutes after it is pressurized to a minimum of 4,500 pascals.  This capability is to be demonstrated using the pressure test procedure  specified in Method 27 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60, and a pressure  measurement device which has a precision of [2.5 mm water and which is  capable of measuring above the pressure at which the tank truck or  railcar is to be tested for vapor tightness.
