                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. With the exception of activities identified in  paragraph (b) of this section, a State must conduct environmental  reviews of the potential environmental impacts of projects and  activities receiving assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Activities excluded from environmental reviews. A State must  conduct environmental reviews of source water protection activities  under Sec. 35.3535, unless the activities solely involve administration  (e.g., personnel, equipment, travel) or technical assistance. A State is  not required to conduct environmental reviews of all the other eligible  set-aside activities under Sec. 35.3535 because EPA has determined that,  due to their nature, they do not individually, cumulatively over time,  or in conjunction with other actions have a significant effect on the  quality of the human environment. A State does not need to include  provisions in its SERP for excluding these activities. Activities  excluded from environmental reviews remain subject to other applicable  Federal cross-cutting authorities under Sec. 35.3575.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Tier I environmental reviews. All projects that are assisted by  the State in amounts up to the amount of the capitalization grant  deposited into the Fund must be reviewed in accordance with a SERP that  is functionally equivalent to the review undertaken by EPA under the  National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). With the exception of  activities excluded from environmental reviews in paragraph (b) of this  section, activities for which a State provides assistance from  capitalization grant funds deposited into set-aside accounts must also  be reviewed in accordance with a SERP that is functionally equivalent to  the review undertaken by EPA under the NEPA. A State may elect to apply  the procedures at 40 CFR part 6 and related subparts or apply its own  ``NEPA-like'' SERP for conducting environmental reviews, provided that  the following elements are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Legal foundation. A State must have the legal authority to  conduct environmental reviews of projects and activities receiving  assistance. The legal authority and supporting documentation must  specify:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The mechanisms to implement mitigation measures to ensure that a  project or activity is environmentally sound;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The legal remedies available to the public to challenge  environmental review determinations and enforcement actions;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The State agency that is primarily responsible for conducting  environmental reviews; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The extent to which environmental review responsibilities will  be delegated to local recipients and will be subject to oversight by the  primary State agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Interdisciplinary approach. A State must employ an  interdisciplinary approach for identifying and mitigating adverse  environmental effects including, but not limited to, those associated  with other cross-cutting Federal environmental authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Decision documentation. A State must fully document the  information, processes, and premises that influence its decisions to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Proceed with a project or activity contained in a finding of no  significant impact (FNSI) following documentation in an environmental  assessment (EA);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Proceed or not proceed with a project or activity contained in  a record of decision (ROD) following preparation of a full environmental  impact statement (EIS);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Reaffirm or modify a decision contained in a previously issued  categorical exclusion (CE), EA/FNSI or EIS/ROD following a mandatory 5  year environmental reevaluation of a proposed project or activity; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If a State elects to implement processes for either  partitioning an environmental review or categorically   excluding projects or activities from environmental review, the State  must similarly document these processes in its proposed SERP.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Public notice and participation. A State must provide public  notice when: a CE is issued or rescinded; a FNSI is issued but before it  becomes effective; a decision that is issued 5 years earlier is  reaffirmed or revised; and prior to initiating an EIS. Except with  respect to a public notice of a CE or reaffirmation of a previous  decision, a formal public comment period must be provided during which  no action on a project or activity will be allowed. A public hearing or  meeting must be held for all projects and activities except for those  having little or no environmental effect.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Alternatives consideration. A State must have evaluation  criteria and processes which allow for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Comparative evaluation among alternatives, including the  beneficial and adverse consequences on the existing environment, the  future environment, and individual sensitive environmental issues that  are identified by project management or through public participation;  and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Devising appropriate near-term and long-range measures to  avoid, minimize, or mitigate adverse impacts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tier II environmental reviews. A State may elect to apply an  alternative SERP to all projects and activities (except those activities  excluded from environmental reviews in paragraph (b) of this section)  for which a State provides assistance in amounts that are greater than  the amount of the capitalization grant deposited into the Fund or set- aside accounts, provided that the process:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Is supported by a legal foundation which establishes the State's  authority to review projects and activities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Responds to other environmental objectives of the State;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Provides for comparative evaluations among alternatives and  accounts for beneficial and adverse consequences to the existing and  future environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Adequately documents the information, processes, and premises  that influence an environmental determination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provides for notice to the public of proposed projects and  activities and for the opportunity to comment on alternatives and to  examine environmental review documents. For projects or activities  determined by the State to be controversial, a public hearing must be  held.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Categorical exclusions (CEs). A State may identify categories of  actions which do not individually, cumulatively over time, or in  conjunction with other actions have a significant effect on the quality  of the human environment and which the State will exclude from the  substantive environmental review requirements of its SERP. Any  procedures under this paragraph must provide for extraordinary  circumstances in which a normally excluded action may have a significant  environmental effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Environmental reviews for refinanced projects or reimbursed  project costs. A State must conduct an environmental review which  considers the impacts of a project based on conditions of the site prior  to initiation of the project. Failure to comply with the environmental  review requirements cannot be justified on the grounds that costs have  already been incurred, impacts have already been caused, or contractual  obligations have been made prior to the binding commitment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> EPA approval process. The RA must review and approve any State  ``NEPA-like'' and alternative procedures to ensure that the requirements  for Tier I and Tier II environmental reviews have been met. The RA will  conduct these reviews on the basis of the criteria for evaluating NEPA- like reviews contained in Appendix A to this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Modifications to approved SERPs. Significant changes to State  environmental review procedures must be approved by the RA.</p>
