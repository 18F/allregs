                                Sec. 219.211  Analysis and follow-up.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The laboratory designated in appendix B to this part undertakes  prompt analysis of provided under this subpart, consistent with the need  to develop all relevant information and produce a complete report.  Specimens are analyzed for alcohol, controlled substances, and non- controlled substances specified by FRA under protocols specified by FRA.  These substances may be tested for in any form, whether naturally or  synthetically derived. Specimens may be analyzed for other impairing  substances specified by FRA as necessary to the particular accident  investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Results of post-accident toxicological testing for controlled  substances conducted under this subpart are reported to the railroad's  Medical Review Officer and the employee. The MRO and the railroad must  treat the test results and any information concerning medical use or  administration of drugs provided under this subpart in the same  confidential manner as if subject to subpart H of this part, except  where publicly disclosed by FRA or the National Transportation Safety  Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> With respect to a surviving employee, a test reported as  positive for alcohol or a controlled substance by the designated  laboratory must be reviewed by the railroad's Medical Review Officer  with respect to any claim of use or administration of medications  (consistent with Sec. 219.103) that could account for the laboratory  findings. The Medical Review Officer must promptly report the results of  each review to the Associate Administrator for Safety, FRA, Washington,  DC 20590. Such report must be in writing and must reference the  employing railroad, accident/incident date, and location, and the  envelope must be marked ``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: ATTENTION  ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM MANAGER.'' The report must state whether the MRO  reported the test result to the employing railroad as positive or  negative and the basis of any determination that analytes detected by  the laboratory derived from authorized use (including a statement of the  compound prescribed, dosage/frequency, and any restrictions imposed by  the authorized medical practitioner). Unless specifically requested by  FRA in writing, the Medical Review Officer may not disclose to FRA the  underlying physical condition for which any medication was authorized or  administered. The FRA is not bound by the railroad Medical Review  Officer's determination, but that determination will be considered by  FRA in relation to the accident/incident investigation and with respect  to any enforcement action under consideration.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> To the extent permitted by law, FRA treats test results  indicating medical use of controlled substances consistent with  Sec. 219.103 (and other information concerning medically authorized drug  use or administration provided incident to such testing) as  administratively confidential and withholds public disclosure, except  where it is necessary to consider this information in an accident  investigation in relation to determination of probable cause. (However,  as further provided in this section, FRA may provide results of testing  under this subpart and supporting documentation to the National  Transportation Safety Board.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An employee may respond in writing to the results of the test  prior to the preparation of any final investigation report concerning  the accident or incident. An employee wishing to respond may do so by  letter addressed to the Alcohol/Drug Program Manager, Office of Safety,  FRA, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Washington, DC 20590 within 45 days of  receipt of the test results. Any such submission must refer to the  accident date, railroad and location, must state the position occupied  by the employee on the date of the accident/incident, and must identify  any information contained therein that the employee requests be withheld  from public disclosure on grounds of personal privacy (but the decision  whether to honor such request will be made by the FRA on the basis of  controlling law).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The toxicology report may contain a statement of  pharmacological significance to assist FRA and other parties in  understanding the data reported. No such statement may be construed as a  finding of probable cause in the accident or incident.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> With the exception of post-accident test results for non- controlled substances, the toxicology report is a part of the report of  the accident/incident and therefore subject to the limitation of 49  U.S.C. 20903 (prohibiting use of the report for any purpose in a civil  action for damages resulting from a matter mentioned in the report).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> It is in the public interest to ensure that any railroad  disciplinary actions that may result from accidents and incidents for  which testing is required under this subpart are disposed of on the  basis of the most complete and reliable information available so that  responsive action will be appropriate. Therefore, during the interval  between an accident or incident and the date that the railroad receives  notification of the results of the toxicological analysis, any provision  of collective bargaining agreements establishing maximum periods for  charging employees with rule violations, or for holding an  investigation, may not be deemed to run as to any offense involving the  accident or incident (i.e., such periods must be tolled).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> This provision may not be construed to excuse the railroad from  any obligation to timely charge an employee (or provide other actual  notice) where the railroad obtains sufficient information relating to  alcohol or drug use, impairment or possession or other rule violations  prior to the receipt to toxicological analysis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> This provision does not authorize holding any employee out of  service pending receipt of toxicological analysis; nor does it restrict  a railroad from taking such action in an appropriate case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 219.201 (with respect to non- qualifying events), each specimen (including each split specimen)  provided under this subpart is retained for not less than three months  following the date of the accident or incident (two years from the date  of the accident or incident in the case of a specimen testing positive  for alcohol or a controlled substance). Post-mortem specimens may be  made available to the National Transportation Safety Board (on request).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employee (donor) may, within 60 days of the date of the  toxicology report, request that his or her split specimen be tested by  the designated laboratory or by another laboratory certified by Health  and Human Services under that Department's Guidelines for Federal  Workplace Drug Testing Programs that has available an appropriate,  validated assay for the fluid and compound declared positive. Since some  analytes may deteriorate during storage, detected levels of the compound  shall, as technically appropriate, be reported and considered  corroborative of the original test result. Any request for a retest  shall be in writing, specify the railroad, accident date and location,  be signed by the employee/donor, be addressed to the Associate  Administrator for Safety, Federal Railroad Administration, Washington,  DC 20590, and be designated ``ADMINISTRATIVELY CONFIDENTIAL: ATTENTION  ALCOHOL/DRUG PROGRAM MANAGER.'' The expense of any employee-requested  split specimen test at a laboratory other than the laboratory designated  under this subpart shall be borne by the employee.
