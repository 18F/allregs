                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In the event that a formal investigative proceeding is conducted  pursuant to a specific order entered by the NCUA Board or by its General  Counsel, then any party who is compelled or requested to provide  documentary evidence or testimony as part of such proceeding shall, upon  request, be shown a copy of the NCUA Board's or its delegate's order.  Copies of such orders shall not be provided for their retention to such  persons requesting same except in the sole discretion of the General  Counsel or his designee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any party compelled to appear, or who appears by request or  permission of the officer conducting the investigation, in person at a  formal investigative proceeding may be accompanied, represented and  advised by counsel who is a member of the bar of the highest court of  any state; provided however, that all witnesses in such proceeding shall  be sequestered, and unless permitted in the discretion of the officer  conducting the investigation, no witness or the counsel accompanying any  such witness shall be permitted to be present during the examination of  any other witness called in such proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The right of a witness to be accompanied, represented and  advised by counsel shall mean the right to have an attorney present  during any formal investigative proceeding and to have the attorney--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Advise such person before, during and after such testimony;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Question such person briefly at the conclusion of his testimony  to clarify any answers such person has given; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Make summary notes during such testimony solely for the use of  such person.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From time to time, in the discretion of the officer, it shall be  necessary for persons other than the witness and his or her counsel to  attend non-public investigative proceedings. For example, the officer  may deem it appropriate that outside counsel to the NCUA Board attend  and advise him or her concerning the proceeding including the  examination of a particular witness. In these circumstances, outside  counsel would not be an officer as that term is used. In other  circumstances, it may be appropriate that a technical expert (such as an  accountant) accompany the witness and his or her counsel in order to  assist counsel in understanding technical issues. These latter  circumstances should be rare, are left to the discretion of the officer  conducting the investigation, and shall not in any event be allowed to  serve as a ruse to coordinate testimony between witnesses, to oversee or  supervise the testimony of any witnesses, or   otherwise defeat the beneficial effects of the witness sequestration  rule.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The officer conducting the investigation may report to the NCUA  Board any instances where any witness or counsel has been guilty of  dilatory, obstructionist or contumacious conduct during the course of a  formal investigative proceeding or any other instance of violations of  these rules. The NCUA Board will thereupon take such further action as  the circumstance may warrant including barring the offending person from  further participation in the particular formal investigative proceeding  or even from further practice before the Board.</p>
