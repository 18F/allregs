A revision to the Texas SIP was submitted on January 10, 1996, which included negative declarations for various categories. Section 172(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 requires nonattainment areas to adopt, at a minimum, the reasonably available control technology (RACT) to reduce emissions from existing sources. Pursuant to section 182(b)(2) of the Act, for moderate and above ozone nonattainment areas, the EPA has identified 13 categories for such sources and developed the Control Technique Guidelines (CTGs) or Alternate Control Techniques (ACTs) documents to implement RACT at those sources. When no major volatile organic compound

(VOC) sources for a source category exist in a nonattainment area, a State may submit a negative declaration for that category. Texas submitted negative declarations for the areas and source categories listed in this paragraph (c)(103). For the Beaumont/Port Arthur region, negative declarations were submitted for the following eight categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For Dallas/Fort Worth, negative declarations were submitted for six categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, shipbuilding and repair, autobody refinishing, plastic part coatings-business machines, and offset lithography. For the Houston/Galveston area, negative declarations were submitted for seven categories: clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography. For El Paso, negative declarations were submitted for nine categories: industrial wastewater, clean-up solvents, aerospace coatings, shipbuilding and repair, wood furniture, plastic part coatings-business machines, plastic part coatings-others, autobody refinishing, and offset lithography.
