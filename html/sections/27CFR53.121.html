                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If the title to, or ownership of, an article  taxable under chapter 32 of the Code is transferred from the  manufacturer, producer, or importer thereof, and, under the law, no tax  attaches to such transfer, the subsequent sale, lease, or use of such  article by the transferee is subject to tax to the same extent and  manner as   if such transferee were the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the  article. The following examples illustrate this rule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The surviving spouse, child or children, executors or  administrators, or other legal representatives, as the case may be, of a  deceased manufacturer, producer, or importer of taxable articles, incur  liability for tax on all such articles sold by them.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A receiver or trustee in bankruptcy who under a court order  conducts or liquidates the business of a manufacturer, producer, or  importer of taxable articles, incurs liability for tax on all taxable  articles sold by him, regardless of whether the articles were  manufactured, produced, or imported before or after he took charge of  the business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An assignee for the benefit of creditors of a manufacturer,  producer, or importer incurs liability for tax with respect to all  taxable articles sold by him as such assignee.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If one or more member of a partnership withdraw, or if new  partners are admitted, the new partnership so constituted incurs  liability for tax on all taxable articles sold by it regardless of when  such articles were manufactured, produced, or imported.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A person who acquires title to taxable articles as a result of  default of the manufacturer, producer, or importer pursuant to an  agreement under the terms of which the articles were pledged as  collateral incurs liability for tax with respect to his sale of the  articles so acquired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A person who succeeds to the business of a manufacturer,  producer, or importer of taxable articles, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A corporation which results from a consolidation, merger, or  reorganization;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A corporation which acquires the business of an individual or  partnership; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A stockholder in a corporation who, after its dissolution,  continues the business;  incurs liability for the tax on all taxable articles sold by such  person. However, where a manufacturer, producer, or importer sells only  his assets, rather than ownership of his business, he incurs liability  for tax on the sale of any taxable articles included in such assets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Transfer of title to damaged articles. If title to a damaged  taxable article is transferred by the manufacturer, producer, or  importer thereof to a carrier or insurance company in adjustment of a  damage claim, such transfer is not considered a taxable sale of the  article. If the article is usable, even though damaged, the carrier or  insurance company incurs liability for tax on its sale, lease, or use of  the article. Where the article has been damaged to the extent that its  only value is as scrap, and it is not restored to usable condition, sale  thereof by the carrier or insurance company is not subject to tax.</p>
