They may be qualified by marker plate, number  plate, letter plate, marker light, shape and color of semaphore   blades or any combination thereof, subject to the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Night aspects of roadway signals, except qualifying  appurtenances, shall be shown by lights; day aspects by lights or  semaphore arms. A single white light shall not be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reflector lenses or buttons or other devices which depend for  visibility upon reflected light from an external source shall not be  used hereafter in night aspects, except qualifying appurtenances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The aspects of cab signals shall be shown by lights or by  illuminated letters or numbers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each aspect displayed by a signal shall be identified by a name  and shall indicate action to be taken. Only one name and indication  shall apply to those aspects indicating the same action to be taken; the  same aspect shall not be used with any other name and indication.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The fundamental indications of signal aspects shall conform to  the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A red light, a series of horizontal lights or a semaphore blade  in a horizontal position shall be used to indicate stop.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A yellow light, a lunar light, or a series of lights or a  semaphore blade in the upper or lower quadrant at an angle of  approximately 45 degrees to the vertical, shall be used to indicate that  speed is to be restricted and stop may be required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A green light, a series of vertical lights, or a semaphore blade  in a vertical position in the upper quadrant or 60 or 90 in the lower  quadrant shall be used to indicate proceed at authorized speed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The names, indications, and aspects of roadway and cab signals  shall be defined in the carrier's Operating Rule Book or Special  Instructions. Modifications shall be filed with the FRA within thirty  days after such modifications become effective.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The absence of a qualifying appurtenance, the failure of a lamp  in a light signal, or a false restrictive position of an arm of a  semaphore signal shall not cause the display of a less restrictive  aspect than intended.
