Under the equal opportunity clause  contained in section 202 of Executive Order 11246, as amended, employers  are prohibited from discriminating against employees   or applicants for employment because of religion or national origin, and  must take affirmative action to insure that applicants are employed, and  that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their  religion or national origin.

Special attention shall be directed toward executive and  middle-management levels, where employment problems relating to religion  and national origin are most likely to occur. Based upon the findings of  such reviews, employers shall undertake appropriate outreach and  positive recruitment activities, such as those listed below, in order to  remedy existing deficiencies. It is not contemplated that employers  necessarily will undertake all of the listed activities.
