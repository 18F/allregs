                                Sec. 21.8120  Vocational training, services, and assistance.

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purposes. An eligible child may receive training, services, and  assistance to enable the child to prepare for and participate in  vocational training or employment.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Training permitted. VA and the child will select vocationally  oriented courses of study and training, completion of which usually  results in a diploma, certificate, degree, qualification for licensure,  or direct placement in employment. The educational and training services  to be provided include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Remedial, deficiency, and refresher training; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training that leads to an identifiable vocational goal. Under  this program, VA may authorize all forms of programs that Sec. Sec.  21.122 through 21.132 describe. This includes education and training  programs in institutions of higher education. VA may authorize the  education and training at an undergraduate or graduate degree level,  only if the degree program is predominantly vocational in nature. For an  eligible child to participate in a graduate degree program, the graduate  degree must be a requirement for entry into the child's vocational goal.  For example, a master's degree is required to engage in social work. The  program of training is predominantly vocational in content if the  majority of the instruction provides the technical skills and knowledge  employers generally regard as specific to, and required for, entry into  the child's vocational goal.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cost of education and training services. The CP or VRC will  consider the cost of training in selecting a facility when:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> There is more than one facility in the area in which the child  resides that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meets the requirements for approval under Sec. Sec. 21.290  through 21.298 (except as provided by Sec. 21.8286(b)),</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Can provide the training, services and other supportive  assistance the child's individualized written plan of vocational  rehabilitation specifies, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Is within reasonable commuting distance; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)(iii)(B)</em> do not apply), and Sec. 21.372 in a  manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31  program.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Accessible courses not locally available. If suitable vocational  training courses are not available in the area in which the child lives,  or if they are available but not accessible to the child, VA may make  other arrangements. These arrangements may include, but are not limited  to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Transportation of the child, but not the child's family,  personal effects, or household belongings, to another area where  necessary services are available; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Use of an individual instructor to provide necessary training in  a manner comparable to that for veterans under the 38 U.S.C. chapter 31  program, as Sec. 21.146 describes.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 1804(b), (c), 1814)</p><p class="depth3">Evaluation and Improvement of Vocational Potential</p>
