                            <p class="depth0">USDA agencies' implementation procedures identify the administrative  actions available to remedy a finding of research misconduct. Such  actions may include the recovery of funds, correction of the research  record, debarment of the researcher(s) that engaged in the research  misconduct, proper attribution, or any other action deemed appropriate  to remedy the instance(s) of research misconduct. The agency should  consider the seriousness of the misconduct, including, but not limited  to, the degree to which the misconduct was knowingly conducted,  intentional, or reckless; was an isolated event or part of a pattern; or  had significant impact on the research record, research subjects, other  researchers, institutions, or the public welfare. In determining the  appropriate administrative action, the appropriate agency must impose a  remedy that is commensurate with the infraction as described in the  finding of research misconduct.</p>
