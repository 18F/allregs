                            <p class="depth0">The National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), as amended,  directs that, to the fullest extent possible, the policies, regulations,  and public laws of the United States shall be interpreted and  administered in accordance with the policies set forth in NEPA. All  agencies of the Federal Government shall comply with the procedures in  section 102(2) of NEPA except where compliance would be inconsistent  with other statutory requirements. The regulations in this part  implement section 102(2) of NEPA in a manner that is consistent with  FDA's authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and the  Public Health Service Act. This part also supplements the regulations  for implementing the procedural provisions of NEPA that were published  by the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) in 40 CFR parts 1500  through 1508 and the procedures included in the ``HHS General  Administration Manual, part 30: Environmental Protection'' (45 FR 76519  to 76534, November 19, 1980).</p>
