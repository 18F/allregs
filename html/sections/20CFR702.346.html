A waiver

of the right to appear and present evidence and allegations as to facts and law shall be made in writing and filed with the Chief Administrative Law Judge or the administrative law judge. Where such a waiver has been filed by all parties, and they do not appear before the administrative law judge personally or by representative, the administrative law judge shall make a record of the relevant written evidence submitted by the parties, together with any pleadings they may submit with respect to the issues in the case. Such documents shall be considered as all of the evidence in the case and the decision shall be based on them.</p>
