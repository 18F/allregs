                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Labor agency responsible for collecting the  claim shall waive the collection of interest on the debt or any portion  of the debt which is paid within 30 days after the date on which  interest began to accrue. This 30-day period may be extended for another  30 days on a case-by-case basis, if the agency reasonably determines  that such action is appropriate, and is in accordance with these  regulations. Also, the responsible agency may waive charges assessed  under this subpart, based on criteria specified in the Federal Claims  Collection Standards relating to the compromise of claims (without  regard to the amount of the debt), or if the agency determines that  collection of these charges would be against equity and good conscience  or not be in the best interests of the United States. Waiver under the  first sentence of this paragraph is mandatory. Under the second and  third sentences waiver is permissive and may be exercised only in  accordance with the standards set by these regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Agencies may waive interest and other charges under appropriate  circumstances, including, for example:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pending consideration of a request for reconsideration,  administrative review, or waiver under a permissive statute,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the agency has accepted an installment plan, there is no  fault or lack of good faith on the part of the debtor, and the amount of  interest is large enough in relation to the size of the debt and the  amount of the installments that the debtor can reasonably afford to pay  so that the debt can never be repaid, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If repayment of the full amount of the debt is made after the  date upon which interest and other charges became payable and the  estimated costs of recovering the residual interest balance exceed the  amount owed the Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where a mandatory waiver or review statute applies, interest and  related charges may not be assessed for those periods during which  collection action must be suspended.</p>
