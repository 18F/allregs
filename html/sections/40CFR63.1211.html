You are not subject to this requirement, however, if you  submit a Notification of Compliance under Sec.  63.1207(j) prior to the  compliance date. Upon inclusion of the Documentation of Compliance in  the operating record, hazardous waste burning incinerators, cement  kilns, and lightweight aggregate kilns regulated under the interim  standards of Sec. Sec.  63.1203, 63.1204, and 63.1205 are no longer  subject to compliance with the previously applicable Notification of  Compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Documentation of Compliance must identify the applicable  emission standards under this subpart and the limits on the operating  parameters under Sec.  63.1209 that will ensure compliance with those  emission standards.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> You must include a signed and dated certification in the  Documentation of Compliance that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Required CEMs and CMS are installed, calibrated, and  continuously operating in compliance with the requirements of this  subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on an engineering evaluation prepared under your  direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed to ensure  that qualified personnel properly gathered and evaluated the information  and supporting documentation, and considering at a minimum the design,  operation, and maintenance characteristics of the combustor and  emissions control equipment, the types, quantities, and characteristics  of feedstreams, and available emissions data:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> You are in compliance with the emission standards of this  subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The limits on the operating parameters under Sec.  63.1209  ensure compliance with the emission standards of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> You must comply with the emission standards and operating  parameter limits specified in the Documentation of Compliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Data compression. You may submit a written request to the  Administrator for approval to use data compression techniques to record  data from CMS, including CEMS, on a frequency less than that required by  Sec.  63.1209. You must submit the request for review and approval as  part of the comprehensive performance test plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> You must record a data value at least once each ten minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For each CEMS or operating parameter for which you request to  use data compression techniques, you must recommend:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A fluctuation limit that defines the maximum permissible  deviation of a new data value from a previously generated value without  requiring you to revert to recording each one-minute value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If you exceed a fluctuation limit, you must record each one- minute value for a period of time not less than ten minutes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If neither the fluctuation limit nor the data compression limit  are exceeded during that period of time, you may reinitiate recording  data values on a frequency of at least once each ten minutes; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A data compression limit defined as the closest level to an  operating parameter limit or emission standard at which reduced data  recording is allowed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Within this level and the operating parameter limit or emission  standard, you must record each one-minute average.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The data compression limit should reflect a level at which you  are unlikely to exceed the specific operating parameter limit or  emission standard, considering its averaging period, with the addition  of a new one-minute average.
