                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Security. The installation commander (or designee) and officials of the on-base financial institutions shall work with the installation security authorities to establish an understanding as to each entity's responsibilities. The

on-base financial institutions are encouraged to establish an ongoing relationship with installation security authorities on all matters of asset protection.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A written agreement shall be established outlining the security procedures that the financial institution will follow and the role that installation security authorities will play with regard to alarms, movement of cash, and procedures to be followed in response to criminal activity (e.g., armed robbery).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cash and other assets in on-base banking offices and credit unions are the property of those financial institutions. Maintenance of alarms and use of armored cars is the sole responsibility of the on-base financial institution. The on-base financial institution is also solely responsible for the guarding or escorting of cash unless the installation commander determines that providing such services is desirable or necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Central locator services. Military locator services shall be provided per the guidelines in subpart B of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When appropriate, installations will process financial institution requests for central locator service to obtain military addresses of active duty personnel. This service will be used to locate persons for settling accounts, and recovering funds on checks that did not clear or loans that are delinquent or in default (see DoD Directive 1344.9 \6\). If delinquent loans or dishonored checks are not recouped within 48 hours, financial institutions operating on DoD installations may bring this information to the attention of the local commander, bank liaison officer, or other designee for assistance in effecting restitution of the amount due, if not otherwise prohibited by law. The financial institution will pay the appropriate fee for each request to the respective Military Department.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\6\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 231.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The DoD Components shall assist financial institutions to locate DoD personnel whose whereabouts cannot be locally determined. The request should be on the financial institution's letterhead, include the Service member's name and social security number, and cite the cognizant Military Service regulation that authorizes the use of locator services. If a financial institution needs immediate service, the cognizant institution official should contact the bank or credit union liaison officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For addresses of Department of the Army active, retired, separated and civilian personnel, financial institutions may telephone (703) 325-3732 or write to: Department of the Army Worldwide Locator, U.S. Army Enlisted Record and Evaluation Center, 8899 E. 56th Street, Indianapolis, IN 46249-5301.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For addresses of Navy active, retired, separated and civilian personnel, financial institutions may telephone (901) 874-3388 or write to: Navy Personnel Command, PERS-312F, 5720 Integrity Drive, Millington, TN 38055-3120.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For addresses of Department of the Air Force active, retired, separated and civilian personnel, financial institutions may telephone (210) 565-2660 or write to: Air Force Personnel Center, MSIMDL Suite 50, 550 C Street West, Randolph AFB, TX 78150-4752.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For addresses of United States Marine Corps active, retired, separated and civilian personnel, financial institutions may telephone (703) 784-3942 or write to:</p><p class="depth4">Active

(1) An on-base financial institution may use the unofficial section of that installation's daily bulletin, provided space is available, to inform DoD personnel of financial services and announce seminars, consumer information programs, and other matters of broad general interest. Announcements of free financial counseling services are encouraged. Such

media may not be used for competitive or comparative advertising of, for example, specific interest rates on savings or loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An on-base financial institution may use the unofficial section of that installation's daily bulletin, provided space is available, to inform DoD personnel of financial services and announce seminars, consumer information programs, and other matters of broad general interest. Announcements of free financial counseling services are encouraged. Such

media may not be used for competitive or comparative advertising of, for example, specific interest rates on savings or loans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An on-base financial institution may use installation bulletin boards, newsletters or web pages to post general information that complements the installation's financial counseling programs and promotes financial responsibility and thrift. Message center services may distribute a reasonable number of announcements to units for use on bulletin boards so long as this does not impose an unreasonable workload.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An on-base financial institution may include an insert in the installation's newcomers package (or equivalent). This insert should benefit newcomers by identifying the financial services that are available on the installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DoD Directive 5120.20 \7\ prevents use of the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service to promote a specific financial institution.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\7\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 231.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Off-base financial institutions are not permitted to distribute competitive literature or forms on the installation. These institutions, however, may use commercial advertising, mailings or telecommunications to reach their customers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Advertising in government-funded (official) installation papers is not permitted with the exception of insert advertising in the Stars and Stripes overseas. Installation newspapers funded by advertisers are not official publications and, thus, may include advertising paid for by any financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Installation activities, including Military Exchange Services and concessionaire outlets, shall not permit the distribution of literature from off-base financial institutions if there is an on-base financial institution. This does not prevent the Military Exchange Services from distributing literature on affinity credit card services that those Military Exchange Services may acquire centrally through competitive solicitation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Automated teller machine (ATM) service. On-base financial institutions are encouraged to install ATMs at those installation(s) on which they are located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial institutions that propose to install ATMs on DoD installations shall bear the cost of ATM installation, maintenance and operation. The installation commander may enter into an agreement with the on-base financial institution wherein the installation may acquire and provide ATMs to on-base financial institutions under certain circumstances, such as when it is advantageous to the government to have one or more ATMs available for use but the acquisition cost to the financial institution is prohibitive. No ATM shall be purchased by an installation unless approved by the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee). In all such cases, installation costs and all logistic support shall be borne by the financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ATM approval authority is as shown:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The installation commander has approval authority when an on-base financial institution wishes to place an ATM on the installation. This approval should be reflected as an amendment to the operating agreement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where there is no on-base financial institution, follow the solicitation procedures to obtain financial services set forth in Secs. 231.5(c) and 231.7(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The availability of ATM service shall not preclude the later establishment of a banking office should conditions change on an installation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Proposals by an installation commander to install ATMs on domestic installations from other than on-base financial institutions, including the Military Exchange Services, morale, welfare and recreational activities and/or other nonappropriated fund instrumentalities, shall be considered only when:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ATM service is unavailable or existing service is inadequate, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The on-base financial institution(s) either declines to provide the service, fails to improve existing service so that it is adequate, or does not formally respond to the request for such service within 30 days of the date of the request. Any ATM service from

other than on-base financial institutions is considered an exception to policy. The procedures to establish an on-base financial institution set forth in Secs. 231.5(c) and 231.7(b) shall be followed when soliciting for such ATM services. Proposals offering shared-access ATMs (e.g., ATMs operated by two or more financial institutions where their accountholders are not assessed any or all fees applicable to nonaccountholders) shall receive preference.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> ATM service from foreign banking institutions may be authorized on overseas installations with or without MBFs operated under contract where the installation or community commander determines that a bonafide need exists to support local national hires. On installations with MBFs operated under contract, the MBFs shall be the primary source of the ATM service except when a determination has been made by the cognizant contract program office that providing the service is either not cost effective or precluded by pertinent status of forces agreements, other intergovernmental agreements or host-country law. In those instances where ATM service from foreign banking institutions is authorized and provided by other than the on-base financial institution, ATM connectivity shall be limited to host country networks and the ATMs shall dispense only local currency (no U.S. dollars). The operating agreement covering ATM service shall be negotiated by the installation or community commander and submitted for approval by the appropriate Combatant Commander (or designee) prior to its execution. A copy of the operating agreement will be forwarded through DoD Component channels to the DFAS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Domestic and international treasury general accounts. In cases where authorization will be required for the on-base banking office or credit union to act as a Treasury General Account (TGA) domestic depositary (or, on overseas installations, an International Treasury General Account (ITGA) depository), the financial institution shall satisfy the risk management standard established by the Secretary of the Treasury. Local operating funds may be used if the on-base financial institution requests reimbursement for costs incurred. On-base financial institutions shall accept deposits for credit to the TGA (or ITGA) when so authorized.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Staffing. (1) On-base financial institutions shall be staffed adequately (i.e., commensurate with industry standards for similar numbers of accountholders and financial services rendered). Staffing at overseas MBFs operated under DoD contract shall be maintained within negotiated ceilings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On-base financial institutions shall be staffed adequately (i.e., commensurate with industry standards for similar numbers of accountholders and financial services rendered). Staffing at overseas MBFs operated under DoD contract shall be maintained within negotiated ceilings.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> All staffing shall comply fully with applicable equal employment opportunity laws and with the spirit of DoD equal employment opportunity policies as set forth in DoD Directive 1440.1. \8\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\8\ See footnote 1 to Sec. 231.1(a).---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> DoD personnel, excluding military retirees and their dependents, may not serve as directors of domestic or foreign banking institutions operating banking offices on those DoD installations where they currently are assigned. This does not preclude a member of a Reserve Component, who has been serving as a director of a domestic or foreign banking institution operating a banking office on a DoD installation, from retaining his or her directorship if called to active duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> DoD personnel may not be detailed to duty with an on-base financial institution located on a DoD installation. Off-duty personnel, however, may be employed by an on-base financial institution subject to approval by the installation commander (or designee). Such employment must not interfere with the performance of the individual's official duties and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Departure clearance. The installation commander establishes the clearance policy for all DoD personnel leaving the installation. The on-base financial institutions shall be included as places requiring clearance. The purpose of a clearance is to report change of address, reaffirm allotments or outstanding debts, and receive financial counseling, if desired or appropriate. Clearance may not be denied in order to collect debts or resolve disputes with financial institution management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Financial education. (1) Officials of on-base financial institutions shall be invited to take part in seminars to educate personnel on personal financial management and financial services. Financial institutions shall be encouraged to provide financial education and counseling services as an integral part of their financial service offerings. Officials of on-base financial institutions shall submit advance briefing texts for approval by the installation commander to ensure that the program is not used to promote services of a specific financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Officials of on-base financial institutions shall be invited to take part in seminars to educate personnel on personal financial management and financial services. Financial institutions shall be encouraged to provide financial education and counseling services as an integral part of their financial service offerings. Officials of on-base financial institutions shall submit advance briefing texts for approval by the installation commander to ensure that the program is not used to promote services of a specific financial institution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> DoD personnel who tender uncollectible checks, overdraw their accounts or fail to meet their financial obligations in a proper and timely manner damage their credit reputation and adversely affect the public image of all government personnel. For uniformed personnel, military financial counselors and legal advisors shall recommend workable repayment plans that avoid further endangering credit ratings and counsel affected personnel to protect their credit standing and career. Counselors shall ensure that such personnel are aware of the stigma associated with bankruptcy and difficulties in obtaining future credit at reasonable rates and terms and shall recommend its use only when no other alternative will alleviate the situation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Operating agreements. (1) Before operations of an on-base banking office or credit union begin, a written operating agreement (Appendix C of this part) and the appropriate real estate outgrant (i.e., a lease, permit or license issued as identified in Secs. 231.5(e), 231.5(f), 231.5(g), 231.7(d), 231.7(e) and 231.7(f) shall be negotiated directly between the installation commander and officials of the designated financial institution. Thereafter, the operating agreement shall be jointly reviewed by the installation commander and the financial institution at least once every 5 years. The operating agreement shall define the basic relationship between the on-base financial institution and the installation commander and identify mutual support activities such as hours of operation, service fees and security provided. One copy of the agreement shall be sent through command channels to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee). A copy of the agreement shall be maintained by the installation commander and the banking office or on-base credit union. At a minimum, the agreement shall include the following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before operations of an on-base banking office or credit union begin, a written operating agreement (Appendix C of this part) and the appropriate real estate outgrant (i.e., a lease, permit or license issued as identified in Secs. 231.5(e), 231.5(f), 231.5(g), 231.7(d), 231.7(e) and 231.7(f) shall be negotiated directly between the installation commander and officials of the designated financial institution. Thereafter, the operating agreement shall be jointly reviewed by the installation commander and the financial institution at least once every 5 years. The operating agreement shall define the basic relationship between the on-base financial institution and the installation commander and identify mutual support activities such as hours of operation, service fees and security provided. One copy of the agreement shall be sent through command channels to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee). A copy of the agreement shall be maintained by the installation commander and the banking office or on-base credit union. At a minimum, the agreement shall include the following provisions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Identification of services to be rendered and the conditions for service. Full financial services shall be provided where feasible. Agreements, however, may not restrict either entity's right to renegotiate services and fees.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agreement by both parties that they will comply with this part and DoD Directive 1000.11 (32 CFR part 230).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Agreement by the on-base financial institution that it will furnish copies of its financial reports and other local publications on an ``as needed'' basis in response to a formal request from the installation commander (or designee).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Agreement that the on-base financial institution will indemnify and hold harmless the U.S. Government from (and against) any loss, expense, claim, or demand to which the U.S. Government may be subjected as a result of death, loss, destruction, or damage in conjunction with the use and occupancy of the premises caused in whole or in part by agents or employees of the on-base financial institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Agreement that neither the Department of Defense nor its representatives shall be responsible or liable for the financial operation of the on-base financial institution or for any loss (including criminal losses), expense, or claim for damages arising from operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Agreement by the on-base financial institution (or any successor) that it will provide no less than 180 days advance written notice to the installation commander before ceasing operations.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Specification of the security services to be provided for guarding cash shipments, at times of unusual risk to the financial institution and to avoid excessive insurance costs charged to that institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Statement that the physical security for cash and negotiable items will be in a manner consistent with the requirements of the on-base financial institution's insurer. A copy of those

requirements will be provided to the installation commander on request.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ix)</em> Statement that the financial institution, whenever possible, will accommodate local command requests for lectures and printed materials for consumer credit education programs. Officials invited to participate in such programs shall not use the occasion to promote the exclusive services of a particular financial institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(x)</em> Agreement that the financial institution will reimburse the installation for the provision of logistical support (such as custodial, janitorial, and other services provided by the government) at rates set forth in the lease or agreement between the installation and the financial institution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(xi)</em> Statement that on-base financial institution operations shall be terminated, when required, under provisions specified in this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Approved expansion of services will be documented as an amendment to the existing operating agreement between the installation commander and the on-base financial institution. The amendment to the operating agreement and any required lease (to include a change to an existing lease) shall be in place prior to the initiation of new financial services or offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Installation financial services. (1) Retail banking operations shall not be performed by any DoD Component or nonappropriated fund instrumentality including the Military Exchange Services and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) activities or any other organizational entity within the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retail banking operations shall not be performed by any DoD Component or nonappropriated fund instrumentality including the Military Exchange Services and morale, welfare and recreation (MWR) activities or any other organizational entity within the Department of Defense.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Financial services provided on DoD installations will be as uniform as possible for all personnel. As separately negotiated, or based on a fee schedule, custodians of nonappropriated funds shall compensate on-base financial institutions for services received. Compensation may be made with compensating balances or paying fees based on the services provided or a combination of these payment mechanisms. Fees shall not exceed the charge customary for the financial institution less an offsetting credit on balances maintained. Banking offices shall classify nonappropriated fund accounts as commercial accounts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At a minimum, banking offices shall provide the same services to individuals and nonappropriated fund instrumentalities as are available in the surrounding geographic area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> On-base financial institutions may conduct operations during normal duty hours provided they do not disrupt the performance of official duties. Operating hours shall be set, in consultation with the bank or credit union liaison officer, to meet the needs of all concerned. ATMs may be used to expand financial services and operating hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> DoD personnel may use their allotment of pay privileges to establish sound credit and savings practices through on-base financial institutions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The on-base financial institution shall credit customer accounts not later than the deposit date of the allotment check or electronic funds transfer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The initiation of an allotment is voluntary (See Volume 7a, Chapter 42, Section 4202 of The DoD Financial Management Regulation (7200.14-R)). Thus, DoD personnel generally cannot be required to initiate an allotment for the repayment of a loan. Allotments voluntarily established by DoD personnel for the purpose of repaying a loan or otherwise providing funds to an on-base financial institution shall continue in effect at the option of the allotter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> In accordance with sound lending practice, policies on loans to individuals are expected to be as liberal as feasible while remaining consistent with the overall interests of the on-base financial institution. On-base financial institutions shall conform to the Standards of Fairness principles before executing loan or credit agreements. See DoD Directive 1344.9.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> On-base financial institutions shall make basic financial education and counseling services available without charge to individuals seeking these services. Financial education and counseling services refer to basic personal and family finances such as budgeting,

checkbook balancing and account reconciliation, benefits of savings, prudent use of credit, how to start a savings program, how to shop and apply for credit, and the consequences of excessive credit. DoD personnel in junior enlisted or civilian grades, or newly married couples who apply for loans, shall be given special attention and counseling.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> On-base financial institutions must strive to provide the best service to all customers. On-base financial institutions that evidence a policy of discrimination in their services are in violation of this part. In resolving complaints of discrimination, use the procedures specified in Sec. 231.5(h)(8).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> All correspondence regarding on-base financial institutions, and questions concerning their operation that cannot be resolved locally, shall be referred through command channels to the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee) for consideration.</p>
