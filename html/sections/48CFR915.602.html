                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Present and future needs demand the involvement of all resources  in exploring alternative energy sources and technologies. To achieve  this objective, it is DOE policy to encourage external sources of unique  and innovative methods, approaches, and ideas by stressing submission of  unsolicited proposals for government support. In furtherance of this  policy and to ensure the integrity   of the acquisition process through application of reasonable controls,  the DOE:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Disseminates information on areas of broad technical concern  whose solutions are considered relevant to the accomplishment of DOE's  assigned mission areas;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Encourages potential proposers to consult with program personnel  before expending resources in the development of written unsolicited  proposals;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Endeavors to distribute unsolicited proposals to all interested  organizations within DOE;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Processes unsolicited proposals in an expeditious manner and,  where practicable, keeps proposers advised as discrete decisions are  made;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Assures that each proposal is evaluated in a fair and objective  manner; and, (6) Assures that each proposal will be used only for its  intended purpose and the information, subject to applicable laws and  regulations, contained therein will not be divulged without prior  permission of the proposer.
