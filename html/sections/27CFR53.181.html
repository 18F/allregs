                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. The payment of tax imposed by chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article by a manufacturer of the article will be considered to be an overpayment by reason of any use in further manufacture, or sale as part of a second manufactured article, described in paragraph (b) of this section. This section applies in those cases where the exportation, use, or sale (or any combination of those activities) referred to in this paragraph occurs before any other use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Use of tax-paid articles in further manufacture described in section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code. A payment of tax under chapter 32 of the Code on the sale of any article, directly or indirectly, by the manufacturer of the article to a subsequent manufacturer will be considered to be an overpayment under section 6416(b)(3)(A) of the Code if the article is used by the subsequent manufacturer as material in the manufacture or production of, or as a component part of, a second article manufactured or produced by the subsequent manufacturer which is taxable under chapter 32 of the Code. For this purpose it is immaterial whether the second article is sold or otherwise disposed of, or if sold, whether the sale is a taxable sale. Any article to which this paragraph applies which would have been used in the manufacture or production of a second article, except for the fact that it was broken or rendered useless in the process of manufacturing or producing the second article, will be considered to have been used as a component part of the second article.
