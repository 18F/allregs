The  DOL official(s) responsible for resolution shall promptly evaluate  findings and recommendations reported by auditors and the corrective  action plan developed by the recipient to determine proper actions in  response to audit findings and recommendations. The process of audit  resolution includes at a minimum an initial determination, an informal  resolution period, and a final determination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial determination. After the conclusion of any comment  period for audits provided the recipient/contractor, the responsible DOL  official(s) shall make an initial determination on the allowability of  questioned costs or activities, administrative or systemic findings, and  the corrective actions outlined by the recipient. Such determination  shall be based on applicable statutes, regulations, administrative  directives, or terms and conditions of the grant/contract award  instrument.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Informal resolution. The recipient/contractor shall have a  reasonable period of time (as determined by the DOL official(s)  responsible for audit resolution) from the date of issuance of the  initial determination to informally resolve those matters in which the  recipient/contractor disagrees with the decisions of the responsible DOL  official(s).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Final determination. After the conclusion of the informal  resolution period, the responsible DOL official(s) shall issue a final  determination that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> As appropriate, indicate that efforts to informally resolve  matters contained in the initial determination have either been  successful or unsuccessful;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lists those matters upon which the parties continue to  disagree;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Lists any modifications to the factual findings and  conclusions set forth in the initial determination;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Lists any sanctions and required corrective actions; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Sets forth any appeal rights.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Time limit. Insofar as possible, the requirements of this  section should be met within 180 days of the date the final approved  audit report is received by the DOL official(s) responsible for audit  resolution.</p>
