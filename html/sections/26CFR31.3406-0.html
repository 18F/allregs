Reportable payments mean interest and dividend payments (as  defined in section 3406(b)(2)) and other reportable payments (as defined  in section 3406(b)(3)).

A broker may use this alternative method of  determining the amount subject to withholding under section 3406 with  respect to a short sale only if at the time the short sale is initiated,  the broker expects that the amount of gain realized upon the closing of  the short sale will be determinable from the broker's records. If, due  to events unforeseen at the time the short sale was initiated, the  broker is unable to determine the basis of the property used to close  the short sale, the property must be assumed for this purpose to have a  basis of zero.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Time of backup withholding. The determination of whether a  short seller is subject to withholding under section 3406 must be made  on the date of the initiation or closing, as the case may be, or on the  date that the initiation or closing, as the case may be, is entered on  the broker's books and records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Fractional shares. A broker is not required to withhold under  section 3406 with respect to a sale of a fractional share of stock  resulting in less than $20   of gross proceeds (as described in Sec. 1.6045-1(c)(3)(x) of this  chapter).

A payor of reportable interest or dividends (as  described in section 3406(b)(2)) or of royalties (as described in  section 3406(b)(3)(E)) may elect not to withhold from a payment that  does not exceed $10 and that on an annualized basis does not exceed $10  (see paragraph (c) of this section). A broker or barter exchange may  elect not to withhold on gross proceeds of $10 or less without regard to  the annualization requirement. See Sec. 31.6051-4 for the requirement to  furnish a statement to the payee if tax is withheld under section 3406.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Manner of making the election.

The election may be made on a payment- by-payment basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> How to annualize--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. To annualize a reportable  interest payment, dividend payment, or royalty payment, a payor must  calculate what the amount of the payment would be if it were paid for a  1-year period (instead of the period for which it actually is paid). The  annualized amount is determined by dividing the amount of the payment by  the number of days in the period for which it is being paid and then  multiplying that result by the   number of days in the year. If the annualized amount is $10 or less, the  payor may elect not to withhold on that payment regardless of whether  more than $10 may be or has been paid to the payee in other reportable  payments during the calendar year. Conversely, if the annualized amount  is more than $10, withholding applies even if $10 or less is actually  paid to the payee during the calendar year. For purposes of computing  the annualized amount, the payor may assume that February always  consists of 28 days and that the year always consists of 360 days. For  amounts that are deposited with a payor in a new account or certificate  between the dates on which the payor customarily pays or credits  interest, the payor may assume that the period for which the interest is  paid is the payor's customary period for paying or crediting interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2))</em> with respect to those  multiple holdings (such as a dividend check that reflects payment on all  stock owned by the payee), the payor must annualize the aggregate  payment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exception for window transactions and original issue discount. A  payor is not required to annualize payments made in window transactions  (as defined in Sec. 31.3406(b)(2)-3(b)) or payments of original issue  discount. With respect to a window transaction, however, the payor is  required to aggregate all payments made in the same transaction (e.g.,  payments made with respect to coupons or obligations presented for  payment at the same time as described in Sec. 1.6049-4(e)(4) of this  chapter).

A determination of undue  hardship will be based on the overall impact to the payee of having  reportable interest or dividend payments withheld at a 31 percent rate  under section 3406. In addition, a determination of undue hardship will  be made only if the Internal Revenue Service concludes that it is   unlikely that any payee underreporting will occur again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Factors. Factors that will be considered in determining whether  withholding causes undue hardship include, but are not limited to, the  following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Whether estimated tax payments, and other credits for current  tax liabilities, or amounts withheld on employee wages or pensions, in  addition to withholding under section 3406, would cause significant  overwithholding;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The payee's health, including the payee's ability to pay  foreseeable medical expenses;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The extent of the payee's reliance on interest and dividend  payments to meet necessary living expenses and the existence, if any, of  other sources of income;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Whether other income of the payee is limited or fixed</p><p class="depth0">(e.g., social security, pension, and unearned income);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The payee's ability to sell or liquidate stocks, bonds, bank  accounts, trust accounts, or other assets, and the consequences of doing  so;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> Whether the payee reported and timely paid the most recent  year's tax liability, including interest and dividend income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(G)</em> Whether the payee has filed a bankruptcy petition with the  United States Bankruptcy Court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> if there is a dispute between  the payee and the Internal Revenue Service on a question of fact or law  that is material to a determination under paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this  section and, based upon all the facts and circumstances, the Internal  Revenue Service finds that the dispute is asserted in good faith by the  payee and there is a reasonable basis for the payee's position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Payees filing a joint return--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. For purposes of  this section, if payee underreporting is found to exist with respect to  a joint return, then the provisions of this section apply to both payees  (i.e., the husband and wife). As a result, both payees are subject to  withholding on accounts in their individual names as well as accounts in  their joint names. Either or both payees may satisfy the criteria for a  determination that no payee underreporting exists, that the  underreporting has been corrected, or that a bona fide dispute exists  (as provided in paragraph (g)(3) (i), (ii), or (iv) of this section).  Both payees, however, must satisfy the criteria for a determination that  withholding will cause or is causing undue hardship (as provided in  paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Innocent spouse. A spouse who files a joint  return may obtain a determination that withholding should stop or not  start with respect to payments made to his or her individual accounts,  if the spouse shows that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> He or she did not underreport income because he or she is a  spouse described in section 6013(e), i.e., innocent spouse; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> There is a bona fide dispute regarding whether he or she is an  innocent spouse and hence did not underreport income.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Divorced or legally separated payee. A payee who, at the time  of the request for a determination under paragraph (g) of this section,  is divorced or separated under State law may obtain a determination that  undue hardship exists (or would exist) under paragraph (g)(3)(iii) of  this section with respect to reportable interest or dividend payments  made to his or her individual accounts if the divorced or legally  separated payee satisfies the criteria for a determination under  paragraph (g)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Penalties.

A payee must furnish the payee's taxpayer  identification number to the payor with respect to any obligation,  deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, investment, account,  or other relationship or instrument established or acquired on or before  December 31, 1983 (a pre-1984 account) and with respect to which the  payor makes a reportable interest or dividend payment (as defined in  section 3406(b)(2)). The manner of determining whether an account or an  instrument is a pre-1984 account is described in paragraph (b)(2) of  this section. The payee of a pre-1984 account may furnish the payee's  taxpayer identification number to the payor orally or in writing. The  payee is not required to certify under penalties of perjury that the  taxpayer identification number is correct.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Determination of pre-1984 account or instrument--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  An account that is in existence before January 1, 1984, will be  considered a pre-1984 account, regardless of whether additional deposits  are made to the account on or after January 1, 1984. An account  established as an expansion of a credit union prime account in existence  prior to January 1, 1984, constitutes a pre-1984 account. If funds taken  from one account in existence prior to January 1, 1984, are used to  create a new account on or after that date, however, the new account  does not constitute a pre-1984 account except as provided in the  preceding sentence. An instrument acquired prior to January 1, 1984, is  a pre-1984 account. Regardless of when an instrument was acquired, if it  is negotiated in a window transaction as defined in Sec. 31.3406(b)(2)- 3(b), it is treated as an instrument acquired after December 31, 1983.  An obligation in bearer form and subject to reporting under section  6045, whenever acquired, is not a pre-1984 account. Any instrument,  whenever acquired, that is held in a brokerage account is considered a  pre-1984 account if the brokerage account is not a post-1983 brokerage  account (as described in paragraph (c)(1)(ii) of this section). If  shares of a corporation are held before January 1, 1984 (or considered  held before that date by operation of this paragraph (b)(2)), and  additional shares are acquired by the holder, irrespective of whether  the shares are received by reason of a stock dividend, investing new  cash, or otherwise, the new shares, in the discretion of the payor, may  be considered a pre-1984 account. In the case of a qualified employee  trust that distributes instruments in kind, any instrument distributed  from the trust is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to  employees who were participants in the trust before 1984. Similarly,  when a payor offers participants in a plan the opportunity to purchase  stock of the payor after a specified time, using the money that the  payee invested during that period of time, the stock so purchased after  December 31, 1983, is considered a pre-1984 account with respect to  participants in the plan who either owned shares or invested money in  the plan before January 1, 1984.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii))</em>, without the participation of  the payee, the new account or instrument, in the discretion of the  payor, may be considered a pre-1984 account. For purposes of the  preceding sentence, a payee is not considered to   have participated in the acquisition of the new account or instrument  solely because the payee failed to exercise a right to withdraw funds at  the maturity or termination of the old account or instrument.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Insurance policies. In the case of insurance policies in  effect on December 31, 1983, the election of a dividend accumulation  option pursuant to which interest is paid (as defined in Sec. 1.6049- 5(a)(4) of this chapter), or the creation of an account in which  proceeds of a policy are held for the policy beneficiary, may, in the  payor's discretion, be treated as a pre-1984 account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> are persons who held accounts or  instruments in the other payor immediately before the acquisition and  who receive an account or instrument in the acquiring payor immediately  after the acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Pre-1984 or post-1983 status unknown. If the acquiring payor, as  described in paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section, is unable to  identify from the business records of the other payor whether any or all  of the accounts or instruments of the persons specified in paragraph  (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section are pre-1984 (or post-1983) accounts or  instruments, then the acquiring payor may treat these unidentified  accounts or instruments as pre-1984 accounts or instruments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Cross reference. See Sec. 31.3406(g)-2(g) for the limited  exception from withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(A) on accounts or  instruments described in paragraphs (b)(2)(iv) (A) and (B) of this  section for which the payor does not have a taxpayer identification  number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Manner required for furnishing a taxpayer identification number  with respect to an account or instrument that is not a pre-1984 account.  A payee who receives reportable interest or dividend payments (as  defined in section 3406(b)(2)) from a payor must certify under penalties  of perjury that the taxpayer identification number the payee furnishes  to the payor is the payee's correct taxpayer identification number. The  payee must make the certification only with respect to an account or  instrument that is not a pre-1984 account (as described in paragraph  (b)(2) of this section). See Sec. 31.3406(h)-3 for a description of the  certificate on which the certification must be made. See  Sec. 31.3406(d)-2 for the requirement that the payee must certify under  penalties of perjury that the payee is not subject to withholding due to  notified payee underreporting. See Sec. 31.3406(d)-3(a) with respect to  an account established directly with, or an instrument acquired directly  from, the payor by electronic transmission or by mail.

The broker must give the information  required by paragraphs (a)(1) (ii) and (iii) of this section to the  payor with the transfer instructions for the acquisition (including  account registration instructions transmitted by a broker in the case of  acquisitions of shares in a mutual fund). A notice including the  information described in paragraph (b)(1) of this section fulfills the  broker's requirement to give notice to the payor. Once the broker  transmits the transfer instructions containing the information required  by this section, the broker has no further responsibility to obtain a  missing taxpayer identification number or missing certification or to  provide additional notices to the payee or payor with respect to the  acquisition of the instrument. Upon receiving the notice from a broker,  the payor must impose withholding on the account pursuant to  Sec. 31.3406(a)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Transactions entered into through a brokerage account that is  not a post-1983 brokerage account. If a broker acquires readily tradable  instruments for a payee through an account (with the broker) that is not  a post-1983 brokerage account (as defined in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)),  and the broker is not the payor of the instruments, the broker must  furnish the payee's taxpayer identification number to the payor. In  addition, if the broker has been notified by the Internal Revenue  Service that the payee is subject to withholding under section 3406  either because of an incorrect taxpayer identification number or due to  notified payee underreporting as described in section 3406(a)(1) (B) or  (C), respectively, the broker must notify the payor of the instrument to  impose withholding with respect to that payee and transmit the  information in the manner described in this paragraph (a). After a payor  receives a notice from a broker pursuant to section 3406(d)(2)(B) and  this paragraph (a), the payor must impose withholding on any accounts of  the payee paying reportable interest or dividends as defined in section  3406(b)(2) in accordance with Sec. 31.3406(a)-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Payor must notify payee--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Failure to provide certifications.

A notice that  contains the information described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section  satisfies the payor's requirement to give notice to the payee.

Paragraph (h) of this section requires a payor to use a  corrected name/TIN combination on subsequent information returns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions and special rules--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Definition of incorrect name/ TIN combination. An incorrect name/TIN combination is a combination of a  name and taxpayer identification number provided on an information  return with respect to which the Internal Revenue Service determines  that the taxpayer identification number provided is not assigned under  section 6109 to the name provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of account. The term ``account'' means any account,  instrument, or other relationship with the payor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Definition of business day. The term ``business day'' means any  day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday (within the meaning  of section 7503).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Certain exceptions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. This section does not apply  with respect to any notice received under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of  this section with respect to payments that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Were made to a fiduciary or nominee account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Were not reportable payments (for example, because the payments  were made to an exempt recipient).  See Sec. 301.6724-1(f)(3) of this chapter for certain solicitation rules  applicable after receipt of a notice under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of  this section with respect to a fiduciary or nominee account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Definition of fiduciary or nominee account. A fiduciary or  nominee account is an account with respect to which at least one person  named in the registration is identified as acting in the capacity as  nominee or as administrator, conservator, custodian, receiver, tutor,  curator, committee, executor, guardian, trustee, or other fiduciary  capacity recognized under governing law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Notice regarding an incorrect name/TIN combination--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In  general. If the Internal Revenue Service notifies a payor that a payee's  name/TIN combination is incorrect and that the payor must commence  backup withholding as required on reportable payments made with respect  to accounts of the payee with the same name/TIN combination, the payor  must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Identify under paragraph (c)(3) of this section any account or  accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, notify the  payee and backup withhold on reportable payments made to the account or  accounts under the rules of paragraphs (d), (e), and (f) of this  section.  This paragraph (c)(1) also applies if the payor receives notice from a  broker under paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Additional requirements for payors that are also brokers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In  general. A broker must notify the payor of an instrument of the  information required under paragraph (c)(2)(ii) of this section, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The broker (in its capacity as a payor) receives a notice from  the Internal Revenue Service under paragraph (c)(1) of this section that  a payee's name/TIN combination is incorrect and is required to identify  an account of the payee pursuant to paragraph (c)(3) of this section as  having the name/TIN combination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The payee acquires through the same account with the broker a  readily tradable instrument with respect to which the broker is not the  payor; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The acquisition of such instrument occurs after the close of the  30th business day after the date that the broker receives that notice  (or on any earlier date that the broker chooses to begin applying this  paragraph (c)(2)).  For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2)(i), with respect to notices under  paragraph (c)(1) of this section received on or after September 1, 1992,  an acquisition includes a transfer of an instrument out of street name  into the name of the registered owner, i.e., the payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The fact that the broker was notified by the Internal Revenue  Service that the payee furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The incorrect name/TIN combination; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The fact that the named payee is subject to backup withholding  under section 3406(a)(1)(B).  The broker is required to provide this information to the payor of the  instrument in connection with the transfer instructions for the  acquisition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Termination of obligation to provide information. The  obligation of a broker to provide information to payors under this  paragraph (c)(2) terminates simultaneously with the termination of the  broker's obligation to backup withhold (in its capacity as payor) on  reportable payments to the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Payor identification of the account or accounts of the payee  that have the incorrect taxpayer identification number--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.  If an account number or designation is provided in the notice received  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section, the payor need only identify any  account or accounts corresponding to that number or designation that has  the same name/TIN combination provided in the notice. If no account  number or designation is provided in the notice received under paragraph  (c)(1) of this section, the payor must identify, using reasonable care,  all accounts of the payee having the same name/TIN combination provided  in the notice. If a payor receives notice from a broker under paragraph  (c)(2) of this section with respect to the acquisition of a readily  tradable instrument, the payor is not required to identify any other  account of the payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Reasonable care where no account number or designation is  provided. A payor who satisfies the following two-part facts-and- circumstances test will be considered to have exercised reasonable care  for purposes of this paragraph (c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Part one of the test is satisfied if a payor searches for  accounts of the payee on the computer or other recordkeeping system that  the payor can reasonably associate with the information return that  generated the notice under paragraph (c)(1) of this section. For  example, a payor who maintains separate computer or recordkeeping  systems for different product lines will have identified and used the  appropriate system if the payor searches for accounts of the payee on  the computer or recordkeeping system that contains the product line for  the type of payments reported on the information return. A payor with  the same product line on several nonintegrated computer or record  systems will have identified and used the appropriate system if the  payor searches for accounts of the payee on any computer or record  system that the payor otherwise can reasonably associate with the  information return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Part two of the test is satisfied if the payor inputs the name/ TIN combination provided on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service  under paragraph (c)(1) of this section into the system that is described  in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(A) of this section. If the system of a payor  cannot utilize the name/TIN combination, the payor must input  appropriate data or criteria, as determined by the capability of the  payor's computer or recordkeeping system.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No identification if error is caused by payor. A payor may  treat an account as not having the incorrect name/TIN combination if the  error resulted because the name or taxpayer identification number on  such account is not the name or taxpayer identification number that was  provided to the payor. This may occur, for example, where a payor  transposes numbers in the taxpayer identification number when  incorporating it into the payor's business records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for joint accounts--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. In the case of  a joint account, the relevant name/TIN combination for purposes of this  section is the name/TIN combination used for information reporting  purposes.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Transitional rule. With respect to notices received under  paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section prior to September 1, 1993, a  payor may treat the name/TIN combination of the first person on a joint  account as the relevant name/TIN combination, unless that person is an  exempt foreign person and the account registration includes names of  persons who are not foreign persons.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Optional rule where names are switched. A payor may backup  withhold under this section on reportable payments made to a joint  account if the order of the names (or taxpayer identification numbers)  on the account is merely changed subsequent to receipt of a notice under  paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section, provided that the name of the  person to which the incorrect name/TIN combination originally applies  remains on the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Date of receipt. For purposes of this section, the date set  forth on the notice from the Internal Revenue Service or broker under  paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section is considered to be the date of  receipt of the notice by the payor. However, if the payor demonstrates  to the satisfaction of the Internal Revenue Service that the date of  actual receipt of the notice is later   than the date on the notice, the actual date of receipt is controlling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Notice from payors of backup withholding due to an incorrect  name/TIN combination--(1) In general. Except as provided in paragraph  (g) of this section, if a payor receives notice under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  or (2) of this section and is required to identify an account as having  the incorrect name/TIN combination under paragraph (c)(3) of this  section, the payor must send a copy of the notice (or an acceptable  substitute notice) to the payee of the account in accordance with the  procedures of paragraph (d)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Procedures--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. The notice that a payor must send to  a payee under paragraph (d)(1) of this section must comply with such  procedural requirements as the Internal Revenue Service provides in the  Internal Revenue Bulletin such as to form and manner of delivery. A  payor must send the notice to the payee within 15 business days after  the date that the payor receives the notice from the Internal Revenue  Service or a broker under paragraph (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Two or more notices for an account for the same year or  received in the same year. A payor who receives, under the same payor  taxpayer identification number, two or more notices under paragraph  (c)(1) or (2) of this section with respect to the same payee's account  for the same year, or in the same calendar year, need only send one  notice to the payee under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Period during which backup withholding is required due to  notification of an incorrect name/TIN combination--(1) In general.  Except as provided in paragraph (g) of this section, if a payor receives  a notice under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (2) of this section and is required  to identify an account as having the same name/TIN combination under  paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the payor must impose backup  withholding on all reportable payments made with respect to the account  after the close of the 30th business day after the date the payor  receives that notice and on or before the close of the 30th calendar day  after the day the payor receives from the payee the certification  required under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Grace periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Starting backup withholding. A payor may, on  an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup  withholding under this paragraph (e) at any time during the 30-business- day period described in paragraph (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Stopping backup withholding. A payor may, on an account-by- account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under  this paragraph (e) at any time within 30 calendar days after the payor  receives from the payee the certification required under paragraph (f)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Dormant accounts. The requirement that a payor backup withhold  under this paragraph (e) on reportable payments made with respect to an  account terminates no later than the close of the third calendar year  ending after the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date that the last reportable payment was made to that  account; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date that the payor received the notice under paragraph  (c)(1) or (2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Manner required for payee to furnish certified taxpayer  identification number.

As a result, a payor must not fail to begin  backup withholding under paragraph (e) of this section solely because  the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification, or stop it once it has  begun solely because the payee provided an awaiting TIN certification.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Receipt of two notices within a 3-year period--(1) In general.  If a payor receives notification under paragraph (c)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (2) of this  section twice within 3 calendar years, and in each case the payor is  required to identify the same account as having the incorrect name/TIN  combination, the payor must--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Disregard any future certifications (described in paragraph (f)  of this section) furnished by the payee with respect to the account  until the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration  (or the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination  under paragraph (g)(5) of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Send the notice described in paragraph (g)(2) of this section  to the payee (and not the notice required under paragraph (d) of this  section) within 15 business days after the date that the payor receives  the second notice; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Impose backup withholding on the account for the period  described in paragraph (g)(3) of this section.

If paragraph (g)(1) of this  section applies, the payor must backup withhold on all reportable  payments made with respect to the account of the payee after the close  of the 30th business day after the date that the payor receives the  second notice under paragraph (c) (1) or (2) of this section and on or  before the close of the 30th calendar day after the date that the payor  receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or the Internal  Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under paragraph  (g)(5) of this section for the account. However, a payor may choose not  to commence backup withholding under this paragraph (g) until January 1,  1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Grace periods--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Starting backup withholding. A payor may, on  an account-by-account basis or in general, choose to begin backup  withholding under this paragraph (g) at any time during the 30-business- day period described in paragraph (g)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Stopping backup withholding. A payor may, on an account-by- account basis or in general, choose to stop backup withholding under  this paragraph (g) at any time within 30 calendar days after the date  the payor receives notice from the Social Security Administration (or  the Internal Revenue Service) validating a name/TIN combination under  paragraph (g)(5) of this section for the account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Dormant accounts.

The application of the provisions of this section may  be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D opened an account with Bank O prior to 1984 and  furnished a taxpayer identification number to O at the time he opened  the account. O pays interest on the account at the end of each calendar  month, and the account is a pre-1984 account. On October 1, 1990, the  Internal Revenue Service notifies Bank O that the name/TIN combination  provided by D is incorrect. O timely notifies D as required in paragraph  (d)(1) of this section. O does not receive the certification required  under paragraph (f) of this section from D. O is required to backup  withhold 20 percent of all reportable payments made after November 14,  1990 (which is 30 business days after the date the Internal Revenue  Service notified O). Therefore, O is not required to backup withhold on  the reportable payment made on October 31, 1990, but is required to  backup withhold on the reportable payment made on November 30, 1990. O  is required to continue to backup withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B)  until O receives the certification required under paragraph (f) of this  section from D (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates  under paragraph (e)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Assume the same facts as in Example 1 except that D  furnishes a new taxpayer identification number to O on November 1, 1990,  but does not certify, under penalties of perjury, that it is his correct  taxpayer identification number as required under paragraph (f) of this  section. Even though the account is a pre-1984 account, O is required to  withhold 20 percent of all reportable payments made after November 14,  1990 (which is 30 business days after the date the Internal Revenue  Service notified O), and before the date O receives the certification  required under paragraph (f) of this section from D.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Assume the same facts as in Example 2 except that D  provides O with the certification required under paragraph (f) of this  section on November 10, 1990. D elects pursuant to paragraph (e)(2)(ii)  of this section to treat the certification as received on November 20,  1990. Even though D did not provide the certification to O within 30  business days after the Internal Revenue Service notified O that D  provided an incorrect taxpayer identification number, O is not required  to backup withhold under section 3406(a)(1)(B) because O did not make  any reportable payment to D after 30 business days after notification of  an incorrect name/TIN combination and before O received D's  certification under paragraph (f) of this section   (or, if earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph  (e)(3) of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Individual F has two post-1983 accounts with Bank R that  pay reportable interest: a savings account and a money market account.  The money market account was opened in 1986, and the savings account was  opened on February 1, 1991. R treats each of these accounts as a  separate account on its books and records for business purposes. On  October 1, 1990, the Internal Revenue Service notified R pursuant to  paragraph (c)(1) of this section that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN  combination with respect to the money market account. R timely sends F  the notice required under paragraph (d) of this section and receives the  certification required under paragraph (f) of this section from F on  November 1, 1990. On October 1, 1991, the Internal Revenue Service again  notifies R that F furnished an incorrect name/TIN combination with  respect to the money market account. Further, R determines from its  business records that two notifications of an incorrect name/TIN  combination have been received with respect to the money market account  within 3 calendar years. R must send F the notice required under  paragraph (g)(2) of this section and must commence backup withholding on  reportable interest paid on the money market account pursuant to  paragraph (g)(3) of this section after November 14, 1991, which is 30  business days after R received the second notice. R must continue to  backup withhold under paragraph (g) of this section on the money market  account until R receives notification from the Social Security  Administration as described in paragraph (g)(5) of this section (or, if  earlier, until backup withholding terminates under paragraph (g)(3)(iii)  of this section).

Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section, the Form W-9 is the form prescribed under section 3406 on which  a payee that is a U.S. person certifies, under penalties of perjury,  that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The taxpayer identification number furnished to the payor is  correct (as required in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1 and Sec. 31.3406(d)-5);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee  underreporting (as required in Sec. 31.3406(d)-2);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The payee is an exempt recipient (as described in  Sec. 31.3406(g)-1); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The payee is awaiting receipt of a taxpayer identification  number (as described in Sec. 31.3406(g)-3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Use of a single or multiple Forms W-9 for accounts of the same  payee. A valid Form W-9 must include the name and taxpayer  identification number of the payee. Except as provided in paragraph (b)  of this section, the payee must sign under penalties of perjury and date  the Form W-9 in order to satisfy the requirements of this section. A  payor or broker may require a payee to furnish a separate Form W-9 for  each obligation, deposit, certificate, share, membership, contract, or  other instrument, or one Form W-9 for all the payee's obligations or  relationships with the payor or broker. In addition, a payee of   a mutual fund that has a common investment advisor or common principal  underwriter with other mutual funds (within the same family of funds)  may be permitted, in the discretion of the mutual fund, to provide one  Form W-9 with respect to shares acquired or owned in any of the funds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Prescribed form to furnish a noncertified taxpayer  identification number. With respect to accounts or other relationships  where the payee is not required to certify, under penalties of perjury,  that the taxpayer identification number being furnished is correct, the  payor or broker may obtain the taxpayer identification number orally or  may use Form W-9, a substitute form, or any other document, but the  payee is not required to sign the form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Forms prepared by payors or brokers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Substitute forms; in  general. A payor or broker may prepare and use a form that contains  provisions that are substantially similar to those of the official Form  W-9. A payor or broker may use any document relating to the transaction,  such as the signature card for an account, so long as the certifications  are clearly set forth. A payor or broker who uses a substitute form may  furnish orally or in writing the instructions for the Form W-9 that  relate to the account. A payor or broker may refuse to accept  certifications (including the official Form W-9) that are not made on  the form or forms provided by the payor or broker. A payor or broker may  refuse to accept a certification provided by a payee only if the payor  or broker furnishes the payee with an acceptable form immediately upon  receipt of an unacceptable form or within 5 business days of receipt of  an unacceptable form. An acceptable form for this purpose must contain a  notice that the payor or broker has refused to accept the form submitted  by the payee and that the payee must submit the acceptable form provided  by the payor in order for the payee not to be subject to withholding  under section 3406. If the payor or broker requires the payee to furnish  a form for each account of the payee, the payor or broker is not  required to furnish an acceptable form until the payee furnishes the  payor or broker with the payee's account numbers. A payor or broker may  use separate substitute forms to have a payee certify under penalties of  perjury that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The payee's taxpayer identification number is correct; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The payee is not subject to withholding under section 3406 due  to notified payee underreporting.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Form for exempt recipient. A payor or broker may use a  substitute form for the payee to certify, under penalties of perjury,  that the payee is an exempt recipient (described in Sec. 31.3406(g)-1 or  described in the respective reporting section), provided the form  contains provisions that are substantially similar to those of the  official Form W-9 relating to exempt recipients. A certificate must be  prepared in accordance with the instructions applicable to exempt  recipients on Form W-9, and must set forth fully and clearly the data  called for therein. If a payor will treat the payee as an exempt  recipient only if the payee files a certificate as to its exempt status,  the certificate is valid only if it contains the payee's taxpayer  identification number. Thus, a payee must include the payee's taxpayer  identification number on a certificate that a payor requires to be made  in order to treat the payee as an exempt recipient.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)-4)</em> and the broker notifies the  payor that the number was not certified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Reasonable reliance on certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A payor is  not liable for the tax imposed under section 3406 if the payor's failure  to deduct and withhold the tax is due to reasonable reliance, as defined  in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, on a Form W-9 (or other acceptable  substitute) required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Circumstances establishing reasonable reliance. For purposes of  paragraph (e)(1) of this section, a payor can reasonably rely on a Form  W-9 (or other acceptable substitute) unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The form does not contain the name and taxpayer identification  number of the payee (or does not state, in lieu of a taxpayer  identification number, that the payee is awaiting receipt of a taxpayer  identification number (i.e., an awaiting-TIN certificate));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The form is not signed and dated by the payee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The form does not contain the statement, when required, that  the payee is not subject to withholding due to notified payee  underreporting;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The payee has deleted the jurat or other similar provisions by  which the payee certifies or affirms the correctness of the statements  contained on the form; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> For purposes of section 3406(a)(1)(C), the payor is required to  subject the account to which the form relates to withholding under  section 3406(a)(1)(C) under the circumstances described in  Sec. 31.3406(c)-1(c)(3)(iii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Who may sign certificate--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. A Form W-9 or other  acceptable substitute form may be signed by any person who is authorized  to sign a declaration under penalties of perjury on behalf of the payee  as provided in section 6061 and the regulations thereunder (relating to  who may sign generally for an individual, which includes certain agents  who may sign returns and other documents), section 6062 and the  regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign corporate returns), and  section 6063 and the regulations thereunder (relating to who may sign  partnership returns).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notified payee underreporting. A payee who has not been notified  that he is subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) as a  result of notified payee underreporting may make the certification  related to notified payee underreporting. In addition, a payee who was  subject to withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee  underreporting may certify that he is not subject to withholding under  section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to notified payee underreporting if the  Internal Revenue Service has provided the payee with written  certification that withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(C) due to  notified payee underreporting has terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Retention of certificates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Accounts or instruments that are  not pre-1984 accounts and brokerage relationships that are post-1983  brokerage accounts. With respect to an account or instrument that is not  a pre-1984 account (as described in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1(b)(3)), or with  respect to a brokerage relationship that is a post-1983 brokerage  account (as described in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1(c)(2)), a payor or broker who  receives a Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form related to  withholding under section 3406 must retain the form in its records for 3  years from the date the account is opened or the instrument is  purchased. The form may be retained on microfilm or microfiche.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Accounts or instruments that are pre-1984 accounts and brokerage  relationships that are not post-1983 brokerage accounts. With respect to  a pre-1984 account (as described in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1(b)(1)) or with  respect to a brokerage relationship that is not a post-1983 brokerage  account (as described in Sec. 31.3406(d)-1(c)(1)), a payor or broker is  not required to retain any Form W-9 or other acceptable substitute form.  If, however, the payor or broker requires the payee to file only one  Form W-9 or substitute form for all accounts or instruments of the  payee, the payor or broker must retain the single form in the manner and  for the period of time described in paragraph (g)(1) of this section if  that form relates to any account or instrument that is not a pre-1984  account or relates to a post-1983 brokerage account. If a payee has  certified that the payee is an exempt recipient described in  Sec. 31.3406(g)-1, the payor or broker must retain the form unless the  payor or broker can establish the existence of procedures that are  reasonably calculated to ensure that a payee who has so certified is  accurately identified in the payor's or broker's records.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Cross references. For the requirement to file an information  return (and furnish the related statement) with respect to a reportable  payment, particularly if that payment has been subject to withholding  under section 3406, see   subtitle F, chapter 61, subparts B and C of the Internal Revenue Code.  See Sec. 31.6302-4 for the requirement to deposit amounts withheld under  section 3406 on either a monthly or semi-weekly basis. See  Sec. 31.6011(a)-4(b) for the requirement to file Form 945, Annual Return  of Withheld Federal Income Tax, to reflect amounts withheld under  section 3406.

For the effective date of Sec. 31.3406(d)-5, see Sec. 31.3406(d)-5(i).  Section 31.3406(g)-1(c) is effective before January 1, 1997. See  Secs. 35a.9999-0T through 35a.9999-5 of this chapter for rules that  apply to international transactions after December 31, 1996.  [T.D. 8637, 60 FR 66133, Dec. 21, 1995]    Sec. 31.3406(j)-1  Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN) matching program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The matching program. Under section 3406(i), the Commissioner  has the authority to establish Taxpayer Identification Number (TIN)  matching programs. The Commissioner may prescribe in a revenue procedure  (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2) of this chapter) or other appropriate guidance  the scope and the terms and conditions of participating in any TIN  matching program. In general, under a matching program, prior to filing  information returns with respect to reportable payments as defined in  section 3406(b)(1), a payor of those reportable payments who is entitled  to participate in the matching program may contact the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS) with respect to the TIN furnished by a payee who has  received or is likely to receive a reportable payment. The IRS will  inform the payor whether or not a name/TIN combination furnished by the  payee matches a name/TIN combination maintained in the data base  utilized for the particular matching program. For purposes of this  section, the term payor includes an agent designated by the payor to  participate in TIN matching on the payor's behalf.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notice of incorrect TIN. No matching details received by a payor  through a matching program will constitute a notice regarding an  incorrect name/TIN combination under Sec. 31.3406(d)-5(c) for purposes  of imposing backup withholding under section 3406(a)(1)(B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application of section 3406(f). The provisions of section  3406(f), relating to confidentiality of information, apply to any  matching details received by a payor through the matching program. A  payor may not take into account any such matching details in determining  whether to open or close an account with a payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Reasonable cause. The IRS will not use either a payor's decision  not to participate in an available TIN matching program or the results  received by a payor from participation in a TIN matching program  implemented under the authority of this section as a basis to assert  that the payor lacks reasonable cause under section 6724(a) for the  failure to file an information return under section 6721 or to furnish a  correct payee statement under section 6722. If the establishment of  reasonable cause may be relevant to a substantial number of the  participants in a TIN matching program implemented under the authority  of this section, the extent to which, if any, a payor may establish  reasonable cause by participating in the TIN matching program will be  set forth in the guidance establishing the program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Definition of account. Account means any account, instrument, or  other relationship with a payor and with respect to which a payor has  made or is likely to make a reportable payment as defined in section  3406(b)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective date. The last sentence in paragraph (a) of this  section is applicable on January 31, 2003. All other provisions of this  section are applicable on and after June 18, 1997.
