                            <p class="depth0">Foreign exemption means a provision of the Act under which the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply to any employee who spends all hours of work in a given workweek in an exempt area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application. When the foreign exemption applies, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply to any employee who spends all hours of work in a given workweek in an exempt area. When an employee meets one of the two criteria in paragraph (b) of this section, the foreign exemption applies until the employee spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area as defined in Sec. 551.104.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Foreign exemption applies. If an employee meets one of the two following criteria, the employee is subject to the foreign exemption of the Act and the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act do not apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee is permanently stationed in an exempt area and spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The employee is not permanently stationed in an exempt area, but spends all hours of work in a given workweek in one or more exempt areas.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Foreign exemption does not apply. For any given workweek, the minimum wage, overtime, and child labor provisions of the Act apply to an employee permanently stationed in an exempt area who spends any hours of work in any nonexempt area. For that workweek, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption, and the agency must determine the exemption status of such an employee as described in paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. The foreign exemption does not resume until the employee again meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Same duties. If the duties performed during that workweek are consistent with the primary duties of the employee's official position, the agency must designate the employee the same FLSA exemption status as if the employee were permanently stationed in any nonexempt area.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Different duties. If the duties performed during that workweek are not consistent with the primary duties of the employee's official position:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The agency must first designate the employee the same FLSA exemption status as the employee would have been designated based on the duties included in the employee's official position if the employee was permanently stationed in any nonexempt area; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The agency must determine the employee's exemption status for that workweek by applying Sec. 551.211.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resumption of foreign exemption. When an employee returns to any exempt area from performing any hours of work in any nonexempt area, the employee is not subject to the foreign exemption until the employee meets one of the criteria in paragraph (b) of this section.</p>
