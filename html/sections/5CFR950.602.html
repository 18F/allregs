                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Employee solicitations shall be conducted during duty hours using methods that permit true voluntary giving and shall reserve to the individual the option of disclosing any gift or keeping it confidential. Campaign kick-offs, victory events, awards, and other non-solicitation events to build support for the CFC are encouraged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Special CFC fundraising events, such as raffles, lotteries, auctions, bake sales, carnivals, athletic events, or other activities not specifically provided for in these regulations are permitted during the campaign period if approved by the appropriate agency head or government official, consistent with agency ethics regulations. CFC special fundraising events should be undertaken in the spirit of generating interest in the CFC and be open to all individuals without regard to whether an individual participates in the CFC. Chances to win must be disassociated from amount of contributions, if any. Raffle prizes should be modest in nature and value. Examples of appropriate raffle prizes may include opportunities for lunch with Agency Officials, agency parking spaces for a specific time period, and gifts of minimal financial value. Any special CFC fundraising event and prize or gift should be approved in advance by the Agency's ethics official.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In all approved special fundraising events the donor must have the option of designating to a specific participating organization or federation or be advised that the donation will be counted as an undesignated contribution and distributed according to these regulations.
