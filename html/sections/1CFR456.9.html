                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The NCPC shall provide Expedited Processing of a FOIA Request if the person making the Request demonstrates that the Request involves:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Circumstances in which the lack of expedited treatment could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An urgency to inform the public about an actual or alleged federal government activity, if made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The loss of substantial due process rights; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exists possible questions about the government's integrity which affect public confidence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A Request for Expedited Processing may be made at the time of the initial FOIA Request or at a later time.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A Requester seeking Expedited Processing must submit a detailed statement setting forth the basis for the Expedited Processing Request. The Requester must certify in the statement that the need for Expedited Processing is true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge. To qualify for Expedited Processing, a Requester relying upon the category in paragraph (a)(2) of this section must establish:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> He/she is a full time Representative of the News Media or primarily engaged in the occupation of information dissemination, though it need not be his/her sole occupation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A particular urgency to inform the public about the information sought by the FOIA Request beyond the public's right to know about the government activity generally; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The information is of the type that has value that will be lost if not disseminated quickly such as a breaking news story. Information of historical interest only or information sought for litigation or commercial activities will not qualify nor would a news media deadline unrelated to breaking news.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Within 10 calendar days of receipt of a Request for expedited processing, the NCPC shall decide whether to grant or deny the Request and notify the Requester of the decision in writing. If a Request for Expedited Processing is granted, the Request shall be given priority and shall be processed in the expedited processing track. If a Request for Expedited Processing is denied, any appeal of that decision shall be acted on expeditiously.</p>
