                            <p class="depth0">Subpart A of this part 780 and this subpart G together constitute  the official interpretative bulletin of the Department of Labor with  respect to the meaning and application of section 13(b)(13) of the Fair  Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended. This section provides an  exemption from the overtime pay provisions of the Act for certain  employees who, in the same workweek, are employed by a farmer in  agriculture and also in the farmer's livestock auction operations. As  appears more fully in subpart A of this part, interpretations in this  bulletin with respect to provisions of the Act discussed are official  interpretations upon which reliance may be placed and which will guide  the Secretary of Labor and the Administrator in the performance of their  duties under the Act. The general exemptions provided in sections  13(a)(6) and 13(b)(12) of the Act for employees employed in agriculture  are not discussed in this subpart except in its relation to section  13(b)(13). The meaning and application of these exemptions are fully  considered in subparts D and E of this part 780.</p>
