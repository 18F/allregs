                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Attainment determination. EPA has determined that the Ventura County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area attained the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2005. EPA also has determined that the Ventura County severe 1-hour ozone nonattainment area is not subject to the requirements of section 185 of the Clean Air Act (CAA) for the 1-hour standard and that the State is not required to submit a SIP under Section 182(d)(3) of the CAA to implement a section 185 program for the 1-hour standard in this area. In addition, the requirements of section 172(c)(9) (contingency measures) for the 1-hour standard do not apply to the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Approval. On December 19, 2007, the California Air Resources Board submitted a maintenance plan for the 1997 8-hour ozone NAAQS for the Monterey Bay Area as required by section 110(a)(1) of the Clean Air Act, as amended in 1990, and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4). Elements of the section 110(a)(1) maintenance plan for ozone include a base year (2002) attainment emissions inventory for ozone, a demonstration of maintenance of the ozone NAAQS with projected emissions inventories through the year 2014 for ozone, a plan to verify continued attainment, and a contingency plan. The maintenance plan meets the Federal requirements of Clean Air Act section 110(a)(1) and 40 CFR 51.905(a)(4) and is approved as a revision to the California State Implementation Plan for the above mentioned area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Determination of attainment. Effective January 4, 2010, EPA is determining that the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), this determination suspends the reasonable further progress and attainment demonstration requirements of section 182(b)(1) and related requirements of section 172(c)(9) of the Clean Air Act for as long as the area does not monitor any violations of the 8-hour ozone standard. If a violation of the 1997 ozone NAAQS is monitored in the Imperial County, California 8-hour ozone nonattainment area, this determination shall no longer apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determinations that Certain Areas Did Not Attain the 1-Hour Ozone NAAQS. EPA has determined that the Los Angeles-South Coast Air Basin Area and the San Joaquin Valley Area extreme 1-hour ozone nonattainment areas did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2010 and that the Southeast Desert Modified Air Quality Maintenance Area severe-17 1-hour ozone nonattainment area did not attain the 1-hour ozone NAAQS by the applicable attainment date of November 15, 2007. These determinations bear on the areas' obligations with respect to the one-hour ozone standard anti-backsliding requirements whose implementation is triggered by a determination of failure to attain by the applicable attainment date: section 172(c)(9) contingency measures for failure to attain and sections 182(d)(3) and 185 major stationary source fee programs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Determinations of Attainment: Effective January 2, 2013.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Approval of applications for extensions of applicable attainment dates. Under section 181(a)(5) of the Clean Air Act, EPA is approving the applications submitted by the California Air Resources Board dated March 23, 2010 and

May 24, 2010 for extensions of the applicable attainment date for the Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties and Nevada County 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas, respectively, from June 15, 2010 to June 15, 2011.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Determinations of attainment by the applicable attainment dates. EPA has determined that the Amador and Calaveras Counties, Chico, Kern County, Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties, Nevada County, and Sutter County 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas in California attained the 1997 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS) by their applicable attainment dates. The applicable attainment dates are as follows: Amador and Calaveras Counties (June 15, 2010), Chico (June 15, 2007), Kern County (June 15, 2010), Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties (June 15, 2011), Nevada County (June 15, 2011), and Sutter County (June 15, 2007).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Determinations of attainment. EPA is determining that the Amador and Calaveras Counties, Chico, Kern County, Mariposa and Tuolumne Counties, Nevada County, Sutter County and Ventura County 8-hour ozone nonattainment areas have attained the 1997 8-hour ozone standard, based upon complete quality-assured data for 2009-2011. Under the provisions of EPA's ozone implementation rule (see 40 CFR 51.918), these determinations suspend the attainment demonstrations and associated reasonably available control measures, reasonable further progress plans, contingency measures, and other planning SIPs related to attainment for as long as the areas continue to attain the 1997 8-hour ozone standard. If EPA determines, after notice-and-comment rulemaking, that any of these areas no longer meets the 1997 ozone NAAQS, the corresponding determination of attainment for that area shall be withdrawn.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination of attainment. EPA has determined that, as of November 19, 2012, the Sacramento Metro 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard, based upon complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data for 2007-2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Determination of attainment. EPA has determined that, as of May 15, 2015, the Southeast Desert 1-hour ozone nonattainment area has attained the 1-hour ozone standard, based upon complete, quality-assured and certified ambient air quality monitoring data for 2011-2013.
