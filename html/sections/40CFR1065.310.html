                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Scope and frequency. Calibrate all torque-measurement systems  including dynamometer torque measurement transducers and systems upon  initial installation and after major maintenance. Use good engineering  judgment to repeat the calibration. Follow the torque transducer  manufacturer's instructions for linearizing your torque sensor's output.  We recommend that you calibrate the torque-measurement system with a  reference force and a lever arm.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Recommended procedure to quantify lever-arm length. Quantify the  lever-arm length, NIST-traceable within 0.5%  uncertainty. The lever arm's length must be measured from the centerline  of the dynamometer to the point at which the reference force is  measured. The lever arm must be perpendicular to gravity (i.e.,  horizontal), and it must be perpendicular to the dynamometer's  rotational axis. Balance the lever arm's torque or quantify its net  hanging torque, NIST-traceable within 1%  uncertainty, and account for it as part of the reference torque.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Recommended procedure to quantify reference force. We recommend  dead-weight calibration, but you may use either of the following  procedures to quantify the reference force, NIST-traceable within 0.5% uncertainty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Dead-weight calibration. This technique applies a known force by  hanging known weights at a known distance along a lever arm. Make sure  the weights' lever arm is perpendicular to gravity (i.e., horizontal)  and perpendicular to the dynamometer's rotational axis. Apply at least  six calibration-weight combinations for each applicable torque-measuring  range, spacing the weight quantities about equally over the range.  Oscillate or rotate the dynamometer during calibration to reduce  frictional static hysteresis. Determine each weight's reference force by  multiplying its NIST-traceable mass by the local acceleration of Earth's  gravity, as described in Sec.  1065.630. Calculate the reference torque  as the weights' reference force multiplied by the lever arm reference  length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Strain gage, load transducer, or proving ring calibration. This  technique applies force either by hanging weights on a lever arm (these  weights and their lever arm length are not used as part of the reference  torque determination) or by operating the dynamometer at different  torques. Apply at least six force combinations for each applicable  torque-measuring range, spacing the force quantities about equally over  the range. Oscillate or rotate the dynamometer during calibration to  reduce frictional static hysteresis. In this case, the reference torque  is determined by multiplying the force output from the reference meter  (such as a strain gage, load transducer, or proving ring) by its  effective lever-arm length, which you measure from the point where the  force measurement is made to the dynamometer's rotational axis. Make  sure you measure this length perpendicular to the reference meter's  measurement axis and perpendicular to the dynamometer's rotational axis.  [79 FR 23768, Apr. 28, 2014]</p>
