These remedies and procedures,  however, may be authorized with respect to debts that are exempt from  the Debt Collection Act of 1982 and the Debt Collection Improvement Act  of 1996, to the extent that they are authorized under some other statute  or the common law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section should not be construed as prohibiting the use of  these authorities or requirements when collecting debts owed by persons  employed by agencies administering the laws cited in paragraph (a) of  this section unless the debt arose under those laws. However, the  Commission is authorized to assess interest and related charges on debts  which are not subject to 31 U.S.C. 3717 to the extent authorized under  the common law or other applicable statutory authority.</p>
