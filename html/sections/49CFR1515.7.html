                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. This section applies to the following applicants:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An applicant for an HME or TWIC who has a disqualifying criminal offense described in 49 CFR 1572.103(a)(5) through (a)(12) or 1572.103(b) and who requests a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An applicant for an HME or TWIC who is an alien under temporary protected status as described in 49 CFR 1572.105 and who requests a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> An applicant applying for an HME or TWIC who lacks mental capacity as described in 49 CFR 1572.109 and who requests a waiver.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grounds for waiver. TSA may issue a waiver of the standards described in paragraph (a) and grant an HME or TWIC if TSA determines that an applicant does not pose a security threat based on a review of information described in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Initiating waiver. (1) An applicant initiates a waiver as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An applicant initiates a waiver as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Providing to TSA the information required in 49 CFR 1572.9 for an HME or 49 CFR 1572.17 for a TWIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paying the fees required in 49 CFR 1572.405 for an HME or in 49 CFR 1572.501 for a TWIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Sending a written request to TSA for a waiver at any time, but not later than 60 days after the date of service of the Final Determination of Threat Assessment. The applicant may request a waiver during the application process, or may first pursue some or all of the appeal procedures in 49 CFR 1515.5 to assert that he or she does not have a disqualifying condition.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In determining whether to grant a waiver, TSA will consider the following factors, as applicable to the disqualifying condition:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The circumstances of the disqualifying act or offense.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Restitution made by the applicant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any Federal or State mitigation remedies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Court records or official medical release documents indicating that the applicant no longer lacks mental capacity.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other factors that indicate the applicant does not pose a security

threat warranting denial of the HME or TWIC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Grant or denial of waivers. (1) The Assistant Administrator will send a written decision granting or denying the waiver to the applicant within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Assistant Administrator will send a written decision granting or denying the waiver to the applicant within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of an HME, if the Assistant Administrator grants the waiver, the Assistant Administrator will send a Determination of No Security Threat to the licensing State within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the case of a mariner applying for a TWIC, if the Assistant Administrator grants the waiver, the Assistant Administrator will send a Determination of No Security Threat to the Coast Guard within 60 days of service of the applicant's request for a waiver, or longer period as TSA may determine for good cause.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the Assistant Administrator denies the waiver the applicant may seek review in accordance with 49 CFR 1515.11. A denial of a waiver under this section does not constitute a final order of TSA as provided in 49 U.S.C. 46110.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Extension of time. TSA may grant an applicant an extension of the time limits for good cause shown. An applicant's request for an extension of time must be in writing and be received by TSA within a reasonable time before the due date to be extended; or an applicant may request an extension after the expiration of a due date by sending a written request describing why the failure to file within the time limits was excusable. TSA may grant itself an extension of time for good cause.</p>
