                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remand. If further evidence, clarification of the evidence,  correction of a procedural defect, or any other action is essential for  a proper appellate decision, a Veterans Law Judge or panel of Veterans  Law Judges shall remand the case to the agency of original jurisdiction,  specifying the action to be undertaken.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Referral. The Board shall refer to the agency of original  jurisdiction for appropriate consideration and handling in the first  instance all claims reasonably raised by the record that have not been  initially adjudicated by the agency of original jurisdiction, except for  claims over which the Board has original jurisdiction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Remand for a Statement of the Case. In cases before the Board in  which a claimant has timely filed a Notice of Disagreement with a  determination of the agency of original jurisdiction on a claim, but the  record reflects that the agency of original jurisdiction has not  subsequently granted the claim in full and has not furnished the  claimant with a Statement of the Case, the Board shall remand the claim  to the agency of original jurisdiction with instructions to prepare and  issue a Statement of the Case in accordance with the provisions of  subpart B of this part. A remand for a Statement of the Case is not  required if the claimant, consistent with the withdrawal requirements of  Sec. 20.204 of this chapter, withdraws the Notice of Disagreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Exceptions.
