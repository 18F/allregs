Until such time  as certification is granted, a given installation of a system that was  measured for the submission for certification will be considered to be  in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, including the  marketing regulations in subpart I of part 2 of this chapter, if tests  at that installation show the system to be in compliance with the  relevant technical requirements. Similarly, where measurements must be  performed on site for equipment subject to verification, a given  installation that has been verified to demonstrate compliance with the  applicable standards will be considered to be in compliance with the  provisions of this chapter, including the marketing regulations in  subpart I of part 2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For perimeter protection systems operating in the frequency  bands allocated to television broadcast stations operating under part 73  of this chapter, the holder of the grant of certification must test each  installation prior to initiation of normal operation to verify  compliance with the technical standards and must maintain a list of all  installations and records of measurements. For perimeter protection  systems operating outside of the frequency bands allocated to television  broadcast stations, upon receipt of a grant of certification, further  testing of the same or similar type of system or installation is not  required.
