The  field notes shall accompany the application, as provided in Sec. 169.7.  The width of the right-of-way shall be clearly shown on the maps.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A separate map shall be filed for each section of 20 miles of  right-of-way, but the map of the last section may include any excess of  10 miles or less.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The scale of maps showing the line of route normally should be  2,000 feet to an inch. The maps may, however, be drawn to a larger scale  when necessary and when an increase in scale cannot be avoided through  the use of separate field notes, but the scale must not be increased to  such extent as to make the maps too cumbersome for convenient handling  and filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The maps shall show the allotment number of each tract of  allotted land, and shall clearly designate each tract of tribal land  affected, together with the sections, townships, and   ranges in which the lands crossed by the right-of-way are situated.</p>
