If the QIO affirms its finding, it  may suggest in writing a method for correcting the situation and a time  period for corrective action. This CAP could correspond with, or be a  continuation of, a prior CAP or be a new proposal based on additional  information received by the QIO. If the finding has been resolved to the  QIO's satisfaction, the QIO may modify its initial finding or  recommendation or close the case.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The QIO must give written notice to the practitioner or other  person of any action it takes as a result of the additional information  received, as specified in Sec. 1004.70.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> At least one member of the QIO participating in the process  which resulted in a recommendation to the OIG that a practitioner or  other person be sanctioned should practice in a similar geographic area,  e.g. urban or rural, and at least one member of the panel must be in the  same medical specialty. Both requirements can be met by a single  individual. In addition, no one at the QIO who is a participant in such  a finding may be in direct economic competition with, or have a  substantial bias for or against, that practitioner or other person being  recommended for sanction.</p>
