                            <p class="depth0">We periodically review your case to determine if you are still disabled under our rules. However, we will not begin a continuing disability review during the period in which you are using a ticket. Sections 411.170 and 411.171 describe when the period of using a ticket begins and ends. You must meet certain requirements for us to consider you to be using a ticket.
