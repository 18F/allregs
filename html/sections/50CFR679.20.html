                            <p class="depth0">This section applies to vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish in the GOA and/or the BSAI and to vessels engaged in commercial fishing for Arctic fish in the Arctic Management Area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Harvest limits--(1) OY (i) BSAI and GOA. The OY for BSAI and GOA target species is a range or specific amount that can be harvested consistently with this part, plus the amounts of ``nonspecified species'' taken incidentally to the harvest of target species. The species categories are defined in Table 1 of the specifications as provided in paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The OY for groundfish in the BSAI regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 1.4 million to 2.0 million mt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The OY for groundfish in the GOA regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 116,000 to 800,000 mt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Arctic Management Area. The OY for each target fish species identified in the Fishery Management Plan for Fish Resources of the Arctic Management Area regulated by this section and by part 600 of this chapter is 0 mt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> TAC. NMFS, after consultation with the Council, will specify and apportion the annual TAC and reserves for each calendar year among the GOA and BSAI target species. TACs in the target species category may be split or combined for purposes of establishing new TACs with apportionments thereof under paragraph (c) of this section. The sum of the TACs so specified must be within the OY range specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annual TAC determination. The annual determinations of TAC for each target species and the reapportionment of reserves may be adjusted, based upon a review of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Biological condition of groundfish stocks. Resource assessment documents prepared annually for the Council that provide information on historical catch trend; updated estimates of the MSY of the groundfish complex and its component species groups; assessments of the stock condition of each target species; assessments of the multispecies and ecosystem impacts of harvesting the groundfish complex at current levels, given the assessed condition of stocks, including consideration of rebuilding depressed stocks; and alternative harvesting strategies and related effects on the component species group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Socioeconomic considerations. Socioeconomic considerations that are consistent with the goals of the fishery management plans for the groundfish fisheries of the BSAI and the GOA, including the need to promote efficiency in the utilization of fishery resources, including minimizing costs; the need to manage for the optimum marketable size of a species; the impact of groundfish harvests on prohibited species and the domestic target fisheries that utilize these species; the desire to enhance depleted stocks; the seasonal access to the groundfish fishery by domestic fishing vessels; the commercial importance of a fishery to local communities; the importance of a fishery to subsistence users; and the need to promote utilization of certain species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Sablefish TAC--(i) Eastern GOA regulatory area. Vessels in the Eastern GOA regulatory area of the GOA using trawl gear will be allocated 5 percent of the sablefish TAC for bycatch in other trawl fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Eastern GOA regulatory area. Vessels in the Eastern GOA regulatory area of the GOA using trawl gear will be allocated 5 percent of the sablefish TAC for bycatch in other trawl fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Central and western GOA regulatory areas--(A) Hook-and-line gear. Vessels in the Central and western GOA regulatory areas using hook-and-line gear will be allocated 80 percent of the sablefish TAC in each of the Central and Western GOA regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hook-and-line gear. Vessels in the Central and western GOA regulatory areas using hook-and-line gear will be allocated 80 percent of the sablefish TAC in each of the Central and Western GOA regulatory areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trawl gear. Vessels using trawl gear will be allocated 20 percent of the sablefish TAC in these areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Bering Sea subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trawl gear. Vessels in the Bering Sea subarea using trawl gear will be allocated 50 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Aleutian Islands subarea--(A) Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 75 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Hook-and-line or pot gear. Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using hook-and-line or pot gear will be allocated 75 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trawl gear. Vessels in the Aleutian Islands subarea using trawl gear will be allocated 25 percent of each TAC for sablefish.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Pollock TAC--(i) Bering Sea Subarea--(A) AFA allocations. The pollock TAC apportioned to the Bering Sea Subarea, after subtraction of the 10 percent CDQ reserve under Sec. 679.31(a), will be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Bering Sea Subarea--(A) AFA allocations. The pollock TAC apportioned to the Bering Sea Subarea, after subtraction of the 10 percent CDQ reserve under Sec. 679.31(a), will be allocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Incidental catch allowance. The Regional Administrator will establish an incidental catch allowance to account for projected incidental catch of pollock by vessels engaged in directed fishing for groundfish other than pollock and by vessels harvesting non-pollock CDQ. If during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that the incidental catch allowance has

been set too high or too low, he/she may issue inseason notification in the Federal Register that reallocates incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa, according to the proportions established under paragraph (a)(5)(i)(A) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Directed fishing allowance. The remaining pollock TAC apportioned to the Bering Sea subarea is established as a directed fishing allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Inshore sector allocation. Fifty percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher vessels harvesting pollock for processing by AFA inshore processors. The inshore allocation will be further divided into separate allocations for cooperative and open access fishing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Inshore cooperatives. The inshore cooperative allocation will be equal to the aggregate annual allocations of all AFA inshore catcher vessel cooperatives that receive pollock allocations under Sec. 679.62(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Inshore open access. The inshore open access allocation will equal that portion of the inshore sector allocation that is not allocated to inshore cooperatives.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Catcher/processor sector allocation. Forty percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher/processors and AFA catcher vessels delivering to catcher processors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Catcher/processor and catcher vessel cooperatives. If by December 1 of the year prior to the year when fishing under the cooperative agreement will begin, NMFS receives filing of cooperative contracts and/or an inter-cooperative agreement entered into by listed AFA catcher/processors and all AFA catcher vessels with catcher/processor sector endorsements, and the Regional Administrator determines that such contracts provide for the distribution of harvest between catcher/processors and catcher vessels in a manner agreed to by all members of the catcher/processor sector cooperative(s), then NMFS will not subdivide the catcher/processor sector allocation between catcher vessels and catcher/processors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Catcher vessel allocation. If such contract is not filed with NMFS by December 1 of the preceding year, then NMFS will allocate 91.5 percent of the catcher/processor sector allocation to AFA catcher/processors engaged in directed fishing for pollock and 8.5 percent of the catcher/processor sector allocation to AFA catcher vessels delivering to catcher/processors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unlisted AFA catcher processors. Unlisted AFA catcher/processors will be limited to harvesting not more than 0.5 percent of catcher/processor sector allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Mothership sector allocation. Ten percent of the directed fishing allowance will be allocated to AFA catcher vessels harvesting pollock for processing by AFA motherships.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Excessive harvesting share. NMFS will establish an excessive harvesting share limit equal to 17.5 percent of the sum of the directed fishing allowances established under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section. The excessive harvesting share limit will be published in the annual harvest specifications and is subject to revision on an inseason basis if NMFS reallocates unharvested amounts of the incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Excessive processing share. NMFS will establish an excessive processing share limit equal to 30.0 percent of the sum of the directed fishing allowances established under paragraphs (a)(5)(i) and (a)(5)(ii) of this section. The excessive processing share limit will be published in the annual harvest specifications and is subject to revision on an inseason basis if NMFS reallocates unharvested amounts of the incidental catch allowance to the directed fishing allowance, or vice versa.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> BSAI seasonal allowances for AFA and CDQ--(1) Inshore, catcher/processor, mothership, and CDQ components. The portions of the BS subarea pollock directed fishing allowances allocated to each component under sections 206(a) and 206(b) of the AFA and the CDQ allowance in the BSAI will be divided into two seasonal allowances corresponding to the two fishing seasons set out at Sec. 679.23(e)(2), as follows: A season, 40 percent; and B season, 60 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Inseason adjustments. Within any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add or subtract any under

harvest or over harvest of a seasonal allowance for a component to the subsequent seasonal allowance for the component through notification published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Steller sea lion conservation area (SCA) harvest limit. For each component under Sections 206(a) and 206(b) of the AFA and for the open access fishery, no more than 28 percent of the annual pollock directed fishery allowance may be taken from the SCA before April 1. The SCA is defined at Sec. 679.22(a)(7)(vii).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Bogoslof District. If the Bogoslof District is open to directed fishing for pollock by regulation, then the pollock TAC for this district will be allocated according to the same procedure established for the Bering Sea subarea at paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this section. If the Bogoslof District is closed to directed fishing for pollock by regulation, then the entire TAC for this district will be allocated as an incidental catch allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> AI. (A) If a directed fishery for pollock in the AI is not specified under paragraph (c) of this section, then the entire TAC for this subarea will be allocated as an incidental catch allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> If a directed fishery for pollock in the AI is not specified under paragraph (c) of this section, then the entire TAC for this subarea will be allocated as an incidental catch allowance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> If the AI is open to directed fishing for pollock under paragraph (c) of this section, then the pollock TAC for this subarea will be specified, allocated, seasonally apportioned, and reallocated as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> AI annual TAC limitations. When the AI pollock ABC is less than 19,000 mt, the annual TAC will be no greater than the ABC. When the AI pollock ABC equals or exceeds 19,000 mt, the annual TAC will be equal to 19,000 mt.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Allocations--(i) CDQ Directed fishing allowance. 10 percent of the annual TAC will be allocated to the CDQ pollock reserve established under Sec. 679.31(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CDQ Directed fishing allowance. 10 percent of the annual TAC will be allocated to the CDQ pollock reserve established under Sec. 679.31(a)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Incidental catch allowance. The Regional Administrator will determine the amount of the pollock incidental catch necessary to support an incidental catch allowance in the AI during the fishing year for each season. This amount of pollock will be deducted from the annual TAC. If during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that the incidental catch allowance is excessive or inadequate, the Regional Administrator may reallocate the excess of the incidental catch allowance to the directed pollock fishery, or may reallocate pollock from the directed pollock fishery to the incidental catch allowance as necessary to support incidental catch of pollock in AI groundfish fisheries, by publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Directed Pollock Fishery. The amount of the TAC remaining after subtraction of the CDQ directed fishing allowance and the incidental catch allowance will be allocated to the Aleut Corporation as a directed pollock fishery allocation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Seasonal apportionment. The seasonal harvest of pollock in the AI directed pollock fishery shall be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A season. No greater than the lesser of the annual initial TAC plus any A season CDQ pollock directed fishery allowance or 40 percent of the AI pollock ABC. The total A season apportionment, including the AI directed pollock fishery allocation, the CDQ pollock directed fishery seasonal allowance, and the incidental catch amount, shall not exceed 40 percent of the ABC.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B season. The B season apportionment of the AI directed pollock fishery shall equal the annual initial TAC minus the A season directed pollock fishery apportionment under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(B)(3)(i) of this section and minus the incidental catch amount under paragraph (a)(5)(iii)(B)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Inseason adjustments for the directed pollock fishery. During any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add any under harvest of the A season directed pollock fishery apportionment to the B season directed pollock fishery apportionment by inseason notification published in the Federal Register if the Regional Administrator determines that the harvest capacity in the B season is sufficient to harvest the adjusted B season apportionment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Inseason adjustments for the incidental catch allowance. During any fishing year, the Regional Administrator may add any under harvest of the A season incidental catch allowance apportionment to the B season incidental catch allowance apportionment by publication in the Federal Register if

the Regional Administrator determines that the additional B season incidental catch allowance is necessary to support other groundfish fisheries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Reallocation of the annual AI directed pollock fishery and AI CDQ allocations. As soon as practicable, if the Regional Administrator determines that vessels participating in either the AI directed pollock fishery or the AI CDQ directed pollock fishery likely will not harvest the entire AI directed pollock fishery or CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance, the Regional Administrator may reallocate some or all of the projected unused directed pollock fishery allocation to the Bering Sea subarea directed pollock fishery or AI CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance to the Bering Sea subarea CDQ pollock directed fishing allowance by inseason notification published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Allocations to small vessels. The annual allocation for vessels 60 feet (18.3 m) LOA or less participating in the AI directed pollock fishery will be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No more than 25 percent of the AI directed pollock fishery allocation through 2008;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 50 percent of the AI directed pollock fishery allocation from 2009 through 2012; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 50 percent of the AI directed pollock fishery allocation in 2013 and beyond.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Pollock harvest limitations. Pollock harvests during the A season as defined at Sec. 679.23(e)(2) are limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> No more than 5 percent of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC in Area 543.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> No more than 15 percent of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC in Area 542.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> No more than 30 percent of the Aleutian Islands pollock ABC in Area 541.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> GOA--(A) Apportionment by area. The TAC for pollock in the combined GOA Western and Central Regulatory Areas will be apportioned among statistical areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the distribution of the pollock biomass as determined by the most recent NMFS surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Apportionment by area. The TAC for pollock in the combined GOA Western and Central Regulatory Areas will be apportioned among statistical areas 610, 620, and 630 in proportion to the distribution of the pollock biomass as determined by the most recent NMFS surveys.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> GOA Western and Central Regulatory Areas seasonal apportionments. Each apportionment established under paragraph (a)(5)(iv)(A) of this section will be divided into four seasonal apportionments corresponding to the four fishing seasons specified in Sec. 679.23(d)(2) as follows: A Season, 25 percent; B Season, 25 percent; C Season, 25 percent; and D Season, 25 percent. Within any fishing year, underharvest or overharvest of a seasonal apportionment may be added to or subtracted from remaining seasonal apportionments in a manner to be determined by the Regional Administrator, provided that any revised seasonal apportionment does not exceed 20 percent of the seasonal TAC apportionment for the statistical area. The reapportionment of underharvest will be applied to the subsequent season within the same statistical area up to the 20 percent limit specified in this paragraph. Any underharvest remaining beyond the 20 percent limit may be further apportioned to the subsequent season in the other statistical areas, in proportion to estimated biomass and in an amount no more than 20 percent of the seasonal TAC apportionment for the statistical area.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> GOA inshore/offshore allocations--(i) GOA pollock. The apportionment of pollock in all GOA regulatory areas for each seasonal allowance described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section will be allocated entirely to vessels harvesting pollock for processing by the inshore component in the GOA after subtraction of an amount that is projected by the Regional Administrator to be caught by, or delivered to, the offshore component in the GOA incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> GOA pollock. The apportionment of pollock in all GOA regulatory areas for each seasonal allowance described in paragraph (a)(5)(iv) of this section will be allocated entirely to vessels harvesting pollock for processing by the inshore component in the GOA after subtraction of an amount that is projected by the Regional Administrator to be caught by, or delivered to, the offshore component in the GOA incidental to directed fishing for other groundfish species.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Eastern GOA Regulatory Area Pacific cod. The apportionment of Pacific cod in the Eastern GOA Regulatory Area will be allocated 90 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the inshore component and 10 percent to vessels harvesting Pacific cod for processing by the offshore component.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Pacific cod TAC, BSAI--(i) CDQ reserve and seasonal allowances. (A) A total of 10.7 percent of the annual Pacific cod TAC will be allocated to the CDQ Program in the annual harvest specifications required under paragraph (c) of this section. The Pacific cod CDQ allocation will be deducted

from the annual Pacific cod TAC before allocations to the non-CDQ sectors are made under paragraph (a)(7)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> CDQ reserve and seasonal allowances. (A) A total of 10.7 percent of the annual Pacific cod TAC will be allocated to the CDQ Program in the annual harvest specifications required under paragraph (c) of this section.

During the annual harvest specifications process set forth at paragraph (c) of this section, the Regional Administrator will specify an amount of Pacific cod that NMFS estimates will be taken as incidental catch in directed fisheries for groundfish other than Pacific cod by the hook-and-line and pot gear sectors. This amount will be the incidental catch allowance and will be deducted from the aggregate portion of Pacific cod TAC annually allocated to the hook-and-line and pot gear sectors before the allocations under paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section are made to these sectors.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Reallocation among non-CDQ sectors. If, during a fishing year, the Regional Administrator determines that a non-CDQ sector will be unable to harvest the entire amount of Pacific cod allocated to that sector under paragraph (a)(7)(ii)(A) of this section, the Regional Administrator will reallocate the projected unused amount of Pacific cod to other sectors through notification in the Federal Register. Any reallocation decision by the Regional Administrator will take into account the capability of a sector to harvest the reallocated amount of Pacific cod, and the following reallocation hierarchy:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Catcher vessel sectors. The Regional Administrator will reallocate projected unharvested amounts of Pacific cod TAC from a catcher vessel sector as follows: first to the jig sector, or to the less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or pot catcher vessel sector, or to both of these sectors; second, to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sectors; and third to the trawl catcher vessel sector. If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from the jig sector allocation, the less than 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line or pot catcher vessel sector allocation, or the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA hook-and-line catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the hook-and-line catcher/processor sector.

If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from a greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the pot catcher/processor sector in accordance with the hierarchy set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(C) of this section. If the Regional Administrator determines that a projected unharvested amount from a trawl catcher vessel sector allocation is unlikely to be harvested through this hierarchy, the Regional Administrator will reallocate that amount to the other trawl sectors in accordance with the hierarchy set forth in paragraph (a)(7)(iii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Trawl gear sectors. The Regional Administrator will reallocate any projected unharvested amounts of Pacific cod TAC from the trawl catcher vessel or AFA catcher/processor sectors to other trawl sectors before unharvested amounts are reallocated and apportioned to specified gear sectors as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> 83.1 percent to the hook-and-line catcher/processor sector,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 2.6 percent to the pot catcher/processor sector, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> 14.3 percent to the greater than or equal to 60 ft (18.3 m) LOA pot catcher vessel sector.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Pot gear sectors.
