An opt-in source that withdraws from the Acid Rain Program shall comply with all requirements under the Acid Rain Program concerning all years for which the opt-in source was an affected unit, even if such requirements arise, or must be complied with after the withdrawal takes effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Notification. (1) After the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met and after the Administrator's action on withdrawal under paragraph (d) of this section is complete, the Administrator will issue a notification to the permitting authority and the designated representative of the opt-in source of the acceptance of the opt-in source's request to withdraw.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are met and after the Administrator's action on withdrawal under paragraph (d) of this section is complete, the Administrator will issue a notification to the permitting authority and the designated representative of the opt-in source of the acceptance of the opt-in source's request to withdraw.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the requirements for withdrawal under paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section are not met or the Administrator's action under paragraph (d) of this section cannot be completed, the Administrator will issue a notification to the permitting authority and the designated representative of the opt-in source that the opt-in source's request to withdraw is denied. If the opt-in source's request to withdraw is denied, the opt-in source shall remain in the Opt-in Program and shall remain subject to the requirements for opt-in sources contained in this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Permit amendment. (1) After the Administrator issues a notification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section that the requirements for withdrawal have been met (including the deduction of the full amount of allowances as required under paragraph (d) of this section), the permitting authority shall

amend, in accordance with Sec. Sec. 72.80 and 72.83 (administrative amendment) of this chapter, the opt-in source's Acid Rain permit to terminate the opt-in permit, not later than 60 days from the issuance of the notification under paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> After the Administrator issues a notification under paragraph (f)(1) of this section that the requirements for withdrawal have been met (including the deduction of the full amount of allowances as required under paragraph (d) of this section), the permitting authority shall

amend, in accordance with Sec.

If the Administrator denies the opt-in source's request to withdraw, the designated representative may submit another request to withdraw in accordance with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Ability to return to the Acid Rain Program. Once a combustion or process source withdraws from the Acid Rain Program and its opt-in permit is terminated, a new opt-in permit application for the combustion or process source may not be submitted prior to the date that is four years after the date on which the opt-in permit became effective.
