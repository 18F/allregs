                            <p class="depth0">The Minimum Performance Criteria that each University must meet in  managing its Laboratory Waste are:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each University must label all laboratory waste with the general  hazard class and either the words ``laboratory waste'' or with the  chemical name of the contents. If the container is too small to hold a  label, the label must be placed on a secondary container.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each University may temporarily hold up to 55 gallons of  laboratory waste or one quart of acutely hazardous laboratory waste, or  weight equivalent, in each laboratory, but upon reaching these  thresholds, each University must mark that laboratory waste with the  date when this threshold requirement was met (by dating the container(s)  or secondary container(s)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each university must remove all of the dated laboratory waste  from the laboratory for delivery to a location identified in paragraph  (i) of this section within 30 days of reaching the threshold amount  identified in paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In no event shall the excess laboratory waste that a laboratory  temporarily holds before dated laboratory waste is removed exceed an  additional 55 gallons of laboratory waste (or one additional quart of  acutely hazardous laboratory waste). No more than 110 gallons of  laboratory waste total (or no more than two quarts of acutely hazardous  laboratory waste total) may be temporarily held in a laboratory at any  one time. Excess laboratory waste must be dated and removed in  accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (b) and (c) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Containers of laboratory wastes must be:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Closed at all times except when wastes are being added to  (including during in-line waste collection) or removed from the  container;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Maintained in good condition and stored in the laboratory in a  manner to avoid leaks;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compatible with their contents to avoid reactions between the  waste and its container; and must be made of, or lined with, materials  which are compatible with the laboratory wastes to be temporarily held  in the laboratory so that the container is not impaired; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inspected regularly (at least annually) to ensure that they meet  requirements for container management.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The management of laboratory waste must not result in the  release of hazardous constituents into the land, air and water where  such release is prohibited under federal law.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The requirements for emergency response are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each University must post notification procedures, location of  emergency response equipment to be used by laboratory workers and  evacuation procedures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Emergency response equipment and procedures for emergency  response must be appropriate to the hazards in the laboratory such that  hazards to human health and the environment will be minimized in the  event of an emergency;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In the event of a fire, explosion or other release of laboratory  waste which could threaten human health or the environment, the  laboratory worker must follow the notification procedures under  paragraph (g)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Each University must investigate, document, and take actions to  correct and prevent future incidents of hazardous chemical spills,  exposures and other incidents that trigger a reportable emergency or  that require reporting under paragraph (g) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Each University may only transfer laboratory wastes from a  laboratory:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Directly to an on-site designated hazardous waste accumulation  area. Notwithstanding 40 CFR 263.10(a), each University must comply with  requirements for transporters set forth in 40 CFR 263.30 and 263.31 in  the event of a discharge of laboratory waste en route from a laboratory  to an on-site hazardous waste accumulation area; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> To a treatment, storage or disposal (TSD) facility permitted to  handle the waste under 40 CFR part 270 or in interim status under 40 CFR  parts 265 and 270 (or authorized to handle the waste by a state with a  hazardous waste management program approved under 40 CFR part 271) if it  is determined in the laboratory by the individuals identified in  Sec. 262.105(b)(3) to be responsible for waste management decisions that  the waste is a hazardous waste and that it is prudent to transfer it  directly to a treatment, storage, and disposal facility rather than an  on-site accumulation area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Each University must ensure that laboratory workers receive  training and are provided with information so that they can implement  and comply with these Minimum Performance Criteria.</p>
