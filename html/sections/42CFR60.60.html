                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Secretary may limit, suspend, or terminate the eligibility under the HEAL program of an otherwise eligible school that violates or fails to comply with any provision of title VII, part A, subpart I of the Act as amended (42 U.S.C. 292-292p), these regulations, or agreements with the Secretary concerning the HEAL program. Prior to terminating a school's participation in the program, the Secretary will provide the school an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures under paragraph (b) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Secretary will provide any school subject to termination with a written notice, sent by certified mail, specifying his or her intention to terminate the school's participation in the program and stating that the school may request, within 30 days of the receipt of this notice, a formal hearing. If the school requests a hearing, it must, within 90 days of the receipt of the notice, submit material, factual issues in dispute to demonstrate that there is cause for a hearing. These issues must be both substantive and relevant. The hearing will be held in the Washington, DC metropolitan area. The Secretary will deny a hearing if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request for a hearing is untimely (i.e., fails to meet the 30-day requirement);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The school does not provide a statement of material, factual issues in dispute within the 90-day required period; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The statement of factual issues in dispute is frivolous or inconsequential.
In the event that the Secretary denies a hearing, the Secretary will send a written denial, by certified mail, to the school setting forth the reasons for denial. If a hearing is denied, or if as a result of the hearing, termination is still determined to be necessary, the school will be terminated from participation in the program. A school will be permitted to reapply for participation in the program when it demonstrates, and the Secretary agrees, that it is in compliance with all HEAL requirements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not apply to a determination that a HEAL school fails to meet the statutory definition of an ``eligible school.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> This section does not apply to administrative action by the Department of Health and Human Services based on any alleged violation of The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (section 438 of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended), as governed by 34 CFR part 99.
