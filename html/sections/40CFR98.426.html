applicable:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If you use Equation PP-1 of this subpart, report the following information for each mass flow meter or CO2 stream that delivers CO2 to containers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual mass in metric tons of CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly mass in metric tons of CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quarterly concentration of the

points of CO2 stream capture, dehydration, compression, and other processing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If you use Equation PP-2 of this subpart, report the following information for each volumetric flow meter or CO2 stream that delivers CO2 to containers:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Annual mass in metric tons of CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Quarterly volume in standard cubic meters of CO2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Quarterly concentration of the CO2 stream in volume or weight percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Report density as follows:</p><p

percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Quarterly density of CO2 in metric tons per standard cubic meter if you report the concentration of the CO2 stream in paragraph (b)(3) of this section in volume percent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The method used to measure density.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The standard used to measure CO2 concentration.</p><p

of this subpart, report the annual CO2 mass in metric tons from all flow meters and CO2 streams that deliver CO2 to containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If you use Equation PP-3b of this subpart, report:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The total annual CO2 mass through main flow meter(s) in metric tons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The total annual CO2 mass through subsequent flow meter(s) in metric tons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The total annual CO2 mass supplied in metric tons.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The location of each flow meter in relation to the point of segregation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> If you use Equation PP-4 of this subpart, report at the corporate level the annual mass of CO2 in metric tons in all CO2 containers that are imported or exported.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each reporter shall report the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The type of equipment used to measure the total flow of the CO2 stream or the total mass or volume in CO2 containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The standard used to operate and calibrate the equipment reported in (e)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The number of days in the reporting year for which substitute data procedures were used for the following purpose:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> To measure quantity.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> To measure concentration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> To measure density.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Report the aggregated annual quantity of CO2 in metric tons that is transferred to each of the following end use applications, if known:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Food and beverage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Industrial and
