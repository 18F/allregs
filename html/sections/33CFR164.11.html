Buoys may not maintain an exact position  because strong or varying currents, heavy seas, ice, and collisions with  vessels can move or sink them or set them adrift. Although buoys may  corroborate a position fixed by other means, buoys cannot be used to fix  a position: however, if no other aids are available, buoys alone may be  used to establish an estimated position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The danger of each closing visual or each closing radar contact  is evaluated and the person directing the movement of the vessel knows  the evaluation;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Rudder orders are executed as given;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Engine speed and direction orders are executed as given;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Magnetic variation and deviation and gyrocompass errors are  known and correctly applied by the person directing the movement of the  vessel;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> A person whom he has determined is competent to steer the vessel  is in the wheelhouse at all times; \1\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\1\ See also 46 U.S.C. 8702(d), which requires an able seaman at the  wheel on U.S. vessels of 100 gross tons or more in narrow or crowded  waters during low visibility. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> If a pilot other than a member of the vessel's crew is employed,  the pilot is informed of the draft, maneuvering characteristics, and  peculiarities of the vessel and of any abnormal circumstances on the  vessel that may affect its safe navigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Current velocity and direction for the area to be transited are  known by the person directing the movement of the vessel;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(m)</em> Predicted set and drift are known by the person directing  movement of the vessel;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(n)</em> Tidal state for the area to be transited is known by the person  directing movement of the vessel;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(o)</em> The vessel's anchors are ready for letting go;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(p)</em> The person directing the movement of the vessel sets the  vessel's speed with consideration for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The prevailing visibility and weather conditions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proximity of the vessel to fixed shore and marine  structures;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The tendency of the vessel underway to squat and suffer  impairment of maneuverability when there is small underkeel clearance;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The comparative proportions of the vessel and the channel;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The density of marine traffic;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The damage that might be caused by the vessel's wake;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The strength and direction of the current; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Any local vessel speed limit;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> The tests required by Sec. 164.25 are made and recorded in the  vessel's log; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> The equipment required by this part is maintained in operable  condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> Upon entering U.S. waters, the steering wheel or lever on the  navigating bridge is operated to determine if the steering equipment is  operating properly under manual control, unless the vessel has been  steered under manual control from the navigating bridge within the  preceding 2 hours, except when operating on the Great Lakes and their  connecting and tributary waters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> At least two of the steering-gear power units on the vessel are  in operation when such units are capable of simultaneous operation,  except when the vessel is sailing on the Great Lakes and their  connecting and tributary waters, and except as required by paragraph (u)  of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> On each passenger vessel meeting the requirements of the  International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea, 1960 (SOLAS 60)  and on each cargo vessel meeting the requirements of SOLAS 74 as amended  in 1981, the number of steering-gear power units necessary to move the  rudder from 35 on either side to 30 on the other in not more than 28  seconds must be in simultaneous operation.
