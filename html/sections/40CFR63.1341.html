Conveying systems include but are not limited to the following: feeders,  belt conveyors, bucket elevators and pneumatic systems.</p><p class="depth0">Conveying system transfer point means a point where any material  including but not limited to feed material, fuel, clinker or product, is  transferred to or from a conveying system, or between separate parts of  a conveying system.</p><p class="depth0">Crusher means a machine designed to reduce large rocks from the  quarry into materials approximately the size of gravel.</p><p class="depth0">Dioxins and furans (D/F)means tetra-, penta-, hexa-, hepta-, and  octa-chlorinated dibenzo dioxins and furans.</p><p class="depth0">Facility means all contiguous or adjoining property that is under  common ownership or control, including properties that are separated  only by a road or other public right-of-way.</p><p class="depth0">Feed means the prepared and mixed materials, which include but are  not limited to materials such as limestone, clay, shale, sand, iron ore,  mill scale, cement kiln dust and flyash, that are fed to the kiln. Feed  does not include the fuels used in the kiln to produce heat to form the  clinker product.</p><p class="depth0">Finish mill means a roll crusher, ball and tube mill or other size  reduction equipment used to grind clinker to a fine powder. Gypsum and  other materials may be added to and blended with clinker in a finish  mill.

Coal mills with a heat source other than the kiln or coal  mills using exhaust gases from the clinker cooler are not an in-line  coal mill.</p><p class="depth0">In-line kiln/raw mill means a system in a portland cement production  process where a dry kiln system is integrated with the raw mill so that  all or a portion of the kiln exhaust gases are used to perform the  drying operation of the raw mill, with no auxiliary heat source used. In  this system the kiln is capable of operating without the raw mill  operating, but the raw mill cannot operate without the kiln gases, and  consequently, the raw mill does not generate a separate exhaust gas  stream.</p><p class="depth0">Kiln means a device, including any associated preheater or  precalciner devices, inline raw mills, inline coal mills or alkali  bypasses that produces clinker by heating limestone and other materials  for subsequent production of portland cement. Because the inline raw  mill and inline coal mill are considered an integral part of the kiln,  for purposes of determining the appropriate emissions limit, the term  kiln also applies to the exhaust of the inline raw mill and the inline  coal mill.</p><p class="depth0">Kiln exhaust gas bypass means alkali bypass.</p><p class="depth0">Monovent means an exhaust configuration of a building or emission  control device (e. g. positive pressure fabric filter) that extends the  length of the structure and has a width very small in relation to its  length (i. e., length to width ratio is typically greater than 5:1). The  exhaust may be an open vent with or without a roof, louvered vents, or a  combination of such features.</p><p class="depth0">New brownfield kiln, in-line kiln raw mill, or raw material dryer  means a kiln, in-line kiln/raw mill or raw material dryer for which  construction is commenced at a plant site (where kilns and/or in-line  kiln/raw mills were in operation prior to March 24, 1998) after March  24, 1998.</p><p class="depth0">New source means any source that commenced construction or  reconstruction after May 6, 2009, for purposes of determining the  applicability of the   kiln, clinker cooler and raw material dryer emissions limits for  mercury, PM, THC, and HCl.</p><p class="depth0">One-minute average means the average of thermocouple or other sensor  responses calculated at least every 60 seconds from responses obtained  at least once during each consecutive 15 second period.</p><p class="depth0">Open clinker storage pile means a clinker storage pile on the ground  for more than three days that is not completely enclosed in a building  or structure.</p><p class="depth0">Operating day means any 24-hour period beginning at 12:00 midnight  during which the kiln operates for any time. For calculating the rolling  30-day average emissions, kiln operating days do not include the hours  of operation during startup or shutdown.</p><p class="depth0">Portland cement plant means any facility manufacturing portland  cement.</p><p class="depth0">Raw material dryer means an impact dryer, drum dryer, paddle- equipped rapid dryer, air separator, or other equipment used to reduce  the moisture content of feed or other materials.</p><p class="depth0">Raw mill means a ball and tube mill, vertical roller mill or other  size reduction equipment, that is not part of an in-line kiln/raw mill,  used to grind feed to the appropriate size. Moisture may be added or  removed from the feed during the grinding operation. If the raw mill is  used to remove moisture from feed materials, it is also, by definition,  a raw material dryer. The raw mill also includes the air separator  associated with the raw mill.</p><p class="depth0">Rolling average means the average of all one-minute averages over  the averaging period.</p><p class="depth0">Run average means the average of the one-minute parameter values for  a run.</p><p class="depth0">Shutdown means the cessation of kiln operation. Shutdown begins when  feed to the kiln is halted and ends when continuous kiln rotation  ceases.</p><p class="depth0">Sorbent means activated carbon, lime, or any other type of material  injected into kiln exhaust for the purposes of capturing and removing  any hazardous air pollutant.</p><p class="depth0">Startup means the time from when a shutdown kiln first begins firing  fuel until it begins producing clinker. Startup begins when a shutdown  kiln turns on the induced draft fan and begins firing fuel in the main  burner. Startup ends when feed is being continuously introduced into the  kiln for at least 120 minutes or when the feed rate exceeds 60 percent  of the kiln design limitation rate, whichever occurs first.</p><p class="depth0">TEQ means the international method of expressing toxicity  equivalents for dioxins and furans as defined in U.S. EPA, Interim  Procedures for Estimating Risks Associated with Exposures to Mixtures of  Chlorinated Dibenzo-p-dioxins and -dibenzofurans (CDDs and CDFs) and  1989 Update, March 1989.</p><p class="depth0">Total organic HAP means, for the purposes of this subpart, the sum  of the concentrations of compounds of formaldehyde, benzene, toluene,  styrene, m-xylene, p-xylene, o-xylene, acetaldehyde, and naphthalene as  measured by EPA Test Method 320 or Method 18 of appendix A to this part  or ASTM D6348-03 \1\ or a combination of these methods, as appropriate.  If measurement results for any pollutant are reported as below the  method detection level (e.g., laboratory analytical results for one or  more sample components are below the method defined analytical detection  level), you must use the method detection level as the measured  emissions level for that pollutant in calculating the total organic HAP  value. The measured result for a multiple component analysis (e.g.,  analytical values for multiple Method 18 fractions) may include a  combination   of method detection level data and analytical data reported above the  method detection level. The owner or operator of an affected source may  request the use of other test methods to make this determination under  paragraphs 63.7(e)(2)(ii) and (f) of this part. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\1\ When using ASTM D6348-03, the following conditions must be met:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> The test plan preparation and implementation in the Annexes to  ASTM D6348-03, Sections A1 through A8 are mandatory; (2) For ASTM D6348- 03 Annex A5 (Analyte Spiking Technique), the percent R must be  determined for each target analyte (see Equation A5.5); (3) For the ASTM  D6348-03 test data to be acceptable for a target analyte percent R must  be 70 percent =R <=130 percent; and (4) The percent R value  for each compound must be reported in the test report and all field  measurements corrected with the calculated percent R value for that  compound using the following equation: Reported Result = The measured  concentration in the stack divided by the calculated percent R value and  then the whole term multiplied by 100. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Totally enclosed conveying system transfer point means a conveying  system transfer point that is enclosed on all sides, top, and bottom.
