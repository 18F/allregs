regulations thereunder relating to adulteration and misbranding. For example, all regulations under section 401 contemplate that the food and all articles used as components or ingredients thereof shall not be poisonous or deleterious and shall be clean, sound, and fit for food. A provision in such regulations for the use of coloring or flavoring does not authorize such use under circumstances or in a manner whereby damage or inferiority is concealed or whereby the food is made to appear better or of greater value than it is.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Safe and suitable means that the ingredient:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Performs an appropriate function in the food in which it is used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Is used at a level no higher than necessary to achieve its intended purpose in that food.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is not a food additive or color additive as defined in section 201 (s) or (t) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act as used in that food, or is a food additive or color additive as so defined and is used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to section 409 or 721 of the act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Section 403(i) of the act requires the listing of all ingredients in standardized foods. All ingredients must be listed in accordance with the requirements of part 101 of this chapter, except that where a definition and standard of identity has specific labeling provisions for optional ingredients, optional ingredients may be declared in accordance with those provisions.
