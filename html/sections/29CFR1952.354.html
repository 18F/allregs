                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with section 18(e) of the Act and procedures in 29 CFR part 1902, and after a determination that the State met the ``fully effective'' compliance staffing benchmarks as revised in 1984 in response to a Court Order in AFL-CIO v. Marshall, (CA 74-406), and was satisfactorily providing reports to OSHA through participation in the Federal-State Unified Management Information System, the Assistant Secretary evaluated actual operations under the State plan for a period of at least one year following certification of completion of developmental steps (46 FR 46320). Based on the 18(e) Evaluation Report (October 1982-March 1984) and after opportunity for public comment, the Assistant Secretary determined that, in operation, the State of Arizona's occupational safety and health program is at least as effective as the Federal program in providing safe and healthful employment and places of employment and meets the criteria for final State plan approval in section 18(e) of the Act and implementing regulations at 29 CFR part 1902. Accordingly, the Arizona plan was granted final approval and concurrent Federal enforcement authority was relinquished under section 18(e) of the Act effective June 20, 1985.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Except as otherwise noted, the plan which has received final approval covers all activities of employers and all places of employment in Arizona. The plan does not cover private sector maritime employment; Federal government employers and employees; enforcement relating to any contractors or subcontractors on any Federal establishment where the land is determined to be exclusive Federal jurisdiction; the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), including USPS employees, and contract employees and contractor-operated facilities engaged in USPS mail operations; copper smelters; concrete and asphalt batch plants that are physically connected to a mine or so interdependent with a mine as to form one

integral enterprise; and Indian reservations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Arizona is required to maintain a State program which is at least as effective as operations under the Federal program; to submit plan supplements in accordance with 29 CFR part 1953; to allocate sufficient safety and health enforcement staff to meet the benchmarks for State staffing established by the U.S. Department of Labor, or any revision to those benchmarks; and, to furnish such reports in such form as the Assistant Secretary may from time to time require.
[50 FR 25571, June 20, 1985, as amended at 63 FR 53281, Oct. 5, 1998; 65 FR 36629, June 9, 2000]</p>
