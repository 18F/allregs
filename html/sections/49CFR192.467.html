                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each buried or submerged pipeline must be electrically isolated from other underground metallic structures, unless the pipeline and the other structures are electrically interconnected and cathodically protected as a single unit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> One or more insulating devices must be installed where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to facilitate the application of corrosion control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Except for unprotected copper inserted in ferrous pipe, each pipeline must be electrically isolated from metallic casings that are a part of the underground system. However, if isolation is not achieved because it is impractical, other measures must be taken to minimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inspection and electrical tests must be made to assure that electrical isolation is adequate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> An insulating device may not be installed in an area where a combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are taken to prevent arcing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Where a pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical transmission tower footings, ground cables or counterpoise, or in other areas where fault currents or unusual risk of lightning may be anticipated, it must be provided with protection against damage due to fault currents or lightning, and protective measures must also be taken at insulating devices.
