unless the contest charges be sufficient, if proven, to negative the right of the entryman to an extension of time for making final proof. If the contest charges be insufficient, the application for extension, where regular in all respects, will be allowed and the contest dismissed subject to the right of appeal, but without prejudice to the contestant's right to amend his charges.</p>
