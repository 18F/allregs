                            <p class="depth0">The regulations in this part establish the procedures by which the  Secretary of Health and Human Services (the Secretary) will determine  whether a practitioner is qualified under section 303(g) of the  Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 823(g)) to dispense opioid drugs in  the treatment of opioid addiction. These regulations also establish the  Secretary's standards regarding the appropriate quantities of opioid  drugs that may be provided for unsupervised use by individuals  undergoing such treatment (21 U.S.C. 823(g)(1)). Under these  regulations, a practitioner who intends to dispense opioid drugs in the  treatment of opioid addiction must first obtain from the Secretary or by  delegation, from the Administrator, Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration (SAMHSA), a certification that the practitioner  is   qualified under the Secretary's standards and will comply with such  standards. Eligibility for certification will depend upon the  practitioner obtaining accreditation from an accreditation body that has  been approved by SAMHSA. These regulations establish the procedures  whereby an entity can apply to become an approved accreditation body.  This part also establishes requirements and general standards for  accreditation bodies to ensure that practitioners are consistently  evaluated for compliance with the Secretary's standards for opiate  addiction treatment with an opioid agonist treatment medication.</p>
