Where the brewer has furnished bond on Form 2898, and payment of the tax is to be deferred, he shall execute the agreement on Form 2900 to pay the amount of tax which has been computed and entered on the form. He shall also certify under the penalties of perjury that he is not in default of any payment of tax chargeable against his bond, and that his bond is in the maximum penal sum, or that it is sufficient to cover the amount of tax on the beer described on the form in addition to all other amounts chargeable against his bond. The brewer shall deliver all copies of Form 2900 to the revenue agent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Action by revenue agent. On receipt of Form 2900, the revenue agent shall verify the computation of the tax entered on the form, and if the proprietor has on file a good and sufficient bond, Form 2898, so indicate on Form 2900. The revenue agent shall then execute his report of release on the Form 2900 and release the beer for the purpose authorized on the form. The completed form shall be distributed in the same manner as provided for TTB Form 5110.51 in Sec. 26.80(b). Where the revenue agent finds that the proprietor does not have good and sufficient bond coverage, or that the proprietor is in default of payment of any taxes previously charged to his bond, he shall return all copies of Form 2900 to the proprietor, giving his reasons for such action.
