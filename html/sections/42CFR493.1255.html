                            <p class="depth0">Calibration and calibration verification procedures are required to substantiate the continued accuracy of the test system throughout the laboratory's reportable range of test results for the test system. Unless otherwise specified in this subpart, for each applicable test system the laboratory must do the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Perform and document calibration procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the manufacturer's test system instructions, using calibration materials provided or specified, and with at least the frequency recommended by the manufacturer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Using the criteria verified or established by the laboratory as specified in Sec. 493.1253(b)(3)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Using calibration materials appropriate for the test system and, if possible, traceable to a reference method or reference material of known value; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Including the number, type, and concentration of calibration materials, as well as acceptable limits for and the frequency of calibration; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Whenever calibration verification fails to meet the laboratory's acceptable limits for calibration verification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Perform and document calibration verification procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Following the manufacturer's calibration verification instructions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Using the criteria verified or established by the laboratory under Sec. 493.1253(b)(3)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Including the number, type, and concentration of the materials, as well as acceptable limits for calibration verification; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Including at least a minimal (or zero) value, a mid-point value, and a maximum value near the upper limit of

the range to verify the laboratory's reportable range of test results for the test system; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> At least once every 6 months and whenever any of the following occur:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A complete change of reagents for a procedure is introduced, unless the laboratory can demonstrate that changing reagent lot numbers does not affect the range used to report patient test results, and control values are not adversely affected by reagent lot number changes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> There is major preventive maintenance or replacement of critical parts that may influence test performance.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Control materials reflect an unusual trend or shift, or are outside of the laboratory's acceptable limits, and other means of assessing and correcting unacceptable control values fail to identify and correct the problem.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The laboratory's established schedule for verifying the reportable range for patient test results requires more frequent calibration verification.</p>
