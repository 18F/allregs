                                Sec. 1.166-4  Reserve for bad debts.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Allowance of deduction. A taxpayer who has established the  reserve method of treating bad debts and has maintained proper reserve  accounts for bad debts or who, in accordance with paragraph (b) of Sec.  1.166-1, adopts the reserve method of treating bad debts may deduct from  gross income a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts in lieu of  deducting specific bad debt items. This paragraph applies both to bad  debts owed to the taxpayer and to bad debts arising out of section  166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations. If a reserve is maintained for  bad debts arising out of section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt  obligations, then a separate reserve must also be maintained for all  other debt obligations of the taxpayer in the same trade or business, if  any. A taxpayer may not maintain a reserve for bad debts arising out of  section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations if with respect to  direct debt obligations in the same trade or business the taxpayer takes  deductions when the debts become worthless in whole or in part rather  than maintaining a reserve for such obligations. See Sec. 1.166-10 for  rules concerning section 166(f)(1)(A) guaranteed debt obligations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Reasonableness of addition to reserve--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relevant factors.  What constitutes a reasonable addition to a reserve for bad debts shall  be determined in the light of the facts existing at the close of the  taxable year of the proposed addition. The reasonableness of the  addition will vary as between classes of business and with conditions of   business prosperity. It will depend primarily upon the total amount of  debts outstanding as of the close of the taxable year, including those  arising currently as well as those arising in prior taxable years, and  the total amount of the existing reserve.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Correction of errors in prior estimates. In the event that  subsequent realizations upon outstanding debts prove to be more or less  than estimated at the time of the creation of the existing reserve, the  amount of the excess or inadequacy in the existing reserve shall be  reflected in the determination of the reasonable addition necessary in  the current taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Statement required. A taxpayer using the reserve method shall  file with his return a statement showing--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The volume of his charge sales or other business transactions  for the taxable year and the percentage of the reserve to such amount;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The total amount of notes and accounts receivable at the  beginning and close of the taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of the debts which have become wholly or partially  worthless and have been charged against the reserve account; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The computation of the addition to the reserve for bad debts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special rules applicable to financial institutions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For  special rules for the addition to the bad debt reserves of certain  banks, see Sec. Sec. 1.585-1 through 1.585-3.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For special rules for the addition to the bad debt reserves of  small business investment companies and business development  corporations, see Sec. Sec. 1.586-1 and 1.586-2.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For special rules for the addition to the bad debts reserves of  certain mutual savings banks, domestic building and loan associations,  and cooperative banks, see Sec. Sec. 1.593-1 through 1.593-11.
