                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> FAR procedures. Procuring activities will conduct competitions among and evaluate offers received from Participants in accordance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation (48 CFR, chapter 1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Eligibility determination by SBA. In either a negotiated or sealed bid competitive 8(a) acquisition, the procuring activity will request that the SBA district office servicing the apparent successful offeror determine that firm's eligibility for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Within 5 working days after receipt of a procuring activity's request for an eligibility determination, SBA will determine whether the firm identified by the procuring activity is eligible for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Eligibility is based on 8(a) BD program criteria, including whether the Participant is:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A small business under the NAICS code assigned to the requirement;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In compliance with any applicable competitive business mix target established or remedial measure imposed by Sec. 124.509 that does not include the denial of future 8(a) contracts;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In compliance with the continued eligibility reporting requirements set forth in Sec. 124.112(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In the developmental stage of program participation if the solicitation restricts offerors to the developmental stage of participation; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A concern with a bona fide place of business in the applicable geographic area if the procurement is for construction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If SBA determines that the apparent successful offeror is ineligible, SBA will notify the procuring activity. The procuring activity will then send to SBA the identity of the next highest evaluated firm for an eligibility determination. The process is repeated until SBA determines that an identified offeror is eligible for award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Except to the extent set forth in paragraph (d) of this section, SBA determines whether a Participant is eligible for a specific 8(a) competitive requirement as of the date that the Participant submitted its initial offer which includes price.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> If the procuring activity contracting officer believes that the apparent successful offeror is not responsible to perform the contract, he or she must refer the concern to SBA for a possible Certificate of Competency in accord with Sec. 125.5 of this title.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Restricted competition--(1) Competition within stages of program participation. SBA may accept a competitive 8(a) requirement that is limited to Participants in the developmental stage of program participation, or may accept a requirement to be competed among firms both in the developmental and transitional stages of program participation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Construction competitions. Based on its knowledge of the 8(a) BD portfolio, SBA will determine whether a competitive 8(a) construction requirement should be competed among only those Participants having a bona fide place of business within the geographical boundaries of one or more SBA district offices, within a state, or within the state and nearby areas. Only those Participants with bona fide places of business within the appropriate geographical boundaries are eligible to submit offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A Participant may have bona fide places of business in more than one location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In order for a Participant to establish a bona fide place of business in a particular geographic location, the SBA district office serving the geographic area of that location must determine if that location in fact qualifies as a bona fide place of business under SBA's requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A Participant must submit a request for a bona fide business determination to the SBA district office servicing it.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The servicing district office will forward the request to the SBA district office serving the geographic area of the particular location for processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The effective date of a bona fide place of business is the date that the evidence (paperwork) shows that the business in fact regularly maintained its business at the new geographic location.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> In order for a Participant to be eligible to submit an offer for a 8(a) procurement limited to a specific geographic area, it must receive from SBA a determination that it has a bona fide place of business within that area prior to submitting its offer for the procurement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Competition for all non-construction requirements. Except for construction requirements, all eligible Participants regardless of location may submit offers in response to competitive 8(a) solicitations. The only geographic restrictions pertaining to 8(a) competitive requirements, other than those for construction requirements, are any imposed by the solicitations themselves.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Award to firms whose program terms have expired. A concern that has completed its term of participation in the 8(a) BD program may be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was a Participant eligible for award of the contract on the initial date specified for receipt of offers contained in the contract solicitation, and if it continues to meet all other applicable eligibility criteria.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Amendments to the solicitation extending the date for submissions of offers will be disregarded.</p><p class="depth0">Example to paragraph (d)(1). The program term for 8(a) Participant X is scheduled to expire on December 19. A solicitation for a competitive 8(a) procurement specifies that initial offers are due on December 15. The procuring activity amends the solicitation to extend the date for the receipt of offers to January 5. X submits its offer on January 5 and is selected as the apparent successful offeror. X is eligible for award because it was an eligible 8(a) Participant on the initial

date set forth in the solicitation for the receipt of offers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a negotiated procurement, a Participant may submit revised offers, including a best and final offer, and be awarded a competitive 8(a) contract if it was eligible as of the initial date specified for the receipt of offers in the solicitation, even though its program term may expire after that date.
