                            <p class="depth0">This regulation deals with home insulation labels, fact sheets, ads, and other promotional materials in or affecting commerce, as ``commerce'' is defined in the Federal Trade Commission Act. If you are covered by this regulation, breaking any of its rules is an unfair and deceptive act or practice or an unfair method of competition under section 5 of that Act. You can be fined heavily (up to $11,000 plus an adjustment for inflation, under Sec. 1.98 of this chapter) each time you break a rule.
