                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> To enable the Board to calculate the revenue shortfall  allocation method (RSAM), which is one of the three benchmarks that are  used to determine the reasonableness of a challenged rate under one  standard of the Board's Simplified Standards for Rail Rate Cases, STB  Docket No. 646 (Sub-No. 1) (STB served Sept. 5, 2007), the Association  of American Railroads (AAR) shall file with the Board, on or before May  30, the weighted average State tax rates applicable to each Class I  railroad for the previous year. The AAR shall submit workpapers  detailing its calculations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Board will serve and publish a notice of the filing in the  Federal Register within 10 days of the AAR's filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any interested party may file comments on the AAR's filing  within 30 days of the notice described in paragraph (b) of this section.  If no comments are received within 30 days, the Board will automatically  adopt the AAR's weighted average State tax rates on the 31st day. If  comments opposing the AAR's calculations are received, the AAR's  response will be due within 20 days of the comments. The Board will  review the submission and comments and serve a decision within 60 days  from the date of the close of the record that either accepts, rejects,  or modifies the AAR's railroad-specific tax information.
