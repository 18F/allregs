CMS will consult with an expert outside advisory panel composed of an appropriate selection of representatives of providers to review (and advise CMS concerning) the clinical integrity of the groups and weights. The panel may use data collected or developed by entities and organizations (other than the Department of Health and Human Services) in conducting the review.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective dates. CMS conducts the first annual review under paragraph (a) of this section in 2001 for payments made in 2002.</p>
