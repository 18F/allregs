                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A swap execution facility's program of risk analysis and  oversight with respect to its operations and automated systems shall  address each of the following categories of risk analysis and oversight:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Business continuity-disaster recovery planning and resources;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Capacity and performance planning;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Systems operations;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Systems development and quality assurance; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Physical security and environmental controls.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A swap execution facility shall maintain a business continuity- disaster recovery plan and resources, emergency procedures, and backup  facilities sufficient to enable timely recovery and resumption of its  operations and resumption of its ongoing fulfillment of its  responsibilities and obligations as a swap execution facility following  any disruption of its operations. Such responsibilities and obligations  include, without limitation, order processing and trade matching;  transmission of matched orders to a designated clearing organization for  clearing, where appropriate; price reporting; market surveillance; and  maintenance of a comprehensive audit trail. The swap execution  facility's business continuity-disaster recovery plan and resources  generally should enable resumption of trading and clearing of swaps  executed on the swap execution facility during the next business day  following the disruption. Swap execution facilities determined by the  Commission to be critical financial markets pursuant to appendix E to  part 40 of this chapter are subject to more stringent requirements in  this regard, set forth in Sec. 40.9 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A swap execution facility that is not determined by the  Commission to be a critical financial market satisfies the requirement  to be able to resume its operations and resume its ongoing fulfillment  of its responsibilities and obligations during the next business day  following any disruption of its operations by maintaining either:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Infrastructure and personnel resources of its own that are  sufficient to ensure timely recovery and resumption of its operations  and resumption of its ongoing fulfillment of its responsibilities and  obligations as a swap execution facility following any disruption of its  operations; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contractual arrangements with other swap execution facilities or  disaster recovery service providers, as appropriate, that are sufficient  to ensure continued trading and clearing of swaps executed on the swap  execution facility, and ongoing fulfillment of all of the swap execution  facility's responsibilities and obligations with respect to such swaps,  in the event that a disruption renders the swap execution facility  temporarily or permanently unable to satisfy this requirement on its own  behalf.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A swap execution facility shall notify Commission staff promptly  of all:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Electronic trading halts and material system malfunctions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cyber security incidents or targeted threats that actually or  potentially jeopardize automated system operation, reliability,  security, or capacity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Activations of the swap execution facility's business  continuity-disaster recovery plan.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A swap execution facility shall provide Commission staff timely  advance notice of all material:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Planned changes to automated systems that may impact the  reliability, security, or adequate scalable capacity of such systems;  and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Planned changes to the swap execution facility's program of risk  analysis and oversight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> A swap execution facility shall provide to the Commission, upon  request, current copies of its business continuity-disaster recovery  plan and other emergency procedures, its assessments of its operational  risks, and other documents requested by Commission staff for the purpose  of maintaining a current profile of the swap execution facility's  automated systems.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> A swap execution facility shall conduct regular, periodic,  objective testing and review of its automated systems to ensure that  they are reliable, secure, and have adequate scalable capacity. A swap  execution facility shall also conduct regular, periodic testing and  review of its business continuity-disaster recovery capabilities.  Pursuant to Core Principle 10 under section 5h of the Act (Recordkeeping  and Reporting) and Sec. Sec. 37.1000 through 37.1001, the swap  execution facility shall keep records of all such tests, and make all  test results available to the Commission upon request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Part 40 of this chapter governs the obligations of those  registered entities that the Commission has determined to be critical  financial markets, with respect to maintenance and geographic dispersal  of disaster recovery resources sufficient to meet a same-day recovery  time objective in the event of a wide-scale disruption. Section 40.9  establishes the requirements for core principle compliance in that  respect.</p>
