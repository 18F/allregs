This Moving Exclusionary Zone is activated only when surface visibility exceeds one nautical mile, between sunrise and sunset, and the Makah whale hunt vessel displays the international numeral pennant five (5). The Moving Exclusionary Zone is deactivated upon sunset, visibility is reduced to less than one nautical mile, or when the Makah hunt vessel strikes international numeral pennant five (5).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Unless otherwise authorized by the Commander, Thirteenth Coast Guard District or his or her representative, no person or vessel may enter the active Moving Exclusionary Zone except for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Authorized Makah whale hunt vessel actively engaged in hunting operations under direction of the master of the Makah vessel flying international numeral pennant five (5), and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A single authorized media pool vessel operating in accordance with paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The international numeral pennant five (5) is only authorized to be displayed from one Makah whale hunt vessel during actual whale hunt operations. No other vessels may display this pennant within the RNA at any time.

Whale hunt operations cease once this intent is abandoned, a whale is landed, or when the international numeral pennant five (5) is struck.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Makah Tribe shall make SECURITE broadcasts beginning one half hour before the commencement of a hunt and every half hour thereafter until hunting activities are concluded.
