                                Sec. 121.185  Airplanes: Reciprocating engine-powered: Landing
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section no person operating a reciprocating engine powered airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction in still air.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet the requirements of paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is specified that meets all of the requirements of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This section does not apply to large nontransport category airplanes operated under Sec. 121.173(c).
