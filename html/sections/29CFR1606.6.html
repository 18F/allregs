Employers and  other users of selection procedures should refer to the UGESP for  guidance on matters, such as adverse impact, validation and  recordkeeping requirements for national origin groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Because height or weight requirements tend to exclude  individuals on the basis of national origin, \3\ the user is expected to  evaluate these selection procedures for adverse impact, regardless of  whether the total selection process has an adverse impact based on  national origin. Therefore, height or weight requirements are identified  here, as they are in the UGESP, \4\ as exceptions to the ``bottom line''  concept. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">\3\ See CD 71-1529 (1971), CCH EEOC Decisions ] 6231, 3 FEP Cases  952; CD 71-1418 (1971), CCH EEOC Decisions ] 6223, 3 FEP Cases 580; CD  74-25 (1973), CCH EEOC Decisions ] 6400, 10 FEP Cases 260.
