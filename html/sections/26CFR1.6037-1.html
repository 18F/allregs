                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> not to  be subject to the tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code shall file, with  respect to each taxable year for which the election is in effect, a  return of income on Form 1120-S. The return shall set forth the   items of gross income and the deductions allowable in computing taxable  income as required by the return form or in the instructions issued with  respect thereto and shall be signed in accordance with section 6062 by  the person authorized to sign a return. The return shall also set forth  the following information concerning the electing small business  corporation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The names and addresses of all persons owning stock in the  corporation at any time during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of shares of stock owned by each shareholder at all  times during the taxable year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The amount of money and other property distributed by the  corporation during the taxable year to each shareholder;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The date of each distribution of money and other property; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Such other information as is required by the form or by the  instructions issued with respect to such form.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Time and place for filing return. The return shall be filed on  or before the 15th day of the third month following the close of the  taxable year with the internal revenue officer designated in the  instructions applicable to Form 1120-S. (See section 6072.)</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Other provisions. The return on Form 1120-S will be treated as a  return filed by the corporation under section 6012, relating to persons  required to make returns of income, for purposes of the provisions of  chapter 66 of the Code, relating to limitations. Thus, for example, the  period of limitation on assessment and collection of any corporate tax  found to be due upon a subsequent determination that the corporation was  not entitled to the benefits of subchapter S, chapter 1 of the Code,  will run from the date of filing the return under section 6037, or from  the date prescribed for filing such return, whichever is the later. For  the rules requiring the disclosure of certain transactions, see Sec.  1.6011-4T.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Penalties. For criminal penalties for failure to file a return,  supply information, or pay tax, and for filing a false or fraudulent  return, statement, or other document, see sections 7203, 7206, and 7207.
