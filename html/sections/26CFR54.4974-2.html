                                Sec. 54.4974-2  Excise tax on accumulations in qualified retirement
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Q-1. Is any tax imposed on a payee under any qualified retirement  plan or any eligible deferred compensation plan (as defined in section  457(b)) to whom an amount is required to be distributed for a taxable  year if the amount distributed during the taxable year is less than the  required minimum distribution?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. Yes, if the amount distributed to a payee under any qualified  retirement plan or any eligible deferred compensation plan (as defined  in section 457(b)) for a calendar year is less than the required minimum  distribution for such year, an excise tax is imposed on such payee under  section 4974 for the taxable year beginning with or within the calendar  year during which the amount is required to be distributed. The tax is  equal to 50 percent of the amount by which such required minimum  distribution exceeds the actual amount distributed during the calendar  year. Section 4974 provides that this tax shall be paid by the payee.  For purposes of section 4974, the term required minimum distribution  means the minimum distribution amount required to be distributed  pursuant to section 401(a)(9), 403(b)(10), 408(a)(6), 408(b)(3), or  457(d)(2), as the case may be, and the regulations thereunder. Except as  otherwise provided in A-6 of this section, the required minimum  distribution for a calendar year is the required minimum distribution  amount required to be distributed during the calendar year. A-6 of this  section provides a special rule for amounts required to be distributed  by an employee's (or individual's) required beginning date.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. For purposes of section 4974, what is a qualified retirement plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. For purposes of section 4974, each of the following is a  qualified retirement plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em>;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An annuity plan described in section 403(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An annuity contract, custodial account, or retirement income  account described in section 403(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An individual retirement account described in section 408(a)  (including a Roth IRA described in section 408A);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b)  (including a Roth IRA described in section 408A); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Any other plan, contract, account, or annuity that, at any time,  has been treated as a plan, account, or annuity described in paragraphs  (a) through (e) of this A-2, whether or not such plan, contract,  account, or annuity currently satisfies the applicable requirements for  such treatment.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. If a payee's interest under a qualified retirement plan is in  the form of an individual account, how is the required minimum  distribution for a given calendar year determined for purposes of  section 4974?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. (a) General rule. If a payee's interest under a qualified  retirement plan is in the form of an individual account and distribution  of such account is not being made under an annuity contract purchased in  accordance with A-4 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6, the amount of the required  minimum distribution for any calendar year for purposes of section 4974  is the required minimum distribution amount required to be distributed  for such calendar year in order to satisfy the minimum distribution  requirements in Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5 as provided in the following  (whichever is applicable)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Section 401(a)(9) and Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-1 through  1.401(a)(9)-5 and 1.401(a)(9)-7 through 1.401(a)(9)-9 in the case of a  plan described in section 401(a) which includes a trust exempt under  section 501(a) or an annuity plan described in section 403(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 403(b)(10) and Sec. 1.403(b)-6(e) (in the case of an  annuity contract, custodial account, or retirement income account  described in section 403(b));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> and Sec. 1.408-8 (in the case of an  individual retirement account or annuity described in section 408(a) or  (b)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Section 457(d) in the case of an eligible deferred compensation  plan (as defined in section 457(b)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Default provisions. Unless otherwise provided under the  qualified retirement plan (or, if applicable, the governing instrument  of the qualified retirement plan), the default provisions in A-4(a) of  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 apply in determining the required minimum  distribution for purposes of section 4974.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Five-year rule. If the 5-year rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii)  applies to the distribution to a payee, no amount is required to be  distributed for any calendar year to satisfy the applicable enumerated  section in paragraph (a) of this A-3 until the calendar year which  contains the date 5 years after the date of the employee's death. For  the calendar year which contains the date 5 years after the employee's  death, the required minimum distribution amount required to be  distributed to satisfy the applicable enumerated section is the payee's  entire remaining interest in the qualified retirement plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. If a payee's interest in a qualified retirement plan is being  distributed in the form of an annuity, how is the amount of the required  minimum distribution determined for purposes of section 4974?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. If a payee's interest in a qualified retirement plan is being  distributed in the form of an annuity (either directly from the plan, in  the case of a defined benefit plan, or under an annuity contract  purchased from an insurance company), the amount of the required minimum  distribution for purposes of section 4974 will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of A-2 of this section for every calendar  year. If the annuity contract (or, in the case of annuity distributions  from a defined benefit plan, a distribution option) under which  distributions to the payee are being made is a permissible annuity  distribution option, the required minimum distribution for a given  calendar year will equal the amount which the annuity contract (or  distribution option) provides is to be distributed for that calendar  year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Impermissible annuity distribution option. An impermissible  annuity distribution option is an annuity contract (or, in the case of  annuity distributions from a defined benefit plan, a distribution  option) under which distributions to the payee are being made that  specifically provides for distributions which, if made as provided,  would for any calendar year be less than the minimum distribution amount  required to be distributed to satisfy the applicable section enumerated  in paragraph (a) of   A-3 of this section. If the annuity contract (or, in the case of annuity  distributions from a defined benefit plan, the distribution option)  under which distributions to the payee are being made is an  impermissible annuity distribution option, the required minimum  distribution for each calendar year will be determined as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If the qualified retirement plan under which distributions are  being made is a defined benefit plan, the minimum distribution amount  required to be distributed each year will be the amount which would have  been distributed under the plan if the distribution option under which  distributions to the payee were being made was the following permissible  annuity distribution option:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of distributions commencing before the death of the  employee, if there is a designated beneficiary under the impermissible  annuity distribution option for purposes of section 401(a)(9), the  permissible annuity distribution option is the joint and survivor  annuity option under the plan for the lives of the employee and the  designated beneficiary that provides for the greatest level amount  payable to the employee determined on an annual basis. If the plan does  not provide such an option or there is no designated beneficiary under  the impermissible distribution option for purposes of section 401(a)(9),  the permissible annuity distribution option is the life annuity option  under the plan payable for the life of the employee in level amounts  with no survivor benefit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> applies. See paragraph (b)(3) of this A-4. The  determination of whether or not there is a designated beneficiary and  the determination of which designated beneficiary's life is to be used  in the case of multiple beneficiaries will be made in accordance with  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-4 and A-7 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5. If the defined  benefit plan does not provide for distribution in the form of the  applicable permissible distribution option, the required minimum  distribution for each calendar year will be an amount as determined by  the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this A-4 purchased with the employee's or  individual's account used to purchase the annuity contract that is the  impermissible annuity distribution option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In the case of distributions commencing before the death of the  employee, if there is a designated beneficiary under the impermissible  annuity distribution option for purposes of section 401(a)(9), the  annuity is a joint and survivor annuity for the lives of the employee  and the designated beneficiary which provides level annual payments and  which would have been a permissible annuity distribution option.  However, the amount of the periodic payment which would have been  payable to the survivor will be the applicable percentage under the  table in A-2(c) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-6 of the amount of the periodic  payment which would have been payable to the employee or individual. If  there is no designated beneficiary under the impermissible distribution  option for purposes of section 401(a)(9), the annuity is a life annuity  for the life of the employee with no survivor benefit which provides  level annual payments and which would   have been a permissible annuity distribution option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em>  applies. See paragraph (b)(3) of this A-4. The amount of the payments  under the annuity contract will be determined using the interest rate  and actuarial tables prescribed under section 7520 determined using the  date determined under A-3 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 when distributions are  required to commence and using the age of the beneficiary as of the  beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains that date. The  determination of whether or not there is a designated beneficiary and  the determination of which designated beneficiary's life is to be used  in the case of multiple beneficiaries will be made in accordance with  Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-4 and A-7 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-5.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the 5-year rule in section 401(a)(9)(B)(ii) applies to the  distribution to the payee under the contract (or distribution option),  no amount is required to be distributed to satisfy the applicable  enumerated section in paragraph (a) of this A-4 until the calendar year  which contains the date 5 years after the date of the employee's death.  For the calendar year which contains the date 5 years after the  employee's death, the required minimum distribution amount required to  be distributed to satisfy the applicable enumerated section is the  payee's entire remaining interest in the annuity contract (or under the  plan in the case of distributions from a defined benefit plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If the plan provides that the required beginning date for  purposes of section 401(a)(9) for all employees is April 1 of the  calendar year following the calendar year in which the employee attained  age 70\1/2\ in accordance with paragraph A-2(e) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2,  the required minimum distribution for each calendar year for an employee  who is not a 5-percent owner for purposes of this section will be the  lesser of the amount determined based on the required beginning date as  set forth in A-2(a) of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-2 or the required beginning  date under the plan. Thus, for example, if an employee dies after  attaining age 70\1/2\, but before April 1 of the calendar year following  the calendar year in which the employee retired, and there is no  designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the  employee's year of death, required minimum distributions for calendar  years after the calendar year containing the employee's date of death  may be based on either the applicable distribution period provided under  either the 5-year rule of A-1 of Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 or the employee's  remaining life expectancy as set forth in A-5(c)(3) of Sec.  1.401(a)(9)-5.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5. If there is any remaining benefit with respect to an employee  (or IRA owner) after any calendar year in which the entire remaining  benefit is required to be distributed under section 401(a)(9), what is  the amount of the required minimum distribution for each calendar year  subsequent to such calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-5. If there is any remaining benefit with respect to an employee  (or IRA owner) after the calendar year in which the entire remaining  benefit is required to be distributed, the required minimum distribution  for each calendar year subsequent to such calendar year is the entire  remaining benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6. With respect to which calendar year is the excise tax under  section 4974 imposed in the case in which the amount not distributed is  an amount required to be distributed by April 1 of a calendar year (by  the employee's or individual's required beginning date)?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. In the case in which the amount not paid is an amount required  to be paid by April 1 of a calendar year, such amount is a required  minimum distribution for the previous calendar year, i.e., for the  employee's or the individual's first distribution calendar year.  However, the excise tax under section 4974 is imposed for the calendar  year containing the last day by which the amount is required to be  distributed, i.e., the calendar year containing   the employee's or individual's required beginning date, even though the  preceding calendar year is the calendar year for which the amount is  required to be distributed. There is also a required minimum  distribution for the calendar year which contains the employee's or  individual's required beginning date. Such distribution is also required  to be made during the calendar year which contains the employee's or  individual's required beginning date.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. Are there any circumstances when the excise tax under section  4974 for a taxable year may be waived?</p><p class="depth0">A-7. (a) Reasonable cause. The tax under section 4974(a) may be  waived if the payee described in section 4974(a) establishes to the  satisfaction of the Commissioner the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The shortfall described in section 4974(a) in the amount  distributed in any taxable year was due to reasonable error; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Reasonable steps are being taken to remedy the shortfall.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Automatic waiver. The tax under section 4974 will be  automatically waived, unless the Commissioner determines otherwise, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The payee described in section 4974(a) is an individual who is  the sole beneficiary and whose required minimum distribution amount for  a calendar year is determined under the life expectancy rule described  in Sec. 1.401(a)(9)-3 A-3 in the case of an employee's or individual's  death before the employee's or individual's required beginning date; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employee's or individual's entire benefit to which that  beneficiary is entitled is distributed by the end of the fifth calendar  year following the calendar year that contains the employee's or  individual's date of death.
