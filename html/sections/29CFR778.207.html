                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Overtime premiums are those defined by the statute. The various  types of contract premium rates which provide extra compensation  qualifying as overtime premiums to be excluded from the regular rate  (under section 7(e) (5), (6), and (7) and credited toward statutory  overtime pay requirements (under section 7(h)) have been described in  Sec. Sec. 778.201 through 778.206. The plain wording of the statute  makes it clear that extra compensation provided by   premium rates other than those described cannot be treated as overtime  premiums. Wherever such other premiums are paid, they must be included  in the employee's regular rate before statutory overtime compensation is  computed; no part of such premiums may be credited toward statutory  overtime pay.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Nonovertime premiums. The Act requires the inclusion in the  regular rate of such extra premiums as nightshift differentials (whether  they take the form of a percent of the base rate or an addition of so  many cents per hour) and premiums paid for hazardous, arduous or dirty  work. It also requires inclusion of any extra compensation which is paid  as an incentive for the rapid performance of work, and since any extra  compensation in order to qualify as an overtime premium must be provided  by a premium rate per hour, except in the special case of pieceworkers  as discussed in Sec. 778.418, lump sum premiums which are paid without  regard to the number of hours worked are not overtime premiums and must  be included in the regular rate. For example, where an employer pays 8  hours' pay for a particular job whether it is performed in 8 hours or in  less time, the extra premium of 2 hours' pay received by an employee who  completes the job in 6 hours must be included in his regular rate.  Similarly, where an employer pays for 8 hours at premium rates for a job  performed during the overtime hours whether it is completed in 8 hours  or less, no part of the premium paid qualifies as overtime premium under  sections 7(e) (5), (6), or (7). (For a further discussion of this and  related problems, see Sec. Sec. 778.308 to 778.314.)</p><p class="depth2">Bonuses</p>
