                            <p class="depth0">Modified contractual language shall be required to place resource  extensions under contract. Resource extensions and allocations to new  customers from the initial resource pool will take effect when existing  contracts expire. These dates are December 31, 2000, for the Pick-Sloan  Missouri Basin Program--Eastern Division and September 30, 2004, for the  Loveland Area Projects. For the Pick-Sloan Missouri Basin Program-- Eastern Division, Western will offer contracts to existing customers for  resource extensions no sooner than the effective date of the final  regulations. For the Loveland Area Projects, existing contracts provide  for potential adjustments to marketable resources in 1999. No contracts  will be offered to existing customers for post-2004 Loveland Area  Projects   resources until the analysis of potential resource adjustments in 1999  has been completed and any adjustments are implemented. Existing power  sales contracts require that this analysis be completed by 1996.</p>
