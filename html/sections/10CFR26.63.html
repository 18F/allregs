                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to grant authorization, licensees and other entities  shall ensure that a suitable inquiry has been conducted, on a best  effort basis, to verify the individual's self-disclosed information and  determine whether any potentially disqualifying FFD information is  available, except if all of the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The individual previously held authorization under this part;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The licensee or other entity has verified that the individual's  last period of authorization was terminated favorably; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The individual has been subject to a behavioral observation  program that includes arrest reporting, which meets the requirements of  this part, throughout the period of interruption.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> To meet the suitable inquiry requirement, licensees and other  entities may rely on the information that other licensees and entities  who are subject to this subpart have gathered for previous periods of  authorization. Licensees and other entities may also rely on those  licensees' and entities' determinations of fitness that were conducted  under Sec. 26.189, as well as their reviews and resolutions of  potentially disqualifying FFD information, for previous periods of  authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The licensee or other entity shall ensure that the suitable  inquiry has been conducted, on a best effort basis, by questioning  former employers, and the employer by whom the individual claims to have  been employed on the day before he or she completes the employment  history, if an employment history is required under Sec. 26.61.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For the claimed employment period, the suitable inquiry must  ascertain the reason for termination, eligibility for rehire, and other  information that could reflect on the individual's fitness to be granted  authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the claimed employment was military service, the licensee or  other entity who is conducting the suitable inquiry shall request a  characterization of service, reason for separation, and any disciplinary  actions related to potentially disqualifying FFD information. If the  individual's last duty station cannot provide this information, the  licensee or other entity may accept a hand-carried copy of the DD 214  presented by the individual which on face value appears to be  legitimate. The licensee or other entity may also accept a copy of a DD  214 provided by the custodian of military records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a company, previous employer, or educational institution to  whom the licensee or other entity has directed a request for information  refuses to provide information or indicates an inability or  unwillingness to provide information within 3 business days of the  request, the licensee or other entity shall document this refusal,  inability, or unwillingness in the licensee's or other entity's record  of the investigation, and obtain a confirmation of employment or  educational enrollment and attendance from at least one alternate  source, with suitable inquiry questions answered to the best of the  alternate source's ability. This alternate source may not have been  previously used by the licensee or other entity to obtain information  about the individual's character. If the licensee or other entity uses  an alternate source because employer information is not forthcoming  within 3 business days of the request, the licensee or other entity need  not delay granting authorization to wait for any employer response, but  shall evaluate and document the response if it is received.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>  is legitimately seeking the information required for an authorization  decision under this subpart and has obtained a signed release from the  subject individual authorizing the disclosure of information, any  licensee or other entity who is subject to this part shall disclose  whether the subject individual's authorization was denied or terminated  unfavorably as a   result of a violation of an FFD policy and shall make available the  information on which the denial or unfavorable termination of  authorization was based, including, but not limited to, drug or alcohol  test results, treatment and followup testing requirements or other  results from a determination of fitness, and any other information that  is relevant to an authorization decision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In conducting a suitable inquiry, a licensee or other entity may  obtain information and documents by electronic means, including, but not  limited to, telephone, facsimile, or e-mail. The licensee or other  entity shall make a record of the contents of the telephone call and  shall retain that record, and any documents or electronic files obtained  electronically, under Sec. Sec. 26.711 and 26.713(a), (b), and (c), as  applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> For individuals about whom no potentially disqualifying FFD  information is known (or about whom potentially disqualifying FFD  information is known, but it has been resolved by a licensee or other  entity who is subject to this subpart) at the time at which the suitable  inquiry is initiated, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that a  suitable inquiry has been conducted as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Initial authorization. The period of the suitable inquiry must  be the past 3 years or since the individual's eighteenth birthday,  whichever is shorter. For the 1-year period immediately preceding the  date on which the individual applies for authorization, the licensee or  other entity shall ensure that the suitable inquiry has been conducted  with every employer, regardless of the length of employment. For the  remaining 2-year period, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that  the suitable inquiry has been conducted with the employer by whom the  individual claims to have been employed the longest within each calendar  month, if the individual claims employment during the given calendar  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Authorization update. The period of the suitable inquiry must be  the period since authorization was terminated. For the 1-year period  immediately preceding the date on which the individual applies for  authorization, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that the  suitable inquiry has been conducted with every employer, regardless of  the length of employment. For the remaining period since authorization  was terminated, the licensee or other entity shall ensure that the  suitable inquiry has been conducted with the employer by whom the  individual claims to have been employed the longest within each calendar  month, if the individual claims employment during the given calendar  month.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Authorization reinstatement after an interruption of more than  30 days. The period of the suitable inquiry must be the period since  authorization was terminated. The licensee or other entity shall ensure  that the suitable inquiry has been conducted with the employer by whom  the individual claims to have been employed the longest within the  calendar month, if the individual claims employment during the given  calendar month.</p>
