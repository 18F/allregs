A transmittal advice for this purpose will accompany the notice of call.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> For purchase. Debentures, the purchase of which has been authorized prior to call or maturity, may be assigned as instructed in paragraph (a) of this section and immediately submitted in accordance with procedures prescribed by HUD for this purpose.
