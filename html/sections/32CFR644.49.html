All negotiations for proposals will be conducted on an individual basis, with adequately qualified appraisal firms, corporations or individuals competent to deliver the required appraisal reports on schedule.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In view of the technical nature of appraisals, Division and District Engineers shall give consideration to designating qualified member(s) of their real estate staffs as contracting officer's representative(s) with full responsibility for all cost estimates involved in contracting for appraisal services and reports. Such contracting officer's representative(s) may also, in the designation of the contracting officer, be utilized to conduct negotiations with the prospective contractors, serve as ordering officer pursuant to the contracts, certify invoices and act in any other capacity within their authority as contracting officer's representative(s).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A copy of the narrative, detailed record of contract negotiations will be forwarded to DAEN-REE, along with the contract as specified above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> In contracting for appraisal reports, contract forms as set forth in Armed Services Procurement Regulations (ASPR) (chapter I of this title) and ER 1180-1-1 (Engineer Contract Instructions) will be used.

Authorized local representatives of the Department of Justice will be consulted concerning the acceptability of the appraiser(s) prior to negotiating any appraisal contract covering tracts proposed for acquisition. The local representative must also approve the per diem fee to be utilized in the appraisal contract. Where agreement cannot be reached between the Division or District Engineer and the local representative of the Department of Justice as to the selection of the appraiser(s), a complete report will be submitted to DAEN-REE, for resolution with the Attorney General.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Interdepartmental services.
