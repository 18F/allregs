Highways must not only blend with our natural social, and cultural environment, but also provide pleasure and satisfaction in their use.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The FHWA will cooperate with State and local agencies and organizations to provide opportunities for the display of original works of art within the highway rights-of-way.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The development of the roadside to include landscape development, safety rest areas, and the preservation of valuable adjacent scenic lands is a necessary component of highway development. Planning and development of the roadside should be concurrent with or closely follow that of the highway. Further, the development of travel information centers and systems is encouraged as an effective method of providing necessary information to the traveling public.</p>
