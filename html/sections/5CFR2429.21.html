                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> How to compute the due date for filing documents with the FLRA. In computing the due date for filing any document with the FLRA under this subchapter, follow these rules:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General rules. Except in the situations discussed in paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, follow these steps in order to determine the date on which you must file any document with the FLRA.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Step 1: Determine the act, event, or default (``the triggering event'') that you are filing in response to. The act, event, or default constitutes the triggering event even if it falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Step 2: Determine the number of days that you have to file (``the filing period'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Step 3: Determine the first day of the filing period. This is the day after, not the day of, the triggering event, and constitutes the first day of the filing period even if it is a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Step 4: Starting with the first day of the filing period, count calendar days--including Saturdays, Sundays, and federal legal holidays--until you reach the last day of the filing period (``the last day'').</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Step 5: Ask: Does the last day fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday? If no, then your filing is due on that day (unless you are entitled to an additional 5 days under Sec. 2429.22). If

yes, then find the next day on the calendar that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday. Your filing is due on that day (unless you are entitled to an additional 5 days under Sec. 2429.22), even if you are filing electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at www.flra.gov (although, as discussed in paragraph (b)(1)(v) of this section, you are permitted to file electronically on Saturdays, Sundays, or federal legal holidays). See Sec. 2429.22 for rules regarding how to calculate your due date if you are entitled to an additional 5 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Agreement-bar exception. If you are filing a petition in an agreement-bar situation under 5 CFR 2422.12(c), (d), (e), and (f), then, as discussed further in those regulations, you must file a petition no later than 60 days before the expiration date of the existing collective-bargaining agreement (``the 60-day date''). The first day (``day one'') of the period is the day before, not the day on which, the collective-bargaining agreement expires. Start with day one, and count back on the calendar from that day, including Saturdays, Sundays, and federal legal holidays. If the 60th day falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday, then you must file your petition by the close of business on the last official workday that comes before, not after, that Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Exception for filing periods that are 7 days or less. If your filing period is 7 days or less, then determine the act, event, or default that you are filing in response to (``the triggering event''). Find the first day after the triggering event that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday. Start counting the 7-day period on (and including) that day, but exclude any Saturdays, Sundays, or federal legal holidays. The 7th day is the due date for filing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> How the FLRA determines the date on which documents have been filed. The FLRA applies the following rules in determining the date on which a party has filed documents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>General rules. Except in the situations discussed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, the FLRA looks to the method by which documents have been filed in order to determine the date on which those documents have been filed. Specifically:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Documents filed with the FLRA by first-class mail. If the mailing contains a legible postmark date, then that date is the date of filing. If the mailing does not contain a legible postmark date, then the FLRA presumes that it was filed 5 days prior to the date on which the appropriate FLRA component, officer, or agent receives it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Documents filed with the FLRA by facsimile (``fax''). If the date of transmission on a fax is clear, then that date is the filing date. If the date of transmission on a fax is not clear, then the date of filing is the date on which the appropriate FLRA component, officer, or agent receives the fax.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Documents filed with the FLRA by personal delivery. The date of filing is the date on which the appropriate FLRA component, officer, or agent receives the filing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Documents filed with the FLRA by deposit with a commercial-delivery service that provides a record showing the date of deposit. The date of filing is the date of deposit with the commercial-delivery service.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Documents filed electronically through use of the eFiling system on the FLRA's Web site at www.flra.gov. The date of filing is the calendar day (including Saturdays, Sundays, and federal legal holidays) on which the document is transmitted in the eFiling system. Although documents that are filed electronically may be filed on Saturdays, Sundays, and federal legal holidays, they are not required to be filed on such days, as discussed in paragraph (a)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions. The rules in paragraph (b)(1) of this section do not apply to filing an unfair labor practice charge under 5 CFR part 2423, a representation petition under 5 CFR part 2422, and a request for an extension of time under Sec. 2429.23(a). See those provisions for more information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Compliance with Sec. 2429.24. All documents filed or required to be filed with the Authority must be filed in accordance with the rules set out in Sec. 2429.24.
