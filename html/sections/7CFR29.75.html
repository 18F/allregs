The blocking and numbering arrangement shall follow the order of sale; that is, down one row and back on the adjacent row.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each warehouse shall display a plainly visible sign with the total number of baskets of flue-cured tobacco allotted to be sold each day. Each warehouse operator shall designate to the inspector the number of the starting space for each day's sale and grading will begin at this designated space. All spaces, whether empty or full, shall be counted. No tobacco will be graded beyond the numbered space corresponding with the number of baskets allotted for each day's sale.

Lots of tobacco shall not be removed, added, rearranged, or substituted between the time they are counted for the day's sale and the time they are graded for the day's sale, provided, however, that with prior approval of the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor compensating lots of tobacco may be substituted for empty spaces and covered lots included in a daily sales count.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Each operator of a warehouse at which baled burley tobacco is offered for sale shall open the particular bale, in a lot of tobacco, chosen by a grader for inspection and reseal that bale after inspection.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each seller, by offering burley tobacco for sale, certifies that the lot inspected by a grader is representative of the grade of all the tobacco in that lot, that the leaf was stalk-cured, that the bales do not contain any foreign matter or material, and are not nested.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Before starting inspection of the day's sale of burley tobacco in each warehouse, the Set Work Leader or Circuit Supervisor shall determine if there is compliance with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.
