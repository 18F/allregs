The termination of collection activity does not preclude the Secretary from retaining a record of the account for purposes of:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Selling the debt, if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that such sale is in the best interest of the United States;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Pursuing collection at a subsequent date in the event there is a change in the debtor's status or a new collection tool becomes available;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Offsetting against future income or assets not available at the time of termination of collection activity; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Screening future applicants for prior indebtedness.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Generally, the Secretary shall terminate collection activity on a debt that has been discharged in bankruptcy, regardless of the amount. The Secretary may continue collection activity, however, subject to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, for any payments provided under a plan of reorganization. Offset and recoupment rights may survive the discharge of the debtor in bankruptcy and, under some

circumstances, claims also may survive the discharge. For example, when the Department is a known creditor of a debtor the claims of the Department may survive a discharge if the Department did not receive formal notice of the bankruptcy proceedings. When the Department believes that it has claims or offsets that may have survived the discharge of the debtor, the Office of the General Counsel should be contacted for legal advice.</p>
