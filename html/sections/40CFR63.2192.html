                            <p class="depth0">Terms used in this subpart are defined in the Clean Air Act, in 40 CFR 63.2, the General Provisions of this part, and in this section as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Batch means a single fermentation cycle in a single fermentation vessel (fermenter).</p><p class="depth0">Batch monitoring period means the period that begins at the later of either the start of aeration or the addition of yeast to the fermenter; the period ends at the earlier of either the end of aeration or the point at which the yeast has begun being emptied from the fermenter.</p><p class="depth0">Brew means the mixture of yeast and additives in the fermenter.</p><p class="depth0">Brew ethanol means the ethanol in fermenter liquid.</p><p class="depth0">Brew ethanol monitor means the monitoring system that you use to measure brew ethanol to demonstrate compliance with this subpart. The monitoring system includes a resistance element used as an ethanol sensor, with the measured resistance proportional to the concentration of ethanol in the brew.</p><p class="depth0">Brew-to-exhaust correlation means the correlation between the concentration of ethanol in the brew and the concentration of VOC in the fermenter exhaust. This correlation is specific to each fed-batch fermentation stage and is established while manufacturing the product that comprises the largest percentage (by mass) of average annual production.</p><p class="depth0">Emission limitation means any emission limit or operating limit.</p><p class="depth0">Fed-batch means the yeast is fed carbohydrates and additives during fermentation in the vessel. In contrast, carbohydrates and additives are added to ``set-batch'' fermenters only at the start of the batch.</p><p class="depth0">1-hour period means any 60-minute period commencing on the minute at which the batch monitoring period begins.</p><p class="depth0">Product means the yeast resulting from the final stage in a production run. Products are distinguished by yeast species, strain, and variety.</p><p class="depth0">Responsible official means responsible official as defined in 40 CFR 70.2.</p><p class="depth0">Specialty yeast includes but is not limited to yeast produced for use in wine, champagne, whiskey, and beer.</p><p class="depth0">Within-concentration batch means a batch for which the average VOC concentration is not higher than the maximum concentration that is allowed as part of the applicable emission limitation.</p><p class="depth0">Sec.
