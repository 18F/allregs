                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Assignments/Transfers. NCE stations awarded by use of the point system in Sec.  73.7003 shall be subject to a holding period. From the grant of the construction permit and continuing until the facility has achieved four years of on-air operations, an applicant proposing to assign or transfer the construction permit/license to another party will be required to demonstrate the following two factors: that the proposed buyer would qualify for the same

number of or greater points as the assignor or transferor originally received; and that consideration received and/or promised does not exceed the assignor's or transferor's legitimate and prudent expenses. For purposes of this section, legitimate and prudent expenses are those expenses reasonably incurred by the assignor or transferor in obtaining and constructing the station (e.g. expenses in preparing an application, in obtaining and installing broadcast equipment to be assigned or transferred, etc.). Costs incurred in operating the station are not recoverable (e.g., rent, salaries, utilities, music licensing fees, etc.). Any successive applicants proposing to assign or transfer the construction permit/license prior to the end of the aforementioned holding period will be required to make the same demonstrations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Technical. In accordance with the provisions of Sec.  73.7002, an NCE applicant receiving a decisive preference for fair distribution of service is required to construct and operate technical facilities substantially as proposed, and can not downgrade service to the area on which the preference is based for a period of four years of on-air operations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The holding period in this section does not apply to construction permits that are awarded on a non-comparative basis, such as those awarded to non-mutually exclusive applicants or through settlement.</p>
