                            <p class="depth0">An apprenticeship program, to be eligible for approval and  registration by a Registration Agency, must conform to the following  standards:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The program must have an organized, written plan (program  standards) embodying the terms and conditions of employment, training,  and supervision of one or more apprentices in an apprenticeable  occupation, as defined in this part, and subscribed to by a sponsor who  has undertaken to carry out the apprentice training program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The program standards must contain provisions that address:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employment and training of the apprentice in a skilled  occupation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term of apprenticeship, which for an individual apprentice  may be measured either through the completion of the industry standard  for on-the-job learning (at least 2,000 hours) (time-based approach),  the attainment of competency (competency-based approach), or a blend of  the time-based and competency-based approaches (hybrid approach).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The time-based approach measures skill acquisition through the  individual apprentice's completion of at least 2,000 hours of on-the-job  learning as described in a work process schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The competency-based approach measures skill acquisition  through the individual apprentice's successful demonstration of acquired  skills and knowledge, as verified by the program sponsor. Programs  utilizing this approach must still require apprentices to complete an  on-the-job learning component of Registered Apprenticeship. The program  standards must address how on-the-job learning will be integrated into  the program, describe competencies, and identify an appropriate means of  testing and evaluation for such competencies.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The hybrid approach measures the individual apprentice's skill  acquisition through a combination of specified minimum number of hours  of on-the-job learning and the successful demonstration of competency as  described in a work process schedule.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The determination of the appropriate approach for the program  standards is made by the program sponsor, subject to approval by the  Registration Agency of the determination as appropriate to the  apprenticeable occupation for which the program standards are  registered.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An outline of the work processes in which the apprentice will  receive supervised work experience and training on the job, and the  allocation of the approximate amount of time to be spent in each major  process.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Provision for organized, related instruction in technical  subjects related to the occupation. A minimum of 144 hours for each year  of apprenticeship is recommended. This instruction in technical subjects  may be accomplished through media such as classroom, occupational or  industry courses, electronic media, or other instruction approved by the  Registration Agency. Every apprenticeship instructor must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Meet the State Department of Education's requirements for a  vocational-technical instructor in the State   of registration, or be a subject matter expert, which is an individual,  such as a journeyworker, who is recognized within an industry as having  expertise in a specific occupation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Have training in teaching techniques and adult learning styles,  which may occur before or after the apprenticeship instructor has  started to provide the related technical instruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A progressively increasing schedule of wages to be paid to the  apprentice consistent with the skill acquired. The entry wage must not  be less than the minimum wage prescribed by the Fair Labor Standards  Act, where applicable, unless a higher wage is required by other  applicable Federal law, State law, respective regulations, or by  collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Periodic review and evaluation of the apprentice's performance  on the job and in related instruction; and the maintenance of  appropriate progress records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> A numeric ratio of apprentices to journeyworkers consistent with  proper supervision, training, safety, and continuity of employment, and  applicable provisions in collective bargaining agreements, except where  such ratios are expressly prohibited by the collective bargaining  agreements. The ratio language must be specific and clearly described as  to its application to the job site, workforce, department or plant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> A probationary period reasonable in relation to the full  apprenticeship term, with full credit given for such period toward  completion of apprenticeship. The probationary period cannot exceed 25  percent of the length of the program, or 1 year, whichever is shorter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Adequate and safe equipment and facilities for training and  supervision, and safety training for apprentices on the job and in  related instruction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The minimum qualifications required by a sponsor for persons  entering the apprenticeship program, with an eligible starting age not  less than 16 years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> The placement of an apprentice under a written Apprenticeship  Agreement that meets the requirements of Sec. 29.7 or the State  apprenticeship law of a recognized Registration Agency. The agreement  must directly, or by reference, incorporate the standards of the program  as part of the agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> The granting of advanced standing or credit for demonstrated  competency, acquired experience, training, or skills for all applicants  equally, with commensurate wages for any progression step so granted.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> The transfer of an apprentice between apprenticeship programs  and within an apprenticeship program must be based on agreement between  the apprentice and the affected apprenticeship committees or program  sponsors, and must comply with the following requirements:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The transferring apprentice must be provided a transcript of  related instruction and on-the-job learning by the committee or program  sponsor;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Transfer must be to the same occupation; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A new apprenticeship agreement must be executed when the  transfer occurs between program sponsors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Assurance of qualified training personnel and adequate  supervision on the job.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Recognition for successful completion of apprenticeship  evidenced by an appropriate certificate issued by the Registration  Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Program standards that utilize the competency-based or hybrid  approach for progression through an apprenticeship and that choose to  issue interim credentials must clearly identify the interim credentials,  demonstrate how these credentials link to the components of the  apprenticeable occupation, and establish the process for assessing an  individual apprentice's demonstration of competency associated with the  particular interim credential. Further, interim credentials must only be  issued for recognized components of an apprenticeable occupation,  thereby linking interim credentials specifically to the knowledge,  skills, and abilities associated with those components of the  apprenticeable occupation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Identification of the Registration Agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Provision for the registration, cancellation and deregistration  of the   program; and for the prompt submission of any program standard  modification or amendment to the Registration Agency for approval.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Provision for registration of apprenticeship agreements,  modifications, and amendments; notice to the Registration Agency of  persons who have successfully completed apprenticeship programs; and  notice of transfers, suspensions, and cancellations of apprenticeship  agreements and a statement of the reasons therefore.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Authority for the cancellation of an apprenticeship agreement  during the probationary period by either party without stated cause;  cancellation during the probationary period will not have an adverse  impact on the sponsor's completion rate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Compliance with 29 CFR part 30, including the equal opportunity  pledge prescribed in 29 CFR 30.3(b); an affirmative action plan  complying with 29 CFR 30.4; and a method for the selection of  apprentices authorized by 29 CFR 30.5, or compliance with parallel  requirements contained in a State plan for equal opportunity in  apprenticeship adopted under 29 CFR part 30 and approved by the  Department. The apprenticeship standards must also include a statement  that the program will be conducted, operated and administered in  conformity with applicable provisions of 29 CFR part 30, as amended, or,  if applicable, an approved State plan for equal opportunity in  apprenticeship.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(22)</em> Contact information (name, address, telephone number, and e- mail address if appropriate) for the appropriate individual with  authority under the program to receive, process and make disposition of  complaints.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(23)</em> Recording and maintenance of all records concerning  apprenticeship as may be required by the Office of Apprenticeship or  recognized State Apprenticeship Agency and other applicable law.</p>
