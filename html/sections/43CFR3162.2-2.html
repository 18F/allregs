Alternatively, we may accept other equivalent protective  measures;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the mineral resources being drained are either unleased  (including those which may not be subject to leasing) or in Federal or  Indian leases, we may execute agreements with the owners of interests in  the producing well under which the United States or the Indian lessor  may be compensated for the drainage (with the consent of the Federal or  (in consultation with the Indian mineral owner and BIA) Indian lessees,  if any);</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> We may offer for lease any qualifying unleased mineral resources  under part 3120 of this chapter or enter into a communitization  agreement; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> We may approve a unit or communitization agreement that provides  for payment of a royalty on production attributable to unleased mineral  resources as provided in Sec. 3181.5.
