Effective October 1, 1985, the Office shall compute incentive payments for States for a fiscal year in recognition of title IV-A collections and of non-title IV-A collections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A portion of a State's incentive payment shall be computed as a percentage of the State's title IV-A collections, and a portion of the incentive payment shall be computed as a percentage of its non-title IV-A collections. The percentages are determined separately for title IV-A and non-title IV-A portions of the incentive. The percentages are based on the ratio of the State's title IV-A collections to the State's total administrative costs and the State's non-title IV-A collections to the State's total administrative costs in accordance with the following schedule:

services in another State shall be treated as having been collected in full by each State;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Fees paid by individuals, recovered costs, and program income such as interest earned on collections shall be deducted from total IV-D administrative costs;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> At the option of the State, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity may be excluded from total IV-D administrative costs; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effective January 1, 1990, amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project under section 455(e) of the Act shall not be included in the State's total IV-D administrative costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Costs of demonstration projects for evaluating model procedures for reviewing child support awards under section 103(e) of Public Law 100-485 shall not be included in the State's total IV-D administrative costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Payment of incentives. (1) The Office will estimate the total incentive payment that each State will receive for the upcoming fiscal year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Each State will include one-quarter of the estimated total payment in its quarterly collection report which will reduce the amount that would otherwise be paid to the Federal government to reimburse its share of assistance payments under Sec. Sec. 302.51 and 302.52 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Following the end of a fiscal year, the Office will calculate the actual incentive payment the State should have received based on the reports submitted for that fiscal year. If adjustments to the estimate made under paragraph (c)(1) of this section are necessary, the State's IV-A grant award will be reduced or increased because of over- or under-estimates for prior quarters and for other adjustments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For FY 1985, the Office will calculate a State's incentive payment based on title IV-A collections retained by the State and paid to the family under Sec. 302.51(b)(1) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> For FY 1986 and 1987, a State will receive the higher of the amount due it under the incentive system and Federal matching rate in effect as of FY 1986 or 80 percent of what it would have received under the incentive system and Federal matching rate in effect during FY 1985.
