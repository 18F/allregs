                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. To carry out such scientific, compliance monitoring,  and other functions as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the  purposes of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director (see table 2 to  Sec. 600.502) may assign U.S. observers to FFV's. Except as provided for  in section 201(h)(2) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, no FFV may conduct  fishing operations within the EEZ unless a U.S. observer is aboard.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Effort plan. To ensure the availability of an observer as  required by this section, the owners and operators of FFV's wanting to  fish within the EEZ will submit to the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director and also to the Chief,  Financial Services Division, NMFS, 1315 East West Highway, Silver  Spring, MD 20910 a schedule of fishing effort 30 days prior to the  beginning of each quarter. A quarter is a time period of 3 consecutive  months beginning   January 1, April 1, July 1, and October 1 of each year. The schedule  will contain the name and IRCS of each FFV intending to fish within the  EEZ during the upcoming quarter, and each FFV's expected date of arrival  and expected date of departure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and Research  Director must be notified immediately of any substitution of vessels or  any cancellation of plans to fish in the EEZ for FFV's listed in the  effort plan required by this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> is not given, the FFV may not engage  in fishing until an observer is available and has been placed aboard the  vessel or the requirement has been waived by the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Assistance to observers. To assist the observer in the  accomplishment of his or her assigned duties, the owner and operator of  an FFV to which an observer is assigned must--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide, at no cost to the observer or the United States,  accommodations for the observer aboard the FFV that are equivalent to  those provided to the officers of that vessel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Cause the FFV to proceed to such places and at such times as may  be designated by the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and  Research Director for the purpose of embarking and debarking the  observer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Allow the observer to use the FFV's communications equipment and  personnel upon demand for the transmission and receipt of messages.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Allow the observer access to and use of the FFV's navigation  equipment and personnel upon demand to determine the vessel's position.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Allow the observer free and unobstructed access to the FFV's  bridge, trawl, or working decks, holding bins, processing areas, freezer  spaces, weight scales, cargo holds and any other space that may be used  to hold, process, weigh, or store fish or fish products at any time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Allow the observer to inspect and copy the FFV's daily log,  communications log, transfer log, and any other log, document, notice,  or record required by these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide the observer copies of any records required by these  regulations upon demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Notify the observer at least 15 minutes before fish are brought  on board or fish or fish products are transferred from the FFV to allow  sampling the catch or observing the transfer, unless the observer  specifically requests not to be notified.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Provide all other reasonable assistance to enable the observer  to carry out his or her duties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Health and safety standards. All foreign fishing vessels to  which an observer is deployed must maintain, at all times that the  vessel is in the EEZ, the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> At least one working radar.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Functioning navigation lights as required by international law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A watch on the bridge by appropriately trained and experienced  personnel while the vessel is underway.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Lifeboats and/or inflatable life rafts with a total carrying  capacity equal to or greater than the number of people aboard the  vessel. Lifeboats and inflatable life rafts must be maintained in good  working order and be readily available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Life jackets equal or greater in number to the total number of  persons aboard the vessel. Life jackets must be stowed in readily  accessible and plainly marked positions throughout the vessel, and  maintained in a state of good repair.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> At least one ring life buoy for each 25 ft (7.6 m) of vessel  length, equipped with automatic water lights. Ring life buoys must have  an outside diameter of not more than 32 inches (81.3 cm) nor less than  30 inches (76.2 cm), and must be maintained in a state of good repair.  Ring life buoys must be readily available, but not positioned so they  pose a threat of entanglement in work areas. They must be secured in  such a way that they can be easily cast loose in the event of an  emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> At least one VHF-FM radio with a functioning channel 16 (156.8  mHz), International Distress, Safety and Calling Frequency, and one  functioning AM radio (SSB-Single Side Band) capable of operating at 2182  kHz (SSB). Radios will be maintained in a radio room, chartroom, or  other suitable location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> At least one Emergency Position Indicating Radio Beacon (EPIRB),  approved by the USCG for offshore commercial use, stowed in a location  so as to make it readily available in the event of an emergency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> At least six hand-held, rocket-propelled, parachute, red-flare  distress signals, and three orange-smoke distress signals stowed in the  pilothouse or navigation bridge in portable watertight containers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> All lights, shapes, whistles, foghorns, fog bells and gongs  required by and maintained in accordance with the International  Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Clean and sanitary conditions in all living spaces, food  service and preparation areas and work spaces aboard the vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Observer transfers. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The operator of the FFV must ensure that  transfers of observers at sea via small boat or raft are carried out  during daylight hours as weather and sea conditions allow, and with the  agreement of the observer involved.

In the event funds are not available  from Congressional appropriations of fees collected to assign an  observer to a foreign fishing vessel, the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director will assign a  supplementary observer to that vessel. The costs of supplementary  observers will be paid for by the owners and operators of foreign  fishing vessels as provided for in paragraph (h) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Supplementary observer authority and duties. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A supplementary  observer aboard a foreign fishing vessel has the same authority and must  be treated in all respects as an observer who is employed by NMFS,  either directly or under contract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The duties of supplementary observers and their deployment and  work schedules will be specified by the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All data collected by supplementary observers will be under the  exclusive control of the Assistant Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Supplementary observer payment--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Method of payment. The  owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels must pay directly to the  contractor the costs of supplementary observer coverage. Payment must be  made to the contractor supplying supplementary observer coverage either  by letter of credit or certified check drawn on a federally chartered  bank in U.S. dollars, or other financial institution acceptable to the  contractor. The letter of credit used to pay supplementary observer fees  to contractors must be separate and distinct from the letter of credit  required by Sec. 600.518(b)(2). Billing schedules will be specified by  the terms of the contract between NOAA and the contractors. Billings for  supplementary observer coverage will be approved by the appropriate  Regional Administrator or Science and Research Director and then  transmitted to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels by  the appropriate designated representative. Each country will have only  one designated representative to receive observer bills for all vessels  of that country, except as provided for by the Assistant Administrator.  All bills must be paid within 10 working days of the billing date.  Failure to pay an observer bill will constitute grounds to revoke  fishing permits. All fees collected under this section will be  considered interim in nature and subject to reconciliation at the end of  the fiscal year in accordance with paragraph (h)(4) of this section and  Sec. 600.518(d).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Contractor costs. The costs charged for supplementary observer  coverage to the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels may not  exceed the costs charged to NMFS for the same or similar services,  except that contractors may charge to the owners and operators of  foreign fishing vessels an additional fee to cover the administrative  costs of the program not ordinarily part of contract costs charged to  NMFS. The costs charged foreign fishermen for supplementary observers  may include, but are not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Salary and benefits, including overtime, for supplementary  observers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The costs of post-certification training required by paragraph  (j)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated  with deploying supplementary observers to foreign fishing vessels  including the cost of travel, transportation, and per diem from the  supplementary observer's post of duty to the point of embarkation to the  foreign fishing vessel, and then from the point of disembarkation to the  post of duty from where the trip began. For the purposes of these  regulations, the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and  Research Director will designate posts of duty for supplementary  observers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The costs of travel, transportation, and per diem associated  with the debriefing following deployment of a supplementary observer by  NMFS officials.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The administrative and overhead costs incurred by the contractor  and, if appropriate, a reasonable profit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NMFS costs. The owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels  must also pay to NMFS as part of the surcharge required by section  201(i)(4) of the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the following costs:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The costs of certifying applicants for the position of  supplementary observer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The costs of any equipment, including safety equipment,  sampling equipment, operations manuals, or other texts necessary to  perform the duties of a supplementary observer. The equipment will be  specified by the appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and  Research Director according to the requirements of the fishery to which  the supplementary observer will be deployed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The costs associated with communications with supplementary  observers for transmission of data and routine messages.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> For the purposes of monitoring the supplementary observer  program, the costs for the management and analysis of data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The costs for data editing and entry.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Any costs incurred by NMFS to train, deploy or debrief a  supplementary observer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The cost for U.S. Customs inspection for supplementary  observers disembarking after deployment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Reconciliation. Fees collected by the contractor in excess of  the actual costs of supplementary observer coverage will be refunded to  the owners and operators of foreign fishing vessels, or kept on deposit  to defray the costs of future supplementary observer coverage. Refunds  will be made within 60 days after final costs are determined and  approved by NMFS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Supplementary observer contractors--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Contractor eligibility.  Supplementary observers will be obtained by NMFS from persons or firms  having established contracts to provide NMFS with observers. In the  event no such contract is in place, NMFS will use established,  competitive contracting procedures to select persons or firms to provide  supplementary observers. The services supplied by the supplementary  observer contractors will be as described within the contract and as  specified below.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Supplementary observer contractors must submit for the approval  of the Assistant Administrator the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A copy of any contract, including all attachments, amendments,  and enclosures thereto, between the contractor and the owners and  operators of foreign fishing vessels for whom the contractor will  provide supplementary observer services.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All application information for persons whom the contractor  desires to employ as certified supplementary observers.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Billing schedules and billings to the owners and operators of  foreign fishing vessels for further transmission to the designated  representative of the appropriate foreign nation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> All data on costs.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Supplementary observers--certification, training--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>  Certification. The appropriate Regional Administrator or Science and  Research Director will certify persons as qualified for the position of  supplementary observer once the following conditions are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The candidate is a citizen or national of the United States.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The candidate has education or experience equivalent to the  education or experience required of persons used as observers by NMFS as  either Federal personnel or contract employees. The education and  experience required for certification may vary according to the  requirements of managing the foreign fishery in which the supplementary  observer is to be deployed. Documentation of U.S. citizenship or  nationality, and education or experience will be provided from personal  qualification statements on file with NMFS contractors who provide  supplementary observer services, and will not require the submission of  additional information to NMFS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Training. Prior to deployment to foreign fishing vessels,  certified supplementary observers must also meet the following  conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each certified supplementary observer must satisfactorily  complete a course of training approved by the appropriate Regional  Administrator or Science and Research Director as equivalent to that  received by persons used as observers by NMFS as either Federal  personnel or contract employees. The course of training may vary  according to the foreign fishery in which the supplementary observer is  to be deployed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each certified supplementary observer must agree in writing to  abide by standards of conduct as set forth in Department of Commerce  Administrative Order 202-735 (as provided by the contractor).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Supplementary observer certification suspension or revocation.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Certification of a supplementary observer may be suspended or  revoked by the Assistant Administrator under the following conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A supplementary observer fails to perform the duties specified  in paragraph (g)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A supplementary observer fails to abide by the standards of  conduct described by Department of Commerce Administrative Order 202- 735.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The suspension or revocation of the certification of a  supplementary observer by the Assistant Administrator may be based on  the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Boarding inspection reports by authorized officers of the USCG  or NMFS, or other credible information, that indicate a supplementary  observer has failed to abide by the established standards of conduct; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An analysis by NMFS of the data collected by a supplementary  observer indicating improper or incorrect data collection or recording.  The failure to properly collect or record data is sufficient to justify  decertification of supplementary observers; no intent to defraud need be  demonstrated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Assistant Administrator will notify the supplementary  observer, in writing, of the Assistant Administrator's intent to suspend  or revoke certification, and the reasons therefor, and provide the  supplementary observer a reasonable opportunity to respond. If the  Assistant Administrator determines that there are disputed questions of  material fact, then the Assistant Administrator may in this respect  appoint an examiner to make an informal fact-finding inquiry and prepare  a report and recommendations.
