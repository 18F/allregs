Reimbursement of the companies for funds expended pursuant to Condition 4 shall not operate to increase the total liability of the companies.</p><p class="depth0">4. contingent liability of the companies</p><p class="depth0">The companies have a contingent liability under this Master Policy for payment of excess losses but only if, and to the extent that, the retrospective premium due under one or more certificates is not paid. In the event of any such failure to pay retrospective premiums, the companies' obligations under this Condition 4 are limited as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Regardless of the number of nuclear incidents which cause bodily injury or property damage to which this Master Policy applies, the number of years this Master Policy is in force, the number of certificates issued or in effect, or the number of annual premiums paid or payable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The total contingent liability of the companies for all excess losses arising out of two or more nuclear incidents shall not exceed $46,500,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Subject to the above provision (a), the total contingent liability of the companies for all excess losses arising out of any one nuclear incident shall not exceed $23,250,000;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Subject to the above provisions (a) and (b), the maximum amount to be paid by the companies in any one calendar year because of contingent liability for excess losses shall not exceed $23,250,000.</p><p class="depth0">If a named insured designated in a certificate shall become insolvent or be adjudged bankrupt, the companies' obligation under this Condition 4 shall not apply to the failure of any named insured designated in such certificate to pay retrospective premium with respect to excess losses because of bodily injury or property damage caused after the date of such insolvency or bankruptcy.</p><p class="depth0">5. investigation, defense or settlement of claims or suits</p><p class="depth0">Subject to the provisions of any written agreement between the companies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the companies shall defend any claim or suit alleging bodily injury or property damage caused by a nuclear incident and seeking damages which are payable under this Master Policy, and may make such investigation and settlement of any claim or suit as they deem expedient. In no event shall the companies be obligated to pay any claim or judgment or to defend any claim or suit after the companies have paid the amount of retrospective premium actually received for excess losses arising out

of the nuclear incident plus the amount of their contingent liability, if any.</p><p class="depth0">6. primary financial protection</p><p class="depth0">Regardless of the number of policies or contracts of primary financial protection applicable to a nuclear incident, the limit of liability of all such policies or contracts shall be deemed to be exhausted when the sums paid under all such policies or contracts are equal to the lesser of (1) the sum of the limits of liability available under all such primary financial protection or (2) one hundred forty million dollars.</p><p class="depth0">The named insured designated in a certificate shall maintain in full effect during the currency of such certificate the primary financial protection described therein, except for any reduction of the limit of liability of such primary financial protection solely as the result of sums paid thereunder. Failure of the named insureds to comply with the foregoing shall not invalidate this Master Policy, but in the event of such failure the companies shall be liable only to the extent that they would have been liable and the named insureds complied therewith.</p><p class="depth0">In the event that the limit of liability of the primary financial protection is reduced, such names insureds shall immediately inform the companies thereof and make all reasonable efforts to reinstate such limit.</p><p class="depth0">Upon the companies' request the named insureds shall provide the companies with a certified copy of any policy or other contract of primary financial protection.

Such interest shall be computed at an annual rate equal to the sum of (a) three percent plus (b) a rate of interest equal to Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the date that the retrospective premium and allowance for premium taxes were due. The annual rate of interest shall be adjusted monthly during the period of default to reflect any revisions of Moody's Average Public Utility Bond Yield described in the issue of Moody's Bond Survey current on the first business day of each such month.</p><p class="depth0">The interest so received shall be used to pay to the companies interest at the annual rate described above for any funds the companies have paid pursuant to Condition 4. Any balance remaining shall accrue to the benefit of named insureds not in default as if it were investment income on retrospective premium.</p><p class="depth0">8. notice of nuclear incident, claim or suit</p><p class="depth0">In the event of bodily injury or property damage to which this Master Policy applies or of a nuclear incident which may give rise to claims therefor, written notice containing particulars sufficient to identify the insured and also reasonably obtainable information with respect to the time, place and circumstances thereof, and the names and addresses of the injured and of available witnesses, shall be given by or for the insured to Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or the companies as soon as practicable. If claim is made or suit is brought against the insured, the insured shall immediately forward to Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association or the companies every demand, notice, summons or other process received by or on behalf of the insured.</p><p class="depth0">9. assistance and cooperation of the insured</p><p class="depth0">The insured shall cooperate with the companies and, upon the companies' request, attend hearings and trials and assist in making settlements, in securing and giving evidence, in obtaining the attendance of witnesses and in the conduct of any legal proceedings in connection with the subject matter of this insurance. The insured shall not, except at the insured's own cost, make any payment, assume any obligation or incur any expense.</p><p class="depth0">10. action against companies</p><p class="depth0">No action shall lie against the companies or any of them unless, as a condition precedent thereto, the insured shall have fully complied with all the terms of this Master Policy, nor until the amount of the insured's obligation to pay shall have been finally determined either by judgment against the insured after actual trial or by written agreement of the insured, the claimant and the companies.</p><p class="depth0">Any person or organization or the legal representative thereof who has secured such judgment or written agreement shall thereafter be entitled to recover under this Master Policy to the extent of the insurance afforded by this Master Policy. No person or organization shall have any right under this Master Policy to join the companies or any of them as parties to any action against the insured to determine the insured's liability, nor shall the companies or any of them be impleaded by the insured or the insured's legal representative. Except as provided in

Condition 4, bankruptcy or insolvency of the insured or of the insured's estate shall not relieve the companies of any of their obligations hereunder.</p><p class="depth0">11. subrogation</p><p class="depth0">In the event of any payment under this Master Policy, the companies may participate with the insured and any underlying insurer in the exercise of all the insured's rights of recovery against any person or organization liable therefor. Prior to knowledge of bodiliy injury or property damage to which this Master Policy applies or of a nuclear incident which may give rise to claims therefor, the insured may waive in writing any right of recovery against any person or organization. After such knowledge, the insured shall not waive or otherwise prejudice any such right of recovery but shall do everything necessary to secure such rights. Recoveries shall be applied first to reimburse any person or organization (including the insured) that may have paid any amount with respect to liability in excess of the limit of the companies' liability hereunder; then to reimburse the companies up to the amount paid hereunder; and lastly to reimburse anyone entitiled to claim the residue, if any. A different apportionment maybe made by agreement signed by all parties affected.</p><p class="depth0">Reasonable expenses incurred in the exercise of rights of recovery shall be apportioned in the ratio of the respective losses for which recovery is sought. The companies shall, after deducting all of their expenses in securing recovery, apply the net amount of recoveries made by the companies as a credit in determining the amount of excess losses.</p><p class="depth0">12. other insurance</p><p class="depth0">This insurance shall be excess insurance over primary financial protection.</p><p class="depth0">This insurance is concurrent with insurance afforded by a Master Policy--Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance (Secondary Financial Protection) issued to the named insured by Mutual Atomic Energy Liability Underwriters, hereinafter called concurrent insurance. The companies shall not be liable under this Master Policy for a greater proportion of excess losses than the applicable limit of liability described in Condition 3 bears to the sum of (a) such limit plus (b) the applicable limit of liability of such concurrent insurance.</p><p class="depth0">If the insured has other valid and collectible insurance (other than primary financial protection or concurrent insurance) applicable to excess losses covered by this Master Policy, the insurance afforded by this Master Policy shall be primary insurance under such other insurance.</p><p class="depth0">13. changes</p><p class="depth0">Notice to any agent or knowledge possessed by any agent or by any other person shall not effect a waiver or a change in any part of this Master Policy or estop the companies from asserting any right under the terms of this Master Policy; nor shall the terms of this Master Policy be waived or changed, except by endorsement executed by Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association on behalf of the companies and issued to form a part of this Master Policy.</p><p class="depth0">14. assignment</p><p class="depth0">Assignment of interest by the named insured shall not bind the companies until their consent is endorsed hereon; if, however, the named insured shall die or be declared bankrupt or insolvent, this Master Policy shall cover such named insured's legal representative, receiver or trustee as an insured under this Master Policy, but only with respect to such legal representative's, receiver's or trustee's liability as such, and then only provided written notice of the legal representative's, receiver's or trustee's appointment as such is given to the companies within ten days after such appointment.</p><p class="depth0">15. custodian of the policy--nuclear regulatory commission</p><p class="depth0">The named insureds have designated the Nuclear Regulatory Commission as the custodian of this Master Policy and any endorsements thereto.</p><p class="depth0">16. cancellation</p><p class="depth0">The first named insured designated in Item 1 of a certificate may cancel such certificate by mailing to the companies and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.</p><p class="depth0">The companies may cancel any certificate by mailing to the first named insured designated in Item 1 of such certificate written notice stating when, not less than ninety days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective; provided that in the event of non-payment of any annual premium, retrospective premium or allowance for premium taxes due under a certificate, such certificate may be canceled by the companies by mailing to the first named insured designated therein written notice stating when, not less than thirty days thereafter, such cancellation shall be effective.</p><p class="depth0">The mailing of notice as aforesaid shall be sufficient proof of notice. The effective date and time of cancellation stated in the notice shall become the end of the certificate period. Delivery of such written notice, either by the first named insured designated in Item 1 of a certificate or by the companies, shall be equivalent to mailing.</p><p class="depth0">A copy of the companies' cancellation notice shall be mailed to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, but mailing such copy is not a condition of cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">If a certificate is canceled, the earned portion of the annual premium shall be computed pro-rata. Adjustment of the annual premium, if any, may be made either at the time cancellation is effective or as soon as practicable after cancellation becomes effective, but payment or tender of unearned premium is not a condition of cancellation.</p><p class="depth0">Cancellation or termination of any certificate shall not terminate the obligation of a named insured to pay retrospective premium and the allowance for premium taxes as provided in such named insured's certificate and Condition 2 of this Master Policy.</p><p class="depth0">This Master Policy shall terminate automatically on the effective date and time of cancellation or termination of the last certificate in effect.</p><p class="depth0">17. company representation</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Any notice, sworn statement or proof of loss which may be required by the provisions of this Master Policy may be given to any one of the companies, and such notice, statement or proof of loss so given shall be valid and binding as to all companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In any action or suit against the companies, service of process may be made on any one of them and such service shall be deemed valid and binding service on all companies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nuclear Energy Liability Insurance Association is the agent of the companies with respect to all matters pertaining to this insurance.
