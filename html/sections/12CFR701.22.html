                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section applies only to loan participations as defined in paragraph (a) of this section. It does not apply to the purchase of an investment interest in a pool of loans. This section establishes the requirements a federally insured credit union must satisfy to purchase a participation in a loan. This section applies only to a federally insured credit union's purchase of a loan participation where the borrower is not a

member of that credit union and where a continuing contractual obligation between the seller and purchaser is contemplated. Generally, a federal credit union's purchase of all or part of a loan made to one of its own members, subject to a limited exception for certain well capitalized federal credit unions in Sec. 701.23(b)(2), where no continuing contractual obligation between the seller and purchaser is contemplated, is governed by Sec. 701.23 of this part. Federally insured, state-chartered credit unions are required by Sec. 741.225 of this chapter to comply with the loan participation requirements of this section. This section does not apply to corporate credit unions, as that term is defined in Sec. 704.2 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth2">Associated borrower means any borrower with a shared ownership, investment, or other pecuniary interest in a business or commercial endeavor with the borrower. This includes guarantors, co-signors, major stakeholders, owners, investors, affiliates and other parties who have influence on the management, control, or operations of the borrower.</p><p class="depth2">Credit union means any federal or state-chartered credit union.</p><p class="depth2">Credit union organization means any credit union service organization meeting the requirements of part 712 of this chapter. This term does not include trade associations or membership organizations principally composed of credit unions.</p><p class="depth2">Eligible organization means a credit union, credit union organization, or financial organization.</p><p class="depth2">Financial organization means any federally chartered or federally insured financial institution; and any state or federal government agency and its subdivisions.</p><p class="depth2">Loan participation means a loan where one or more eligible organizations participate pursuant to a written agreement with the originating lender, and the written agreement requires the originating lender's continuing participation throughout the life of the loan.</p><p class="depth2">Originating lender means the participant with which the borrower initially or originally contracts for a loan and who, thereafter or concurrently with the funding of the loan, sells participations to other lenders.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A federally insured credit union may purchase a participation interest in a loan from an eligible organization only if the loan is one the purchasing credit union is empowered to grant and the following additional conditions are satisfied:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The purchase complies with all regulatory requirements to the same extent as if the purchasing federally insured credit union had originated the loan, including, for example, the loans-to-one-borrower provisions in Sec. 701.21(c)(5) of this part for federal credit unions and Sec. 723.8 of the member business loans rule in part 723 of this chapter for all federally insured credit unions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The purchasing federally insured credit union has executed a written loan participation agreement with the originating lender and the agreement meets the minimum requirements for a loan participation agreement as described in paragraph (d) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The originating lender retains an interest in each participated loan. If the originating lender is a federal credit union, the retained interest must be at least 10 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan through the life of the loan. If the originating lender is any other type of eligible organization, the retained interest must be at least 5 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan through the life of the loan, unless a higher percentage is required under applicable state law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The borrower becomes a member of one of the participating credit unions before the purchasing federally insured credit union purchases a participation interest in the loan; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The purchase complies with the purchasing federally insured credit union's internal written loan participation policy, which, at a minimum, must:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish underwriting standards for loan participations;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Establish a limit on the aggregate amount of loan participations that may be purchased from any one originating lender, not to exceed the greater of $5,000,000 or 100 percent of the federally insured credit union's net worth, unless this amount is waived by

the appropriate regional director, and, in the case of a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, with prior written concurrence of the appropriate state supervisory authority;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Establish limits on the amount of loan participations that may be purchased by each loan type, not to exceed a specified percentage of the federally insured credit union's net worth; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Establish a limit on the aggregate amount of loan participations that may be purchased with respect to a single borrower, or group of associated borrowers, not to exceed 15 percent of the federally insured credit union's net worth, unless waived by the appropriate regional director, and, in the case of a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, with prior written concurrence of the appropriate state supervisory authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To seek a waiver from any of the limitations in paragraph (b) of this section, a federally insured credit union must submit a written request to its regional director with a full and detailed explanation of why it is requesting the waiver. Within 45 days of receipt of a completed waiver request, including all necessary supporting documentation and, if appropriate, any written concurrence, the regional director will provide the federally insured credit union a written response. The regional director's decision will be based on safety and soundness and other considerations; however, the regional director will not grant a waiver to a federally insured, state-chartered credit union without the prior written concurrence of the appropriate state supervisory authority. A federally insured credit union may appeal any part of the waiver determination to the NCUA Board. Appeals must be submitted through the regional director within 60 days of the date of the determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A loan participation agreement must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be properly executed by authorized representatives of all parties under applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be properly authorized by the federally insured credit union's board of directors or, if the board has so delegated in its policy, a designated committee or senior management official, under the federally insured credit union's bylaws and all applicable law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Be retained in the federally insured credit union's office (original or copies); and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Include provisions which, at a minimum, address the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Prior to purchase, the identification of the specific loan participation(s) being purchased, either directly in the agreement or through a document which is incorporated by reference into the agreement;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The interest that the originating lender will retain in the loan to be participated. If the originating lender is a federal credit union, the retained interest must be at least 10 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan through the life of the loan. If the originating lender is any other type of eligible organization, the retained interest must be at least 5 percent of the outstanding balance of the loan through the life of the loan, unless a higher percentage is required under state law;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The location and custodian for original loan documents;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An explanation of the conditions under which parties to the agreement can gain access to financial and other performance information about a loan, the borrower, and the servicer so the parties can monitor the loan;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> An explanation of the duties and responsibilities of the originating lender, servicer, and participants with respect to all aspects of the participation, including servicing, default, foreclosure, collection, and other matters involving the ongoing administration of the loan; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Circumstances and conditions under which participants may replace the servicer.
