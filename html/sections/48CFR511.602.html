                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The purpose of the DPAS is to assure the timely availability of  industrial resources to meet current national defense, energy, and civil  emergency preparedness program requirements and to provide an operating  system to support rapid industrial response in a national emergency. The  primary statutory authority for the   DPAS is Title I of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, with  additional authority from the Selective Service Act of 1948 and the  Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act.  Executive Orders 12919 and 12742 delegate to the DOC authority to  administer the DPAS. Within the DOC, the Office of Strategic Industries  and Economic Security (SIES) is assigned responsibility for DPAS  implementation, administration, and compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The DPAS is published in the Code of Federal Regulations at 15  CFR part 700. This regulation provides an overview, a detailed  explanation of operations and procedures, and other implementing  guidance, including information on special priorities assistance and  compliance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Orders placed under DPAS are ``rated orders.'' Rated orders must  receive preferential treatment only as necessary to meet delivery  requirements. Rated orders are identified by a rating symbol of either  ``DX'' or ``DO'' followed by a program identification symbol. All ``DO''  rated orders have equal priority with each other and take preference  over unrated orders. All ``DX'' rated orders have equal priority with  each other and take preference over ``DO'' rated orders and unrated  orders. A program identification symbol indicates which approved program  is supported by the rated order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The authority delegated to GSA shall not be used to support the  procurement of any items that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are commonly available in commercial markets for general  consumption;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Do not require major modification when purchased for approved  program use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Are readily available in sufficient quantity so as to cause no  delay in meeting approved program requirements; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Are to be used primarily for administrative purposes (including  Federal Supply Classification (FSC) classes, groups, or items), such as  for personnel or financial management. The Commissioner, FAS, shall  issue additional guidance, as may be necessary, to ensure effective  implementation of its delegated DPAS authority.  [74 FR 66254, Dec. 15, 2009]</p>
