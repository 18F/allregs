                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Receipt. You must evaluate each incoming HCT/P for the presence  and significance of microorganisms and inspect for damage and  contamination. You must determine whether to accept, reject, or place in  quarantine each incoming HCT/P, based upon pre-established criteria  designed to prevent communicable disease transmission.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Predistribution shipment. If you ship an HCT/P within your  establishment or between establishments (e.g., procurer to processor)  and the HCT/P is not available for distribution as described in  paragraph (c) of this section, you must first determine and document  whether pre-established criteria designed to prevent communicable  disease transmission have been met, and you must ship the HCT/P in  quarantine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Availability for distribution. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Before making an HCT/P  available for distribution, you must review manufacturing and tracking  records pertaining to the HCT/P, and, on the basis of that record  review, you must verify and document that the release criteria have been  met. A responsible person must document and date the determination that  an HCT/P is available for distribution.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must not make available for distribution an HCT/P that is in  quarantine, is contaminated, is recovered from a donor who has been  determined to be ineligible or for whom a donor-eligibility  determination has not been completed (except as provided under  Sec. Sec. 1271.60, 1271.65, and 1271.90), or that otherwise does not  meet release criteria designed to prevent communicable disease  transmission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must not make available for distribution any HCT/P  manufactured   under a departure from a procedure relevant to preventing risks of  communicable disease transmission, unless a responsible person has  determined that the departure does not increase the risk of communicable  disease through the use of the HCT/P. You must record and justify any  departure from a procedure at the time of its occurrence.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Packaging and shipping. Packaging and shipping containers must  be designed and constructed to protect the HCT/P from contamination. For  each type of HCT/P, you must establish appropriate shipping conditions  to be maintained during transit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures. You must establish and maintain procedures,  including release criteria, for the activities in paragraphs (a) through  (d) of this section. You must document these activities. Documentation  must include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Identification of the HCT/P and the establishment that supplied  the HCT/P;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Activities performed and the results of each activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Date(s) of activity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Quantity of HCT/P subject to the activity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Disposition of the HCT/P (e.g., identity of consignee).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Return to inventory. You must establish and maintain procedures  to determine if an HCT/P that is returned to your establishment is  suitable to be returned to inventory.</p>
