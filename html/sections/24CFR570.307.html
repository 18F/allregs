                                Sec.  570.307  Urban counties.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determination of qualification. The Secretary will determine the  qualifications of counties to receive entitlements as urban counties  upon receipt of qualification documentation from counties at such time,  and in such manner and form as prescribed by HUD. The Secretary shall  determine eligibility and applicable portions of each eligible county  for purposes of fund allocation under section 106 of the Act on the  basis of information available from the U.S. Bureau of the Census with  respect to population and other pertinent demographic characteristics,  and based on information provided by the county and its included units  of general local government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Qualification as an urban county. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A county will qualify as  an urban county if such county meets the definition at Sec.  570.3(3).  As necessitated by this definition, the Secretary shall determine which  counties have authority to carry out essential community development and  housing assistance activities in their included units of general local  government without the consent of the local governing body and which  counties must execute cooperation agreements with such units to include  them in the urban county for qualification and grant calculation  purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the time of urban county qualification, HUD may refuse to  recognize the cooperation agreement of a unit of general local  government in an urban county where, based on past performance and other  available information, there is substantial evidence that such unit does  not cooperate in the implementation of the essential community  development or housing assistance activities or where legal impediments  to such implementation exist, or where participation by a unit of  general local government in noncompliance with the applicable law in  subpart K would constitute noncompliance by the urban county. In such a  case, the unit of general local government will not be permitted to  participate in the urban county, and its population or other needs  characteristics will not be considered in the determination of whether  the county qualifies as an urban county or in determining the amount of  funds to which the urban county may be entitled. HUD will not take this  action unless the unit of general local government and the county have  been given an opportunity to challenge HUD's determination and to  informally consult with HUD concerning the proposed action.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Essential activities. For purposes of this section, the term  ``essential community development and housing assistance activities''  means community renewal and lower income housing activities,  specifically urban renewal and publicly assisted housing. In determining  whether a county has the required powers, the Secretary will consider  both its authority and, where applicable, the authority of its  designated agency or agencies.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Period of qualification. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The qualification by HUD of an  urban county shall remain effective for three successive Federal fiscal  years regardless of changes in its population during that period, except  as provided under paragraph (f) of this section and except as provided  under Sec.  570.3(3) where the period of qualification shall be two  successive Federal fiscal years.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> During the period of qualification, no included unit of general  local government may withdraw from nor be removed from the urban county  for HUD's grant computation purposes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If some portion of an urban county's unincorporated area becomes  incorporated during the urban county qualification period, the newly  incorporated unit of general local government shall not be excluded from  the urban county nor shall it be eligible for   a separate grant under subpart D, F, or I until the end of the urban  county's current qualification period, unless the urban county fails to  receive a grant for any year during that qualification period.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Grant ineligibility of included units of general local  government. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An included unit of general local government cannot  become eligible for an entitlement grant as a metropolitan city during  the period of qualification of the urban county (even if it becomes a  principal city of a metropolitan area or its population surpasses 50,000  during that period). Rather, such a unit of general local government  shall continue to be included as part of the urban county for the  remainder of the urban county's qualification period, and no separate  grant amount shall be calculated for the included unit.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> An included unit of general local government which is part of an  urban county shall be ineligible to apply for grants under subpart F, or  to be a recipient of assistance under subpart I, during the entire  period of urban county qualification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Failure of an urban county to receive a grant. Failure of an  urban county to receive a grant during any year shall terminate the  existing qualification of that urban county, and that county shall  requalify as an urban county before receiving an entitlement grant in  any successive Federal fiscal year. Such termination shall release units  of general local government included in the urban county, in subsequent  years, from the prohibition to receive grants under paragraphs (d)(3),  (e)(1) and (e)(2) of this section. For this purpose an urban county  shall be deemed to have received a grant upon having satisfied the  requirements of sections 104 (a), (b), (c), and (d) of the Act, without  regard to adjustments which may be made to this grant amount under  section 104(e) or 111 of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Notifications of the opportunity to be excluded. Any county  seeking to qualify for an entitlement grant as an urban county for any  Federal fiscal year shall notify each unit of general local government  which is located, in whole or in part, within the county and which would  otherwise be included in the urban county, but which is eligible to  elect to have its population excluded from that of the urban county,  that it has the opportunity to make such an election, and that such an  election, or the failure to make such an election, shall be effective  for the period for which the county qualifies as an urban county. These  notifications shall be made by a date specified by HUD. A unit of  general local government which elects to be excluded from participation  as a part of the urban county shall notify the county and HUD in writing  by a date specified by HUD. Such a unit of government may subsequently  elect to participate in the urban county for the remaining one or two  year period by notifying HUD and the county, in writing, of such  election by a date specified by HUD.
