In the case of any plan (as defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section), there is imposed a tax for the employer's taxable year equal to 10 percent of the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any excess contributions under a plan for the plan year ending in the taxable year; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any excess aggregate contributions under the plan for the plan year ending in the taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Liability for tax. The tax imposed by paragraph (a)(1) of this section is to be paid by the employer. In the case of a collectively bargained plan to which section 413(b) applies, all employers who are parties to the collective bargaining agreement and whose employees are participants in the plan are jointly and severally liable for the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Due date and form for payment of tax--(i) The tax described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is due on the last day of the 15th month after the close of the plan year to which the excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The tax described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section is due on the last day of the 15th month after the close of the plan year to which the excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions relate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An employer that owes the tax described in paragraph (a)(1) of this section must file the form prescribed by the Commissioner for the payment of the tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rule for simplified employee pensions--(i) An employer that maintains a simplified employee pension (SEP) as defined in section 408(k) that accepts elective contributions is exempted from the tax of section 4979 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it notifies its employees of the fact and tax consequences of excess contributions within 2\1/2\ months following the plan year for which excess contributions are made. The notification must meet the standards of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer that maintains a simplified employee pension (SEP) as defined in section 408(k) that accepts elective contributions is exempted from the tax of section 4979 and paragraph (a)(1) of this section if it notifies its employees of the fact and tax consequences of excess contributions within 2\1/2\ months following the plan year for which excess contributions are made. The notification must meet the standards of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer's notification to each affected employee of the excess SEP contributions must specifically state, in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant: the amount of the excess contributions attributable to that employee's elective deferrals; the calendar year for which the excess contributions were made; that the excess contributions are includible in the affected employee's gross income for the specified calendar year; and that failure to withdraw the excess contributions and income attributable thereto by the due date (plus extensions) for filing the affected employee's tax return for the preceding calendar year may result in significant penalties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If an employer does not notify its employees by the last day of the 12-month period following the year of excess SEP contributions, the SEP will no longer be considered to meet the requirements of section 408(k)(6).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following is a list of terms and definitions to be used for purposes of section 4979 and this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Excess aggregate contributions. The term ``excess aggregate contribution'' has the meaning set forth in Sec. 1.401(m)-5 of this chapter. For purposes of determining excess aggregate contributions under an annuity contract described in section 403(b), the contract is treated as a plan described in section 401(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Excess contributions. The term ``excess contributions'' has the meaning set forth in sections 401(k)(8)(B), 408(k)(6)(C)(ii), and 501(c)(18). See, e.g., Sec. 1.401(k)-6 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Plan. The term ``plan'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A plan described in section 401(a) that includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any annuity plan described in section 403(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any annuity contract described in section 403(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> A simplified employee pension of an employer that satisfies the requirements of section 408(k); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> A plan described in section 501(c)(18).
The term includes any plan that at any time has been determined by the Secretary to be one of the types of plans described in this paragraph (b)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No tax when excess distributed within 2\1/2\ months of close of year or additional employer contributions made--(1) General rule. No tax is imposed under this section on any excess contribution or excess aggregate contribution, as the case may be, to the extent the contribution (together with any income allocable thereto) is corrected before the close of the first 2\1/2\ months of the following plan year (6 months in the case of a plan that includes an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w)). The extension to 6 months applies to a distribution of excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions for a plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2010, only where all the eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs (both as defined in Sec. 1.401(k)-6 of this Chapter) are covered employees under an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w) for the entire plan year (or the portion of the plan year that the eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs are eligible employees under the plan)). Qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions taken into account under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) of this Chapter or qualified nonelective contributions or elective contributions taken into account under Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(6) of this Chapter for a plan year may permit a plan to avoid excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions, respectively, even if made after the close of the 2\1/2\ month (or 6 month) period for distributing excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions without the excise tax. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(1)(i) and (5)(i) of this Chapter for methods to avoid excess contributions, and Sec. 1.401(m)-2(b)(1)(i) of the Chapter for methods to avoid excess aggregate contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. No tax is imposed under this section on any excess contribution or excess aggregate contribution, as the case may be, to the extent the contribution (together with any income allocable thereto) is corrected before the close of the first 2\1/2\ months of the following plan year (6 months in the case of a plan that includes an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w)). The extension to 6 months applies to a distribution of excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions for a plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2010, only where all the eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs (both as defined in Sec. 1.401(k)-6 of this Chapter) are covered employees under an eligible automatic contribution arrangement within the meaning of section 414(w) for the entire plan year (or the portion of the plan year that the eligible NHCEs and eligible HCEs are eligible employees under the plan)). Qualified nonelective contributions and qualified matching contributions taken into account under Sec. 1.401(k)-2(a)(6) of this Chapter or qualified nonelective contributions or elective contributions taken into account under Sec. 1.401(m)-2(a)(6) of this Chapter for a plan year may permit a plan to avoid excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions, respectively, even if made after the close of the 2\1/2\ month (or 6 month) period for distributing excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions without the excise tax. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(1)(i) and (5)(i) of this Chapter for methods to avoid excess contributions, and Sec. 1.401(m)-2(b)(1)(i) of the Chapter for methods to avoid excess aggregate contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Tax treatment of distributions. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(3)(ii) and (2)(vi) of this chapter for rules for determining the tax consequences to a participant of a distribution or recharacterization of excess contributions and income allocable thereto, including a special rule for de minimis distributions. See Sec. 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(vi) of this chapter for rules for determining the tax consequences to a participant of a distribution of excess aggregate contributions and income allocable thereto.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Income. See Sec. 1.401(k)-2(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter for rules for determining income allocable to excess contributions. See Sec. 1.401(m)-2(b)(2)(iv) of this chapter for rules for determining income allocable to excess aggregate contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Example. The provisions of this paragraph (c) are illustrated by the following example.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X maintains Plan Y, a calendar year profit-sharing plan that includes a qualified cash or deferred arrangement. Under the plan, failure to satisfy the actual deferral percentage test may only be corrected by distributing the excess contributions or making qualified nonelective contributions (QNECs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> On December 31, 1990, X determines that Y does not satisfy the actual deferral percentage test for the 1990 plan year, and that excess contributions for the year equal $5,000. On March 1, 1991, Y distributes $2,000 of these excess contributions. On May 30, 1991, X distributes another $2,000 of excess contributions. On December 17, 1991, X contributes QNECs for certain nonhighly compensated employees, thereby eliminating the remainder of the excess contributions for 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> X has incurred a tax liability under section 4979 for 1990 equal to 10 percent of the excess contributions that were in the plan as of December 31, 1990. However, this tax is not imposed on the $2,000 distributed on March 1, 1991, or the amount corrected by QNECs. X must pay an excise tax of $200, 10 percent of the $2,000 of excess contributions distributed after March 15, 1991. This tax must be paid by March 31, 1992.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effective date--(1) General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4), this section is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Except as provided in paragraphs (d)(2) through (4), this section is effective for plan years beginning after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Section 403(b) annuity contracts. In the case of an annuity contract under section 403(b), this section applies to plan years beginning after December 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Collectively bargained plans and plans of state or local governments. For plan years beginning before January 1, 1993, the provisions of this section do not apply to a collectively bargained plan that automatically satisfies the requirements of section 410(b). See Sec. Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-1(c)(5) and 1.410(b)-2(b)(7) of this chapter. In the case of a plan (including a collectively bargained plan) maintained by a state or local government, the provisions of this section do not apply for plan years beginning before the later of January 1, 1996, or 90 days after the opening of the first legislative session beginning on or after January 1, 1996, of the governing body with authority to amend the plan, if that body does not meet continuously. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3), the term governing body with authority to amend the plan means the legislature, board, commission, council, or other governing body with authority to amend the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plan years beginning before January 1, 1992. For plan years beginning before January 1, 1992, a reasonable interpretation of the rules set forth in section 4979, as in effect during those years, may be relied upon in determining whether the excise tax is due for those years.

Sec. 54.4980B-1  COBRA in general.</p><p class="depth0">The COBRA continuation coverage requirements are described in general in the following questions-and-answers:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What are the health care continuation coverage requirements contained in section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code and in ERISA?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Section 4980B provides generally that a group health plan must offer each qualified beneficiary who would otherwise lose coverage under the plan as a result of a qualifying event an opportunity to elect, within the election period, continuation coverage under the plan. The continuation coverage requirements were added to section 162 by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 (COBRA), Public Law 99-272 (100 Stat. 222), and moved to section 4980B by the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988, Public Law 100-647 (102 Stat. 3342). Continuation coverage required under section 4980B is referred to in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 as COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> COBRA also added parallel continuation coverage requirements to Part 6 of Subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) (29 U.S.C. 1161-1168), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Labor. If a plan does not comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, the Internal Revenue Code imposes an excise tax on the employer maintaining the plan (or on the plan itself), whereas ERISA gives certain parties--including qualified beneficiaries who are participants or beneficiaries within the meaning of title I of ERISA, as well as the Department of Labor--the right to file a lawsuit to redress the noncompliance. The rules in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 apply for purposes of section 4980B and generally also for purposes of the COBRA continuation coverage requirements in title I of ERISA. However, certain provisions of the COBRA continuation coverage requirements (such as the definitions of group health plan,

employee, and employer) are not identical in the Internal Revenue Code and title I of ERISA. In those cases in which the statutory language is not identical, the rules in Sec.

Sec. 54.4980B-2  Plans that must comply.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers apply in determining which plans must comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: For purposes of section 4980B, what is a group health plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) For purposes of section 4980B, a group health plan is a plan maintained by an employer or employee organization to provide health care to individuals who have an employment-related connection to the employer or employee organization or to their families. Individuals who have an employment-related connection to the employer or employee organization consist of employees, former employees, the employer, and others associated or formerly associated with the employer or employee organization in a business relationship (including members of a union who are not currently employees). Health care is provided under a plan whether provided directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise, and whether or not provided through an on-site facility (except as set forth in paragraph (d) of this Q&A-1;), or through a cafeteria plan (as defined in section 125) or other flexible benefit arrangement. (See paragraphs (b) through (e) in Q&A-8; of this section for rules regarding the application of the COBRA continuation coverage requirements to certain health flexible spending arrangements.) For purposes of this Q&A-1;, insurance includes not only group insurance policies but also one or more individual insurance policies in any arrangement that involves the provision of health care to two or more employees. A plan maintained by an employer or employee organization is any plan of, or contributed to (directly or indirectly) by, an employer or employee organization. Thus, a group health plan is maintained by an employer or employee organization even if the employer or employee organization does not contribute to it if coverage under the plan would not be available at the same cost to an individual but for the individual's employment-related connection to the employer or employee organization. These rules are further explained in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this Q&A-1.; An exception for qualified long-term

care services is set forth in paragraph (e) of this Q&A-1;, and for medical savings accounts in paragraph (f) of this Q&A-1.; See Q&A-6; of this section for rules to determine the number of group health plans that an employer or employee organization maintains.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, health care has the same meaning as medical care under section 213(d). Thus, health care generally includes the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, and any other undertaking for the purpose of affecting any structure or function of the body. Health care also includes transportation primarily for and essential to health care as described in the preceding sentence. However, health care does not include anything that is merely beneficial to the general health of an individual, such as a vacation. Thus, if an employer or employee organization maintains a program that furthers general good health, but the program does not relate to the relief or alleviation of health or medical problems and is generally accessible to and used by employees without regard to their physical condition or state of health, that program is not considered a program that provides health care and so is not a group health plan. For example, if an employer maintains a spa, swimming pool, gymnasium, or other exercise/fitness program or facility that is normally accessible to and used by employees for reasons other than relief of health or medical problems, such a facility does not constitute a program that provides health care and thus is not a group health plan. In contrast, if an employer maintains a drug or alcohol treatment program or a health clinic, or any other facility or program that is intended to relieve or alleviate a physical condition or health problem, the facility or program is considered to be the provision of health care and so is considered a group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Whether a benefit provided to employees constitutes health care is not affected by whether the benefit is excludable from income under section 132 (relating to certain fringe benefits). For example, if a department store provides its employees discounted prices on all merchandise, including health care items such as drugs or eyeglasses, the mere fact that the discounted prices also apply to health care items will not cause the program to be a plan providing health care, so long as the discount program would normally be accessible to and used by employees without regard to health needs or physical condition. If, however, the employer maintaining the discount program is a health clinic, so that the program is used exclusively by employees with health or medical needs, the program is considered to be a plan providing health care and so is considered to be a group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The provision of health care at a facility that is located on the premises of an employer or employee organization does not constitute a group health plan if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The health care consists primarily of first aid that is provided during the employer's working hours for treatment of a health condition, illness, or injury that occurs during those working hours;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The health care is available only to current employees; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employees are not charged for the use of the facility.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A plan does not constitute a group health plan subject to COBRA if substantially all of the coverage provided under the plan is for qualified long-term care services (as defined in section 7702B(c)). For this purpose, a plan is permitted to use any reasonable method in determining whether substantially all of the coverage provided under the plan is for qualified long-term care services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Under section 106(b)(5), amounts contributed by an employer to a medical savings account (as defined in section 220(d)) are not considered part of a group health plan subject to COBRA. Thus, a plan is not required to make COBRA continuation coverage available with respect to amounts contributed by an employer to a medical savings account. A high deductible health plan does not fail to be a group health plan subject to COBRA merely because it covers a medical savings account holder.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: For purposes of section 4980B, what is the employer?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) For purposes of section 4980B, employer refers to--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A person for whom services are performed;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any other person that is a member of a group described in section 414(b), (c), (m), or (o) that includes a person described in paragraph (a)(1) of this Q&A-2; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any successor of a person described in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this Q&A-2.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An employer is a successor employer if it results from a consolidation, merger, or similar restructuring of the employer or if it is a mere continuation of the employer. See paragraph (c) in Q&A-8; of Sec. 54.4980B-9 for rules describing the circumstances in which a purchaser of substantial assets is a successor employer to the employer selling the assets.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: What is a multiemployer plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, a multiemployer plan is a plan to which more than one employer is required to contribute, that is maintained pursuant to one or more collective bargaining agreements between one or more employee organizations and more than one employer, and that satisfies such other requirements as the Secretary of Labor may prescribe by regulation. Whenever reference is made in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 to a plan of or maintained by an employer or employee organization, the reference includes a multiemployer plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: What group health plans are subject to COBRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) All group health plans are subject to COBRA except group health plans described in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-4.; Group health plans described in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-4; are referred to in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 as excepted from COBRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The following group health plans are excepted from COBRA--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Small-employer plans (see Q&A-5; of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Church plans (within the meaning of section 414(e)); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Governmental plans (within the meaning of section 414(d)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The COBRA continuation coverage requirements generally do not apply to group health plans that are excepted from COBRA. However, a small-employer plan otherwise excepted from COBRA is nonetheless subject to COBRA with respect to qualified beneficiaries who experience a qualifying event during a period when the plan is not a small-employer plan (see paragraph (g) of Q&A-5; of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Although governmental plans are not subject to the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, group health plans maintained by state or local governments are generally subject to parallel continuation coverage requirements that were added by section 10003 of COBRA to the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300bb-1 through 300bb-8), which is administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Federal employees and their family members covered under the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program are covered by generally similar, but not parallel, temporary continuation of coverage provisions enacted by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Amendments Act of 1988. See 5 U.S.C. 8905a.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is a small-employer plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) Except in the case of a multiemployer plan, a small-employer plan is a group health plan maintained by an employer (within the meaning of Q&A-2; of this section) that normally employed fewer than 20 employees (within the meaning of paragraph (c) of this Q&A-5;) during the preceding calendar year. In the case of a multiemployer plan, a small-employer plan is a group health plan under which each of the employers contributing to the plan for a calendar year normally employed fewer than 20 employees during the preceding calendar year. See Q&A-6; of this section for rules to determine the number of plans that an employer or employee organization maintains. The rules of this paragraph (a) are illustrated in the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Corporation S employs 12 employees, all of whom work and reside in the United States. S maintains a group health plan for its employees and their families. S is a wholly-owned subsidiary of P. In the previous calendar year, the controlled group of corporations including P and S employed more than 19 employees, although the only

employees in the United States of the controlled group that includes P and S are the 12 employees of S.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under Sec. 1.414(b)-1 of this chapter, foreign corporations are not excluded from membership in a controlled group of corporations. Consequently, the group health plan maintained by S is not a small-employer plan during the current calendar year because the controlled group including S normally employed at least 20 employees in the preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An employer is considered to have normally employed fewer than 20 employees during a particular calendar year if, and only if, it had fewer than 20 employees on at least 50 percent of its typical business days during that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> All full-time and part-time common law employees of an employer are taken into account in determining whether an employer had fewer than 20 employees; however, an individual who is not a common law employee of the employer is not taken into account. Thus, the following individuals are not counted as employees for purposes of this Q&A-5; even though they are referred to as employees for all other purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Self-employed individuals (within the meaning of section 401(c)(1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Independent contractors (and their employees and independent contractors); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Directors (in the case of a corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> In determining the number of the employees of an employer, each full-time employee is counted as one employee and each part-time employee is counted as a fraction of an employee, determined in accordance with paragraph (e) of this Q&A-5.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An employer may determine the number of its employees on a daily basis or a pay period basis. The basis used by the employer must be used with respect to all employees of the employer and must be used for the entire year for which the number of employees is being determined. If an employer determines the number of its employees on a daily basis, it must determine the actual number of full-time employees on each typical business day and the actual number of part-time employees and the hours worked by each of those part-time employees on each typical business day. Each full-time employee counts as one employee on each typical business day and each part-time employee counts as a fraction, with the numerator of the fraction equal to the number of hours worked by that employee and the denominator equal to the number of hours that must be worked on a typical business day in order to be considered a full-time employee. If an employer determines the number of its employees on a pay period basis, it must determine the actual number of full-time employees employed during that pay period and the actual number of part-time employees employed and the hours worked by each of those part-time employees during the pay period. For each day of that pay period, each full-time employee counts as one employee and each part-time employee counts as a fraction, with the numerator of the fraction equal to the number of hours worked by that employee during that pay period and the denominator equal to the number of hours that must be worked during that pay period in order to be considered a full-time employee. The determination of the number of hours required to be considered a full-time employee is based upon the employer's employment practices, except that in no event may the hours required to be considered a full-time employee exceed eight hours for any day or 40 hours for any week.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> In the case of a multiemployer plan, the determination of whether the plan is a small-employer plan on any particular date depends on which employers are contributing to the plan on that date and on the workforce of those employers during the preceding calendar year. If a plan that is otherwise subject to COBRA ceases to be a small-employer plan because of the addition during a calendar year of an employer that did not normally employ fewer than 20 employees on a typical business day during the preceding calendar year, the plan ceases to be excepted from COBRA immediately upon the addition of the new employer. In contrast, if the plan ceases to be a small-employer plan by reason of an increase during a calendar year in the workforce of an employer contributing to the plan, the plan ceases to be excepted

from COBRA on the January 1 immediately following the calendar year in which the employer's workforce increased.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> A small-employer plan is generally excepted from COBRA. If, however, a plan that has been subject to COBRA (that is, was not a small-employer plan) becomes a small-employer plan, the plan remains subject to COBRA for qualifying events that occurred during the period when the plan was subject to COBRA. The rules of this paragraph (g) are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. An employer maintains a group health plan. The employer employed 20 employees on more than 50 percent of its working days during 2001, and consequently the plan is not excepted from COBRA during 2002. Employee E resigns and does not work for the employer after January 31, 2002. Under the terms of the plan, E is no longer eligible for coverage upon the effective date of the resignation, that is, February 1, 2002. The employer does not hire a replacement for E. E timely elects and pays for COBRA continuation coverage. The employer employs 19 employees for the remainder of 2002, and consequently the plan is not subject to COBRA in 2003. The plan must nevertheless continue to make COBRA continuation coverage available to E during 2003 until the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available ceases under the rules of Sec. 54.4980B-7. The obligation could continue until August 1, 2003, the date that is 18 months after the date of E's qualifying event, or longer if E is eligible for a disability extension.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example 1. The employer continues to employ 19 employees throughout 2003 and 2004 and consequently the plan continues to be excepted from COBRA during 2004 and 2005. Spouse S is covered under the plan because S is married to one of the employer's employees. On April 1, 2002, S is divorced from that employee and ceases to be eligible for coverage under the plan. The plan is subject to COBRA during 2002 because X normally employed 20 employees during 2001. S timely notifies the plan administrator of the divorce and timely elects and pays for COBRA continuation coverage. Even though the plan is generally excepted from COBRA during 2003, 2004, and 2005, it must nevertheless continue to make COBRA continuation coverage available to S during those years until the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available ceases under the rules of Sec. 54.4980B-7. The obligation could continue until April 1, 2005, the date that is 36 months after the date of S's qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. The facts are the same as in Example 2. C is a dependent child of one of the employer's employees and is covered under the plan. A dependent child is no longer eligible for coverage under the plan upon the attainment of age 23. C attains age 23 on November 16, 2005. The plan is excepted from COBRA with respect to C during 2005 because the employer normally employed fewer than 20 employees during 2004. Consequently, the plan is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available to C (and would not be obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available to C even if the plan later became subject to COBRA again).</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: How is the number of group health plans that an employer or employee organization maintains determined?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) The rules of this Q&A-6; apply in determining the number of group health plans that an employer or employee organization maintains. All references elsewhere in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 to a group health plan are references to a group health plan as determined under Q&A-1; of this section and this Q&A-6.; Except as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this Q&A-6;, all health care benefits, other than benefits for qualified long-term care services (as defined in section 7702B(c)), provided by a corporation, partnership, or other entity or trade or business, or by an employee organization, constitute one group health plan, unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> It is clear from the instruments governing an arrangement or arrangements to provide health care benefits that the benefits are being provided under separate plans; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The arrangement or arrangements are operated pursuant to such instruments as separate plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A multiemployer plan and a nonmultiemployer plan are always separate plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a principal purpose of establishing separate plans is to evade any requirement of law, then the separate plans will be considered a single plan to the extent necessary to prevent the evasion.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The significance of treating an arrangement as two or more separate group health plans is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X maintains a single group health plan, which provides major

medical and prescription drug benefits. Employer Y maintains two group health plans; one provides major medical benefits and the other provides prescription drug benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> X's plan could comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements by giving a qualified beneficiary experiencing a qualifying event with respect to X's plan the choice of either electing both major medical and prescription drug benefits or not receiving any COBRA continuation coverage under X's plan. By contrast, for Y's plans to comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements, a qualified beneficiary experiencing a qualifying event with respect to each of Y's plans must be given the choice of electing COBRA continuation coverage under either the major medical plan or the prescription drug plan or both.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. If a joint board of trustees administers one multiemployer plan, that plan will fail to qualify for the small-employer plan exception if any one of the employers whose employees are covered under the plan normally employed 20 or more employees during the preceding calendar year. However, if the joint board of trustees maintains two or more multiemployer plans, then the exception would be available with respect to each of those plans in which each of the employers whose employees are covered under the plan normally employed fewer than 20 employees during the preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: What is the plan year?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: (a) The plan year is the year that is designated as the plan year in the plan documents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the plan documents do not designate a plan year (or if there are no plan documents), then the plan year is determined in accordance with this paragraph (b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan year is the deductible/limit year used under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the plan does not impose deductibles or limits on an annual basis, then the plan year is the policy year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If the plan does not impose deductibles or limits on an annual basis, and either the plan is not insured or the insurance policy is not renewed on an annual basis, then the plan year is the employer's taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> In any other case, the plan year is the calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: How do the COBRA continuation coverage requirements apply to cafeteria plans and other flexible benefit arrangements?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: (a)(1) The provision of health care benefits does not fail to be a group health plan merely because those benefits are offered under a cafeteria plan (as defined in section 125) or under any other arrangement under which an employee is offered a choice between health care benefits and other taxable or nontaxable benefits. However, the COBRA continuation coverage requirements apply only to the type and level of coverage under the cafeteria plan or other flexible benefit arrangement that a qualified beneficiary is actually receiving on the day before the qualifying event. See paragraphs (b) through (e) of this Q&A-8; for rules limiting the obligations of certain health flexible spending arrangements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The rules of this paragraph (a) are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0">Example: (i) Under the terms of a cafeteria plan, employees can choose among life insurance coverage, membership in a health maintenance organization (HMO), coverage for medical expenses under an indemnity arrangement, and cash compensation. Of these available choices, the HMO and the indemnity arrangement are the arrangements providing health care. The instruments governing the HMO and indemnity arrangements indicate that they are separate group health plans. These group health plans are subject to COBRA. The employer does not provide any group health plan outside of the cafeteria plan. B and C are unmarried employees. B has chosen the life insurance coverage, and C has chosen the indemnity arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B does not have to be offered COBRA continuation coverage upon terminating employment, nor is a subsequent open enrollment period for active employees required to be made available to B. However, if C terminates employment and the termination constitutes a qualifying event, C must be offered an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage under the indemnity arrangement. If C makes such an election and an open enrollment period for active employees occurs while C is still receiving the COBRA continuation coverage, C must be offered the opportunity to switch from the indemnity arrangement to the HMO (but not to the life insurance coverage because that does not constitute coverage provided under a group health plan).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a health flexible spending arrangement (health FSA), within the meaning of section 106(c)(2), satisfies the two conditions in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; for a plan year, the obligation of the health FSA to make COBRA continuation coverage available to a

qualified beneficiary who experiences a qualifying event in that plan year is limited in accordance with paragraphs (d) and (e) of this Q&A-8;, as illustrated by an example in paragraph (f) of this Q&A-8.; To the extent that a health FSA is obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available to a qualified beneficiary, the health FSA must comply with all the applicable rules of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, including the rules of Q&A-3; in Sec. 54.4980B-5 (relating to limits).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The conditions of this paragraph (c) are satisfied if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Benefits provided under the health FSA are excepted benefits within the meaning of sections 9831 and 9832; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for a year of COBRA continuation coverage under Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-8 equals or exceeds the maximum benefit available under the health FSA for the year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If the conditions in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; are satisfied for a plan year, then the health FSA is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available for any subsequent plan year to any qualified beneficiary who experiences a qualifying event during that plan year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If the conditions in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; are satisfied for a plan year, the health FSA is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available for that plan year to any qualified beneficiary who experiences a qualifying event during that plan year unless, as of the date of the qualifying event, the qualified beneficiary can become entitled to receive during the remainder of the plan year a benefit that exceeds the maximum amount that the health FSA is permitted to require to be paid for COBRA continuation coverage for the remainder of the plan year. In determining the amount of the benefit that a qualified beneficiary can become entitled to receive during the remainder of the plan year, the health FSA may deduct from the maximum benefit available to that qualified beneficiary for the year (based on the election made under the health FSA for that qualified beneficiary before the date of the qualifying event) any reimbursable claims submitted to the health FSA for that plan year before the date of the qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The rules of paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this Q&A-8; are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a group health plan providing major medical benefits and a group health plan that is a health FSA, and the plan year for each plan is the calendar year. Both the plan providing major medical benefits and the health FSA are subject to COBRA. Under the health FSA, during an open season before the beginning of each calendar year, employees can elect to reduce their compensation during the upcoming year by up to $1200 per year and have that same amount contributed to a health flexible spending account. The employer contributes an additional amount to the account equal to the employee's salary reduction election for the year. Thus, the maximum amount available to an employee under the health FSA for a year is two times the amount of the employee's salary reduction election for the year. This amount may be paid to the employee during the year as reimbursement for health expenses not covered by the employer's major medical plan (such as deductibles, copayments, prescription drugs, or eyeglasses). The employer determined, in accordance with section 4980B(f)(4), that a reasonable estimate of the cost of providing coverage for similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries for 2002 under this health FSA is equal to two times their salary reduction election for 2002 and, thus, that two times the salary reduction election is the applicable premium for 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the employer provides major medical benefits under another group health plan, and because the maximum benefit that any employee can receive under the health FSA is not greater than two times the employee's salary reduction election for the plan year, benefits under this health FSA are excepted benefits within the meaning of sections 9831 and 9832. Thus, the first condition of paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; is satisfied for the year. The maximum amount that a plan can require to be paid for coverage (outside of coverage required to be made available due to a disability extension) under Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-8 is 102 percent of the applicable premium. Thus, the maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for coverage for the 2002 plan year is 2.04 times the employee's salary reduction election for the plan year. Because the maximum benefit available under the health FSA is 2.0 times the employee's salary reduction election for the year, the maximum benefit available under the health FSA for the year is less than the maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for coverage for

the year. Thus, the second condition in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; is also satisfied for the 2002 plan year. Because both conditions in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; are satisfied for 2002, with respect to any qualifying event occurring in 2002, the health FSA is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available for any year after 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Whether the health FSA is obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available in 2002 to a qualified beneficiary with respect to a qualifying event that occurs in 2002 depends upon the maximum benefit that would be available to the qualified beneficiary under COBRA continuation coverage for that plan year. Case 1: Employee B has elected to reduce B's salary by $1200 for 2002. Thus, the maximum benefit that B can become entitled to receive under the health FSA during the entire year is $2400. B experiences a qualifying event that is the termination of B's employment on May 31, 2002. As of that date, B had submitted $300 of reimbursable expenses under the health FSA. Thus, the maximum benefit that B could become entitled to receive for the remainder of 2002 is $2100. The maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for COBRA continuation coverage for the remainder of 2002 is 102 percent times \1/12\ of the applicable premium for 2002 times the number of months remaining in 2002 after the date of the qualifying event. In B's case, the maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for COBRA continuation coverage for 2002 is 2.04 times $1200, or $2448. One-twelfth of $2448 is $204. Because seven months remain in the plan year, the maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for B's coverage for the remainder of the year is seven times $204, or $1428. Because $1428 is less than the maximum benefit that B could become entitled to receive for the remainder of the year ($2100), the health FSA is required to make COBRA continuation coverage available to B for the remainder of 2002 (but not for any subsequent year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Case 2: The facts are the same as in Case 1 except that B had submitted $1000 of reimbursable expenses as of the date of the qualifying event. In that case, the maximum benefit available to B for the remainder of the year would be $1400 instead of $2100. Because the maximum amount that the health FSA can require to be paid for B's coverage is $1428, and because the $1400 maximum benefit for the remainder of the year does not exceed $1428, the health FSA is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available to B in 2002 (or any later year). (Of course, the administrator of the health FSA is permitted to make COBRA continuation coverage available to every qualified beneficiary in the year that the qualified beneficiary's qualifying event occurs in order to avoid having to determine the maximum benefit available for each qualified beneficiary for the remainder of the plan year.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: What is the effect of a group health plan's failure to comply with the requirements of section 4980B(f)?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: Under section 4980B(a), if a group health plan subject to COBRA fails to comply with section 4980B(f), an excise tax is imposed. Moreover, non-tax remedies may be available if the plan fails to comply with the parallel requirements in ERISA, which are administered by the Department of Labor.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: Who is liable for the excise tax if a group health plan fails to comply with the requirements of section 4980B(f)?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: (a) In general, the excise tax is imposed on the employer maintaining the plan, except that in the case of a multiemployer plan (see Q&A-3; of this section for a definition of multiemployer plan) the excise tax is imposed on the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In certain circumstances, the excise tax is also imposed on a person involved with the provision of benefits under the plan (other than in the capacity of an employee), such as an insurer providing benefits under the plan or a third party administrator administering claims under the plan. In general, such a person will be liable for the excise tax if the person assumes, under a legally enforceable written agreement, the responsibility for performing the act to which the failure to comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements relates. Such a person will be liable for the excise tax notwithstanding the absence of a written agreement assuming responsibility for complying with COBRA if the person provides coverage under the plan to a similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiary (see Q&A-3; of Sec. 54.4980B-3 for a definition of similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries) and the employer or plan administrator submits a written request to the person to provide to a qualified beneficiary the same coverage that the person provides to the similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiary. If the person providing coverage under the plan to a similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiary is the plan administrator and the qualifying event is a divorce or legal separation or

a dependent child's ceasing to be covered under the generally applicable requirements of the plan, the plan administrator will also be liable for the excise tax if the qualified beneficiary submits a written request for coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: If a person is liable for the excise tax under section 4980B, what form must the person file and what is the due date for the filing and payment of the excise tax?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: (a) In general.

Sec. 54.4980B-3  Qualified beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">The determination of who is a qualified beneficiary, an employee, or a covered employee, and of who are the similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries is addressed in the following questions-and-answers:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: Who is a qualified beneficiary?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a)(1) Except as set forth in paragraphs (c) through (f) of this Q&A-1;, a qualified beneficiary is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any individual who, on the day before a qualifying event, is covered under a group health plan by virtue of being on that day either a covered employee, the spouse of a covered employee, or a dependent child of the covered employee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a qualifying event that is the bankruptcy of the employer, a covered employee who had retired on or before the date of substantial elimination of group health plan coverage is also a qualified beneficiary, as is any spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child of such a covered employee if, on the day before the bankruptcy qualifying event, the spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child is a beneficiary under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In general, an individual (other than a child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage) who is not covered under a plan on the day before the qualifying event cannot be a qualified beneficiary with respect to that qualifying event, and the reason for the individual's lack of actual coverage (such as the individual's having declined participation in the plan or failed to satisfy the plan's conditions for participation) is not relevant for this purpose. However, if the individual is denied or not offered coverage under a plan under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101-12213, the special enrollment rules of section 9801, or the requirements of section 9802 prohibiting discrimination in eligibility to enroll in a group health plan based on health status), then, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, the individual will be considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Paragraph (b) of this Q&A-1; describes how certain family members are not qualified beneficiaries even if they become covered under the plan; paragraphs (c), (d), and (e) of this Q&A-1; place limits on the general rules of this paragraph (a) concerning who is a qualified beneficiary; paragraph (f) of this Q&A-1; provides when an individual who has been a qualified beneficiary ceases to be a qualified beneficiary; paragraph (g) of this Q&A-1; defines placed for adoption; and paragraph (h) of this Q&A-1; contains examples.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In contrast to a child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, an individual who marries any qualified beneficiary on or after the date of the qualifying event and a newborn or adopted

child (other than one born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee) are not qualified beneficiaries by virtue of the marriage, birth, or placement for adoption or by virtue of the individual's status as the spouse or the child's status as a dependent of the qualified beneficiary. These new family members do not themselves become qualified beneficiaries even if they become covered under the plan. (For situations in which a plan is required to make coverage available to new family members of a qualified beneficiary who is receiving COBRA continuation coverage, see Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-5, paragraph (c) in Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-5, and section 9801(f)(2).)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An individual is not a qualified beneficiary if, on the day before the qualifying event referred to in paragraph (a) of this Q&A-1;, the individual is covered under the group health plan by reason of another individual's election of COBRA continuation coverage and is not already a qualified beneficiary by reason of a prior qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> A covered employee can be a qualified beneficiary only in connection with a qualifying event that is the termination, or reduction of hours, of the covered employee's employment, or that is the bankruptcy of the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> An individual is not a qualified beneficiary if the individual's status as a covered employee is attributable to a period in which the individual was a nonresident alien who received from the individual's employer no earned income (within the meaning of section 911(d)(2)) that constituted income from sources within the United States (within the meaning of section 861(a)(3)). If, pursuant to the preceding sentence, an individual is not a qualified beneficiary, then a spouse or dependent child of the individual is not considered a qualified beneficiary by virtue of the relationship to the individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> A qualified beneficiary who does not elect COBRA continuation coverage in connection with a qualifying event ceases to be a qualified beneficiary at the end of the election period (see Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-6). Thus, for example, if such a former qualified beneficiary is later added to a covered employee's coverage (e.g., during an open enrollment period) and then another qualifying event occurs with respect to the covered employee, the former qualified beneficiary does not become a qualified beneficiary by reason of the second qualifying event. If a covered employee who is a qualified beneficiary does not elect COBRA continuation coverage during the election period, then any child born to or placed for adoption with the covered employee on or after the date of the qualifying event is not a qualified beneficiary. Once a plan's obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to an individual who has been a qualified beneficiary ceases under the rules of Sec. 54.4980B-7, the individual ceases to be a qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, placement for adoption or being placed for adoption means the assumption and retention by the covered employee of a legal obligation for total or partial support of a child in anticipation of the adoption of the child. The child's placement for adoption with the covered employee terminates upon the termination of the legal obligation for total or partial support. A child who is immediately adopted by the covered employee without a preceding placement for adoption is considered to be placed for adoption on the date of the adoption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> The rules of this Q&A-1; are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> B is a single employee who voluntarily terminates employment and elects COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan. To comply with the requirements of section 9801(f), the plan permits a covered employee who marries to have her or his spouse covered under the plan. One month after electing COBRA continuation coverage, B marries and chooses to have B's spouse covered under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B's spouse is not a qualified beneficiary. Thus, if B dies during the period of COBRA continuation coverage, the plan does not have to offer B's surviving spouse an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> C is a married employee who terminates employment. C elects COBRA continuation coverage for C but not C's spouse, and C's spouse declines to elect such coverage. C's spouse thus ceases to be a

qualified beneficiary. At the next open enrollment period, C adds the spouse as a beneficiary under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The addition of the spouse during the open enrollment period does not make the spouse a qualified beneficiary. The plan thus will not have to offer the spouse an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage upon a later divorce from or death of C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Under the terms of a group health plan, a covered employee's child, upon attaining age 19, ceases to be a dependent eligible for coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At that time, the child must be offered an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage. If the child elects COBRA continuation coverage, the child marries during the period of the COBRA continuation coverage, and the child's spouse becomes covered under the group health plan, the child's spouse is not a qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D is a single employee who, upon retirement, is given the opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage but declines it in favor of an alternative offer of 12 months of employer-paid retiree health benefits. At the end of the election period, D ceases to be a qualified beneficiary and will not have to be given another opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage (at the end of those 12 months or at any other time). D marries E during the period of retiree health coverage and, under the terms of that coverage, E becomes covered under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If a divorce from or death of D will result in E's losing coverage, E will be a qualified beneficiary because E's coverage under the plan on the day before the qualifying event (that is, the divorce or death) will have been by reason of D's acceptance of 12 months of employer-paid coverage after the prior qualifying event (D's retirement) rather than by reason of an election of COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that, under the terms of the plan, the divorce or death does not cause E to lose coverage so that E continues to be covered for the balance of the original 12-month period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> E does not have to be allowed to elect COBRA continuation coverage because the loss of coverage at the end of the 12-month period is not caused by the divorce or death, and thus the divorce or death does not constitute a qualifying event. See Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Who is an employee and who is a covered employee?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a)(1) For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 (except for purposes of Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-2, relating to the exception from COBRA for plans maintained by an employer with fewer than 20 employees), an employee is any individual who is eligible to be covered under a group health plan by virtue of the performance of services for the employer maintaining the plan or by virtue of membership in the employee organization maintaining the plan. Thus, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 (except for purposes of Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-2), the following individuals are employees if their relationship to the employer maintaining the plan makes them eligible to be covered under the plan--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Self-employed individuals (within the meaning of section 401(c)(1));</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Independent contractors (and their employees and independent contractors); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Directors (in the case of a corporation).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Similarly, whenever reference is made in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 (except in Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-2) to an employment relationship (such as by referring to the termination of employment of an employee or to an employee's being employed by an employer), the reference includes the relationship of those individuals who are employees within the meaning of this paragraph (a). See paragraph (c) in Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-2 for a narrower meaning of employee solely for purposes of Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, a covered employee is any individual who is (or was) provided coverage under a group health plan (other than a plan that is excepted from COBRA on the date of the qualifying event; see Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-2) by virtue of being or having been an employee. For example, a retiree or former employee who is covered by a group health plan is a covered employee if the coverage results in whole or in part from her or his previous employment. An employee (or former employee) who is merely eligible for coverage under a group health plan is generally not a covered employee if the employee (or former employee) is not actually covered under the plan. In general, the reason for the employee's (or former employee's) lack of actual coverage (such as having declined participation in the plan or having failed

to satisfy the plan's conditions for participation) is not relevant for this purpose. However, if the employee (or former employee) is denied or not offered coverage under circumstances in which the denial or failure to offer constitutes a violation of applicable law (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. 12101 through 12213, the special enrollment rules of section 9801, or the requirements of section 9802 prohibiting discrimination in eligibility to enroll in a group health plan based on health status), then, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, the employee (or former employee) will be considered to have had the coverage that was wrongfully denied or not offered.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Who are the similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: For purposes of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10, similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries means the group of covered employees, spouses of covered employees, or dependent children of covered employees receiving coverage under a group health plan maintained by the employer or employee organization who are receiving that coverage for a reason other than the rights provided under the COBRA continuation coverage requirements and who, based on all of the facts and circumstances, are most similarly situated to the situation of the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event.
[T.D. 8812, 64 FR 5176, Feb. 3, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8928, 66 FR 1852, Jan. 10, 2001]


Sec. 54.4980B-4  Qualifying events.</p><p class="depth0">The determination of what constitutes a qualifying event is addressed in the following questions and answers:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is a qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) A qualifying event is an event that satisfies paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q&A-1.; Paragraph (e) of this Q&A-1; further explains a reduction of hours of employment, paragraph (f) of this Q&A-1; describes the treatment of children born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, and paragraph (g) of this Q&A-1; contains examples. See Q&A-1; through Q&A-3; of Sec. 54.4980B-10 for special rules in the case of leave taken under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2601-2619).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An event satisfies this paragraph (b) if the event is any of the following--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The death of a covered employee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The termination (other than by reason of the employee's gross misconduct), or reduction of hours, of a covered employee's employment;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The divorce or legal separation of a covered employee from the employee's spouse;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A covered employee's becoming entitled to Medicare benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395-1395ggg);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A dependent child's ceasing to be a dependent child of a covered employee under the generally applicable requirements of the plan; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code with respect to an employer from whose employment a covered employee retired at any time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An event satisfies this paragraph (c) if, under the terms of the group health plan, the event causes the covered employee, or the spouse or a dependent child of the covered employee, to lose coverage under the plan. For this purpose, to lose coverage means to cease to be covered under the same terms and conditions as in effect immediately before the qualifying event. Any increase in the premium or contribution that must be paid by a covered employee (or the spouse or dependent child of a covered employee) for coverage under a group health plan that results from the occurrence of one of the events listed in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-1; is a loss of coverage. In the case of an event that is the bankruptcy of the employer, lose coverage also means any substantial elimination of coverage under the plan, occurring within 12 months before or after the date the bankruptcy proceeding commences, for a covered employee who had retired on or before the date of the substantial elimination of group health plan coverage or for any spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child of such a covered employee if, on the day before the bankruptcy qualifying event, the spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent child is a beneficiary under

the plan. For purposes of this paragraph (c), a loss of coverage need not occur immediately after the event, so long as the loss of coverage occurs before the end of the maximum coverage period (see Q&A-4; and Q&A-;6 of Sec. 54.4980B-7). However, if neither the covered employee nor the spouse or a dependent child of the covered employee loses coverage before the end of what would be the maximum coverage period, the event does not satisfy this paragraph (c). If coverage is reduced or eliminated in anticipation of an event (for example, an employer's eliminating an employee's coverage in anticipation of the termination of the employee's employment, or an employee's eliminating the coverage of the employee's spouse in anticipation of a divorce or legal separation), the reduction or elimination is disregarded in determining whether the event causes a loss of coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> An event satisfies this paragraph (d) if it occurs while the plan is subject to COBRA. Thus, an event will not satisfy this paragraph (d) if it occurs while the plan is excepted from COBRA (see Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-2). Even if the plan later becomes subject to COBRA, it is not required to make COBRA continuation coverage available to anyone whose coverage ends as a result of an event during a year in which the plan is excepted from COBRA. For example, if a group health plan is excepted from COBRA as a small-employer plan during the year 2001 (see Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-2) and an employee terminates employment on December 31, 2001, the termination is not a qualifying event and the plan is not required to permit the employee to elect COBRA continuation coverage. This is the case even if the plan ceases to be a small-employer plan as of January 1, 2002. Also, the same result will follow even if the employee is given three months of coverage beyond December 31 (that is, through March of 2002), because there will be no qualifying event as of the termination of coverage in March. However, if the employee's spouse is initially provided with the three-month coverage through March 2002, but the spouse divorces the employee before the end of the three months and loses coverage as a result of the divorce, the divorce will constitute a qualifying event during 2002 and so entitle the spouse to elect COBRA continuation coverage. See Q&A-7; of Sec. 54.4980B-7 regarding the maximum coverage period in such a case.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> A reduction of hours of a covered employee's employment occurs whenever there is a decrease in the hours that a covered employee is required to work or actually works, but only if the decrease is not accompanied by an immediate termination of employment. This is true regardless of whether the covered employee continues to perform services following the reduction of hours of employment. For example, an absence from work due to disability, a temporary layoff, or any other reason (other than due to leave that is FMLA leave; see Sec. 54.4980B-10) is a reduction of hours of a covered employee's employment if there is not an immediate termination of employment. If a group health plan measures eligibility for the coverage of employees by the number of hours worked in a given time period, such as the preceding month or quarter, and an employee covered under the plan fails to work the minimum number of hours during that time period, the failure to work the minimum number of required hours is a reduction of hours of that covered employee's employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The qualifying event of a qualified beneficiary who is a child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage is the qualifying event giving rise to the period of COBRA continuation coverage during which the child is born or placed for adoption. If a second qualifying event has occurred before the child is born or placed for adoption (such as the death of the covered employee), then the second qualifying event also applies to the newborn or adopted child. See Q&A-6; of Sec. 54.4980B-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The rules of this Q&A-1; are illustrated by the following examples, in each of which the group health plan is subject to COBRA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employee who is covered by a group health plan terminates employment (other than by reason of the employee's gross misconduct) and, beginning with

the day after the last day of employment, is given 3 months of employer-paid coverage under the same terms and conditions as before that date. At the end of the three months, the coverage terminates.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The loss of coverage at the end of the three months results from the termination of employment and, thus, the termination of employment is a qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employee who is covered by a group health plan retires (which is a termination of employment other than by reason of the employee's gross misconduct) and, upon retirement, is required to pay an increased amount for the same group health coverage that the employee had before retirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The increase in the premium or contribution required for coverage is a loss of coverage under paragraph (c) of this Q&A-1; and, thus, the retirement is a qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employee and the employee's spouse are covered under an employer's group health plan. The employee retires and is given identical coverage for life. However, the plan provides that the spousal coverage will not be continued beyond six months unless a higher premium for the spouse is paid to the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The requirement for the spouse to pay a higher premium at the end of the six months is a loss of coverage under paragraph (c) of this Q&A-1.; Thus, the retirement is a qualifying event and the spouse must be given an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> F is a covered employee who is married to G, and both are covered under a group health plan maintained by F's employer. F and G are divorced. Under the terms of the plan, the divorce causes G to lose coverage. The divorce is a qualifying event, and G elects COBRA continuation coverage, remarries during the period of COBRA continuation coverage, and G's new spouse becomes covered under the plan. (See Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-5, paragraph (c) in Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-5, and section 9801(f)(2).) G dies. Under the terms of the plan, the death causes G's new spouse to lose coverage under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> G's death is not a qualifying event because G is not a covered employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a group health plan for both active employees and retired employees (and their families). The coverage for active employees and retired employees is identical, and the employer does not require retirees to pay more for coverage than active employees. The plan does not make COBRA continuation coverage available when an employee retires (and is not required to because the retired employee has not lost coverage under the plan). The employer amends the plan to eliminate coverage for retired employees effective January 1, 2002. On that date, several retired employees (and their spouses and dependent children) have been covered under the plan since their retirement for less than the maximum coverage period that would apply to them in connection with their retirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The elimination of retiree coverage under these circumstances is a deferred loss of coverage for those retirees (and their spouses and dependent children) under paragraph (c) of this Q&A-1; and, thus, the retirement is a qualifying event. The plan must make COBRA continuation coverage available to them for the balance of the maximum coverage period that applies to them in connection with the retirement.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Are the facts surrounding a termination of employment (such as whether it was voluntary or involuntary) relevant in determining whether the termination of employment is a qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: Apart from facts constituting gross misconduct, the facts surrounding the termination or reduction of hours are irrelevant in determining whether a qualifying event has occurred. Thus, it does not matter whether the employee voluntarily terminated or was discharged. For example, a strike or a lockout is a termination or reduction of hours that constitutes a qualifying event if the strike or lockout results in a loss of coverage as described in paragraph (c) of Q&A-1; of this section. Similarly, a layoff that results in such a loss of coverage is a qualifying event.

Sec. 54.4980B-5  COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address the requirements for coverage to constitute COBRA continuation coverage:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is COBRA continuation coverage?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) If a qualifying event occurs, each qualified beneficiary (other than a qualified beneficiary for whom the qualifying event will not result in any immediate or deferred loss of coverage) must be offered an opportunity to elect to receive the group health plan coverage that is provided to similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries (ordinarily, the same coverage that the

qualified beneficiary had on the day before the qualifying event). See Q&A-3; of Sec. 54.4980B-3 for the definition of similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries. This coverage is COBRA continuation coverage. If coverage is modified for similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries, then the coverage made available to qualified beneficiaries is modified in the same way. If the continuation coverage offered differs in any way from the coverage made available to similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries, the coverage offered does not constitute COBRA continuation coverage and the group health plan is not in compliance with COBRA unless other coverage that does constitute COBRA continuation coverage is also offered. Any elimination or reduction of coverage in anticipation of an event described in paragraph (b) of Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4 is disregarded for purposes of this Q&A-1; and for purposes of any other reference in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 to coverage in effect immediately before (or on the day before) a qualifying event. COBRA continuation coverage must not be conditioned upon, or discriminate on the basis of lack of, evidence of insurability.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of a qualified beneficiary who is a child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, the child is generally entitled to elect immediately to have the same coverage that dependent children of active employees receive under the benefit packages under which the covered employee has coverage at the time of the birth or placement for adoption. Such a child would be entitled to elect coverage different from that elected by the covered employee during the next available open enrollment period under the plan. See Q&A-4; of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What deductibles apply if COBRA continuation coverage is elected?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) Qualified beneficiaries electing COBRA continuation coverage generally are subject to the same deductibles as similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries. If a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage begins before the end of a period prescribed for accumulating amounts toward deductibles, the qualified beneficiary must retain credit for expenses incurred toward those deductibles before the beginning of COBRA continuation coverage as though the qualifying event had not occurred. The specific application of this rule depends on the type of deductible, as set forth in paragraphs (b) through (d) of this Q&A-2.; Special rules are set forth in paragraph (e) of this Q&A-2;, and examples appear in paragraph (f) of this Q&A-2.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a deductible is computed separately for each individual receiving coverage under the plan, each individual's remaining deductible amount (if any) on the date COBRA continuation coverage begins is equal to that individual's remaining deductible amount immediately before that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a deductible is computed on a family basis, the remaining deductible for the family on the date that COBRA continuation coverage begins depends on the members of the family electing COBRA continuation coverage. In computing the family deductible that remains on the date COBRA continuation coverage begins, only the expenses of those family members receiving COBRA continuation coverage need be taken into account. If the qualifying event results in there being more than one family unit (for example, because of a divorce), the family deductible may be computed separately for each resulting family unit based on the members in each unit. These rules apply regardless of whether the plan provides that the family deductible is an alternative to individual deductibles or an additional requirement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Deductibles that are not described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this Q&A-2; must be treated in a manner consistent with the principles set forth in those paragraphs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> If a deductible is computed on the basis of a covered employee's compensation instead of being a fixed dollar amount and the employee remains employed during the period of COBRA continuation coverage, the plan is permitted to choose whether to apply the deductible by treating the employee's compensation as continuing without change for the duration of the COBRA continuation coverage at the level that was used to compute the deductible in

effect immediately before the COBRA continuation coverage began, or to apply the deductible by taking the employee's actual compensation into account. In applying a deductible that is computed on the basis of the covered employee's compensation instead of being a fixed dollar amount, for periods of COBRA continuation coverage in which the employee is not employed by the employer, the plan is required to compute the deductible by treating the employee's compensation as continuing without change for the duration of the COBRA continuation coverage either at the level that was used to compute the deductible in effect immediately before the COBRA continuation coverage began or at the level that was used to compute the deductible in effect immediately before the employee's employment was terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The rules of this Q&A-2; are illustrated by the following examples; in each example, deductibles under the plan are determined on a calendar year basis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan applies a separate $100 annual deductible to each individual it covers. The plan provides that the spouse and dependent children of a covered employee will lose coverage on the last day of the month after the month of the covered employee's death. A covered employee dies on June 11, 2001. The spouse and the two dependent children elect COBRA continuation coverage, which will begin on August 1, 2001. As of July 31, 2001, the spouse has incurred $80 of covered expenses, the older child has incurred no covered expenses, and the younger one has incurred $120 of covered expenses (and therefore has already satisfied the deductible).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> At the beginning of COBRA continuation coverage on August 1, the spouse has a remaining deductible of $20, the older child still has the full $100 deductible, and the younger one has no further deductible.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan applies a separate $200 annual deductible to each individual it covers, except that each family member is treated as having satisfied the individual deductible once the family has incurred $500 of covered expenses during the year. The plan provides that upon the divorce of a covered employee, coverage will end immediately for the employee's spouse and any children who do not remain in the employee's custody. A covered employee with four dependent children is divorced, the spouse obtains custody of the two oldest children, and the spouse and those children all elect COBRA continuation coverage to begin immediately. The family had accumulated $420 of covered expenses before the divorce, as follows: $70 by each parent, $200 by the oldest child, $80 by the youngest child, and none by the other two children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The resulting family consisting of the spouse and the two oldest children accumulated a total of $270 of covered expenses, and thus the remaining deductible for that family could be as high as $230 (because the plan would not have to count the incurred expenses of the covered employee and the youngest child). The remaining deductible for the resulting family consisting of the covered employee and the two youngest children is not subject to the rules of this Q&A-2; because their coverage is not COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Each year a group health plan pays 70 percent of the cost of an individual's psychotherapy after that individual's first three visits during the year. A qualified beneficiary whose election of COBRA continuation coverage takes effect beginning August 1, 2001 and who has already made two visits as of that date need only pay for one more visit before the plan must begin to pay 70 percent of the cost of the remaining visits during 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan has a $250 annual deductible per covered individual. The plan provides that if the deductible is not satisfied in a particular year, expenses incurred during October through December of that year are credited toward satisfaction of the deductible in the next year. A qualified beneficiary who has incurred covered expenses of $150 from January through September of 2001 and $40 during October elects COBRA continuation coverage beginning November 1, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The remaining deductible amount for this qualified beneficiary is $60 at the beginning of the COBRA continuation coverage. If this individual incurs covered expenses of $50 in November and December of 2001 combined (so that the $250 deductible for 2001 is not satisfied), the $90 incurred from October through December of 2001 are credited toward satisfaction of the deductible amount for 2002.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: How do a plan's limits apply to COBRA continuation coverage?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) Limits are treated in the same way as deductibles (see Q&A-;2 of this section). This rule applies both to limits on plan benefits (such as a maximum number of hospital days or dollar amount of reimbursable expenses) and limits on out-of-pocket expenses (such as a limit on copayments, a limit on deductibles plus copayments, or a catastrophic limit). This rule applies equally to annual and lifetime limits

and applies equally to limits on specific benefits and limits on benefits in the aggregate under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The rule of this Q&A-3; is illustrated by the following examples; in each example limits are determined on a calendar year basis:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan pays for a maximum of 150 days of hospital confinement per individual per year. A covered employee who has had 20 days of hospital confinement as of May 1, 2001 terminates employment and elects COBRA continuation coverage as of that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> During the remainder of the year 2001 the plan need only pay for a maximum of 130 days of hospital confinement for this individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan reimburses a maximum of $20,000 of covered expenses per family per year, and the same $20,000 limit applies to unmarried covered employees. A covered employee and spouse who have no children divorce on May 1, 2001, and the spouse elects COBRA continuation coverage as of that date. In 2001, the employee had incurred $5,000 of expenses and the spouse had incurred $8,000 before May 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The plan can limit its reimbursement of the amount of expenses incurred by the spouse on and after May 1 for the remainder of the year to $12,000 ($20,000-$8,000 = $12,000). The remaining limit for the employee is not subject to the rules of this Q&A-3; because the employee's coverage is not COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A group health plan pays for 80 percent of covered expenses after satisfaction of a $100-per-individual deductible, and the plan pays for 100 percent of covered expenses after a family has incurred out-of-pocket costs of $2,000. The plan provides that upon the divorce of a covered employee, coverage will end immediately for the employee's spouse and any children who do not remain in the employee's custody. An employee and spouse with three dependent children divorce on June 1, 2001, and one of the children remains with the employee. The spouse elects COBRA continuation coverage as of that date for the spouse and the other two children. During January through May of 2001, the spouse incurred $600 of covered expenses and each of the two children in the spouse's custody after the divorce incurred covered expenses of $1,100. This resulted in total out-of-pocket costs for these three individuals of $800 ($300 total for the three deductibles, plus $500 for 20 percent of the other $2,500 in incurred expenses [$600 + $1,100 + $1,100 = $2,800; $2,800-$300 = $2,500]).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For the remainder of 2001, the resulting family consisting of the spouse and two children has an out-of-pocket limit of $1,200 ($2,000-$800 = $1,200) . The remaining out-of-pocket limit for the resulting family consisting of the employee and one child is not subject to the rules of this Q&A-3; because their coverage is not COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Can a qualified beneficiary who elects COBRA continuation coverage ever change from the coverage received by that individual immediately before the qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) In general, a qualified beneficiary need only be given an opportunity to continue the coverage that she or he was receiving immediately before the qualifying event. This is true regardless of whether the coverage received by the qualified beneficiary before the qualifying event ceases to be of value to the qualified beneficiary, such as in the case of a qualified beneficiary covered under a region-specific health maintenance organization (HMO) who leaves the HMO's service region. The only situations in which a qualified beneficiary must be allowed to change from the coverage received immediately before the qualifying event are as set forth in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this Q&A-4; and in Q&A-1; of this section (regarding changes to or elimination of the coverage provided to similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If a qualified beneficiary participates in a region-specific benefit package (such as an HMO or an on-site clinic) that will not service her or his health needs in the area to which she or he is relocating (regardless of the reason for the relocation), the qualified beneficiary must be given, within a reasonable period after requesting other coverage, an opportunity to elect alternative coverage that the employer or employee organization makes available to active employees. If the employer or employee organization makes group health plan coverage available to similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries that can be extended in the area to which the qualified beneficiary is relocating, then that coverage is the alternative coverage that must be made available to the relocating qualified beneficiary. If the employer or employee organization does not make group health plan coverage available to similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries that can be extended in the

area to which the qualified beneficiary is relocating but makes coverage available to other employees that can be extended in that area, then the coverage made available to those other employees must be made available to the relocating qualified beneficiary. The effective date of the alternative coverage must be not later than the date of the qualified beneficiary's relocation, or, if later, the first day of the month following the month in which the qualified beneficiary requests the alternative coverage. However, the employer or employee organization is not required to make any other coverage available to the relocating qualified beneficiary if the only coverage the employer or employee organization makes available to active employees is not available in the area to which the qualified beneficiary relocates (because all such coverage is region-specific and does not service individuals in that area).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If an employer or employee organization makes an open enrollment period available to similarly situated active employees with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred, the same open enrollment period rights must be made available to each qualified beneficiary receiving COBRA continuation coverage. An open enrollment period means a period during which an employee covered under a plan can choose to be covered under another group health plan or under another benefit package within the same plan, or to add or eliminate coverage of family members.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rules of this Q&A-4; are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> E is an employee who works for an employer that maintains several group health plans. Under the terms of the plans, if an employee chooses to cover any family members under a plan, all family members must be covered by the same plan and that plan must be the same as the plan covering the employee. Immediately before E's termination of employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct), E is covered along with E's spouse and children by a plan. The coverage under that plan will end as a result of the termination of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon E's termination of employment, each of the four family members is a qualified beneficiary. Even though the employer maintains various other plans and options, it is not necessary for the qualified beneficiaries to be allowed to switch to a new plan when E terminates employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> COBRA continuation coverage is elected for each of the four family members. Three months after E's termination of employment there is an open enrollment period during which similarly situated active employees are offered an opportunity to choose to be covered under a new plan or to add or eliminate family coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> During the open enrollment period, each of the four qualified beneficiaries must be offered the opportunity to switch to another plan (as though each qualified beneficiary were an individual employee). For example, each member of E's family could choose coverage under a separate plan, even though the family members of employed individuals could not choose coverage under separate plans. Of course, if each family member chooses COBRA continuation coverage under a separate plan, the plan can require payment for each family member that is based on the applicable premium for individual coverage under that separate plan. See Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that E's family members are not covered under E's group health plan when E terminates employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Although the family members do not have to be given an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage, E must be allowed to add them to E's COBRA continuation coverage during the open enrollment period. This is true even though the family members are not, and cannot become, qualified beneficiaries (see Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-3).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Aside from open enrollment periods, can a qualified beneficiary who has elected COBRA continuation coverage choose to cover individuals (such as newborn children, adopted children, or new spouses) who join the qualified beneficiary's family on or after the date of the qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) Yes. Under section 9801, employees eligible to participate in a group health plan (whether or not participating), as well as former employees participating in a plan (referred to in those rules as participants), are entitled to special enrollment rights for certain family members upon the loss of other group health plan coverage or upon the acquisition by the employee or participant of a new spouse or of a new dependent through birth, adoption, or placement for adoption, if certain requirements are satisfied. Employees not participating in the plan also can obtain rights for self-enrollment under

those rules. Once a qualified beneficiary is receiving COBRA continuation coverage (that is, has timely elected and made timely payment for COBRA continuation coverage), the qualified beneficiary has the same right to enroll family members under those special enrollment rules as if the qualified beneficiary were an employee or participant within the meaning of those rules. However, neither a qualified beneficiary who is not receiving COBRA continuation coverage nor a former qualified beneficiary has any special enrollment rights under those rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In addition to the special enrollment rights described in paragraph (a) of this Q&A-5;, if the plan covering the qualified beneficiary provides that new family members of active employees can become covered (either automatically or upon an appropriate election) before the next open enrollment period, then the same right must be extended to the new family members of a qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If the addition of a new family member will result in a higher applicable premium (for example, if the qualified beneficiary was previously receiving COBRA continuation coverage as an individual, or if the applicable premium for family coverage depends on family size), the plan can require the payment of a correspondingly higher amount for the COBRA continuation coverage. See Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The right to add new family members under this Q&A-5; is in addition to the rights that newborn and adopted children of covered employees may have as qualified beneficiaries; see Q&A-1; in Sec. 54.4980B-3.
[T.D. 8812, 64 FR 5180, Feb. 3, 1999, as amended by T.D. 8928, 66 FR 1852, Jan. 10, 2001]


Sec. 54.4980B-6  Electing COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address the manner in which COBRA continuation coverage is elected:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What is the election period and how long must it last?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) A group health plan can condition the availability of COBRA continuation coverage upon the timely election of such coverage. An election of COBRA continuation coverage is a timely election if it is made during the election period. The election period must begin not later than the date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event. (See paragraph (c) of Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4 for the meaning of lose coverage.) The election period must not end before the date that is 60 days after the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date notice is provided to the qualified beneficiary of her or his right to elect COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> An election is considered to be made on the date it is sent to the plan administrator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The rules of this Q&A-1; are illustrated by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An unmarried employee without children who is receiving employer-paid coverage under a group health plan voluntarily terminates employment on June 1, 2001. The employee is not disabled at the time of the termination of employment nor at any time thereafter, and the plan does not provide for the extension of the required periods (as is permitted under paragraph (b) of Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-7).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Case 1: If the plan provides that the employer-paid coverage ends immediately upon the termination of employment, the election period must begin not later than June 1, 2001, and must not end earlier than July 31, 2001. If notice of the right to elect COBRA continuation coverage is not provided to the employee until June 15, 2001, the election period must not end earlier than August 14, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Case 2: If the plan provides that the employer-paid coverage does not end until 6 months after the termination of employment, the employee does not lose coverage until December 1, 2001. The election period can therefore begin as late as December 1, 2001, and must not end before January 30, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Case 3: If employer-paid coverage for 6 months after the termination of employment is offered only to those qualified beneficiaries who waive COBRA continuation coverage, the employee loses coverage on June 1, 2001, so the election period is the same as in Case 1. The difference between Case 2 and Case 3 is that in Case 2 the employee can receive 6 months of employer-paid coverage and then elect to pay for up to an additional 12 months of COBRA continuation coverage, while in Case 3 the employee must choose between 6 months of employer-paid coverage and paying for up to 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage. In all three cases, COBRA continuation coverage

need not be provided for more than 18 months after the termination of employment (see Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-7), and in certain circumstances might be provided for a shorter period (see Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-7).</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: Is a covered employee or qualified beneficiary responsible for informing the plan administrator of the occurrence of a qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) In general, the employer or plan administrator must determine when a qualifying event has occurred. However, each covered employee or qualified beneficiary is responsible for notifying the plan administrator of the occurrence of a qualifying event that is either a dependent child's ceasing to be a dependent child under the generally applicable requirements of the plan or a divorce or legal separation of a covered employee. The group health plan is not required to offer the qualified beneficiary an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage if the notice is not provided to the plan administrator within 60 days after the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The date of the qualifying event; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The date the qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of the qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For purposes of this Q&A-2;, if more than one qualified beneficiary would lose coverage on account of a divorce or legal separation of a covered employee, a timely notice of the divorce or legal separation that is provided by the covered employee or any one of those qualified beneficiaries will be sufficient to preserve the election rights of all of the qualified beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: During the election period and before the qualified beneficiary has made an election, must coverage be provided?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) In general, each qualified beneficiary has until 60 days after the later of the date the qualifying event would cause her or him to lose coverage or the date notice is provided to the qualified beneficiary of her or his right to elect COBRA continuation coverage to decide whether to elect COBRA continuation coverage. If the election is made during that period, coverage must be provided from the date that coverage would otherwise have been lost (but see Q&A-4; of this section). This can be accomplished as described in paragraph (b) or (c) of this Q&A-3.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> In the case of an indemnity or reimbursement arrangement, the employer or employee organization can provide for plan coverage during the election period or, if the plan allows retroactive reinstatement, the employer or employee organization can terminate the coverage of the qualified beneficiary and reinstate her or him when the election (and, if applicable, payment for the coverage) is made. Claims incurred by a qualified beneficiary during the election period do not have to be paid before the election (and, if applicable, payment for the coverage) is made. If a provider of health care (such as a physician, hospital, or pharmacy) contacts the plan to confirm coverage of a qualified beneficiary during the election period, the plan must give a complete response to the health care provider about the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage rights during the election period. For example, if the plan provides coverage during the election period but cancels coverage retroactively if COBRA continuation coverage is not elected, then the plan must inform a provider that a qualified beneficiary for whom coverage has not been elected is covered but that the coverage is subject to retroactive termination. Similarly, if the plan cancels coverage but then retroactively reinstates it once COBRA continuation coverage is elected, then the plan must inform the provider that the qualified beneficiary currently does not have coverage but will have coverage retroactively to the date coverage was lost if COBRA continuation coverage is elected. (See paragraph (c) of Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-8 for similar rules that a plan must follow in confirming coverage during a period when the plan has not received payment but that is still within the grace period for a qualified beneficiary for whom COBRA continuation coverage has been elected.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> In the case of a group health plan that provides health services (such as a health maintenance organization or a walk-in clinic), the plan can

require with respect to a qualified beneficiary who has not elected and paid for COBRA continuation coverage that the qualified beneficiary choose between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a group health plan that provides health services (such as a health maintenance organization or a walk-in clinic), the plan can

require with respect to a qualified beneficiary who has not elected and paid for COBRA continuation coverage that the qualified beneficiary choose between--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Electing and paying for the coverage; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paying the reasonable and customary charge for the plan's services, but only if a qualified beneficiary who chooses to pay for the services will be reimbursed for that payment within 30 days after the election of COBRA continuation coverage (and, if applicable, the payment of any balance due for the coverage).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the alternative, the plan can provide continued coverage and treat the qualified beneficiary's use of the facility as a constructive election. In such a case, the qualified beneficiary is obligated to pay any applicable charge for the coverage, but only if the qualified beneficiary is informed that use of the facility will be a constructive election before using the facility.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Is a waiver before the end of the election period effective to end a qualified beneficiary's election rights?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: If, during the election period, a qualified beneficiary waives COBRA continuation coverage, the waiver can be revoked at any time before the end of the election period. Revocation of the waiver is an election of COBRA continuation coverage. However, if a waiver of COBRA continuation coverage is later revoked, coverage need not be provided retroactively (that is, from the date of the loss of coverage until the waiver is revoked). Waivers and revocations of waivers are considered made on the date they are sent to the employer, employee organization, or plan administrator, as applicable.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Can an employer or employee organization withhold money or other benefits owed to a qualified beneficiary until the qualified beneficiary either waives COBRA continuation coverage, elects and pays for such coverage, or allows the election period to expire?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. An employer, and an employee organization, must not withhold anything to which a qualified beneficiary is otherwise entitled (by operation of law or other agreement) in order to compel payment for COBRA continuation coverage or to coerce the qualified beneficiary to give up rights to COBRA continuation coverage (including the right to use the full election period to decide whether to elect such coverage). Such a withholding constitutes a failure to comply with the COBRA continuation coverage requirements. Furthermore, any purported waiver obtained by means of such a withholding is invalid.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Can each qualified beneficiary make an independent election under COBRA?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: Yes. Each qualified beneficiary (including a child who is born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage) must be offered the opportunity to make an independent election to receive COBRA continuation coverage. If the plan allows similarly situated active employees with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred to choose among several options during an open enrollment period (for example, to switch to another group health plan or to another benefit package under the same group health plan), then each qualified beneficiary must also be offered an independent election to choose during an open enrollment period among the options made available to similarly situated active employees with respect to whom a qualifying event has not occurred. If a qualified beneficiary who is either a covered employee or the spouse of a covered employee elects COBRA continuation coverage and the election does not specify whether the election is for self-only coverage, the election is deemed to include an election of COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of all other qualified beneficiaries with respect to that qualifying event. An election on behalf of a minor child can be made by the child's parent or legal guardian. An election on behalf of a qualified beneficiary who is incapacitated or dies can be made by the legal representative of the qualified beneficiary or the qualified beneficiary's estate, as determined under applicable state law, or by the spouse of the qualified beneficiary. (See also Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-7 relating to the independent right of each qualified beneficiary with respect to the same qualifying event to receive COBRA continuation coverage

during the disability extension.) The rules of this Q&A-6; are illustrated by the following examples; in each example each group health plan is subject to COBRA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee H and H's spouse are covered under a group health plan immediately before H's termination of employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct). Coverage under the plan will end as a result of the termination of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon H's termination of employment, both H and H's spouse are qualified beneficiaries and each must be allowed to elect COBRA continuation coverage. Thus, H might elect COBRA continuation coverage while the spouse declines to elect such coverage, or H might elect COBRA continuation coverage for both of them. In contrast, H cannot decline COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of H's spouse. Thus, if H does not elect COBRA continuation coverage on behalf of the spouse, the spouse must still be allowed to elect COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a group health plan under which all employees receive employer-paid coverage. Employees can arrange to cover their families by paying an additional amount. The employer also maintains a cafeteria plan, under which one of the options is to pay part or all of the employee share of the cost for family coverage under the group health plan. Thus, an employee might pay for family coverage under the group health plan partly with before-tax dollars and partly with after-tax dollars.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If an employee's family is receiving coverage under the group health plan when a qualifying event occurs, each of the qualified beneficiaries must be offered an opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage, regardless of how that qualified beneficiary's coverage was paid for before the qualifying event.

Sec. 54.4980B-7  Duration of COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address the duration of COBRA continuation coverage:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: How long must COBRA continuation coverage be made available to a qualified beneficiary?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Except for an interruption of coverage in connection with a waiver, as described in Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-6, COBRA continuation coverage that has been elected for a qualified beneficiary must extend for at least the period beginning on the date of the qualifying event and ending not before the earliest of the following dates--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The last day of the maximum coverage period (see Q&A-4; of this section);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The first day for which timely payment is not made to the plan with respect to the qualified beneficiary (see Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-8);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The date upon which the employer or employee organization ceases to provide any group health plan (including successor plans) to any employee;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> The date, after the date of the election, upon which the qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under any other group health plan, as described in Q&A-2; of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> The date, after the date of the election, upon which the qualified beneficiary first becomes entitled to Medicare benefits, as described in Q&A-3; of this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> In the case of a qualified beneficiary entitled to a disability extension (see Q&A-5; of this section), the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Either 29 months after the date of the qualifying event, or the first day of the month that is more than 30 days after the date of a final determination under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401-433 or 1381-1385) that the disabled qualified beneficiary whose disability resulted in the qualified beneficiary's being entitled to the disability extension is no longer disabled, whichever is earlier; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The end of the maximum coverage period that applies to the qualified beneficiary without regard to the disability extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> However, a group health plan can terminate for cause the coverage of a qualified beneficiary receiving COBRA continuation coverage on the same basis that the plan terminates for cause the coverage of similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries. For example, if a group health plan terminates the coverage of active employees for the submission of a fraudulent claim, then the coverage of a qualified beneficiary can also be terminated for the submission of a fraudulent claim. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, the coverage of a qualified

beneficiary can be terminated for failure to make timely payment to the plan only if payment is not timely under the rules of Q&A-5; in Sec. 54.4980B-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of an individual who is not a qualified beneficiary and who is receiving coverage under a group health plan solely because of the individual's relationship to a qualified beneficiary, if the plan's obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the qualified beneficiary ceases under this section, the plan is not obligated to make coverage available to the individual who is not a qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: When may a plan terminate a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage due to coverage under another group health plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) If a qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under another group health plan (including for this purpose any group health plan of a governmental employer or employee organization) after the date on which COBRA continuation coverage is elected for the qualified beneficiary and the other coverage satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this Q&A-2;, then the plan may terminate the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage upon the date on which the qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under the other group health plan (even if the other coverage is less valuable to the qualified beneficiary). By contrast, if a qualified beneficiary first becomes covered under another group health plan on or before the date on which COBRA continuation coverage is elected, then the other coverage cannot be a basis for terminating the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (b) is satisfied if the qualified beneficiary is actually covered, rather than merely eligible to be covered, under the other group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (c) is satisfied if the other group health plan is a plan that is not maintained by the employer or employee organization that maintains the plan under which COBRA continuation coverage must otherwise be made available.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (d) is satisfied if the other group health plan does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of the qualified beneficiary (other than such an exclusion or limitation that does not apply to, or is satisfied by, the qualified beneficiary by reason of the provisions in section 9801 (relating to limitations on preexisting condition exclusion periods in group health plans)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> The rules of this Q&A-2; are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X maintains a group health plan subject to COBRA. C is an employee covered under the plan. C is also covered under a group health plan maintained by Employer Y, the employer of C's spouse. C terminates employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct), and the termination of employment causes C to lose coverage under X's plan (and, thus, is a qualifying event). C elects to receive COBRA continuation coverage under X's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, X's plan cannot terminate C's COBRA continuation coverage on the basis of C's coverage under Y's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer W maintains a group health plan subject to COBRA. D is an employee covered under the plan. D terminates employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct), and the termination of employment causes D to lose coverage under W's plan (and, thus, is a qualifying event). D elects to receive COBRA continuation coverage under W's plan. Later D becomes employed by Employer V and is covered under V's group health plan. D's coverage under V's plan is not subject to any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of D.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, W can terminate D's COBRA continuation coverage on the date D becomes covered under V's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that D becomes employed by V and becomes covered under V's group health plan before D elects COBRA continuation coverage under W's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Because the termination of employment is a qualifying event, D must be offered COBRA continuation coverage under W's plan, and W is not permitted to terminate D's COBRA continuation coverage on account of D's coverage under V's plan because D first became covered under V's plan before COBRA continuation coverage was elected for D.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: When may a plan terminate a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage due to the qualified

beneficiary's entitlement to Medicare benefits?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) If a qualified beneficiary first becomes entitled to Medicare benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395-1395ggg) after the date on which COBRA continuation coverage is elected for the qualified beneficiary, then the plan may terminate the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage upon the date on which the qualified beneficiary becomes so entitled. By contrast, if a qualified beneficiary first becomes entitled to Medicare benefits on or before the date that COBRA continuation coverage is elected, then the qualified beneficiary's entitlement to Medicare benefits cannot be a basis for terminating the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A qualified beneficiary becomes entitled to Medicare benefits upon the effective date of enrollment in either part A or B, whichever occurs earlier. Thus, merely being eligible to enroll in Medicare does not constitute being entitled to Medicare benefits.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: When does the maximum coverage period end?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Q&A-4;, the maximum coverage period ends 36 months after the qualifying event. The maximum coverage period for a qualified beneficiary who is a child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage is the maximum coverage period for the qualifying event giving rise to the period of COBRA continuation coverage during which the child was born or placed for adoption. Paragraph (b) of this Q&A-4; describes the starting point from which the end of the maximum coverage period is measured. The date that the maximum coverage period ends is described in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-4; in a case where the qualifying event is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, in paragraph (d) of this Q&A-4; in a case where a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395-1395ggg) before experiencing a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, and in paragraph (e) of this Q&A-4; in the case of a qualifying event that is the bankruptcy of the employer. See Q&A-8; of Sec. 54.4980B-2 for limitations that apply to certain health flexible spending arrangements. See also Q&A-6; of this section in the case of multiple qualifying events. Nothing in Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 prohibits a group health plan from providing coverage that continues beyond the end of the maximum coverage period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> The end of the maximum coverage period is measured from the date of the qualifying event even if the qualifying event does not result in a loss of coverage under the plan until a later date.

A plan provides for the extension of the required periods if it provides both--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> That the 30-day notice period (during which the employer is required to notify the plan administrator of the occurrence of certain qualifying events such as the death of the covered employee or the termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment of the covered employee) begins on the date of the loss of coverage rather than on the date of the qualifying event; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> That the end of the maximum coverage period is measured from the date of the loss of coverage rather than from the date of the qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In the case of a plan that provides for the extension of the required periods, whenever the rules of Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10 refer to the measurement of a period from the date of the qualifying event, those rules apply in such a case by measuring the period instead from the date of the loss of coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period ends 18 months after the qualifying event if there is no disability extension, and 29 months after the qualifying event if there is a disability extension. See

Q&A-5; of this section for rules to determine if there is a disability extension. If there is a disability extension and the disabled qualified beneficiary is later determined to no longer be disabled, then a plan may terminate the COBRA continuation coverage of an affected qualified beneficiary before the end of the disability extension; see paragraph (a)(6) in Q&A-1; of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)(1)</em> If a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395-1395ggg) before experiencing a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period for qualified beneficiaries other than the covered employee ends on the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> If a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395-1395ggg) before experiencing a qualifying event that is a termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment, the maximum coverage period for qualified beneficiaries other than the covered employee ends on the later of--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 36 months after the date the covered employee became entitled to Medicare benefits; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 18 months (or 29 months, if there is a disability extension) after the date of the covered employee's termination of employment or reduction of hours of employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> See paragraph (b) of Q&A-3; of this section regarding the determination of when a covered employee becomes entitled to Medicare benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> In the case of a qualifying event that is the bankruptcy of the employer, the maximum coverage period for a qualified beneficiary who is the retired covered employee ends on the date of the retired covered employee's death.

If the disability extension applies with respect to a qualifying event, it applies with respect to each qualified beneficiary entitled to COBRA continuation coverage because of that qualifying event. Thus, for example, the 29-month maximum coverage period applies to each qualified beneficiary who is not disabled as well as to the qualified beneficiary who is disabled, and it applies independently with respect to each of the qualified beneficiaries. See Q&A-1; in Sec. 54.4980B-8, which permits a plan to require payment of an increased amount during the disability extension.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (b) is satisfied if a qualifying event occurs that is a termination, or reduction of hours, of a covered employee's employment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (c) is satisfied if an individual (whether or not the covered employee) who is a qualified beneficiary in connection with the qualifying event described in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-5; is determined under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401-433 or 1381-1385) to have been disabled at any time during the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage. For this purpose, the period of the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage is measured from the date of the qualifying event described in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-5; (except that if a loss of coverage would occur at a later date in the absence of an election for COBRA continuation coverage and if the plan provides for the extension of the required periods (as described in paragraph (b) of Q&A-4; of this section) then the period of the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage is measured from the date on which the coverage would be lost). However, in the case of a qualified beneficiary who is a child born to or placed for adoption with a covered employee during a period of COBRA continuation coverage, the period of the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage is measured from the date of birth or placement for adoption. For purposes of this paragraph (c), an individual is determined to be disabled within the first 60 days of COBRA continuation coverage if the individual has been determined under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act to have been disabled before the

first day of COBRA continuation coverage and has not been determined to be no longer disabled at any time between the date of that disability determination and the first day of COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The requirement of this paragraph (d) is satisfied if any of the qualified beneficiaries affected by the qualifying event described in paragraph (b) of this Q&A-5; provides notice to the plan administrator of the disability determination on a date that is both within 60 days after the date the determination is issued and before the end of the original 18-month maximum coverage period that applies to the qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Under what circumstances can the maximum coverage period be expanded?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) The maximum coverage period can be expanded if the requirements of Q&A-5; of this section (relating to the disability extension) or paragraph (b) of this Q&A-6; are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The requirements of this paragraph (b) are satisfied if a qualifying event that gives rise to an 18-month maximum coverage period (or a 29-month maximum coverage period in the case of a disability extension) is followed, within that 18-month period (or within that 29-month period, in the case of a disability extension), by a second qualifying event (for example, a death or a divorce) that gives rise to a 36-month maximum coverage period. (Thus, a termination of employment following a qualifying event that is a reduction of hours of employment cannot be a second qualifying event that expands the maximum coverage period; the bankruptcy of an employer also cannot be a second qualifying event that expands the maximum coverage period.) In such a case, the original 18-month period (or 29-month period, in the case of a disability extension) is expanded to 36 months, but only for those individuals who were qualified beneficiaries under the group health plan in connection with the first qualifying event and who are still qualified beneficiaries at the time of the second qualifying event. No qualifying event (other than a qualifying event that is the bankruptcy of the employer) can give rise to a maximum coverage period that ends more than 36 months after the date of the first qualifying event (or more than 36 months after the date of the loss of coverage, in the case of a plan that provides for the extension of the required periods; see paragraph (b) in Q&A-4; of this section). For example, if an employee covered by a group health plan that is subject to COBRA terminates employment (for reasons other than gross misconduct) on December 31, 2000, the termination is a qualifying event giving rise to a maximum coverage period that extends for 18 months to June 30, 2002. If the employee dies after the employee and the employee's spouse and dependent children have elected COBRA continuation coverage and on or before June 30, 2002, the spouse and dependent children (except anyone among them whose COBRA continuation coverage had already ended for some other reason) will be able to receive COBRA continuation coverage through December 31, 2003. See Q&A-8;(b) of Sec. 54.4980B-2 for a special rule that applies to certain health flexible spending arrangements.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: If health coverage is provided to a qualified beneficiary after a qualifying event without regard to COBRA continuation coverage (for example, as a result of state or local law, the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (38 U.S.C. 4315), industry practice, a collective bargaining agreement, severance agreement, or plan procedure), will such alternative coverage extend the maximum coverage period?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: (a) No. The end of the maximum coverage period is measured solely as described in Q&A-4; and Q&A-6; of this section, which is generally from the date of the qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If the alternative coverage does not satisfy all the requirements for COBRA continuation coverage, or if the amount that the group health plan requires to be paid for the alternative coverage is greater than the amount required to be paid by similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries for the coverage that the qualified beneficiary can elect to receive as COBRA continuation coverage, the plan covering the qualified beneficiary immediately before the qualifying event must offer the

qualified beneficiary receiving the alternative coverage the opportunity to elect COBRA continuation coverage.

If such a conversion option is not otherwise generally available, it need not be made available to qualified beneficiaries.

Sec. 54.4980B-8  Paying for COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address paying for COBRA continuation coverage:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: Can a group health plan require payment for COBRA continuation coverage?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Yes. For any period of COBRA continuation coverage, a group health plan can require the payment of an amount that does not exceed 102 percent of the applicable premium for that period. (See paragraph (b) of this Q&A-1; for a rule permitting a plan to require payment of an increased amount due to the disability extension.) The applicable premium is defined in section 4980B(f)(4). A group health plan can terminate a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage as of the first day of any period for which timely payment is not made to the plan with respect to that qualified beneficiary (see Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-7). For the meaning of timely payment, see Q&A-5; of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A group health plan is permitted to require the payment of an amount that does not exceed 150 percent of the applicable premium for any period of COBRA continuation coverage covering a disabled qualified beneficiary (for example, whether single or family coverage) if the coverage would not be required to be made available in the absence of a disability extension. (See Q&A-5; of Sec. 54.4980B-7 for rules to determine whether a qualified beneficiary is entitled to a disability extension.) A plan is not permitted to require the payment of an amount that exceeds 102 percent of the applicable premium for any period of COBRA continuation coverage to which a qualified beneficiary is entitled without regard to the disability extension. Thus, if a qualified beneficiary entitled to a disability extension experiences a second qualifying event within the original 18-month maximum coverage period, then the plan is not permitted to require the payment of an amount that exceeds 102 percent of the applicable premium for any period of COBRA continuation coverage. By contrast, if a qualified beneficiary entitled to a disability extension experiences a second qualifying event after the end of the original 18-month maximum coverage period, then the plan may require the payment of an amount that is up to 150 percent of the applicable premium for the remainder of the period of COBRA continuation coverage (that is, from the beginning of the 19th month through the end of the 36th month) as long as the disabled qualified beneficiary is included in that coverage. The rules of this paragraph (b) are illustrated by the following examples; in each example the group health plan is subject to COBRA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> An employer maintains a group health plan. The plan determines the cost of covering individuals under the plan by reference to two categories, individual coverage and family coverage, and the applicable premium is determined for those two categories. An employee and members of the employee's family are covered under the plan. The employee experiences a qualifying event that is the termination of the employee's employment. The employee's family qualifies for the disability extension because of the disability of the employee's spouse. (Timely notice of the disability is provided to the plan administrator.) Timely payment of the amount required by the plan for COBRA continuation coverage for the family (which does not exceed 102 percent of the cost of family coverage under the plan) was made to the plan with respect to the employee's family for the first 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage, and the disabled spouse and the rest of the family continue to receive COBRA continuation coverage through the 29th month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, the plan may require payment of up to 150 percent of the applicable premium for family coverage in order for the family to receive COBRA continuation coverage from the 19th month through the 29th month. If the plan determined the cost of coverage by reference to three categories (such as employee, employee-plus-one-dependent, employee-plus-two-or-more-dependents) or more than three categories, instead of two categories, the plan could still require, from the 19th month through the 29th month of COBRA continuation coverage, the payment of 150 percent of the cost of coverage for the category of coverage that included the disabled spouse.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that only the covered employee elects and pays for the first 18 months of COBRA continuation coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Even though the employee's disabled spouse does not elect or pay for COBRA continuation coverage, the employee satisfies the requirements for the disability extension to apply with respect to the employee's qualifying event. Under these facts, the plan may not require the payment of more than 102 percent of the applicable premium for individual coverage for the entire period of the employee's COBRA continuation coverage, including the period from the 19th month through the 29th month. If COBRA continuation coverage had been elected and paid for with respect to other nondisabled members of the employee's family, then the plan could not require the payment of more than 102 percent of the applicable premium for family coverage (or for any other appropriate category of coverage that might apply to that group of qualified beneficiaries under the plan, such as employee-plus-one-dependent or employee-plus-two-or-more-dependents) for those family members to continue their coverage from the 19th month through the 29th month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A group health plan does not fail to comply with section 9802(b) (which generally prohibits an individual from being charged, on the basis of health status, a higher premium than that charged for similarly situated individuals enrolled in the plan) with respect to a qualified beneficiary entitled to the disability extension merely because the plan requires payment of an amount permitted under paragraph (b) of this Q&A-;1.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: When is the applicable premium determined and when can a group health plan increase the amount it requires to be paid for COBRA continuation coverage?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) The applicable premium for each determination period must be computed and fixed by a group health plan before the determination period begins. A determination period is any 12-month period selected by the plan, but it must be applied consistently from year to year. The determination period is a single period for any benefit package. Thus, each qualified beneficiary does not have a separate determination period beginning on the date (or anniversaries of the date) that COBRA continuation coverage begins for that qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> During a determination period, a plan can increase the amount it requires to be paid for a qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage only in the following three cases:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The plan has previously charged less than the maximum amount permitted under Q&A-1; of this section and the increased amount required to be paid does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under Q&A-1; of this section;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The increase occurs during the disability extension and the increased amount required to be paid does not exceed the maximum amount permitted under paragraph (b) of Q&A-1; of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A qualified beneficiary changes the coverage being received (see paragraph (c) of this Q&A-2; for rules on how the amount the plan requires to be

paid may or must change when a qualified beneficiary changes the coverage being received).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If a plan allows similarly situated active employees who have not experienced a qualifying event to change the coverage they are receiving, then the plan must also allow each qualified beneficiary to change the coverage being received on the same terms as the similarly situated active employees. (See Q&A-4; in Sec. 54.4980B-5.) If a qualified beneficiary changes coverage from one benefit package (or a group of benefit packages) to another benefit package (or another group of benefit packages), or adds or eliminates coverage for family members, then the following rules apply. If the change in coverage is to a benefit package, group of benefit packages, or coverage unit (such as family coverage, self-plus-one-dependent, or self-plus-two-or-more-dependents) for which the applicable premium is higher, then the plan may increase the amount that it requires to be paid for COBRA continuation coverage to an amount that does not exceed the amount permitted under Q&A-1; of this section as applied to the new coverage. If the change in coverage is to a benefit package, group of benefit packages, or coverage unit (such as individual or self-plus-one-dependent) for which the applicable premium is lower, then the plan cannot require the payment of an amount that exceeds the amount permitted under Q&A-1; of this section as applied to the new coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Must a plan allow payment for COBRA continuation coverage to be made in monthly installments?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: Yes. A group health plan must allow payment for COBRA continuation coverage to be made in monthly installments. A group health plan is permitted to also allow the alternative of payment for COBRA continuation coverage being made at other intervals (for example, weekly, quarterly, or semiannually).</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Is a plan required to allow a qualified beneficiary to choose to have the first payment for COBRA continuation coverage applied prospectively only?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: No. A plan is permitted to apply the first payment for COBRA continuation coverage to the period of coverage beginning immediately after the date on which coverage under the plan would have been lost on account of the qualifying event. Of course, if the group health plan allows a qualified beneficiary to waive COBRA continuation coverage for any period before electing to receive COBRA continuation coverage, the first payment is not applied to the period of the waiver.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What is timely payment for COBRA continuation coverage?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) Except as provided in this paragraph (a) or in paragraph (b) or (d) of this Q&A-5;, timely payment for a period of COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan means payment that is made to the plan by the date that is 30 days after the first day of that period. Payment that is made to the plan by a later date is also considered timely payment if either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Under the terms of the plan, covered employees or qualified beneficiaries are allowed until that later date to pay for their coverage for the period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Under the terms of an arrangement between the employer or employee organization and an insurance company, health maintenance organization, or other entity that provides plan benefits on the employer's or employee organization's behalf, the employer or employee organization is allowed until that later date to pay for coverage of similarly situated nonCOBRA beneficiaries for the period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this Q&A-5;, a plan cannot require payment for any period of COBRA continuation coverage for a qualified beneficiary earlier than 45 days after the date on which the election of COBRA continuation coverage is made for that qualified beneficiary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> If, after COBRA continuation coverage has been elected for a qualified beneficiary, a provider of health care (such as a physician, hospital, or pharmacy) contacts the plan to confirm coverage of a qualified beneficiary for a period for which the plan has not yet received payment, the plan must give a complete response to the health care provider about the qualified beneficiary's COBRA continuation coverage rights, if any, described in paragraphs

(a), (b), and (d) of this Q&A-5.; For example, if the plan provides coverage during the 30- and 45-day grace periods described in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q&A-5; but cancels coverage retroactively if payment is not made by the end of the applicable grace period, then the plan must inform a provider with respect to a qualified beneficiary for whom payment has not been received that the qualified beneficiary is covered but that the coverage is subject to retroactive termination if timely payment is not made. Similarly, if the plan cancels coverage if it has not received payment by the first day of a period of coverage but retroactively reinstates coverage if payment is made by the end of the grace period for that period of coverage, then the plan must inform the provider that the qualified beneficiary currently does not have coverage but will have coverage retroactively to the first date of the period if timely payment is made. (See paragraph (b) of Q&A-3; in Sec. 54.4980B-6 for similar rules that the plan must follow in confirming coverage during the election period.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> If timely payment is made to the plan in an amount that is not significantly less than the amount the plan requires to be paid for a period of coverage, then the amount paid is deemed to satisfy the plan's requirement for the amount that must be paid, unless the plan notifies the qualified beneficiary of the amount of the deficiency and grants a reasonable period of time for payment of the deficiency to be made. For this purpose, as a safe harbor, 30 days after the date the notice is provided is deemed to be a reasonable period of time. An amount is not significantly less than the amount the plan requires to be paid for a period of coverage if and only if the shortfall is no greater than the lesser of the following two amounts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Fifty dollars (or such other amount as the Commissioner may provide in a revenue ruling, notice, or other guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii) of this chapter)); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> 10 percent of the amount the plan requires to be paid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Payment is considered made on the date on which it is sent to the plan.

Sec. 54.4980B-9  Business reorganizations and employer withdrawals from multiemployer plans.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address who has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to affected qualified beneficiaries in the context of business reorganizations and employer withdrawals from multiemployer plans:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: For purposes of this section, what are a business reorganization, a stock sale, and an asset sale?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> A business reorganization is a stock sale or an asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A stock sale is a transfer of stock in a corporation that causes the corporation to become a different employer or a member of a different employer. (See Q&A-2; of Sec. 54.4980B-2, which defines employer to include all members of a controlled group of corporations.) Thus, for example, a sale or distribution of stock in a corporation that causes the corporation to cease to be a member of one controlled group of corporations, whether or not it becomes a member of another controlled group of corporations, is a stock sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> An asset sale is a transfer of substantial assets, such as a plant or division or substantially all the assets of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.414(b)-1 of this chapter apply in determining what constitutes a controlled group of corporations, and the rules of Sec. Sec. 1.414(c)-1 through 1.414(c)-5 of this chapter apply in determining what constitutes a group of trades or businesses under common control.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: In the case of a stock sale, what are the selling group, the acquired organization, and the buying group?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: In the case of a stock sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The selling group is the controlled group of corporations, or the group of trades or businesses under common control, of which a corporation ceases to be a member as a result of the stock sale;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The acquired organization is the corporation that ceases to be a member

of the selling group as a result of the stock sale; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The buying group is the controlled group of corporations, or the group of trades or businesses under common control, of which the acquired organization becomes a member as a result of the stock sale. If the acquired organization does not become a member of such a group, the buying group is the acquired organization.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: In the case of an asset sale, what are the selling group and the buying group?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: In the case of an asset sale--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The selling group is the controlled group of corporations or the group of trades or businesses under common control that includes the corporation or other trade or business that is selling the assets; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The buying group is the controlled group of corporations or the group of trades or businesses under common control that includes the corporation or other trade or business that is buying the assets.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Who is an M&A; qualified beneficiary?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) Asset sales: In the case of an asset sale, an individual is an M&A; qualified beneficiary if the individual is a qualified beneficiary whose qualifying event occurred prior to or in connection with the sale and who is, or whose qualifying event occurred in connection with, a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was associated with the assets being sold.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Stock sales: In the case of a stock sale, an individual is an M&A; qualified beneficiary if the individual is a qualified beneficiary whose qualifying event occurred prior to or in connection with the sale and who is, or whose qualifying event occurred in connection with, a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was with the acquired organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In the case of a qualified beneficiary who has experienced more than one qualifying event with respect to her or his current right to COBRA continuation coverage, the qualifying event referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Q&A-4; is the first qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: In the case of a stock sale, is the sale a qualifying event with respect to a covered employee who is employed by the acquired organization before the sale and who continues to be employed by the acquired organization after the sale, or with respect to the spouse or dependent children of such a covered employee?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. A covered employee who continues to be employed by the acquired organization after the sale does not experience a termination of employment as a result of the sale. Accordingly, the sale is not a qualifying event with respect to the covered employee, or with respect to the covered employee's spouse or dependent children, regardless of whether they are provided with group health coverage after the sale, and neither the covered employee, nor the covered employee's spouse or dependent children, become qualified beneficiaries as a result of the sale.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: In the case of an asset sale, is the sale a qualifying event with respect to a covered employee whose employment immediately before the sale was associated with the purchased assets, or with respect to the spouse or dependent children of such a covered employee who are covered under a group health plan of the selling group immediately before the sale?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) Yes, unless--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The buying group is a successor employer under paragraph (c) of Q&A-8; of this section or Q&A-2; of Sec. 54.4980B-2, and the covered employee is employed by the buying group immediately after the sale; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The covered employee (or the spouse or any dependent child of the covered employee) does not lose coverage (within the meaning of paragraph (c) in Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4) under a group health plan of the selling group after the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Unless the conditions in paragraph (a)(1) or (2) of this Q&A-6; are satisfied, such a covered employee experiences a termination of employment with the selling group as a result of the asset sale, regardless of whether the covered employee is employed by the buying group or whether the covered employee's employment is associated with the purchased assets after the

sale. Accordingly, the covered employee, and the spouse and dependent children of the covered employee who lose coverage under a plan of the selling group in connection with the sale, are M&A; qualified beneficiaries in connection with the sale.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: In a business reorganization, are the buying group and the selling group permitted to allocate by contract the responsibility to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: Yes. Nothing in this section prohibits a selling group and a buying group from allocating to one or the other of the parties in a purchase agreement the responsibility to provide the coverage required under Sec. Sec. 54.4980B-1 through 54.4980B-10. However, if and to the extent that the party assigned this responsibility under the terms of the contract fails to perform, the party who has the obligation under Q&A-8; of this section to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries continues to have that obligation.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: Which group health plan has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries in a business reorganization?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: (a) In the case of a business reorganization (whether a stock sale or an asset sale), so long as the selling group maintains a group health plan after the sale, a group health plan maintained by the selling group has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that sale. This Q&A-8; prescribes rules for cases in which the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale. Paragraph (b) of this Q&A-8; contains these rules for stock sales, and paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; contains these rules for asset sales. Neither a stock sale nor an asset sale has any effect on the COBRA continuation coverage requirements applicable to any group health plan for any period before the sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)(1)</em> In the case of a stock sale, if the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale, a group health plan maintained by the buying group has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that stock sale. A group health plan of the buying group has this obligation beginning on the later of the following two dates and continuing as long as the buying group continues to maintain a group health plan (but subject to the rules in Sec. 54.4980B-7, relating to the duration of COBRA continuation coverage)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of a stock sale, if the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale, a group health plan maintained by the buying group has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that stock sale. A group health plan of the buying group has this obligation beginning on the later of the following two dates and continuing as long as the buying group continues to maintain a group health plan (but subject to the rules in Sec. 54.4980B-7, relating to the duration of COBRA continuation coverage)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date of the stock sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The determination of whether the selling group's cessation of providing any group health plan to any employee is in connection with the stock sale is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. A group health plan of the buying group does not, as a result of the stock sale, have an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to those qualified beneficiaries of the selling group who are not M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)(1)</em> In the case of an asset sale, if the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale and if the buying group continues the business operations associated with the assets purchased from the selling group without interruption or substantial change, then the buying group is a successor employer to the selling group in connection with that asset sale. A buying group does not fail to be a successor employer in connection with an asset sale merely because the asset sale takes place in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code. If the buying group is a successor employer, a group health plan maintained by the buying group has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that asset sale. A group health plan of the buying group has this obligation beginning on the later of the following two dates and continuing as long as the buying group continues to maintain a group health

plan (but subject to the rules in Sec. 54.4980B-7, relating to the duration of COBRA continuation coverage)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of an asset sale, if the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale and if the buying group continues the business operations associated with the assets purchased from the selling group without interruption or substantial change, then the buying group is a successor employer to the selling group in connection with that asset sale. A buying group does not fail to be a successor employer in connection with an asset sale merely because the asset sale takes place in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy under title 11 of the United States Code. If the buying group is a successor employer, a group health plan maintained by the buying group has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that asset sale. A group health plan of the buying group has this obligation beginning on the later of the following two dates and continuing as long as the buying group continues to maintain a group health

plan (but subject to the rules in Sec. 54.4980B-7, relating to the duration of COBRA continuation coverage)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The date the selling group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The date of the asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The determination of whether the selling group's cessation of providing any group health plan to any employee is in connection with the asset sale is based on all of the relevant facts and circumstances. A group health plan of the buying group does not, as a result of the asset sale, have an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to those qualified beneficiaries of the selling group who are not M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to that sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The rules of Q&A-1; through Q&A-7; of this section and this Q&A-8; are illustrated by the following examples; in each example, each group health plan is subject to COBRA:</p><p class="depth0">Stock Sale Examples</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S consists of three corporations, A, B, and C. Buying Group P consists of two corporations, D and E. P enters into a contract to purchase all the stock of C from S effective July 1, 2002. Before the sale of C, S maintains a single group health plan for the employees of A, B, and C (and their families). P maintains a single group health plan for the employees of D and E (and their families). Effective July 1, 2002, the employees of C (and their families) become covered under P's plan. On June 30, 2002, there are 48 qualified beneficiaries receiving COBRA continuation coverage under S's plan, 15 of whom are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale of C. (The other 33 qualified beneficiaries had qualifying events in connection with a covered employee whose last employment before the qualifying event was with either A or B.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, S's plan continues to have the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the 15 M&A; qualified beneficiaries under S's plan after the sale of C to P. The employees who continue in employment with C do not experience a qualifying event by virtue of P's acquisition of C. If they experience a qualifying event after the sale, then the group health plan of P has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S consists of three corporations, A, B, and C. Each of A, B, and C maintains a group health plan for its employees (and their families). Buying Group P consists of two corporations, D and E. P enters into a contract to purchase all of the stock of C from S effective July 1, 2002. As of June 30, 2002, there are 14 qualified beneficiaries receiving COBRA continuation coverage under C's plan. C continues to employ all of its employees and continues to maintain its group health plan after being acquired by P on July 1, 2002.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, C is an acquired organization and the 14 qualified beneficiaries under C's plan are M&A; qualified beneficiaries. A group health plan of S (that is, either the plan maintained by A or the plan maintained by B) has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the 14 M&A; qualified beneficiaries. S and P could negotiate to have C's plan continue to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the 14 M&A; qualified beneficiaries. In such a case, neither A's plan nor B's plan would make COBRA continuation coverage available to the 14 M&A; qualified beneficiaries unless C's plan failed to fulfill its contractual responsibility to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the M&A; qualified beneficiaries. C's employees (and their spouses and dependent children) do not experience a qualifying event in connection with P's acquisition of C, and consequently no plan maintained by either P or S has any obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to C's employees (or their spouses or dependent children) in connection with the transfer of stock in C from S to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that C ceases to employ two employees on June 30, 2002, and those two employees never become covered under P's plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, the two employees experience a qualifying event on June 30, 2002 because their termination of employment causes a loss of group health coverage. A group health plan of S (that is, either the plan maintained by A or the plan maintained by B) has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the two employees (and to any spouse or dependent child of the two employees who loses coverage under C's plan in connection with the termination of employment of the two employees) because they are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale of C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S consists of three corporations, A, B, and C. Buying Group P consists of two corporations, D and E. P enters into a contract to purchase all of the stock of C from S effective July 1, 2002. Before the sale of C, S maintains a single group health plan for the employees of A, B, and C (and their families). P maintains a single group health plan for the employees of D and E (and their families). Effective July 1, 2002, the employees of C (and their families) become covered under P's plan. On June 30,

2002, there are 25 qualified beneficiaries receiving COBRA continuation coverage under S's plan, 20 of whom are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale of C. (The other five qualified beneficiaries had qualifying events in connection with a covered employee whose last employment before the qualifying event was with either A or B.) S terminates its group health plan effective June 30, 2002 and begins to liquidate the assets of A and B and to lay off the employees of A and B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, S ceases to provide a group health plan to any employee in connection with the sale of C to P. Thus, beginning July 1, 2002 P's plan has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the 20 M&A; qualified beneficiaries, but P is not obligated to make COBRA continuation coverage available to the other 5 qualified beneficiaries with respect to S's plan as of June 30, 2002 or to any of the employees of A or B whose employment is terminated by S (or to any of those employees' spouses or dependent children).</p><p class="depth0">Asset Sale Examples</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S provides group health plan coverage to employees at each of its operating divisions. S sells the assets of one of its divisions to Buying Group P. Under the terms of the group health plan covering the employees at the division being sold, their coverage will end on the date of the sale. P hires all but one of those employees, gives them the same positions that they had with S before the sale, and provides them with coverage under a group health plan. Immediately before the sale, there are two qualified beneficiaries receiving COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan of S whose qualifying events occurred in connection with a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was associated with the assets sold to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> These two qualified beneficiaries are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P. Under these facts, a group health plan of S retains the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to these two M&A; qualified beneficiaries. In addition, the one employee P does not hire as well as all of the employees P hires (and the spouses and dependent children of these employees) who were covered under a group health plan of S on the day before the sale are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale. A group health plan of S also has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to these M&A; qualified beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S provides group health plan coverage to employees at each of its operating divisions. S sells substantially all of the assets of all of its divisions to Buying Group P, and S ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee on the date of the sale. P hires all but one of S's employees on the date of the asset sale by S, gives those employees the same positions that they had with S before the sale, and continues the business operations of those divisions without substantial change or interruption. P provides these employees with coverage under a group health plan. Immediately before the sale, there are 10 qualified beneficiaries receiving COBRA continuation coverage under a group health plan of S whose qualifying events occurred in connection with a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was associated with the assets sold to P.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> These 10 qualified beneficiaries are M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P. Under these facts, P is a successor employer described in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8.; Thus, a group health plan of P has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to these 10 M&A; qualified beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The one employee that P does not hire and the family members of that employee are also M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale. A group health plan of P also has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to these M&A; qualified beneficiaries.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The employees who continue in employment in connection with the asset sale (and their family members) and who were covered under a group health plan of S on the day before the sale are not M&A; qualified beneficiaries because P is a successor employer to S in connection with the asset sale. Thus, no group health plan of P has any obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to these continuing employees with respect to the qualifying event that resulted from their losing coverage under S's plan in connection with the asset sale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S provides group health plan coverage to employees at each of its two operating divisions. S sells the assets of one of its divisions to Buying Group P1. Under the terms of the group health plan covering the employees at the division being sold, their coverage will end on the date of the sale. P1 hires all but one of those employees, gives them the same positions that they had with S before the sale, and provides them with coverage under a group health plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, a group health plan of S has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale to P1. (If an M&A; qualified beneficiary first became covered under P1's plan after electing COBRA continuation coverage under S's plan, then S's plan could terminate the COBRA continuation coverage once the M&A; qualified beneficiary became covered under

P1's plan, provided that the remaining conditions of Q&A-2; of Sec. 54.4980B-7 were satisfied.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Several months after the sale to P1, S sells the assets of its remaining division to Buying Group P2, and S ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee on the date of that sale. Thus, under Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-7, S ceases to have an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary on the date of the sale to P2. P1 and P2 are unrelated organizations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Even if it was foreseeable that S would sell its remaining division to an unrelated third party after the sale to P1, under these facts the cessation of S to provide any group health plan to any employee on the date of the sale to P2 is not in connection with the asset sale to P1. Thus, even after the date S ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee, no group health plan of P1 has any obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P1 by S. If P2 is a successor employer under the rules of paragraph (c) of this Q&A-8; and maintains one or more group health plans after the sale, then a group health plan of P2 would have an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P2 by S (but in such a case employees of S before the sale who continued working for P2 after the sale would not be M&A; qualified beneficiaries). However, even in such a case, no group health plan of P2 would have an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P1 by S. Thus, under these facts, after S has ceased to provide any group health plan to any employee, no plan has an obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the asset sale to P1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Selling Group S provides group health plan coverage to employees at each of its operating divisions. S sells substantially all of the assets of all of its divisions to Buying Group P. P hires most of S's employees on the date of the purchase of S's assets, retains those employees in the same positions that they had with S before the purchase, and continues the business operations of those divisions without substantial change or interruption. P provides these employees with coverage under a group health plan. S continues to employ a few employees for the principal purpose of winding up the affairs of S in preparation for liquidation. S continues to provide coverage under a group health plan to these few remaining employees for several weeks after the date of the sale and then ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, the cessation by S to provide any group health plan to any employee is in connection with the asset sale to P. Because of this, and because P continued the business operations associated with those assets without substantial change or interruption, P is a successor employer to S with respect to the asset sale. Thus, a group health plan of P has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to M&A; qualified beneficiaries with respect to the sale beginning on the date that S ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee. (A group health plan of S retains this obligation for the several weeks after the date of the sale until S ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: Can the cessation of contributions by an employer to a multiemployer group health plan be a qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: The cessation of contributions by an employer to a multiemployer group health plan is not itself a qualifying event, even though the cessation of contributions may cause current employees (and their spouses and dependent children) to lose coverage under the multiemployer plan. An event coinciding with the employer's cessation of contributions (such as a reduction of hours of employment in the case of striking employees) will constitute a qualifying event if it otherwise satisfies the requirements of Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: If an employer stops contributing to a multiemployer group health plan, does the multiemployer plan have the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to a qualified beneficiary who was receiving coverage under the multiemployer plan on the day before the cessation of contributions and who is, or whose qualifying event occurred in connection with, a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was with the employer that has stopped contributing to the multiemployer plan?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: (a) In general, yes. (See Q&A-3; of Sec. 54.4980B-2 for a definition of multiemployer plan.) If, however, the employer that stops contributing to the multiemployer plan makes group health plan coverage available to (or starts contributing to another multiemployer plan that is a group health plan with respect to) a class of the employer's employees formerly covered under the multiemployer plan, the plan maintained by the employer (or the

other multiemployer plan), from that date forward, has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary who was receiving coverage under the multiemployer plan on the day before the cessation of contributions and who is, or whose qualifying event occurred in connection with, a covered employee whose last employment prior to the qualifying event was with the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The rules of Q&A-9; of this section and this Q&A-10; are illustrated by the following examples; in each example, each group health plan is subject to COBRA:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer Z employs a class of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and participating in multiemployer group health plan M. As required by the collective bargaining agreement, Z has been making contributions to M. Z experiences financial difficulties and stops making contributions to M but continues to employ all of the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Z's cessation of contributions to M causes those employees (and their spouses and dependent children) to lose coverage under M. Z does not make group health plan coverage available to any of the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> After Z stops contributing to M, M continues to have the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary who experienced a qualifying event that preceded or coincided with the cessation of contributions to M and whose coverage under M on the day before the qualifying event was due to an employment affiliation with Z. The loss of coverage under M for those employees of Z who continue in employment (and the loss of coverage for their spouses and dependent children) does not constitute a qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1 except that B, one of the employees covered under M before Z stops contributing to M, is transferred into management. Z maintains a group health plan for managers and B becomes eligible for coverage under the plan on the day of B's transfer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, Z does not make group health plan coverage available to a class of employees formerly covered under M after B becomes eligible under Z's group health plan for managers. Accordingly, M continues to have the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary who experienced a qualifying event that preceded or coincided with the cessation of contributions to M and whose coverage under M on the day before the qualifying event was due to an employment affiliation with Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer Y employs two classes of employees--skilled and unskilled laborers--covered by a collective bargaining agreement and participating in multiemployer group health plan M. As required by the collective bargaining agreement, Y has been making contributions to M. Y stops making contributions to M but continues to employ all the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. Y's cessation of contributions to M causes those employees (and their spouses and dependent children) to lose coverage under M. Y makes group health plan coverage available to the skilled laborers immediately after their coverage ceases under M, but Y does not make group health plan coverage available to any of the unskilled laborers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, because Y makes group health plan coverage available to a class of employees previously covered under M immediately after both classes of employees lose coverage under M, Y alone has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary who experienced a qualifying event that preceded or coincided with the cessation of contributions to M and whose coverage under M on the day before the qualifying event was due to an employment affiliation with Y, regardless of whether the employment affiliation was as a skilled or unskilled laborer. However, the loss of coverage under M for those employees of Y who continue in employment (and the loss of coverage for their spouses and dependent children) does not constitute a qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer X employs a class of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and participating in multiemployer group health plan M. As required by the collective bargaining agreement, X has been making contributions to M. X experiences financial difficulties and is forced into bankruptcy by its creditors. X continues to employ all of the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement. X also continues to make contributions to M until the current collective bargaining agreement expires, on June 30, 2001, and then X stops making contributions to M. X's employees (and their spouses and dependent children) lose coverage under M effective July 1, 2001. X does not enter into another collective bargaining agreement covering the class of employees covered by the expired collective bargaining agreement. Effective September 1, 2001, X establishes a group health plan covering the class of employees formerly covered by the collective bargaining agreement. The group health plan also covers their spouses and dependent children.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under these facts, M has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage

available from July 1, 2001 until August 31, 2001, and the group health plan established by X has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available from September 1, 2001 until the obligation ends (see Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-7) to any qualified beneficiary who experienced a qualifying event that preceded or coincided with the cessation of contributions to M and whose coverage under M on the day before the qualifying event was due to an employment affiliation with X. The loss of coverage under M for those employees of X who continue in employment (and the loss of coverage for their spouses and dependent children) does not constitute a qualifying event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer W employs a class of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement and participating in multiemployer group health plan M. As required by the collective bargaining agreement, W has been making contributions to M. The employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement vote to decertify their current employee representative effective January 1, 2002 and vote to certify a new employee representative effective the same date. As a consequence, on January 1, 2002 they cease to be covered under M and commence to be covered under multiemployer group health plan N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Effective January 1, 2002, N has the obligation to make COBRA continuation coverage available to any qualified beneficiary who experienced a qualifying event that preceded or coincided with the cessation of contributions to M and whose coverage under M on the day before the qualifying event was due to an employment affiliation with W. The loss of coverage under M for those employees of W who continue in employment (and the loss of coverage for their spouses and dependent children) does not constitute a qualifying event.

Sec. 54.4980B-10  Interaction of FMLA and COBRA.</p><p class="depth0">The following questions-and-answers address how the taking of leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) (29 U.S.C. 2601-2619) affects the COBRA continuation coverage requirements:</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: In what circumstances does a qualifying event occur if an employee does not return from leave taken under FMLA?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) The taking of leave under FMLA does not constitute a qualifying event. A qualifying event under Q&A-1; of Sec. 54.4980B-4 occurs, however, if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An employee (or the spouse or a dependent child of the employee) is covered on the day before the first day of FMLA leave (or becomes covered during the FMLA leave) under a group health plan of the employee's employer;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The employee does not return to employment with the employer at the end of the FMLA leave; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The employee (or the spouse or a dependent child of the employee) would, in the absence of COBRA continuation coverage, lose coverage under the group health plan before the end of the maximum coverage period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> However, the satisfaction of the three conditions in paragraph (a) of this Q&A-1; does not constitute a qualifying event if the employer eliminates, on or before the last day of the employee's FMLA leave, coverage under a group health plan for the class of employees (while continuing to employ that class of employees) to which the employee would have belonged if the employee had not taken FMLA leave.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: If a qualifying event described in Q&A-1; of this section occurs, when does it occur, and how is the maximum coverage period measured?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: A qualifying event described in Q&A-1; of this section occurs on the last day of FMLA leave. (The determination of when FMLA leave ends is not made under the rules of this section. See the FMLA regulations, 29 CFR Part 825 (Sec. Sec. 825.100-825.800).) The maximum coverage period (see Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-7) is measured from the date of the qualifying event (that is, the last day of FMLA leave). If, however, coverage under the group health plan is lost at a later date and the plan provides for the extension of the required periods (see paragraph (b) of Q&A-4; of Sec. 54.4980B-7), then the maximum coverage period is measured from the date when coverage is lost. The rules of this Q&A-2; are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee B is covered under the group health plan of Employer X on January 31, 2001. B takes FMLA leave beginning February 1, 2001. B's last day of FMLA leave is 12 weeks later, on April 25, 2001, and B does not return to work with X at the end of the FMLA leave. If B does not elect COBRA continuation coverage, B will not be covered under the group health plan of X as of April 26, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> B experiences a qualifying event on April 25, 2001, and the maximum coverage period is measured from that date. (This is the case even if, for part or all of the FMLA leave, B fails to pay the employee portion of premiums for coverage under the group health plan of X and is not covered under X's plan. See Q&A-3; of this section.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employee C and C's spouse are covered under the group health plan of Employer Y on August 15, 2001. C takes FMLA leave beginning August 16, 2001. C informs Y less than 12 weeks later, on September 28, 2001, that C will not be returning to work. Under the FMLA regulations, 29 CFR Part 825 (Sec. Sec. 825.100-825.800), C's last day of FMLA leave is September 28, 2001. C does not return to work with Y at the end of the FMLA leave. If C and C's spouse do not elect COBRA continuation coverage, they will not be covered under the group health plan of Y as of September 29, 2001.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> C and C's spouse experience a qualifying event on September 28, 2001, and the maximum coverage period (generally 18 months) is measured from that date. (This is the case even if, for part or all of the FMLA leave, C fails to pay the employee portion of premiums for coverage under the group health plan of Y and C or C's spouse is not covered under Y's plan. See Q&A-3; of this section.)</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: If an employee fails to pay the employee portion of premiums for coverage under a group health plan during FMLA leave or declines coverage under a group health plan during FMLA leave, does this affect the determination of whether or when the employee has experienced a qualifying event?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: No. Any lapse of coverage under a group health plan during FMLA leave is irrelevant in determining whether a set of circumstances constitutes a qualifying event under Q&A-1; of this section or when such a qualifying event occurs under Q&A-2; of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: Is the application of the rules in Q&A-1; through Q&A-3; of this section affected by a requirement of state or local law to provide a period of coverage longer than that required under FMLA?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: No. Any state or local law that requires coverage under a group health plan to be maintained during a leave of absence for a period longer than that required under FMLA (for example, for 16 weeks of leave rather than for the 12 weeks required under FMLA) is disregarded for purposes of determining when a qualifying event occurs under Q&A-1; through Q&A-3; of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: May COBRA continuation coverage be conditioned upon reimbursement of the premiums paid by the employer for coverage under a group health plan during FMLA leave?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: No. The U.S. Department of Labor has published rules describing the circumstances in which an employer may recover premiums it pays to maintain coverage, including family coverage, under a group health plan during FMLA leave from an employee who fails to return from leave. See 29 CFR 825.213. Even if recovery of premiums is permitted under 29 CFR 825.213, the right to COBRA continuation coverage cannot be conditioned upon the employee's reimbursement of the employer for premiums the employer paid to maintain coverage under a group health plan during FMLA leave.

What are the notice requirements of section 4980F(e) of the Internal Revenue Code and section 204(h) of ERISA?</p><p class="depth0">A-1. (a) Requirements of Internal Revenue Code section 4980F(e) and ERISA section 204(h). Section 4980F of the Internal Revenue Code (section 4980F) and section 204(h) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA), 29 U.S.C. 1054(h) (section 204(h)) each generally requires notice of an amendment to an applicable pension plan that either provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual or that eliminates or significantly reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy. The notice is required to be provided to plan participants and alternate payees who are applicable individuals (as defined in Q&A-10; of this section), to certain employee organizations, and to contributing employers under a multiemployer plan (as described in Q&A-10;(a) of this section). The plan administrator must generally provide the notice before the effective date of the plan amendment. Q&A-9; of this section sets forth the time frames for providing notice, Q&A-11; of this section sets forth the content requirements for the notice, and Q&A-12; of this section contains special rules for cases in which participants can choose between the old and new benefit formulas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other notice requirements. Other provisions of law may require that certain parties be notified of a plan amendment. See, for example, sections

102 and 104 of ERISA, and the regulations thereunder, for requirements relating to summary plan descriptions and summaries of material modifications.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2. What are the differences between section 4980F and section 204(h)?</p><p class="depth0">A-2. The notice requirements of section 4980F generally are parallel to the notice requirements of section 204(h), as amended by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, Public Law 107-16 (115 Stat. 38) (2001) (EGTRRA). However, the consequences of the failure to satisfy the requirements of the two provisions differ: Section 4980F imposes an excise tax on a failure to satisfy the notice requirements, while section 204(h)(6), as amended by EGTRRA, contains a special rule with respect to an egregious failure to satisfy the notice requirements. See Q&A-14; and Q&A-15; of this section. Except to the extent specifically indicated, these regulations apply both to section 4980F and to section 204(h).</p><p class="depth0">Q-3. What is an ``applicable pension plan'' to which section 4980F and section 204(h) apply?</p><p class="depth0">A-3. (a) In general. Section 4980F and section 204(h) apply to an applicable pension plan. For purposes of section 4980F, an applicable pension plan means a defined benefit plan qualifying under section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or an individual account plan that is subject to the funding standards of section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of section 204(h), an applicable pension plan means a defined benefit plan that is subject to part 2 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA, or an individual account plan that is subject to such part 2 and to the funding standards of section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code. Accordingly, individual account plans that are not subject to the funding standards of section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code, such as profit-sharing and stock bonus plans and contracts under section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, are not applicable pension plans to which section 4980F or section 204(h) apply. Similarly, a defined benefit plan that neither qualifies under section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Internal Revenue Code nor is subject to part 2 of subtitle B of title I of ERISA is not an applicable pension plan. Further, neither a governmental plan (within the meaning of section 414(d) of the Internal Revenue Code), nor a church plan (within the meaning of section 414(e) of the Internal Revenue Code) with respect to which no election has been made under section 410(d) of the Internal Revenue Code is an applicable pension plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Section 204(h) notice not required for small plans covering no employees. Section 204(h) notice is not required for a plan under which no employees are participants covered under the plan, as described in Sec. 2510.3-3(b) of the Department of Labor regulations, and which has fewer than 100 participants.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4. What is ``section 204(h) notice'' and what is a ``section 204(h) amendment''?</p><p class="depth0">A-4. (a) Section 204(h) notice is notice that complies with section 4980F(e) of the Internal Revenue Code, section 204(h)(1) of ERISA, and this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A section 204(h) amendment is an amendment for which section 204(h) notice is required under this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5.

Section 204(h) notice is required for an amendment to an applicable pension plan that provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Early retirement benefits and retirement-type subsidies. Section 204(h) notice is also required for an amendment to an applicable pension plan that provides for the significant reduction of an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy.

What is an amendment that reduces the rate of future benefit accrual or reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy for purposes of determining whether section 204(h) notice is required?</p><p class="depth0">A-6. (a) In general. For purposes of determining whether section 204(h) notice is required, an amendment reduces the rate of future benefit accrual or reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy only as provided in paragraph (b) or (c) of this Q&A-6.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Reduction in rate of future benefit accrual--(1) Defined benefit plans. For purposes of section 4980F and section 204(h), an amendment to a defined benefit plan reduces the rate of future benefit accrual only if it is reasonably expected that the amendment will reduce the amount of the future annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later) for benefits accruing for a year. For this purpose, the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age is the benefit payable in the form in which the terms of the plan express the accrued benefit (or, in the case of a plan in which the accrued benefit is not expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, the benefit payable in the form of a single life annuity commencing at normal retirement age that is the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit expressed under the terms of the plan, as determined in accordance with section 411(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Defined benefit plans. For purposes of section 4980F and section 204(h), an amendment to a defined benefit plan reduces the rate of future benefit accrual only if it is reasonably expected that the amendment will reduce the amount of the future annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later) for benefits accruing for a year. For this purpose, the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age is the benefit payable in the form in which the terms of the plan express the accrued benefit (or, in the case of a plan in which the accrued benefit is not expressed in the form of an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, the benefit payable in the form of a single life annuity commencing at normal retirement age that is the actuarial equivalent of the accrued benefit expressed under the terms of the plan, as determined in accordance with section 411(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Individual account plans. For purposes of section 4980F and section 204(h), an amendment to an individual account plan reduces the rate of future benefit accrual only if it is reasonably expected that the amendment will reduce the amount of contributions or forfeitures allocated for any future year. Changes in the investments or investment options under an individual account plan are not taken into account for this purpose.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Determination of rate of future benefit accrual. The rate of future benefit accrual for purposes of this paragraph (b) is determined without regard to optional forms of benefit within the meaning of Sec. 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-1;(b) of this chapter (other than the annual benefit described in paragraph (b)(1) of this Q&A-6;). The rate of future benefit accrual is also determined without regard to ancillary benefits and other rights or features as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-4(e) of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction of early retirement benefits or retirement-type subsidies. For purposes of section 4980F and section 204(h), an amendment reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy only if it is reasonably expected that the amendment will eliminate or reduce an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7. What plan provisions are taken into account in determining whether an amendment is a section 204(h) amendment?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. All plan provisions that may affect the rate of future benefit accrual, early retirement benefits, or retirement-type subsidies of participants or alternate payees must be taken into account in determining whether an amendment is a section 204(h) amendment. For example, plan provisions that may affect the rate of future benefit accrual include the dollar amount or percentage of compensation on which benefit accruals are based; the definition of service or compensation taken into account in determining an employee's benefit accrual; the method of determining average compensation for calculating benefit accruals; the definition of normal retirement age in a defined benefit plan; the exclusion of current participants from future participation; benefit offset provisions; minimum benefit provisions; the formula for determining the amount of contributions and forfeitures allocated to participants' accounts in an individual account plan; in the case of a plan using permitted disparity under section 401(l) of the Internal Revenue Code, the amount of

disparity between the excess benefit percentage or excess contribution percentage and the base benefit percentage or base contribution percentage (all as defined in section 401(l) of the Internal Revenue Code); and the actuarial assumptions used to determine contributions under a target benefit plan (as defined in Sec. 1.401(a)(4)-8(b)(3)(i) of this chapter). Plan provisions that may affect early retirement benefits or retirement-type subsidies include the right to receive payment of benefits after severance from employment and before normal retirement age and actuarial factors used in determining optional forms for distribution of retirement benefits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Provisions incorporated by reference in plan. If all or a part of a plan's rate of future benefit accrual, or an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy provided under the plan, depends on provisions in another document that are referenced in the plan document, a change in the provisions of the other document is an amendment of the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Plan provisions not taken into account--(1) In general. Plan provisions that do not affect the rate of future benefit accrual of participants or alternate payees are not taken into account in determining whether there has been a reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Plan provisions that do not affect the rate of future benefit accrual of participants or alternate payees are not taken into account in determining whether there has been a reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Interaction with section 411(d)(6). Any benefit that is not a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit as described in Sec. Sec. 1.411(d)-3(g)(14) and 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-1;(d) of this chapter, or that is a section 411(d)(6) protected benefit that may be eliminated or reduced as permitted under Sec. 1.411(d)-3(c), (d), or (f), or under Sec. 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-2;(a)(2), (a)(3), (b)(1), or (b)(2)(ii) through (b)(2)(xi) of this chapter, is not taken into account in determining whether an amendment is a section 204(h) amendment. Thus, for example, provisions relating to the right to make after-tax deferrals are not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this Q&A-7;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A defined benefit plan provides a normal retirement benefit equal to 50% of highest 5-year average pay multiplied by a fraction (not in excess of one), the numerator of which equals the number of years of participation in the plan and the denominator of which is 20. A plan amendment is adopted that changes the numerator or denominator of that fraction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The plan amendment must be taken into account in determining whether there has been a reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan C is a multiemployer defined benefit plan subject to several collective bargaining agreements. The specific benefit formula under Plan C that applies to an employee depends on the hourly rate of contribution of the employee's employer, which is set forth in the provisions of the collective bargaining agreements that are referenced in the Plan C document. Collective Bargaining Agreement A between Employer B and the union representing employees of Employer B is renegotiated to provide that the hourly contribution rate for an employee of B who is subject to the Collective Bargaining Agreement A will decrease. That decrease will result in a decrease in the rate of future benefit accrual for employees of B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Under paragraph (a)(2) of this Q&A-7;, the change to Collective Bargaining Agreement A is a plan amendment that is a section 204(h) amendment if the reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual is significant.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8. What is the basic principle used in determining whether a reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual or a reduction in an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy is significant for purposes of section 4980F and section 204(h)?</p><p class="depth0">A-8. (a) General rule. Whether an amendment reducing the rate of future benefit accrual or eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy provides for a reduction that is significant for purposes of section 4980F (and section 204(h) of ERISA) is determined based on reasonable expectations taking into account the relevant facts and circumstances at the time the amendment is adopted, or, if earlier, at the effective date of the amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Application for determining significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual. For a defined benefit plan, the determination of whether an amendment provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual is made by comparing the amount of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later), as

determined under Q&A-6;(b)(1) of this section, under the terms of the plan as amended with the amount of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later), as determined under Q&A-6;(b)(1) of this section, under the terms of the plan prior to amendment. For an individual account plan, the determination of whether an amendment provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual is made in accordance with Q&A-6;(b)(2) of this section by comparing the amounts to be allocated in the future to participants' accounts under the terms of the plan as amended with the amounts to be allocated in the future to participants' accounts under the terms of the plan prior to amendment. An amendment to convert a money purchase pension plan to a profit-sharing or other individual account plan that is not subject to section 412 of the Internal Revenue Code is, in all cases, deemed to be an amendment that provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Application to certain amendments reducing early retirement benefits or retirement-type subsidies. Section 204(h) notice is not required for an amendment that reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy if the amendment is permitted under the third sentence of section 411(d)(6)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code and paragraphs (c), (d), and (f) of Sec. 1.411(d)-3 of this chapter (relating to the elimination or reduction of benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants unless the amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner). However, in determining whether an amendment reducing a retirement-type subsidy constitutes a significant reduction because it reduces a retirement-type subsidy as permitted under Sec. 1.411(d)-3(e)(6) of this chapter, the amendment is treated in the same manner as an amendment that limits the retirement-type subsidy to benefits that accrue before the applicable amendment date (as defined at Sec. 1.411(d)-3(g)(4) of this chapter) with respect to each participant or alternate payee to whom the reduction is reasonably expected to apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Plan amendments reflecting a change in statutorily mandated minimum present value rules. If a defined benefit plan offers a distribution to which the minimum present value rules of section 417(e)(3) apply (other than a payment to which section 411(a)(13)(A) applies) and the plan is amended to reflect the changes to the applicable interest rate and applicable mortality table in section 417(e)(3) made by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, Public Law 109-780 (120 Stat. 780) (PPA '06) (and no change is made in the dates on which the payment will be made), no section 204(h) notice is required to be provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this Q&A-8;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Pension Plan A is a defined benefit plan that provides a rate of benefit accrual of 1% of highest-5 years pay multiplied by years of service, payable annually for life commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later). An amendment to Plan A is adopted on August 1, 2009, effective January 1, 2010, to provide that any participant who separates from service after December 31, 2009, and before January 1, 2015, will have the same number of years of service he or she would have had if his or her service continued to December 31, 2014.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. In this example, the effective date of the plan amendment is January 1, 2010. While the amendment will result in a reduction in the annual rate of future benefit accrual from 2011 through 2014 (because, under the amendment, benefits based upon an additional 5 years of service accrue on January 1, 2010, and no additional service is credited after January 1, 2010 until January 1, 2015), the amendment does not result in a reduction that is significant because the amount of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later) under the terms of the plan as amended is not under any conditions less than the amount of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age (or at actual retirement age, if later) to which any participant would have been entitled under the terms of the plan had the amendment not been made.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that the 2009 amendment does not alter the plan provisions relating to a participant's number of years of service, but instead amends the plan's provisions relating to early retirement benefits. Before the amendment, the plan provides for

distributions before normal retirement age to be actuarially reduced, but, if a participant retires after attainment of age 55 and completion of 10 years of service, the applicable early retirement reduction factor is 3% per year for the years between the ages 65 and 62 and 6% per year for the ages from 62 to 55. The amendment changes these provisions so that an actuarial reduction applies in all cases, but, in accordance with section 411(d)(6)(B), provides that no participant's early retirement benefit will be less than the amount provided under the plan as in effect on December 31, 2009 with respect to service before January 1, 2010. For participant X, the reduction is significant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The amendment will result in a reduction in a retirement-type subsidy provided under Plan A (i.e., Plan A's early retirement subsidy). Section 204(h) notice must be provided to participant X and any other participant for whom the reduction is significant and the notice must be provided at least 45 days before January 1, 2010 (or by such other date as may apply under Q&A-9; of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 2, except that, for participant X, the change does not go into effect for any annuity commencement date before January 1, 2011. Participant X continues employment through January 1, 2011.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The conclusion is the same as in Example 2. Taking into account the rule in the second sentence of Q&A-8;(c) of this section, the reduction that occurs for participant X on January 1, 2011, is treated as the same reduction that occurs under Example 2. Accordingly, assuming that the reduction is significant, section 204(h) notice must be provided to participant X at least 45 days before the January 1, 2010 effective date of the amendment (or by such other date as may apply under Q&A-9; of this section).</p><p class="depth0">Q-9.

The following examples illustrate the rules in this Q&A-10;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A defined benefit plan requires an individual to complete 1 year of service to become a participant who can accrue benefits, and participants cease to accrue benefits under the plan at severance from employment with the employer. There are no alternate payees and employees are not represented by an employee organization. On November 18, 2004, the plan is amended effective as of January 1, 2005 to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual. Section 204(h) notice is provided on November 1, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion.

The amendment requires 30 or more years of service in order for benefits commencing before normal retirement age to be unreduced, but the amendment only applies for future benefit accruals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Section 204(h) notice is only required to be provided to individuals who, on January 1, 2005, have completed at least 1 year of service but less than 30 years of service, are employed by the employer, have not attained normal retirement age, and will have completed 20 or more years of service before normal retirement age if their employment continues to normal retirement age.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan is amended to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual for all current employees who are participants.

The plan administrator is not required to provide section 204(h) notice to any former employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the plan covers two groups of alternate payees. The alternate payees in the first group are entitled to a certain percentage or portion of the former spouse's accrued benefit and, for this purpose, the accrued benefit is determined at the time the former spouse begins receiving retirement benefits under the plan. The alternate payees in the second group are entitled to a certain percentage or portion of the former spouse's accrued benefit and, for this purpose, the accrued benefit was determined at the time the qualified domestic relations order was issued by the court.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. It is reasonable to expect that the benefits to be received by the second group of alternate payees will not be affected by any reduction in a former spouse's rate of future benefit accrual. Accordingly, the plan administrator is not required to provide section 204(h) notice to the alternate payees in the second group.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan covers hourly employees and salaried employees. The plan provides the same rate of benefit accrual for both groups. The employer amends the plan to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual of the salaried employees only. At that time, it is reasonable to expect that only a small percentage of hourly employees will become salaried in the future.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The plan administrator is not required to provide section 204(h) notice to the participants who are currently hourly employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan covers employees in Division M and employees in Division N. The plan provides the same rate of benefit accrual for both groups. The employer amends the plan to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual of employees in Division M.

In this case, the plan administrator must provide section 204(h) notice to the participants who are employees in Division M and to the participants who are employees in Division N.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. A plan is amended to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual for all current employees who are participants. The plan amendment will be effective on January 1, 2004.

Illustrative examples are in any event required to be provided for any change from a traditional defined benefit formula to a cash balance formula or a change that results in a period of time during which there are no accruals (or minimal accruals) with regard to normal retirement benefits or an early retirement subsidy (a wear-away period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Requirement generally. The requirement to include sufficient information for each applicable individual to determine the approximate magnitude of the expected reduction for that individual under (a)(4)(i)(A) of this Q&A-11; is deemed satisfied if the notice includes one or more illustrative examples showing the approximate magnitude of the reduction in the examples, as provided in this paragraph (a)(4)(ii). Illustrative examples are in any event required to be provided for any change from a traditional defined benefit formula to a cash balance formula or a change that results in a period of time during which there are no accruals (or minimal accruals) with regard to normal retirement benefits or an early retirement subsidy (a wear-away period).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examples must bound the range of reductions. Where an amendment results in reductions that vary (either among participants, as would occur for an amendment converting a traditional defined benefit formula to a cash balance formula, or over time as to any individual participant, as would occur for an amendment that results in a wear-away period), the illustrative example(s) provided in accordance with this paragraph (a)(4)(ii) must show the approximate range of the reductions. However, any reductions that are likely to occur in only a de minimis number of cases are not required to be taken into account in determining the range of the reductions if a narrative statement is included to that effect and examples are provided that show the approximate range of the reductions in other cases. Amendments for which the maximum reduction occurs under identifiable circumstances, with proportionately smaller reductions in other cases, may be illustrated by one example illustrating the maximum reduction, with a statement that smaller reductions also occur. Further, assuming that the reduction varies from small to large depending on service or other factors, two illustrative examples may be provided showing the smallest likely reduction and the largest likely reduction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Assumptions used in examples. The examples provided under this paragraph (a)(4)(ii) are not required to be

based on any particular form of payment (such as a life annuity or a single sum), but may be based on whatever form appropriately illustrates the reduction. The examples generally may be based on any reasonable assumptions (for example, assumptions relating to the representative participant's age, years of service, and compensation, along with any interest rate and mortality table used in the illustrations, as well as salary scale assumptions used in the illustrations for amendments that alter the compensation taken into account under the plan), but the section 204(h) notice must identify those assumptions. However, if a plan's benefit provisions include a factor that varies over time (such as a variable interest rate), the determination of whether an amendment is reasonably expected to result in a wear-away period must be based on the value of the factor applicable under the plan at a time that is reasonably close to the date section 204(h) notice is provided, and any wear-away period that is solely a result of a future change in the variable factor may be disregarded. For example, to determine whether a wear-away occurs as a result of a section 204(h) amendment that converts a defined benefit plan to a cash balance pension plan that will credit interest based on a variable interest factor specified in the plan, the future interest credits must be projected based on the interest rate applicable under the variable factor at the time section 204(h) notice is provided.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Individual statements. This paragraph (a)(4)(ii) may be satisfied by providing a statement to each applicable individual projecting what that individual's future benefits are reasonably expected to be at various future dates and what that individual's future benefits would have been under the terms of the plan as in effect before the section 204(h) amendment, provided that the statement includes the same information required for examples under paragraphs (a)(4)(ii)(A) through (C) of this Q&A-11;, including showing the approximate range of the reductions for the individual if the reductions vary over time and identification of the assumptions used in the projections.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> No false or misleading information.

The following examples illustrate the requirements paragraph (a) of this Q&A-11.; In each example, it is assumed that the actual notice provided is written in a manner calculated to be understood by the average plan participant and to apprise the applicable individual of the significance of the notice in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this Q&A-11.; The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan A provides that a participant is entitled to a normal retirement benefit of 2% of the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest (highest average pay) multiplied by years of service. Plan A is amended to provide that, effective January 1, 2004, the normal retirement benefit will be 2% of the participant's highest average pay multiplied by years of service before the effective date, plus 1% of the participant's highest average pay multiplied by years of service after the effective date. The plan administrator provides notice that

states: ``Under the Plan's current benefit formula, a participant's normal retirement benefit is 2% of the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest multiplied by the participant's years of service. This formula is being changed by a plan amendment. Under the Plan as amended, a participant's normal retirement benefit will be the sum of 2% of the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest multiplied by years of service before the January 1, 2004 effective date, plus 1% of the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest multiplied by the participant's years of service after December 31, 2003. This change is effective on January 1, 2004.'' The notice does not contain any additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The notice satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-11.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan B provides that a participant is entitled to a normal retirement benefit at age 64 of 2.2% of the participant's career average pay multiplied by years of service. Plan B is amended to cease all accruals, effective January 1, 2004. The plan administrator provides notice that includes a description of the old benefit formula, a statement that, after December 31, 2003, no participant will earn any further accruals, and the effective date of the amendment. The notice does not contain any additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The notice satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-11.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan C provides that a participant is entitled to a normal retirement benefit at age 65 of 2% of career average compensation multiplied by years of service. Plan C is amended to provide that the normal retirement benefit will be 1% of average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest multiplied by years of service. The amendment only applies to accruals for years of service after the amendment, so that each employee's accrued benefit is equal to the sum of the benefit accrued as of the effective date of the amendment plus the accrued benefit equal to the new formula applied to years of service beginning on or after the effective date. The plan administrator provides notice that describes the old and new benefit formulas and also explains that for an individual whose compensation increases over the individual's career such that the individual's highest 3-year average exceeds the individual's career average, the reduction will be less or there may be no reduction. The notice does not contain any additional information.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The notice satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-11.;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. (A) Plan D is a defined benefit pension plan under which each participant accrues a normal retirement benefit, as a life annuity beginning at the normal retirement age of 65, equal to the participant's number of years of service multiplied by 1.5 percent multiplied by the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest. Plan D provides early retirement benefits for former employees beginning at or after age 55 in the form of an early retirement annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the normal retirement benefit, with the reduction for early commencement based on reasonable actuarial assumptions that are specified in Plan D. Plan D provides for the suspension of benefits of participants who continue in employment beyond normal retirement age, in accordance with section 203(a)(3)(B) of ERISA and regulations thereunder issued by the Department of Labor. The pension of a participant who retires after age 65 is calculated under the same normal retirement benefit formula, but is based on the participant's service credit and highest 3-year pay at the time of late retirement with any appropriate actuarial increases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Plan D is a defined benefit pension plan under which each participant accrues a normal retirement benefit, as a life annuity beginning at the normal retirement age of 65, equal to the participant's number of years of service multiplied by 1.5 percent multiplied by the participant's average pay over the 3 consecutive years for which the average is the highest. Plan D provides early retirement benefits for former employees beginning at or after age 55 in the form of an early retirement annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the normal retirement benefit, with the reduction for early commencement based on reasonable actuarial assumptions that are specified in Plan D. Plan D provides for the suspension of benefits of participants who continue in employment beyond normal retirement age, in accordance with section 203(a)(3)(B) of ERISA and regulations thereunder issued by the Department of Labor. The pension of a participant who retires after age 65 is calculated under the same normal retirement benefit formula, but is based on the participant's service credit and highest 3-year pay at the time of late retirement with any appropriate actuarial increases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Plan D is amended, effective July 1, 2005, to change the formula for all future accruals to a cash balance formula under which the opening account balance for each participant on July 1, 2005, is zero, hypothetical pay credits equal to 5 percent of pay are credited to the account thereafter, and hypothetical interest is credited monthly based on the applicable interest rate under section 417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code at the beginning of the quarter. Any participant who terminates employment with vested benefits can receive an actuarially equivalent annuity (based on the same reasonable actuarial assumptions that are specified in Plan D) commencing at any time after termination of employment and before the plan's normal retirement age of 65. The benefit resulting from the hypothetical account balance is in addition to the benefit accrued before July 1, 2005 (taking into account only service and highest 3-year pay before July 1, 2005), so that it is reasonably expected that no wear-away period will result from the amendment. The plan administrator expects that, as a general rule, depending on future pay increases and future interest rates, the rate of future benefit accrual after the conversion is higher for participants who accrue benefits before approximately age 50 and after approximately age 70, but is lower for participants who accrue benefits between approximately age 50 and age 70.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The plan administrator of Plan D announces the conversion to a cash balance formula on May 16, 2005. The announcement is delivered to all participants and includes a written notice that describes the old formula, the new formula, and the effective date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> In addition, the notice states that the Plan D formula before the conversion provided a normal retirement benefit equal to the product of a participant's number of years of service multiplied by 1.5 percent multiplied by the participant's average pay over the 3 years for which the average is the highest (highest 3-year pay). The notice includes an example showing the normal retirement benefit that will be accrued after June 30, 2005 for a participant who is age 49 with 10 years of service at the time of the conversion. The plan administrator reasonably believes that such a participant is representative of the participants whose rate of future benefit accrual will be reduced as a result of the amendment. The example estimates that, if the participant continues employment to age 65, the participant's normal retirement benefit for service from age 49 to age 65 will be $657 per month for life. The example assumes that the participant's pay is $50,000 at age 49. The example states that the estimated $657 monthly pension accrues over the 16-year period from age 49 to age 65 and that, based on assumed future pay increases, this amount annually would be 9.1 percent of the participant's highest 3-year pay at age 65, which over the 16 years from age 49 to age 65 averages 0.57 percent per year multiplied by the participant's highest 3-year pay. The example also states that the sum of the monthly annuity accrued before the conversion in the 10-year period from age 39 to age 49 plus the $657 monthly annuity estimated to be accrued over the 16-year period from age 49 to age 65 is $1,235 and that, based on assumed future increases in pay, this would be 17.1 percent of the participant's highest 3-year pay at age 65, which over the employee's career from age 39 to age 65 averages 0.66 percent per year multiplied by the participant's highest 3-year pay. The notice also includes two other examples with similar information, one of which is intended to show the circumstances in which a small reduction may occur and the other of which shows the largest reduction that the plan administrator thinks is likely to occur. The notice states that the estimates are based on the assumption that pay increases annually after June 30, 2005, at a 4 percent rate. The notice also specifies that the applicable interest rate under section 417(e) for hypothetical interest credits after June 30, 2005 is assumed to be 6 percent, which is the section 417(e) of the Internal Revenue Code applicable interest rate under the plan for 2005.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The information in the notice, as described in paragraph (i)(C) and (i)(D) of this Example 4, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this Q&A-11; with respect to applicable individuals who are participants. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this Q&A-11; are satisfied because, as noted in paragraph (i)(D) of this Example 4, the notice describes the old formula and describes the estimated future accruals under the new formula in terms that can be readily compared to the old formula, i.e., the notice states that the estimated $657 monthly pension accrued over the 16-year period from age 49 to age 65 averages 0.57 percent of the participant's highest 3-year pay at age 65. The requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this Q&A-11; that the examples include sufficient information to be able to determine the approximate magnitude of the reduction would also be satisfied if the notice instead directly stated the amount of the monthly pension that would have accrued over the 16-year period from age 49 to age 65 under the old formula.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 4, except that, under the plan as in effect before the amendment, the early retirement pension for a participant who terminates employment after age 55 with at least 20 years of service is equal to the normal retirement benefit without reduction from age 65 to age 62 and reduced by only 5 percent per year for each year before age 62. As a result, early retirement benefits for such a participant constitute a retirement-type subsidy. The plan as in effect after the amendment provides an early retirement benefit equal to the sum of the early retirement benefit payable under the plan as in effect before the amendment taking into account only service and highest 3-year pay before July 1, 2005, plus an early retirement annuity that is actuarially equivalent to the account balance for service after June 30, 2005. The notice provided by the plan administrator describes the old early retirement annuity, the new early retirement annuity, and the effective date. The notice includes an estimate of the early retirement annuity payable to the illustrated participant for service after the conversion if the participant were to retire at age 59 (which the plan administrator believes is a typical early retirement age) and elect to begin receiving an immediate early retirement annuity. The example states that the normal retirement benefit expected to be payable at age 65 as a result of service from age 49 to age 59 is $434 per month for life beginning at age 65 and that the early retirement annuity expected to be payable as a result of service from age 49 to age 59 is $270 per month for life beginning at age 59. The example states that the monthly early retirement annuity of $270 is 38 percent less than the monthly normal retirement benefit of $434, whereas a 15 percent reduction would have applied under the plan as in effect before the amendment. The notice also includes similar information for examples that show the smallest and largest reduction that the plan administrator thinks is likely to occur in the early retirement benefit. The notice also specifies the applicable interest rate, mortality table, and salary

scale used in the example to calculate the early retirement reductions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The information in the notice, as described in paragraphs (i)(C) and (D) of Example 4 and paragraph (i) of this Example 5, satisfies the requirements of paragraph (a)(3) of this Q&A-11; with respect to applicable individuals who are participants. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4) of this Q&A-11; are satisfied because, as noted in paragraph (i) of this Example 5, the notice describes the early retirement subsidy under the old formula and describes the estimated early retirement pension under the new formula in terms that can be readily compared to the old formula, i.e., the notice states that the monthly early retirement pension of $270 is 38 percent less than the monthly normal retirement benefit of $434, whereas a 15 percent reduction would have applied under the plan as in effect before the amendment. The requirements of paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of this Q&A-11; that the examples include sufficient information to be able to determine the approximate magnitude of the reduction would also be satisfied if the notice instead directly stated the amount of the monthly early retirement pension that would be payable at age 59 under the old formula.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12. What special rules apply if participants can choose between the old and new benefit formulas?</p><p class="depth0">A-12. In any case in which an applicable individual can choose between the benefit formula (including any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy) in effect before the section 204(h) amendment (old formula) or the benefit formula in effect after the section 204(h) amendment (new formula), section 204(h) notice has not been provided unless the applicable individual has been provided the information required under Q&A-11; of this section, and has also been provided sufficient information to enable the individual to make an informed choice between the old and new benefit formulas. The information required under Q&A-11; of this section must be provided by the date otherwise required under Q&A-9; of this section. The information sufficient to enable the individual to make an informed choice must be provided within a period that is reasonably contemporaneous with the date by which the individual is required to make his or her choice and that allows sufficient advance notice to enable the individual to understand and consider the additional information before making that choice.</p><p class="depth0">Q-13. How may section 204(h) notice be provided?</p><p class="depth0">A-13. (a) Delivering section 204(h) notice. A plan administrator (including a person acting on behalf of the plan administrator, such as the employer or plan trustee) must provide section 204(h) notice through a method that results in actual receipt of the notice or the plan administrator must take appropriate and necessary measures reasonably calculated to ensure that the method for providing section 204(h) notice results in actual receipt of the notice. Section 204(h) notice must be provided either in the form of a paper document or in an electronic form that satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this Q&A-13.; First class mail to the last known address of the party is an acceptable delivery method. Likewise, hand delivery is acceptable. However, the posting of notice is not considered provision of section 204(h) notice. Section 204(h) notice may be enclosed with or combined with other notice provided by the employer or plan administrator (for example, a notice of intent to terminate under title IV of ERISA). Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-13;, a section 204(h) notice is deemed to have been provided on a date if it has been provided by the end of that day. When notice is delivered by first class mail, the notice is considered provided as of the date of the United States postmark stamped on the cover in which the document is mailed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (a) of this Q&A-13;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan A is amended to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual effective January 1, 2005. Under Q&A-9; of this section, section 204(h) notice is required to be provided at least 45 days before the effective date of the amendment. The plan administrator causes section 204(h) notice to be mailed to all affected participants. The mailing is postmarked November 16, 2004.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because section 204(h) notice is given 45 days before the effective date of the plan amendment, it satisfies the timing requirement of Q&A-9; of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> New technologies--(1) General rule. A section 204(h) notice may be provided to an applicable individual through an electronic method (other than an oral

For plan years beginning prior to January 1, 2007, Q&A-13; of this section, as it appeared in the April 1, 2006 edition of 26 CFR part 1, applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the requirement in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this Q&A-13.; In these examples, it is assumed that the notice satisfies the requirements in paragraphs (c)(1)(ii) of this section. The examples are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On July 1, 2003, M, a plan administrator of Company N's plan, sends notice intended to constitute section 204(h) notice to A, an employee of Company N and a participant in the plan. The notice is sent through e-mail to A's e-mail address on Company N's electronic information system. Accessing Company N's electronic information system is not an integral part of A's duties. M sends the e-mail with a request for a computer-generated notification that the message was received and opened. M receives notification indicating that the e-mail was received and opened by A on July 9, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. With respect to A, although M has failed to take appropriate and necessary measures reasonably calculated to ensure that the method for providing section 204(h) notice results in actual receipt of the notice, M satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this Q&A-13; on July 9, 2003, which is when A actually receives the notice.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. On August 1, 2003, O, a plan administrator of Company P's plan, sends a notice intended to constitute section 204(h) notice of ERISA to B, who is an employee of Company P and a participant in Company P's plan. The notice is sent through e-mail to B's e-mail address on Company P's electronic information system. B has the ability to effectively access electronic documents from B's e-mail address on Company P's electronic information system and accessing the system is an integral part of B's duties.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because access to the system is an integral part of B's duties, O has taken appropriate and necessary measures reasonably calculated to ensure that the method for providing section 204(h) notice results in actual receipt of the notice. Thus, regardless of whether B actually accesses B's email on that date, O satisfies the requirement of paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this Q&A-13; on August 1, 2003, with respect to B.</p><p class="depth0">Q-14. What are the consequences if a plan administrator fails to provide section 204(h) notice?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Effect of egregious failure to provide section 204(h) notice. Section 204(h)(6)(A) of ERISA provides that, in the case of any egregious failure to meet the notice requirements with respect to any plan amendment, the plan provisions are applied so that all applicable individuals are entitled to the greater of the benefit to which they would have been entitled without regard to the amendment, or the benefit under the plan with regard to the amendment. For a special rule applicable in the case of a plan termination, see Q&A-17;(b) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Definition of egregious failure. For purposes of section 204(h) of ERISA and this Q&A-14;, there is an egregious failure to meet the notice requirements if a failure to provide required notice is within the control of the plan sponsor and is either an intentional failure or a failure, whether or not intentional, to provide most of the individuals with most of the information they are entitled to receive. For this purpose, an intentional failure includes any failure to promptly provide the required notice or information after the plan administrator discovers an unintentional failure to meet the requirements. A failure to give section 204(h) notice is deemed not to be egregious if the plan administrator reasonably determines, taking into account section 4980F, section 204(h), these regulations, other administrative pronouncements, and relevant facts and circumstances, that the reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual resulting from an amendment is not significant (as described in Q&A-8; of this section), or that an

amendment does not significantly reduce an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of this paragraph (a):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan A is amended to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual effective January 1, 2003. Section 204(h) notice is required to be provided 45 days before January 1, 2003. Timely section 204(h) notice is provided to all applicable individuals (and to each employee organization representing participants who are applicable individuals), except that the employer intentionally fails to provide section 204(h) notice to certain participants until May 16, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The failure to provide section 204(h) notice is egregious. Accordingly, for the period from January 1, 2003 through June 30, 2003 (which is the date that is 45 days after May 16, 2003), all participants and alternate payees are entitled to the greater of the benefit to which they would have been entitled under Plan A as in effect before the amendment or the benefit under the plan as amended.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Effect of non-egregious failure to provide section 204(h) notice. If an egregious failure has not occurred, the amendment with respect to which section 204(h) notice is required may become effective with respect to all applicable individuals. However, see section 502 of ERISA for civil enforcement remedies. Thus, where there is a failure, whether or not egregious, to provide section 204(h) notice in accordance with this section, individuals may have recourse under section 502 of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Excise taxes. See section 4980F and Q&A-15; of this section for excise taxes that may apply to a failure to notify applicable individuals of a pension plan amendment that provides for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual or eliminates or significantly reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy, regardless of whether or not the failure is egregious.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15. What are some of the rules that apply with respect to the excise tax under section 4980F?</p><p class="depth0">A-15. (a) Person responsible for excise tax. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the employer is responsible for reporting and paying the excise tax. In the case of a multiemployer plan, the plan is responsible for reporting and paying the excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Excise tax inapplicable in certain cases. Under section 4980F(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, no excise tax is imposed on a failure for any period during which it is established to the satisfaction of the Commissioner that the employer (or other person responsible for the tax) exercised reasonable diligence, but did not know that the failure existed. Under section 4980F(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code, no excise tax applies to a failure to provide section 204(h) notice if the employer (or other person responsible for the tax) exercised reasonable diligence and corrects the failure within 30 days after the employer (or other person responsible for the tax) first knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that such failure existed. For purposes of section 4980F(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code, a person has exercised reasonable diligence, but did not know that the failure existed if and only if--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The person exercised reasonable diligence in attempting to deliver section 204(h) notice to applicable individuals by the latest date permitted under this section; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> At the latest date permitted for delivery of section 204(h) notice, the person reasonably believes that section 204(h) notice was actually delivered to each applicable individual by that date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (b) of this Q&A-15;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Plan A is amended to reduce significantly the rate of future benefit accrual. The employer sends out a section 204(h) notice to all affected participants and other applicable individuals and to any employee organization representing applicable individuals, including actual delivery by hand to employees at worksites and by first-class mail for any other applicable individual and to any employee organization representing applicable individuals. However, although the employer exercises reasonable diligence in seeking to deliver the notice, the notice is not delivered to any participants at one worksite due to a failure of an overnight delivery service to provide the notice to appropriate personnel at that site for them to timely hand deliver the notice to affected employees. The error is discovered when the employer subsequently calls to confirm delivery. Appropriate section 204(h)

notice is then promptly delivered to all affected participants at the worksite.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the employer exercised reasonable diligence, but did not know that a failure existed, no excise tax applies, assuming that participants at the worksite receive section 204(h) notice within 30 days after the employer first knew, or exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the failure occurred.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16. How do section 4980F and section 204(h) apply when a business is sold?</p><p class="depth0">A-16. (a) Generally. Whether section 204(h) notice is required in connection with the sale of a business depends on whether a plan amendment is adopted that significantly reduces the rate of future benefit accrual or significantly reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of this Q&A-16;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation Q maintains Plan A, a defined benefit plan that covers all employees of Corporation Q, including employees in its Division M. Plan A provides that participating employees cease to accrue benefits when they cease to be employees of Corporation Q. On January 1, 2006, Corporation Q sells all of the assets of Division M to Corporation R. Corporation R maintains Plan B, which covers all of the employees of Corporation R. Under the sale agreement, employees of Division M become employees of Corporation R on the date of the sale (and cease to be employees of Corporation Q), Corporation Q continues to maintain Plan A following the sale, and the employees of Division M become participants in Plan B.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No section 204(h) notice is required because no plan amendment was adopted that reduced the rate of future benefit accrual. The employees of Division M who become employees of Corporation R ceased to accrue benefits under Plan A because their employment with Corporation Q terminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Subsidiary Y is a wholly owned subsidiary of Corporation S. Subsidiary Y maintains Plan C, a defined benefit plan that covers employees of Subsidiary Y. Corporation S sells all of the stock of Subsidiary Y to Corporation T. At the effective date of the sale of the stock of Subsidiary Y, in accordance with the sale agreement between Corporation S and Corporation T, Subsidiary Y amends Plan C so that all benefit accruals cease.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Section 204(h) notice is required to be provided because Subsidiary Y adopted a plan amendment that significantly reduced the rate of future benefit accrual in Plan C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. As a result of an acquisition, Corporation U maintains two defined benefit plans: Plan D covers employees of Division N and Plan E covers the rest of the employees of Corporation U. Plan E provides a significantly lower rate of future benefit accrual than Plan D. Plan D is merged with Plan E, and all of the employees of Corporation U will accrue benefits under the merged plan in accordance with the benefit formula of former Plan E.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Section 204(h) notice is required.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. The facts are the same as in Example 3, except that the rate of future benefit accrual in Plan E is not significantly lower. In addition, Plan D has a retirement-type subsidy that Plan E does not have and the Plan D employees' rights to the subsidy under the merged plan are limited to benefits accrued before the merger.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Section 204(h) notice is required for any participants or beneficiaries for whom the reduction in the retirement-type subsidy is significant (and for any employee organization representing such participants).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation V maintains several plans, including Plan F, which covers employees of Division P. Plan F provides that participating employees cease to accrue further benefits under the plan when they cease to be employees of Corporation V. Corporation V sells all of the assets of Division P to Corporation W, which maintains Plan G for its employees. Plan G provides a significantly lower rate of future benefit accrual than Plan F. Plan F is merged with Plan G as part of the sale, and employees of Division P who become employees of Corporation W will accrue benefits under the merged plan in accordance with the benefit formula of former Plan G.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. No section 204(h) notice is required because no plan amendment was adopted that reduces the rate of future benefit accrual or eliminates or significantly reduces an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy. Under the terms of Plan F as in effect prior to the merger, employees of Division P cease to accrue any further benefits (including benefits with respect to early retirement benefits and any retirement-type subsidy) under Plan F after the date of the sale because their employment with Corporation V terminated.</p><p class="depth0">Q-17. How are amendments to cease accruals and terminate a plan treated under section 4980F and section 204(h)?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Rule. An amendment providing for the cessation of benefit accruals on a specified future date and for the termination of a plan is subject to section 4980F and section 204(h).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rule of paragraph (a)(1) of this Q&A-17;:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. An employer adopts an amendment that provides for the cessation of benefit accruals under a defined benefit plan on December 31, 2003, and for the termination of the plan pursuant to title IV of ERISA as of a proposed termination date that is also December 31, 2003. As part of the notice of intent to terminate required under title IV in order to terminate the plan, the plan administrator gives section 204(h) notice of the amendment ceasing accruals, which states that benefit accruals will cease ``on December 31, 2003 whether or not the plan is terminated on that date.'' However, because all the requirements of title IV for a plan termination are not satisfied, the plan cannot be terminated until a date that is later than December 31, 2003.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Nonetheless, because section 204(h) notice was given stating that the plan was amended to cease accruals on December 31, 2003, section 204(h) does not prevent the amendment to cease accruals from being effective on December 31, 2003. The result would be the same had the section 204(h) notice informed the participants that the plan was amended to provide for a proposed termination date of December 31, 2003 and to provide that ``benefit accruals will cease on the proposed termination date whether or not the plan is terminated on that date.'' However, neither section 4980F nor section 204(h) would be satisfied with respect to the December 31, 2003 effective date if the section 204(h) notice had merely stated that benefit accruals would cease ``on the termination date'' or ``on the proposed termination date.''</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Additional requirements under title IV of ERISA. See 29 CFR 4041.23(b)(4) and 4041.43(b)(5) for special rules applicable to plans terminating under title IV of ERISA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Terminations in accordance with title IV of ERISA. A plan that is terminated in accordance with title IV of ERISA is deemed to have satisfied section 4980F and section 204(h) not later than the termination date (or date of termination, as applicable) established under section 4048 of ERISA. Accordingly, neither section 4980F nor section 204(h) would in any event require that any additional benefits accrue after the effective date of the termination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amendment effective before termination date of a plan subject to title IV of ERISA. To the extent that an amendment providing for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual or a significant reduction in an early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy has an effective date that is earlier than the termination date (or date of termination, as applicable) established under section 4048 of ERISA, that amendment is subject to section 4980F and section 204(h). Accordingly, the plan administrator must provide section 204(h) notice (either separately, with, or as part of the notice of intent to terminate) with respect to such an amendment.</p><p class="depth0">Q-18. What are the effective dates of section 4980F, section 204(h), as amended by EGTRRA, and these regulations?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. Section 4980F and section 204(h), as amended by EGTRRA, apply to plan amendments taking effect on or after June 7, 2001 (statutory effective date), which is the date of enactment of EGTRRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transition rule. For amendments applying after the statutory effective date in paragraph (a)(1) of this Q&A-18; and prior to the regulatory effective date in paragraph (c) of this Q&A-18;, the requirements of section 4980F(e)(2) and (3) of the Internal Revenue Code and section 204(h), as amended by EGTRRA, are treated as satisfied if the plan administrator makes a reasonable, good faith effort to comply with those requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special notice rule--(i) In general. Notwithstanding Q&A-9; of this section, section 204(h) notice is not required by section 4980F(e) of the Internal Revenue Code or section 204(h), as amended by EGTRRA, to be provided prior to September 7, 2001 (the date that is three months after the date of enactment of EGTRRA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general.

The requirements of section 4980F and section 204(h), as amended by EGTRRA, do not apply to any plan amendment that takes effect on or after June 7, 2001 if, before April 25, 2001, notice was provided to participants and beneficiaries adversely affected by the plan amendment (and their representatives) which was reasonably expected to notify them of the nature and effective date of the plan amendment. For purposes of this paragraph (a)(3)(ii), notice that

complies with Sec. 1.411(d)-6 of this chapter, as it appeared in the April 1, 2001 edition of 26 CFR part 1, is deemed to be notice which was reasonably expected to notify participants and beneficiaries adversely affected by the plan amendment (and their representatives) of the nature and effective date of the plan amendment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special effective date for certain section 204(h) amendments made by plans of commercial airlines.

Sec. 54.4980G-1  Failure of employer to make comparable health savings account contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What are the comparability rules that apply to employer contributions to Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: If an employer makes contributions to any employee's HSA, the employer must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees. See Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-4 for the definition of comparable contributions. Comparable participating employees are eligible individuals (as defined in section 223(c)(1)) who are in the same category of employees and who have the same category of high deductible health plan (HDHP) coverage. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E(d)(3). See section 223(c)(2) and (g) for the definition of an HDHP. See also Q & A-5 in Sec. 54.4980G-3 for the categories of employees and Q & A-2 of this section for the categories of HDHP coverage. But see Q & A-6 in Sec. 54.4980G-3 for treatment of collectively bargained employees and Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-6 for the rules allowing larger comparable contributions to nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: What are the categories of HDHP coverage for purposes of applying the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) In general. Generally, the categories of coverage are self-only HDHP coverage and family HDHP coverage. Family HDHP coverage means any coverage other than self-only HDHP coverage. The comparability rules apply separately to self-only HDHP coverage and family HDHP coverage. In addition, if an HDHP has family coverage options meeting the descriptions listed in paragraph (b) of this Q & A-2, each such coverage option may be treated as a separate category of coverage and the comparability rules may be applied separately to each category. However, if the HDHP has more than one category that provides coverage for the same number of individuals, all such categories are treated as a single category for purposes of the comparability rules. Thus, the categories of ``employee plus spouse'' and ``employee plus dependent,'' each providing coverage for two individuals, are treated as the single category ``self plus one'' for comparability purposes. See, however, the final sentence of paragraph (a) of Q & A-1 of Sec. 54.4980G-4 for a special rule that applies if different amounts are contributed for different categories of family coverage. See also Sec. 54.4980G-6 for the rules allowing larger comparable contributions to nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> HDHP Family coverage categories. The coverage categories are--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Self plus one;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Self plus two; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Self plus three or more.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The rules of this Q & A-2 are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer A maintains an HDHP and contributes to the HSAs of eligible employees who elect coverage under the HDHP. The HDHP has self-only coverage and family coverage. Thus, the categories of coverage are self-only and family coverage. Employer A contributes $750 to the HSA of each eligible employee with self-only HDHP coverage and $1,000 to the HSA of each eligible employee with family HDHP coverage. Employer A's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer B maintains an HDHP and contributes to the HSAs of eligible employees who elect coverage under the HDHP.

Likewise, the self plus spouse plus one dependent category and the self plus two dependents category constitute the same category of HDHP coverage (self plus two) and Employer B must make the same comparable contributions to the HSAs of all eligible individuals who are in either the self plus spouse plus one dependent category of HDHP coverage or the self plus two dependents category of HDHP coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Employer C maintains an HDHP and contributes to the HSAs of eligible employees who elect coverage under the HDHP.

Employer C's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: What is the testing period for making comparable contributions to employees' HSAs?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: To satisfy the comparability rules, an employer must make comparable contributions for the calendar year to the HSAs of employees who are comparable participating employees. See section 4980G(a). See Q & A-3 and Q & A-4 in Sec. 54.4980G-4 for a discussion of HSA contribution methods.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: How is the excise tax computed if employer contributions do not satisfy the comparability rules for a calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) Computation of tax. If employer contributions do not satisfy the comparability rules for a calendar year, the employer is subject to an excise tax equal to 35% of the aggregate amount contributed by the employer to HSAs for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-4:</p><p class="depth0">Example. During the 2007 calendar year, Employer D has 8 employees who are eligible individuals with self-only coverage under an HDHP provided by Employer D. The deductible for the HDHP is $2,000. For the 2007 calendar year, Employer D contributes $2,000 each to the HSAs of two employees and $1,000 each to the HSAs of the other six employees, for total HSA contributions of $10,000. Employer D's contributions do not satisfy the comparability rules. Therefore, Employer D is subject to an excise tax of $3,500 (35% of $10,000) for its failure to make comparable contributions to its employees' HSAs.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: If a person is liable for the excise tax under section 4980G, what form must the person file and what is the due date for the filing and payment of the excise tax?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) In general.

Sec. 54.4980G-3  Failure of employer to make comparable health savings account contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: Do the comparability rules apply to contributions that an employer makes to the HSAs of independent contractors or self-employed individuals?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: No. The comparability rules apply only to contributions that an employer makes to the HSAs of employees.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: May a sole proprietor who is an eligible individual contribute to his or her own HSA without contributing to the HSAs of his or her employees who are eligible individuals?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) Sole proprietor not an employee. Yes. The comparability rules apply only to contributions made by an employer to the HSAs of employees. Because a sole proprietor is not an employee, the comparability rules do not apply to contributions the sole proprietor makes to his or her own HSA. However, if a sole proprietor contributes to any employee's HSA, the sole proprietor must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees. In determining whether the comparability rules are satisfied, contributions that a sole proprietor makes to his or her own HSA are not taken into account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-2:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In a calendar year, B, a sole proprietor is an eligible individual and contributes $1,000 to B's own HSA. B also contributes $500 for the same calendar year to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual. The comparability rules are not violated by B's $1,000 contribution to B's own HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: Do the comparability rules apply to contributions by a partnership to a partner's HSA?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) Partner not an employee. No. Contributions by a partnership to a bona fide partner's HSA are not subject to the comparability rules because the contributions are not contributions by an employer to the HSA of an employee. The contributions are treated as either guaranteed payments under section 707(c) or distributions under section 731. However, if a partnership contributes to the HSAs of any employee who is not a partner, the partnership must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-3:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Partnership X is a limited partnership with three equal individual partners, A (a general partner), B (a limited partner), and C (a limited partner). C is to be paid $300 annually for services rendered to Partnership X in her capacity as a partner without regard to partnership income (a section 707(c) guaranteed payment). D and E are the only employees of Partnership X and are not partners in Partnership X. A, B, C, D, and E are eligible individuals and each has an HSA. During Partnership X's Year 1 taxable year, which is also a calendar year, Partnership X makes the following contributions--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> A $300 contribution to each of A's and B's HSAs which are treated as section 731 distributions to A and B;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> A $300 contribution to C's HSA in lieu of paying C the guaranteed payment directly; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> A $200 contribution to each of D's and E's HSAs, who are comparable participating employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Partnership X's contributions to A's and B's HSAs are section 731 distributions, which are treated as cash distributions. Partnership X's contribution to C's HSA is treated as a guaranteed payment under section 707(c). The contribution is not excludible from C's gross income under section 106(d) because the contribution is treated as a distributive share of partnership income for purposes of all Code sections other than sections 61(a) and 162(a), and a guaranteed payment to a partner is not treated as compensation to an employee. Thus, Partnership

X's contributions to the HSAs of A, B, and C are not subject to the comparability rules. Partnership X's contributions to D's and E's HSAs are subject to the comparability rules because D and E are employees of Partnership X and are not partners in Partnership X. Partnership X's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: How are members of controlled groups treated when applying the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: All persons or entities treated as a single employer under section 414 (b), (c), (m), or (o) are treated as one employer. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E(e).</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: What are the categories of employees for comparability testing?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: (a) Categories. The categories of employees for comparability testing are as follows (but see Q & A-6 of this section for the treatment of collectively bargained employees and Q & A-1 of Sec. 54.4980G-6 for a special rule for contributions made to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees)--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Current full-time employees;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Current part-time employees; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Former employees (except for former employees with coverage under the employer's HDHP because of an election under a COBRA continuation provision (as defined in section 9832(d)(1)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Part-time and full-time employees. For purposes of section 4980G, part-time employees are customarily employed for fewer than 30 hours per week and full-time employees are customarily employed for 30 or more hours per week. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E(d)(4)(A) and (B).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In general. Except as provided in Q & A-6 of this section, the categories of employees in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-5 are the exclusive categories of employees for comparability testing. An employer must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees (eligible individuals who are in the same category of employees with the same category of HDHP coverage) during the calendar year without regard to any classification other than these categories. For example, full-time eligible employees with self-only HDHP coverage and part-time eligible employees with self-only HDHP coverage are separate categories of employees and different amounts can be contributed to the HSAs for each of these categories. But see Sec. 54.4980G-6 for a special rule for contributions made to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: Are employees who are included in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement comparable participating employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) In general. No. Collectively bargained employees who are covered by a bona fide collective bargaining agreement between employee representatives and one or more employers are not comparable participating employees, if health benefits were the subject of good faith bargaining between such employee representatives and such employer or employers. Former employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement also are not comparable participating employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-6. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer A offers its employees an HDHP with a $1,500 deductible for self-only coverage. Employer A has collectively bargained and non-collectively bargained employees. The collectively bargained employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement under which health benefits were bargained in good faith. In the 2007 calendar year, Employer A contributes $500 to the HSAs of all eligible non-collectively bargained employees with self-only coverage under Employer A's HDHP. Employer A does not contribute to the HSAs of the collectively bargained employees. Employer A's contributions to the HSAs of non-collectively bargained employees satisfy the comparability rules. The comparability rules do not apply to collectively bargained employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer B offers its employees an HDHP with a $1,500 deductible for self-only coverage. Employer B has collectively bargained and non-collectively bargained employees. The collectively bargained employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement under which health benefits were bargained in good faith. In the 2007 calendar year and in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Employer B contributes to the HSAs of all eligible collectively bargained employees. Employer B does not contribute to the HSAs of the non-collectively bargained employees. Employer B's contributions to the HSAs of collectively bargained employees are not subject to the comparability rules because the comparability rules do not apply

to collectively bargained employees. Accordingly, Employer B's failure to contribute to the HSAs of the non-collectively bargained employees does not violate the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer C has two units of collectively bargained employees--unit Q and unit R--each covered by a collective bargaining agreement under which health benefits were bargained in good faith. In the 2007 calendar year and in accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Employer C contributes to the HSAs of all eligible collectively bargained employees in unit Q. In accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Employer C makes no HSA contributions for collectively bargained employees in unit R. Employer C's contributions to the HSAs of collectively bargained employees are not subject to the comparability rules because the comparability rules do not apply to collectively bargained employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Employer D has a unit of collectively bargained employees that are covered by a collective bargaining agreement under which health benefits were bargained in good faith. In accordance with the terms of the collective bargaining agreement, Employer D contributes an amount equal to a specified number of cents per hour for each hour worked to the HSAs of all eligible collectively bargained employees. Employer D's contributions to the HSAs of collectively bargained employees are not subject to the comparability rules because the comparability rules do not apply to collectively bargained employees.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: Is an employer permitted to make comparable contributions only to the HSAs of comparable participating employees who have coverage under the employer's HDHP?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: (a) Employer-provided HDHP coverage. If during a calendar year, an employer contributes to the HSA of any employee who is an eligible individual covered under an HDHP provided by the employer, the employer is required to make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees with coverage under any HDHP provided by the employer. An employer that contributes only to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals with coverage under the employer's HDHP is not required to make comparable contributions to HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals but are not covered under the employer's HDHP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Non-employer provided HDHP coverage. An employer that contributes to the HSA of any employee who is an eligible individual with coverage under any HDHP that is not an HDHP provided by the employer, must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees whether or not covered under the employer's HDHP. An employer that makes a reasonable good faith effort to identify all comparable participating employees with non-employer provided HDHP coverage and makes comparable contributions to the HSAs of such employees satisfies the requirements in paragraph (b) of this Q & A-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this Q & A-7. None of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer E offers an HDHP to its full-time employees. Most full-time employees are covered under Employer E's HDHP and Employer E makes comparable contributions only to these employees' HSAs. Employee W, a full-time employee of Employer E and an eligible individual, is covered under an HDHP provided by the employer of W's spouse and not under Employer E's HDHP. Employer E is not required to make comparable contributions to W's HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In a calendar year, Employer F does not offer an HDHP. Several full-time employees of Employer F, who are eligible individuals, have HSAs. Employer F contributes to these employees' HSAs. Employer F must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all full-time employees who are eligible individuals.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In a calendar year, Employer G offers an HDHP to its full-time employees. Most full-time employees are covered under Employer G's HDHP and Employer G makes comparable contributions to these employees' HSAs and also to the HSAs of full-time employees who are eligible individuals and who are not covered under Employer G's HDHP. Employee S, a full-time employee of Employer G and a comparable participating employee, is covered under an HDHP provided by the employer of S's spouse and not under Employer G's HDHP. Employer G must make comparable contributions to S's HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-8: If an employee and his or her spouse are eligible individuals who work for the same employer and one employee-spouse has family coverage

for both employees under the employer's HDHP, must the employer make comparable contributions to the HSAs of both employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-8: (a) In general. If the employer makes contributions only to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals covered under its HDHP where only one employee-spouse has family coverage for both employees under the employer's HDHP, the employer is not required to contribute to the HSAs of both employee-spouses. The employer is required to contribute to the HSA of the employee-spouse with coverage under the employer's HDHP, but is not required to contribute to the HSA of the employee-spouse covered under the employer's HDHP by virtue of his or her spouse's coverage. However, if the employer contributes to the HSA of any employee who is an eligible individual with coverage under an HDHP that is not an HDHP provided by the employer, the employer must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of both employee-spouses if they are both eligible individuals. If an employer is required to contribute to the HSAs of both employee-spouses, the employer is not required to contribute amounts in excess of the annual contribution limits in section 223(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-8. None of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer H offers an HDHP to its full-time employees. Most full-time employees are covered under Employer H's HDHP and Employer H makes comparable contributions only to these employees' HSAs. T and U are a married couple. Employee T, who is a full-time employee of Employer H and an eligible individual, has family coverage under Employer H's HDHP for T and T's spouse. Employee U, who is also a full-time employee of Employer H and an eligible individual, does not have coverage under Employer H's HDHP except as the spouse of Employee T. Employer H is required to make comparable contributions to T's HSA, but is not required to make comparable contributions to U's HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In a calendar year, Employer J offers an HDHP to its full-time employees. Most full-time employees are covered under Employer J's HDHP and Employer J makes comparable contributions to these employees' HSAs and to the HSAs of full-time employees who are eligible individuals but are not covered under Employer J's HDHP. R and S are a married couple. Employee S, who is a full-time employee of Employer J and an eligible individual, has family coverage under Employer J's HDHP for S and S's spouse. Employee R, who is also a full-time employee of Employer J and an eligible individual, does not have coverage under Employer J's HDHP except as the spouse of Employee S. Employer J must make comparable contributions to S's HSA and to R's HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-9: Does an employer that makes HSA contributions only for one class of non-collectively bargained employees who are eligible individuals, but not for another class of non-collectively bargained employees who are eligible individuals (for example, management v. non-management) satisfy the requirement that the employer make comparable contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-9: (a) Different classes of employees. No. If the two classes of employees are comparable participating employees, the comparability rules are not satisfied. The only categories of employees for comparability purposes are current full-time employees, current part-time employees, and former employees. Collectively bargained employees are not comparable participating employees. But see Q & A-1 in 54.4980G-5 on contributions made through a cafeteria plan. See Sec. 54.4980G-6 for a special rule for contributions made to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-9. None of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer K maintains an HDHP covering all management and non-management employees. Employer K contributes to the HSAs of non-management employees who are eligible individuals covered under its HDHP. Employer K does not contribute to the HSAs of its management employees who are eligible individuals covered under its HDHP. The comparability rules are not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. All of Employer L's employees are located in city X and city Y. In a calendar year, Employer L maintains an HDHP for all employees working in city X only. Employer L does not maintain an HDHP for its employees working in city Y. Employer L contributes $500 to the HSAs of city X employees who are eligible individuals with

coverage under its HDHP. Employer L does not contribute to the HSAs of any of its city Y employees. The comparability rules are satisfied because none of the employees in city Y are covered under an HDHP of Employer L. (However, if any employees in city Y were covered by an HDHP of Employer L, Employer L could not fail to contribute to their HSAs merely because they work in a different city.)</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer M has two divisions--division N and division O. In a calendar year, Employer M maintains an HDHP for employees working in division N and division O. Employer M contributes to the HSAs of division N employees who are eligible individuals with coverage under its HDHP. Employer M does not contribute to the HSAs of division O employees who are eligible individuals covered under its HDHP. The comparability rules are not satisfied.</p><p class="depth0">Q-10: If an employer contributes to the HSAs of former employees who are eligible individuals, do the comparability rules apply to these contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: (a) Former employees. Yes. The comparability rules apply to contributions an employer makes to former employees' HSAs. Therefore, if an employer contributes to any former employee's HSA, it must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating former employees (former employees who are eligible individuals with the same category of HDHP coverage). However, an employer is not required to make comparable contributions to the HSAs of former employees with coverage under the employer's HDHP because of an election under a COBRA continuation provision (as defined in section 9832(d)(1)). See Q & A-5 and Q & A-12 of this section. The comparability rules apply separately to former employees because they are a separate category of covered employee. See Q & A-5 of this section. Also, former employees who were covered by a collective bargaining agreement immediately before termination of employment are not comparable participating employees. See Q & A-6 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Locating former employees. An employer making comparable contributions to former employees must take reasonable actions to locate any missing comparable participating former employees. In general, such actions include the use of certified mail, the Internal Revenue Service Letter Forwarding Program or the Social Security Administration's Letter Forwarding Service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-10. None of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer N contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each current employee who is an eligible individual with coverage under any HDHP.

An employer that contributes only to the HSAs of former employees who are eligible individuals with coverage under the employer's HDHP is not required to make comparable contributions to the HSAs of former employees who are eligible individuals and who are not covered under the employer's HDHP. However, an employer that contributes to the HSA of any former employee who is an eligible individual with coverage under an HDHP that is not an HDHP of the employer, must make comparable contributions to the HSAs of all former employees who are

Sec. 54.4980G-4  Calculating comparable contributions.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: What are comparable contributions?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) Definition. Contributions are comparable if, for each month in a calendar year, the contributions are either the same amount or the same percentage of the deductible under the HDHP for employees who are eligible individuals with the same category of coverage on the first day of that month. Employees with self-only HDHP coverage are tested separately from employees with family HDHP coverage. Similarly, employees with different categories of family HDHP coverage may be tested separately. See Q & A-2 in Sec. 54.4980G-1. An employer is not required to contribute the same amount or the same percentage of the deductible for employees who are eligible individuals with one category of HDHP coverage that it contributes for employees who are eligible individuals with a different category of HDHP coverage. For example, an employer that satisfies the comparability rules by contributing the same amount to the HSAs of all employees who are eligible individuals with family HDHP coverage is not required to contribute any amount to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals with self-only HDHP coverage, or to contribute the same percentage of the self-only HDHP deductible as the amount contributed with respect to family HDHP coverage. However, the contribution with respect to the self plus two category may not be less than the contribution with respect to the self plus one category and the contribution with respect to the self plus three or more category may not be less than the contribution with respect to the self plus two category. But see Q & A-1 of Sec. 54.4980G-6 for a special rule for contributions made to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-1. None of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In the 2007 calendar year, Employer A offers its full-time employees three health plans, including an HDHP with self-

only coverage and a $2,000 deductible. Employer A contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual electing the self-only HDHP coverage. Employer A makes no HSA contributions for employees with family HDHP coverage or for employees who do not elect the employer's self-only HDHP.

under the HDHP and are enrolled in Medicare. For the calendar year, Employer G contributes $500 to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual. No contributions are made to the HSAs of employees who have coverage under Employer G's health FSA or under a spouse's health FSA or who are enrolled in Medicare.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employees who have coverage under a health FSA (whether Employer H's or their spouse's FSA) or who are covered under Medicare are not eligible individuals. Specifically, the employees who have coverage under the health FSA or under a spouse's health FSA are not comparable participating employees because they are not eligible individuals under section 223(c)(1). Similarly, the employees who are enrolled in Medicare are not comparable participating employees because they are not eligible individuals under section 223(b)(7) and (c)(1). Therefore, employees who have coverage under the health FSA or under a spouse's health FSA and employees who are enrolled in Medicare are excluded from comparability testing. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E. Employer G's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: How does an employer comply with the comparability rules when some non-collectively bargained employees who are eligible individuals do not work for the employer during the entire calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) In general. In determining whether the comparability rules are satisfied, an employer must take into account all full-time and part-time employees who were employees and eligible individuals for any month during the calendar year. (Full-time and part-time employees are tested separately. See Q & A-5 in Sec. 54.4980G-3.) There are two methods to comply with the comparability rules when some employees who are eligible individuals do not work for the employer during the entire calendar year; contributions may be made on a pay-as-you-go basis or on a look-back basis. See Q & A-9 through Q & A-11 in Sec. 54.4980G-3 for the rules regarding comparable contributions to the HSAs of former employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contributions on a pay-as-you-go basis. An employer may comply with the comparability rules by contributing amounts at one or more dates during the calendar year to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals as of the first day of the month, if contributions are the same amount or the same percentage of the HDHP deductible for employees who are eligible individuals as of the first day of the month with the same category of coverage and are made at the same time. Contributions made at the employer's usual payroll interval for different groups of employees are considered to be made at the same time. For example, if salaried employees are paid monthly and hourly employees are paid bi-weekly, an employer may contribute to the HSAs of hourly employees on a bi-weekly basis and to the HSAs of salaried employees on a monthly basis. An employer may change the amount that it contributes to the HSAs of employees at any point. However, the changed contribution amounts must satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (b) of this Q & A-2: The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Beginning on January 1st, Employer H contributes $50 per month on the first day of each month to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual on that date. Employer H does not contribute to the HSAs of former employees. In mid-March of the same year, Employee X, an eligible individual, terminates employment after Employer H has contributed $150 to X's HSA. After X terminates employment, Employer H does not contribute additional amounts to X's HSA. In mid-April of the same year, Employer H hires Employee Y, an eligible individual, and contributes $50 to Y's HSA in May and $50 in June. Effective in July of the same year, Employer H stops contributing to the HSAs of all employees and makes no contributions to the HSA of any employee for the months of July through December. In August, Employer H hires Employee Z, an eligible individual. Employer H does not contribute to Z's HSA. After Z is hired, Employer H does not hire additional employees. As of the end of the calendar year, Employer H has made the following HSA contributions to its employees' HSAs--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Employer H contributed $150 to X's HSA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Employer H contributed $100 to Y's HSA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Employer H did not contribute to Z's HSA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Employer H contributed $300 to the HSA of each employee who was an eligible individual and employed by Employer J from January through June.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employer H's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In a calendar year, Employer J offers its employees an HDHP and contributes on a monthly pay-as-you-go basis to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals with coverage under Employer J's HDHP. In the calendar year, Employer J contributes $50 per month to the HSA of each employee with self-only HDHP coverage and $100 per month to the HSA of each employee with family HDHP coverage. From January 1st through March 31st of the calendar year, Employee X is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. From April 1st through December 31st of the calendar year, X is an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. For the months of January, February and March of the calendar year, Employer J contributes $50 per month to X's HSA. For the remaining months of the calendar year, Employer J contributes $100 per month to X's HSA. Employer J's contributions to X's HSA satisfy the comparibility rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Contributions on a look-back basis. An employer may also satisfy the comparability rules by determining comparable contributions for the calendar year at the end of the calendar year, taking into account all employees who were eligible individuals for any month during the calendar year and contributing the same percentage of the HDHP deductible or the same dollar amount to the HSAs of all employees with the same category of coverage for that month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (d) of this Q & A-2. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer K offers its employees an HDHP and contributes on a look-back basis to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals with coverage under Employer K's HDHP. Employer K contributes $600 ($50 per month) for the calendar year to the HSA of each employee with self-only HDHP coverage and $1,200 ($100 per month) for the calendar year to the HSA of each employee with family HDHP coverage. From January 1st through June 30th of the calendar year, Employee Y is an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. From July 1st through December 31st, Y is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer K contributes $900 on a look-back basis for the calendar year to Y's HSA ($100) per month for the months of January through June and $50 per month for the months of July through December. Employer K's contributions to Y's HSA satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. On December 31st, Employer L contributes $50 per month on a look-back basis to each employee's HSA for each month in the calendar year that the employee was an eligible individual. In mid-March of the same year, Employee T, an eligible individual, terminated employment. In mid-April of the same year, Employer L hired Employee U, who becomes an eligible individual as of May 1st and works for Employer L through December 31st. On December 31st, Employer L contributes $150 to Employee T's HSA and $400 to Employee U's HSA. Employer L's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Periods and dates for making contributions. With both the pay-as-you-go method and the look-back method, an employer may establish, on a reasonable and consistent basis, periods for which contributions will be made (for example, a quarterly period covering three consecutive months in a calendar year) and the dates on which such contributions will be made for that designated period (for example, the first day of the quarter or the last day of the quarter in the case of an employer who has established a quarterly period for making contributions). An employer that makes contributions on a pay-as-you-go basis for a period covering more than one month will not fail to satisfy the comparability rules because an employee who terminates employment prior to the end of the period for which contributions were made has received more contributions on a monthly basis than employees who have worked the entire period. In addition, an employer that makes contributions on a pay-as-you-go basis for a period covering more than one month must make HSA contributions for any comparable participating employees hired after the date of initial funding for that period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (f) of this Q & A-2:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Employer M has established, on a reasonable and consistent basis, a quarterly period for making contributions to the HSAs of eligible employees on a pay-as-you-go basis. Beginning on January 1st, Employer M contributes $150 for the first three months of the calendar year to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual on that date. On January 15th, Employee V, an eligible individual, terminated employment after Employer M has contributed $150 to V's HSA.

On January 15th, Employer M hired Employee W, who becomes an eligible individual as of February 1st. On April 1st, Employer M has contributed $100 to W's HSA for the two months (February and March) in the quarter period that Employee W was an eligible employee. Employer M's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Maximum contribution permitted for all employees who are eligible individuals during the last month of the taxable year. An employer may contribute up to the maximum annual contribution amount for the calendar year (based on the employees' HDHP coverage) to the HSAs of all employees who are eligible individuals on the first day of the last month of the employees' taxable year, including employees who worked for the employer for less than the entire calendar year and employees who became eligible individuals after January 1st of the calendar year. For example, such contribution may be made on behalf of an eligible individual who is hired after January 1st or an employee who becomes an eligible individual after January 1st. Employers are not required to provide more than a pro-rata contribution based on the number of months that an individual was an eligible individual and employed by the employer during the year. However, if an employer contributes more than a pro-rata amount for the calendar year to the HSA of any eligible individual who is hired after January 1st of the calendar year or any employee who becomes an eligible individual any time after January 1st of the calendar year, the employer must contribute that same amount on an equal and uniform basis to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees (as defined in Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-1) who are hired or become eligible individuals after January 1st of the calendar year. Likewise, if an employer contributes the maximum annual contribution amount for the calendar year to the HSA of any eligible individual who is hired after January 1st of the calendar year or any employee who becomes an eligible individual any time after January 1st of the calendar year, the employer must contribute the maximum annual contribution amount on an equal and uniform basis to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees (as defined in Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-1) who are hired or become eligible individuals after January 1st of the calendar year. An employer who makes the maximum calendar year contribution or more than a pro-rata contribution to the HSAs of employees who become eligible individuals after the first day of the calendar year or eligible individuals who are hired after the first day of the calendar year will not fail to satisfy comparability merely because some employees will have received more contributions on a monthly basis than employees who worked the entire calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in paragraph (h) in this Q & A-2. In the following examples, no contributions are made through a section 125 cafeteria plan and none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. On January 1, 2010, Employer Q contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals with family HDHP coverage. In mid-March of the same year, Employer Q hires Employee A, an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. On April 1, 2010, Employer Q contributes $1,000 to the HSA of Employee A. In September of the same year, Employee B becomes an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. On October 1, 2010, Employer G contributes $1,000 to the HSA of Employee B. Employer Q does not make any other contributions for the 2010 calendar year. Employer Q's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. For the 2010 calendar year, Employer R only has two employees, Employee C and Employee D. Employee C, an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage, works for Employer R for the entire calendar year. Employee D, an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage works for Employer R from July 1st through December 31st. Employer R contributes $1,200 for the calendar year to the HSA of Employee C and $600 to the HSA of Employee D. Employer R does not make any other contributions for the 2010 calendar year. Employer R's contributions satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(j)</em> Effective/applicability date. The rules in paragraphs (h) and (i) of Q & A-2 are effective for employer contributions made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: How do the comparability rules apply to employer contributions to employees' HSAs if some non-collectively bargained employees work full-time

during the entire calendar year, and other non-collectively bargained employees work full-time for less than the entire calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: Employer contributions to the HSAs of employees who work full-time for less than twelve months satisfy the comparability rules if the contribution amount is comparable when determined on a month-to-month basis. For example, if the employer contributes $240 to the HSA of each full-time employee who works the entire calendar year, the employer must contribute $60 to the HSA of each full-time employee who works on the first day of each three months of the calendar year. The rules set forth in this Q & A-2 apply to employer contributions made on a pay-as-you-go basis or on a look-back basis as described in Q & A-3 of this section. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E(d)(2)(B).</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: May an employer make contributions for the entire year to the HSAs of its employees who are eligible individuals at the beginning of the calendar year (on a pre-funded basis) instead of contributing on a pay-as-you-go or on a look-back basis?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: (a) Contributions on a pre-funded basis. Yes. An employer may make contributions for the entire year to the HSAs of its employees who are eligible individuals at the beginning of the calendar year. An employer that pre-funds the HSAs of its employees will not fail to satisfy the comparability rules because an employee who terminates employment prior to the end of the calendar year has received more contributions on a monthly basis than employees who work the entire calendar year. See Q & A-12 of this section. Under section 223(d)(1)(E), an account beneficiary's interest in an HSA is nonforfeitable. An employer must make comparable contributions for all employees who are comparable participating employees for any month during the calendar year, including employees who are eligible individuals hired after the date of initial funding. An employer that makes HSA contributions on a pre-funded basis may also contribute on a pre-funded basis to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals hired after the date of initial funding. Alternatively, an employer that has pre-funded the HSAs of comparable participating employees may contribute to the HSAs of employees who are eligible individuals hired after the date of initial funding on a pay-as-you-go basis or on a look-back basis. An employer that makes HSA contributions on a pre-funded basis must use the same contribution method for all employees who are eligible individuals hired after the date of initial funding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-4:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> On January 1, Employer N contributes $1,200 for the calendar year on a pre-funded basis to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual. In mid-May, Employer N hires Employee B, who becomes an eligible individual as of June 1st. Therefore, Employer N is required to make comparable contributions to B's HSA beginning in June. Employer N satisfies the comparability rules with respect to contributions to B's HSA if it makes HSA contributions in any one of the following ways--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Pre-funding B's HSA by contributing $700 to B's HSA;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Contributing $100 per month on a pay-as-you-go basis to B's HSA; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Contributing to B's HSA at the end of the calendar year taking into account each month that B was an eligible individual and employed by Employer M.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If Employer M hires additional employees who are eligible individuals after initial funding, it must use the same contribution method for these employees that it used to contribute to B's HSA.</p><p class="depth0">Q-5: Must an employer use the same contribution method as described in Q & A-2 and Q & A-4 of this section for all employees who were comparable participating employees for any month during the calendar year?</p><p class="depth0">A-5: Yes. If an employer makes comparable HSA contributions on a pay-as-you-go basis, it must do so for each employee who is a comparable participating employee as of the first day of the month. If an employer makes comparable contributions on a look-back basis, it must do so for each employee who was a comparable participating employee for any month during the calendar year. If an employer makes HSA contributions on a pre-funded basis, it must do so for all employees who are comparable participating employees at the beginning of the calendar year and must make comparable

HSA contributions for all employees who are comparable participating employees for any month during the calendar year, including employees who are eligible individuals hired after the date of initial funding. See Q & A-4 of this section for rules regarding contributions for employees hired after initial funding.</p><p class="depth0">Q-6: How does an employer comply with the comparability rules if an employee has not established an HSA at the time the employer contributes to its employees' HSAs?</p><p class="depth0">A-6: (a) Employee has not established an HSA at the time the employer funds its employees' HSAs. If an employee has not established an HSA at the time the employer funds its employees' HSAs, the employer complies with the comparability rules by contributing comparable amounts plus reasonable interest to the employee's HSA when the employee establishes the HSA, taking into account each month that the employee was a comparable participating employee. See Q & A-13 of this section for rules regarding reasonable interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-6:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Beginning on January 1st, Employer O contributes $500 per calendar year on a pay-as-you-go basis to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual. Employee C is an eligible individual during the entire calendar year but does not establish an HSA until March. Notwithstanding C's delay in establishing an HSA, Employer O must make up the missed HSA contributions plus reasonable interest for January and February by April 15th of the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0">Q-7: If an employer bases its contributions on a percentage of the HDHP deductible, how is the correct percentage or dollar amount computed?</p><p class="depth0">A-7: (a) Computing HSA contributions. The correct percentage is determined by rounding to the nearest 1/100th of a percentage point and the dollar amount is determined by rounding to the nearest whole dollar.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-7:</p><p class="depth0">Example. In this Example, assume that each HDHP provided by Employer P satisfies the definition of an HDHP for the 2007 calendar year. In the 2007 calendar year, Employer P maintains two HDHPs.

Plan B has a deductible of $3,500 for self-only coverage.

who have worked for the employer for a specified number of years, do the contributions satisfy the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-10: No. If all comparable participating employees do not meet the age or length of service requirement, all comparable participating employees do not receive comparable contributions to their HSAs and the employer contributions fail to satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-11: If an employer makes additional contributions to the HSAs of all comparable participating employees who are eligible to make the additional contributions (HSA catch-up contributions) under section 223(b)(3), do the contributions satisfy the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-11: No. If all comparable participating employees are not eligible to make the additional HSA contributions under section 223(b)(3), all comparable participating employees do not receive comparable contributions to their HSAs, and the employer contributions fail to satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-12: If an employer's contributions to an employee's HSA result in non-comparable contributions, may the employer recoup the excess amount from the employee's HSA?</p><p class="depth0">A-12: No. An employer may not recoup from an employee's HSA any portion of the employer's contribution to the employee's HSA. Under section 223(d)(1)(E), an account beneficiary's interest in an HSA is nonforfeitable. However, an employer may make additional HSA contributions to satisfy the comparability rules. An employer may contribute up until April 15th following the calendar year in which the non-comparable contributions were made. An employer that makes additional HSA contributions to correct non-comparable contributions must also contribute reasonable interest. However, an employer is not required to contribute amounts in excess of the annual contribution limits in section 223(b).

However, if an employee has earlier notified the employer that he or she has established an HSA, or if the employer has previously made contributions to that employee's HSA, the employer may not condition making comparable

contributions on receipt of any additional notice from that employee. For each calendar year, a notice is deemed to be timely if the employer provides the notice no earlier than 90 days before the first HSA employer contribution for that calendar year and no later than January 15 of the following calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Model notice. Employers may use the following sample language as a basis in preparing their own notices.
Notice to Employees Regarding Employer Contributions to HSAs:</p><p class="depth0">This notice explains how you may be eligible to receive contributions from [employer] if you are covered by a High Deductible Health Plan (HDHP). [Employer] provides contributions to the Health Savings Account (HSA) of each employee who is [insert employer's eligibility requirements for HSA contributions] (``eligible employee''). If you are an eligible employee, you must do the following in order to receive an employer contribution:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Establish an HSA on or before the last day in February of [insert year after the year for which the contribution is being made] and;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notify [insert name and contact information for appropriate person to be contacted] of your HSA account information on or before the last day in February of [insert year after year for which the contribution is being made]. [Specify the HSA account information that the employee must provide (e.g., account number, name and address of trustee or custodian, etc.) and the method by which the employee must provide this account information (e.g., in writing, by e-mail, on a certain form, etc.)].</p><p class="depth0">If you establish your HSA on or before the last day of February in [insert year after year for which the contribution is being made] and notify [employer] of your HSA account information, you will receive your HSA contributions, plus reasonable interest, for [insert year for which contribution is being made] by April 15 of [insert year after year for which contribution is being made]. If, however, you do not establish your HSA or you do not notify us of your HSA account information by the deadline, then we are not required to make any contributions to your HSA for [insert applicable year]. You may notify us that you have established an HSA by sending an [e-mail or] a written notice to [insert name, title and, if applicable, e-mail address]. If you have any questions about this notice, you can contact [insert name and title] at [insert telephone number or other contact information].</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Electronic delivery. An employer may furnish the notice required under this section electronically in accordance with Sec. 1.401(a)-21 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this Q & A-14:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In a calendar year, Employer Q contributes to the HSAs of current employees who are eligible individuals covered under any HDHP. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer Q contributes $50 per month on the first day of each month, beginning January 1st, to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible employee on that date. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer Q provides written notice satisfying the content requirements of this Q & A-14 on October 16, 2008 to all employees regarding the availability of HSA contributions for eligible employees. For eligible employees who are hired after October 16, 2008, Employer Q provides such a notice no later than January 15, 2010. Employer Q's notice satisfies the notice timing requirements in paragraph (a)(1) of this Q & A-14.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer R's written cafeteria plan permits employees to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs. Employees making this election have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of their HSA pre-tax contribution. Employer R automatically contributes a non-elective matching contribution to the HSA of each employee who makes a pre-tax HSA contribution. Because Employer R's HSA contributions are made through the cafeteria plan, the comparability requirements do not apply to the HSA contributions made by Employer R. Consequently, Employer R is not required to provide written notice to its employees regarding the availability of this matching HSA contribution. See Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-5 for treatment of HSA contributions made through a cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In a calendar year, Employer S maintains an HDHP and only contributes to the HSAs of eligible employees who elect coverage under its HDHP. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer S employs ten eligible employees and all ten employees have elected coverage under Employer S's HDHP and have established HSAs. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer S makes comparable contributions to the HSAs of all ten employees. Employer S satisfies the comparability rules. Thus, Employer S is not required to provide written notice to its employees regarding the availability of HSA contributions for eligible employees.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In a calendar year, Employer T contributes to the HSAs of current full-time employees with family coverage under any HDHP. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer T provides timely written notice satisfying the content requirements of this section to

all employees regardless of HDHP coverage. Employer T makes identical monthly contributions to all eligible employees (meaning full time employees with family HDHP coverage) that establish HSAs. Employer T contributes comparable amounts (taking into account each month that the employee was a comparable participating employee) plus reasonable interest to the HSAs of the eligible employees that establish HSAs and provide the necessary information after the end of the year but on or before the last day of February, 2010. Employer T makes no contribution to the HSAs of employees that do not establish an HSA or that do not provide the necessary information on or before the last day of February, 2010. Employer T satisfies the comparability requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. For the 2009 calendar year, Employer V contributes to the HSAs of current full time employees with family coverage under any HDHP. Employer V has 500 current full time employees. As of the date for Employer V's first HSA contribution for the 2009 calendar year, 450 eligible employees have established HSAs. Employer V provides timely written notice satisfying the content requirements of this section only to those 50 eligible employees who have not established HSAs. Employer V makes identical quarterly contributions to the 450 eligible employees who established HSAs. By April 15, 2010, Employer V contributes comparable amounts to the other eligible employees who establish HSAs and provide the necessary information on or before the last day of February, 2010. Employer V makes no contribution to the HSAs of eligible employees that do not establish an HSA or that do not provide the necessary information on or before the last day of February, 2010. Employer V satisfies the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-15: For any calendar year, may an employer accelerate part or all of its contributions for the entire year to the HSAs of employees who have incurred, during the calendar year, qualified medical expenses (as defined in section 223(d)(2)) exceeding the employer's cumulative HSA contributions at that time?</p><p class="depth0">A-15: (a) In general. Yes. For any calendar year, an employer may accelerate part or all of its contributions for the entire year to the HSAs of employees who have incurred, during the calendar year, qualified medical expenses exceeding the employer's cumulative HSA contributions at that time. If an employer accelerates contributions to the HSA of any such eligible employee, all accelerated contributions must be available throughout the calendar year on an equal and uniform basis to all such eligible employees. Employers must establish reasonable uniform methods and requirements for accelerated contributions and the determination of medical expenses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Satisfying comparability. An employer that accelerates contributions to the HSAs of its employees will not fail to satisfy the comparability rules because employees who incur qualifying medical expenses exceeding the employer's cumulative HSA contributions at that time have received more contributions in a given period than comparable employees who do not incur such expenses, provided that all comparable employees receive the same amount or the same percentage for the calendar year. Also, an employer that accelerates contributions to the HSAs of its employees will not fail to satisfy the comparability rules because an employee who terminates employment prior to the end of the calendar year has received more contributions on a monthly basis than employees who work the entire calendar year. An employer is not required to contribute reasonable interest on either accelerated or non-accelerated HSA contributions. But see Q & A-6 and Q & A-12 of this section for when reasonable interest must be paid.</p><p class="depth0">Q-16: What is the effective date for the rules in Q & A-14 and Q & A-15 of this section?</p><p class="depth0">A-16: These regulations apply to employer contributions made for calendar years beginning on or after January 1, 2009.

Sec. 54.4980G-5  HSA comparability rules and cafeteria plans and waiver of excise tax.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: If an employer makes contributions through a section 125 cafeteria plan to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual, are the contributions subject to the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: (a) In general. No. The comparability rules do not apply to HSA contributions that an employer makes through a section 125 cafeteria plan.

However, contributions to an HSA made through a cafeteria plan are subject to the section 125 nondiscrimination rules (eligibility rules, contributions and benefits tests and key employee concentration tests). See section 125(b), (c) and (g) and the regulations thereunder.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Contributions made through a section 125 cafeteria plan. Employer contributions to employees' HSAs are made through a section 125 cafeteria plan and are subject to the section 125 cafeteria plan nondiscrimination rules and not the comparability rules if under the written cafeteria plan, the employees have the right to elect to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of all or a portion of an HSA contribution (meaning that all or a portion of the HSA contributions are available as pre-tax salary reduction amounts), regardless of whether an employee actually elects to contribute any amount to the HSA by salary reduction.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: If an employer makes contributions through a cafeteria plan to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual in an amount equal to the amount of the employee's HSA contribution or a percentage of the amount of the employee's HSA contribution (matching contributions), are the contributions subject to the section 4980G comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: No. The comparability rules do not apply to HSA contributions that an employer makes through a section 125 cafeteria plan. Thus, where matching contributions are made by an employer through a cafeteria plan, the contributions are not subject to the comparability rules of section 4980G. However, contributions, including matching contributions, to an HSA made under a cafeteria plan are subject to the section 125 nondiscrimination rules (eligibility rules, contributions and benefits tests and key employee concentration tests). See Q & A-1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: If under the employer's cafeteria plan, employees who are eligible individuals and who participate in health assessments, disease management programs or wellness programs receive an employer contribution to an HSA and the employees have the right to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs, are the contributions subject to the comparability rules?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) In general. No. The comparability rules do not apply to employer contributions to an HSA made through a cafeteria plan. See Q & A-1 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in this Sec. 54.4980G-5. The examples read as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Employer A's written cafeteria plan permits employees to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs. Employees making this election have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of their HSA pre-tax contribution. The section 125 cafeteria plan nondiscrimination rules and not the comparability rules apply because the HSA contributions are made through the cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Employer B's written cafeteria plan permits employees to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs. Employees making this election have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of their HSA pre-tax contribution. Employer B automatically contributes a non-elective matching contribution or seed money to the HSA of each employee who makes a pre-tax HSA contribution. The section 125 cafeteria plan nondiscrimination rules and not the comparability rules apply to Employer B's HSA contributions because the HSA contributions are made through the cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Employer C's written cafeteria plan permits employees to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs. Employees making this election have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of their HSA pre-tax contribution. Employer C makes a non-elective contribution to the HSAs of all employees who complete a health risk assessment and participate in Employer C's wellness program. Employees do not have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of Employer C's non-elective contribution. The section 125 cafeteria plan nondiscrimination rules and not the comparability rules apply to Employer C's HSA contributions because the HSA contributions are made through the cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Employer D's written cafeteria plan permits employees to elect to make pre-tax salary reduction contributions to their HSAs. Employees making this election have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of their HSA pre-tax contribution. Employees participating in the plan who are eligible individuals receive automatic employer contributions to their

HSAs. Employees make no election with respect to Employer D's contribution and do not have the right to receive cash or other taxable benefits in lieu of Employer D's contribution but are permitted to make their own pre-tax salary reduction contributions to fund their HSAs. The section 125 cafeteria plan nondiscrimination rules and not the comparability rules apply to Employer D's HSA contributions because the HSA contributions are made through the cafeteria plan.</p><p class="depth0">Q-4: May all or part of the excise tax imposed under section 4980G be waived?</p><p class="depth0">A-4: In the case of a failure which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, all or a portion of the excise tax imposed under section 4980G may be waived to the extent that the payment of the tax would be excessive relative to the failure involved. See sections 4980G(b) and 4980E(c).

Sec. 54.4980G-6  Special rule for contributions made to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0">Q-1: May an employer make larger contributions to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees than to the HSAs of highly compensated employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-1: Yes. Employers may make larger HSA contributions for nonhighly compensated employees who are comparable participating employees than for highly compensated employees who are comparable participating employees. See Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-1 for the definition of comparable participating employee. For purposes of this section, highly compensated employee is defined under section 414(q). Nonhighly compensated employees are employees that are not highly compensated employees. The comparability rules continue to apply with respect to contributions to the HSAs of all nonhighly compensated employees. Employers must make comparable contributions for the calendar year to the HSA of each nonhighly compensated employee who is a comparable participating employee.</p><p class="depth0">Q-2: May an employer make larger contributions to the HSAs of highly compensated employees than to the HSAs of nonhighly compensated employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-2: (a) In general. No. Employer contributions to HSAs for highly compensated employees who are comparable participating employees may not be larger than employer HSA contributions for nonhighly compensated employees who are comparable participating employees. The comparability rules continue to apply with respect to contributions to the HSAs of all highly compensated employees. Employers must make comparable contributions for the calendar year to the HSA of each highly compensated comparable participating employee. See Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-1 for the definition of comparable participating employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules in Q & A-1 and Q & A-2 of this section. No contributions are made through a section 125 cafeteria plan and none of the employees in the following examples are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. All of the employees in the following examples have the same HDHP deductible for the same category of coverage.</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. In 2010, Employer A contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer A makes no contribution to the HSA of any full-time highly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer A's HSA contributions for calendar year 2010 satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. In 2010, Employer B contributes $2,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer B also contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time highly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer B's HSA contributions for calendar year 2010 satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. In 2010, Employer C contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer C contributes $2,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time highly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer C's HSA contributions for calendar year 2010 do not satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. In 2010, Employer D contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of

each full-time nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. Employer D also contributes $1,000 to the HSA of each full-time highly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with self-only HDHP coverage. In addition, the employer contributes an additional $500 to the HSA of each nonhighly compensated employee who participates in a wellness program. The nonhighly compensated employees did not receive comparable contributions, and, therefore, Employer D's HSA contributions for calendar year 2010 do not satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. In 2010, Employer E contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time non-management nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. Employer E also contributes $500 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time management nonhighly compensated employee who is an eligible individual with family HDHP coverage. The nonhighly compensated employees did not receive comparable contributions, and, therefore, Employer E's HSA contributions for calendar year 2010 do not satisfy the comparability rules.</p><p class="depth0">Q-3: May an employer make larger HSA contributions for employees with self plus two HDHP coverage than employees with self plus one HDHP coverage even if the employees with self plus two are all highly compensated employees and the employees with self plus one are all nonhighly compensated employees?</p><p class="depth0">A-3: (a) Yes. Q & A-1 in Sec. 54.4980G-4 provides that an employer's contribution with respect to the self plus two category of HDHP coverage may not be less than the contribution with respect to the self plus one category and the contribution with respect to the self plus three or more category may not be less than the contribution with respect to the self plus two category. Therefore, the comparability rules are not violated if an employer makes a larger HSA contribution for the self plus two category of HDHP coverage than to self plus one coverage, even if the employees with self plus two coverage are all highly compensated employees and the employees with self plus one coverage are all nonhighly compensated employees. Likewise, the comparability rules are not violated if an employer makes a larger HSA contribution for the self plus three category of HDHP coverage than to self plus two coverage, even if the employees with self plus three coverage are all highly compensated employees and the employees with self plus two coverage are all nonhighly compensated employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the rules in paragraph (a) of this Q & A-3.

In 2010, Employer F contributes $1,000 for the calendar year to the HSA of each full-time employee who is an eligible individual with self plus one HDHP coverage. Employer F contributes $1,500 for the calendar year to the HSA of each employee who is an eligible individual with self plus two HDHP coverage. The deductible for both the self plus one HDHP and the self plus two HDHP is $2,000. Employee A, an eligible individual, is a nonhighly compensated employee with self plus one coverage. Employee B, an eligible individual, is a highly compensated employee with self plus two coverage. For the 2010 calendar year, Employer F contributes $1,000 to Employee A's HSA and $1,500 to Employee B's HSA.

Sec. 54.4980H-2  Applicable large employer and applicable large employer member.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 4980H applies to an applicable large employer and to all of the applicable large employer members that comprise that applicable large employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determining applicable large employer status--(1) In general. An employer's status as an applicable large employer for a calendar year is determined by taking the sum of the total number of full-time employees (including any seasonal workers) for each calendar month in the preceding calendar year and the total number of FTEs (including any seasonal workers) for each calendar month in the preceding calendar year, and dividing by 12. The result, if not a whole number, is then rounded to the next lowest whole number. If the result of this calculation is less than 50, the employer is not an applicable large employer for the current calendar year. If the result of this calculation is 50 or more, the employer is an applicable large employer for the current calendar year, unless the seasonal worker exception in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general.

The result, if not a whole number, is then rounded to the next lowest whole number. If the result of this calculation is less than 50, the employer is not an applicable large employer for the current calendar year. If the result of this calculation is 50 or more, the employer is an applicable large employer for the current calendar year, unless the seasonal worker exception in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Seasonal worker exception. If the sum of an employer's full-time employees and FTEs exceeds 50 for 120 days or less during the preceding calendar year, and the employees in excess of 50 who were employed during that period of no more than 120 days are seasonal workers, the employer is not considered to employ more than 50 full-time employees (including FTEs) and the employer is not an applicable large employer for the current calendar year. In the case of an employer that was not in existence on any business day during the preceding calendar year, if the employer reasonably expects that the sum of its full-time employees and FTEs for the current calendar year will exceed 50 for 120 days or less during the calendar year, and that the employees in excess of 50 who will be employed during that period of no more than 120 days will be seasonal workers, the employer is not an applicable large employer for the current calendar year. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2) only, four calendar months may be treated as the equivalent of 120 days. The four calendar months and the 120 days are not required to be consecutive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Employers not in existence in preceding calendar year. An employer not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year is an applicable large employer for the current calendar year if the employer is reasonably expected to employ an average of at least 50 full-time employees (taking into account FTEs) on business days during the current calendar year and it actually employs an average of at least 50 full-time employees (taking into account FTEs) on business days during the calendar year. An employer is treated as not having been in existence throughout the prior calendar year only if the employer was not in existence on any business day in the prior calendar year. See paragraph (b)(2) of this section for the application of the seasonal worker exception to employers not in existence in the preceding calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for government entities, churches, and conventions and associations of churches. [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Transition rule for an employer's first year as an applicable large employer. With respect to an employee who was not offered coverage by the employer at any point during the prior calendar year, if the applicable large employer offers coverage to the employee on or before April 1 of the first calendar year for which the employer is an applicable large employer, the employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H by reason of its failure to offer coverage to the employee for January through March of that year, provided that this relief applies only with respect to potential liability under section 4980H(b) (for January through March of the first calendar year for which the employer is an applicable large employer) if the coverage offered by April 1 provides minimum value. If the employer does not offer coverage to the employee by April 1, the employer may be subject to a section 4980H(a) assessable payment with respect January through March of the first calendar year for which the employer is an applicable large employer in addition to any later calendar months for which coverage was not offered. If the employer offers coverage to the employee by April 1 that does not provided minimum value, the employer may be subject to a section 4980H(b) assessable payment with respect to the employee for January through March of the first calendar year for which the employer is an applicable large employer in addition to any later calendar months for which coverage does not provide minimum value or is not affordable. This rule applies only during the first year that an employer is an applicable large employer (and would not apply if, for example, the employer falls below the 50 full-time employee (plus FTE) threshold for a subsequent calendar year and then increases employment and becomes an applicable large employer again).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Full-time equivalent employees (FTEs)--(1) In general. In determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer, the number of FTEs it employed during the preceding calendar year is taken into account.

the employer's FTEs for that calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. In determining whether an employer is an applicable large employer, the number of FTEs it employed during the preceding calendar year is taken into account.

the employer's FTEs for that calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculating the number of FTEs. The number of FTEs for each calendar month in the preceding calendar year is determined by calculating the aggregate number of hours of service for that calendar month for employees who were not full-time employees (but not more than 120 hours of service for any employee) and dividing that number by 120. In determining the number of FTEs for each calendar month, fractions are taken into account; an employer may round the number of FTEs for each calendar month to the nearest one hundredth.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section. In these examples, hours of service are computed following the rules set forth in Sec. 54.4980H-3, and references to years refer to calendar years unless otherwise specified. The employers in Example 2 through Example 6 are each the sole applicable large employer member of the applicable large employer, as determined under section 414(b), (c), (m), and (o).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For all of 2015 and 2016, Corporation Z owns 100 percent of all classes of stock of Corporation Y and Corporation X. Corporation Z has no employees at any time in 2015. For every calendar month in 2015, Corporation Y has 40 full-time employees and Corporation X has 60 full-time employees. Corporations Z, Y, and X are a controlled group of corporations under section 414(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because Corporations Z, Y and X have a combined total of 100 full-time employees during 2015, Corporations Z, Y, and X together are an applicable large employer for 2016. Each of Corporations Z, Y and X is an applicable large employer member for 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. During each calendar month of 2015, Employer W has 20 full-time employees each of whom averages 35 hours of service per week, 40 employees each of whom averages 90 hours of service per calendar month, and no seasonal workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Each of the 20 employees who average 35 hours of service per week count as one full-time employee for each calendar month. To determine the number of FTEs for each calendar month, the total hours of service of the employees who are not full-time employees (but not more than 120 hours of service per employee) are aggregated and divided by 120. The result is that the employer has 30 FTEs for each calendar month (40 x 90 = 3,600, and 3,600 / 120 = 30). Because Employer W has 50 full-time employees (the sum of 20 full-time employees and 30 FTEs) during each calendar month in 2015, and because the seasonal worker exception is not applicable, Employer W is an applicable large employer for 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. During 2015, Employer V has 40 full-time employees for the entire calendar year, none of whom are seasonal workers. In addition, Employer V also has 80 seasonal workers who are full-time employees and who work for Employer V from September through December 2015. Employer V has no FTEs during 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Before applying the seasonal worker exception, Employer V has 40 full-time employees during each of eight calendar months of 2015, and 120 full-time employees during each of four calendar months of 2015, resulting in an average of 66.67 full-time employees for the year. However, Employer V's workforce exceeded 50 full-time employees (counting seasonal workers) for no more than four calendar months (treated as the equivalent of 120 days) in calendar year 2015, and the number of full-time employees would be less than 50 during those months if seasonal workers were disregarded. Accordingly, because after application of the seasonal worker exception described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section Employer V is not considered to employ more than 50 full-time employees, Employer V is not an applicable large employer for 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 3, except that Employer V has 20 FTEs in August, some of whom are seasonal workers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. The seasonal worker exception described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply if the number of an employer's full-time employees (including seasonal workers) and FTEs exceeds 50 for more than 120 days during the calendar year. Because Employer V has at least 50 full-time employees for a period greater than four calendar months (treated as the equivalent of 120 days) during 2015, the exception described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section does not apply. Employer V averaged 68 full-time employees in 2015: [(40 x 7) + (60 x 1) + (120 x 4)] / 12 = 68.33, and accordingly, Employer V is an applicable large employer for calendar year 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Corporation S is incorporated on January 1, 2016. On January 1, 2016, Corporation S has three employees. However, prior to incorporation, Corporation S's owners purchased a factory intended to open within two calendar months of incorporation and to employ approximately 100 full-time employees. By

March 15, 2016, Corporation S has more than 75 full-time employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because Corporation S can reasonably be expected to employ on average at least 50 full-time employees on business days during 2016, and actually employs an average of at least 50 full-time employees on business days during 2016, Corporation S is an applicable large employer (and an applicable large employer member) for calendar year 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. As of January 1, 2015, Employer R has been in existence for several years and did not average 50 or more full-time employees (including FTEs) on business days during 2014. Employer R averages 50 or more full-time employees on business days during 2015, so that for 2016 Employer R is an applicable large employer, for the first time. For all the calendar months of 2016, Employer R has the same 60 full-time employees. Employer R offered 20 of those full-time employees healthcare coverage during 2015, and offered those same employees coverage providing minimum value for 2016. With respect to the 40 full-time employees who were not offered coverage during 2015, Employer R offers coverage providing minimum value for calendar months April 2016 through December 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For the 40 full-time employees not offered coverage during 2015 and offered coverage providing minimum value for the calendar months April 2016 through December 2016, the failure to offer coverage during the calendar months January 2016 through March 2016 will not result in an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to those employees for those three calendar months. For those same 40 full-time employees, the offer of coverage during the calendar months April 2016 through December 2016 may result in an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to any employee for any calendar month for which the offer is not affordable and for which Employer R has received a Section 1411 Certification. For the other 20 full-time employees, the offer of coverage during 2016 may result in an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) for any calendar month if the offer is not affordable and Employer R has received a Section 1411 Certification with respect to the employee who received the offer of coverage. For all calendar months of 2016, Employer R will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Additional guidance. With respect to an employer's status as an applicable large employer, the Commissioner may prescribe additional guidance of general applicability, published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 54.4980H-3  Determining full-time employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. This section sets forth the rules for determining hours of service and status as a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980H. These regulations provide two methods for determining full-time employee status--the monthly measurement method, set forth in paragraph (c) of this section, and the look-back measurement method, set forth in paragraph (d) of this section. The monthly measurement method applies for purposes of determining and calculating liability under section 4980H(a) and (b), as well as, with respect to paragraph (c)(1) of this section, determination of applicable large employer status (except with respect to the weekly rule under the monthly measurement method). The look-back measurement method applies solely for purposes of determining and calculating liability under section 4980H(a) and (b) (and not for purposes of determining status as an applicable large employer). See Sec. 54.4980H-1(a)(21) for the definition of full-time employee. The rules set forth in this section prescribe the minimum standards for determining status as a full-time employee for purposes of section 4980H; treatment of additional employees as full-time employees for other purposes does not affect section 4980H liability if those employees are not full-time employees under the look-back measurement method or the monthly measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Hours of service--(1) In general. The following rules on the calculation of hours of service apply for purposes of applying both the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The following rules on the calculation of hours of service apply for purposes of applying both the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Hourly employees calculation. Under the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method, for employees paid on an hourly basis, an employer must calculate actual hours of service from records of hours worked and hours for which payment is made or due.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Non-hourly employees calculation--(i) In general. Except as otherwise provided, under the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method, for employees paid on a non-hourly basis, an employer must calculate hours of service by using one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Except as otherwise provided, under the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method, for employees paid on a non-hourly basis, an employer must calculate hours of service by using one of the following methods:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Using actual hours of service from records of hours worked and hours for which payment is made or due;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Using a days-worked equivalency whereby the employee is credited with eight hours of service for each day for which the employee would be required to be credited with at least one hour of service in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Using a weeks-worked equivalency whereby the employee is credited with 40 hours of service for each week for which the employee would be required to be credited with at least one hour of service in accordance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Change in method. An employer must use one of the three methods in paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section for calculating the hours of service for non-hourly employees. An employer is not required to use the same method for all non-hourly employees, and may apply different methods for different categories of non-hourly employees, provided the categories are reasonable and consistently applied. Similarly, an applicable large employer member is not required to apply the same methods as other applicable large employer members of the same applicable large employer for the same or different categories of non-hourly employees, provided that in each case the categories are reasonable and consistently applied by the applicable large employer member. An employer may change the method of calculating the hours of service of non-hourly employees (or of one or more categories of non-hourly employees) for each calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Prohibited use of equivalencies. The number of hours of service calculated using the days-worked or weeks-worked equivalency must reflect generally the hours actually worked and the hours for which payment is made or due. An employer is not permitted to use the days-worked equivalency or the weeks-worked equivalency if the result is to substantially understate an employee's hours of service in a manner that would cause that employee not to be treated as a full-time employee, or if the result is to understate the hours of service of a substantial number of employees (even if no particular employee's hours of service are understated substantially and even if the understatement would not cause the employee to not be treated as a full-time employee). For example, as to the former, an employer may not use a days-worked equivalency in the case of an employee who generally works three 10-hour days per week, because the equivalency would substantially understate the employee's hours of service as 24 hours of service per week, which would result in the employee being treated as not a full-time employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Monthly measurement method--(1) In general. Under the monthly measurement method, an applicable large employer member determines each employee's status as a full-time employee by counting the employee's hours of service for each calendar month. See Sec. 54.4980H-1(a)(21) for the definition of full-time employee. This paragraph (c)(1) (except with respect to the weekly rule) applies for purposes of the determination of status as an applicable large employer; paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section do not apply for purposes of the determination of status as an applicable large employer. For rules regarding the use of the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method for different categories of employees, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. Under the monthly measurement method, an applicable large employer member determines each employee's status as a full-time employee by counting the employee's hours of service for each calendar month. See Sec. 54.4980H-1(a)(21) for the definition of full-time employee. This paragraph (c)(1) (except with respect to the weekly rule) applies for purposes of the determination of status as an applicable large employer; paragraphs (c)(2) through (4) of this section do not apply for purposes of the determination of status as an applicable large employer. For rules regarding the use of the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method for different categories of employees, see paragraph (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Employee first otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage. The rule in this paragraph (c)(2) applies with respect to an employee who, in a calendar month, first becomes otherwise eligible to be offered coverage under a group health plan of an employer using the monthly measurement method with respect to that employee. For purposes of this paragraph (c)(2), an employee is otherwise eligible to be offered coverage under a group health plan for a calendar month if, pursuant to the terms of the plan as in effect for that calendar month, the employee meets all conditions to be offered coverage under

the plan for that calendar month, other than the completion of a waiting period, within the meaning of Sec. 54.9801-2, and an employee is first otherwise eligible if the employee has not previously been eligible or otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer during the employee's period of employment. An employer is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to an employee for each calendar month during the period of three full calendar months beginning with the first full calendar month in which the employee is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer, provided that the employee is offered coverage no later than the first day of the first calendar month immediately following the three-month period if the employee is still employed on that day. If the coverage for which the employee is otherwise eligible during the three-month period, and which the employee actually is offered on the day following that three-month period if still employed, provides minimum value, the employer also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to that employee for the three-month period. This rule cannot apply more than once per period of employment of an employee. If an employee terminates employment and returns under circumstances that would constitute a rehire as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the rule in this paragraph (c)(2) may apply again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Use of weekly periods. With respect to a category of employees for whom an employer uses the monthly measurement method, an employer may determine full-time employee status for a calendar month based on hours of service over a period that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Begins on the first day of the week that includes the first day of the calendar month, provided that the period over which hours of service are measured does not include the week in which falls the last day of the calendar month (unless that week ends with the last day of the calendar month, in which case it is included); or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> begins on the first day of the week immediately subsequent to the week that includes the first day of the calendar month (unless the week begins on the first day of the calendar month, in which case it is included), provided the period over which hours of service are measured includes the week in which falls the last day of the calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employees rehired after termination of employment or resuming service after other absence--(i) Treatment as a new employee after a period of absence for employees of employers other than educational organizations. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section (related to rules for employers that are educational organizations), an employee who resumes providing services to (or is otherwise credited with an hour of service for) an applicable large employer after a period during which the individual was not credited with any hours of service may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, and therefore may be treated as a new employee upon the resumption of services only if the employee did not have an hour of service for the applicable large employer for a period of at least 13 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the resumption of services. The rule set forth in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) applies solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, upon the resumption of services, is treated as a new employee or as a continuing employee, and does not determine whether the employee is treated as a continuing full-time employee (for example, an employee on leave) or a terminated employee for some or all of the period during which no hours of service are credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Treatment as a new employee after a period of absence for employees of employers other than educational organizations. Except as provided in paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section (related to rules for employers that are educational organizations), an employee who resumes providing services to (or is otherwise credited with an hour of service for) an applicable large employer after a period during which the individual was not credited with any hours of service may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, and therefore may be treated as a new employee upon the resumption of services only if the employee did not have an hour of service for the applicable large employer for a period of at least 13 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the resumption of services. The rule set forth in this paragraph (c)(4)(i) applies solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, upon the resumption of services, is treated as a new employee or as a continuing employee, and does not determine whether the employee is treated as a continuing full-time employee (for example, an employee on leave) or a terminated employee for some or all of the period during which no hours of service are credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment as a new employee after a period of absence for employees of educational organizations. With respect to an employer that is an educational organization, an employee who resumes providing services to (or is otherwise credited with an hour of service for) an applicable large employer after a period during which the individual was not credited with any hours of service may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, and therefore may be treated as a new employee upon the resumption of services, only if the employee did not have an hour of service for the applicable

large employer for a period of at least 26 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the resumption of services. The rule set forth in this paragraph (c)(4)(ii) applies solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, upon the resumption of services, is treated as a new employee or as a continuing employee, and does not determine whether the employee is treated as a continuing full-time employee (for example, an employee on leave) or a terminated employee for some or all of the period during which no hours of service are credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Averaging method for special unpaid leave and employment break periods. The averaging method for periods of special unpaid leave and employment break periods does not apply under the monthly measurement method, regardless of whether the employer is (or is not) an educational organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment of continuing employee. The rule set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section applies to an employee treated as a continuing employee in the same way that it applies to an employee who has not experienced a period with no hours of service. A continuing employee treated as a full-time employee is treated as offered coverage upon resumption of services if the employee is offered coverage as of the first day that employee is credited with an hour of service, or, if later, as soon as administratively practicable. For this purpose, offering coverage by no later than the first day of the calendar month following resumption of services is deemed to be as soon as administratively practicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Rule of parity. For purposes of determining the period after which an employee may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, an applicable large employer may choose a period, measured in weeks, of at least four consecutive weeks during which the employee was not credited with any hours of service that exceeds the number of weeks of that employee's period of employment with the applicable large employer immediately preceding the period that is shorter than 13 weeks (for an employee of an educational organization employer, a period that is shorter than 26 weeks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> International transfers. An employer may treat an employee as having terminated employment if the employee transfers to a position at the same applicable large employer (including a different applicable large employer member that is part of the same applicable large employer) if the position is anticipated to continue indefinitely or for at least 12 months and if substantially all of the compensation will constitute income from sources without the United States (within the meaning of sections 861 through 863 and the regulations thereunder). With respect to an employee transferring from a position that was anticipated to continue indefinitely or for at least 12 months and in which substantially all of the compensation for the hours of service constitutes income from sources without the United States (within the meaning of sections 861 through 863 and the regulations thereunder) to a position at the same applicable large employer (including a different applicable large employer member that is part of the same applicable large employer) with respect to which substantially all of the compensation will constitute U.S. source income, the employer may treat that employee as a new hire to the extent consistent with the rules related to rehired employees as set forth in paragraph (c)(4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rules of paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. In each example, the employer is an applicable large employer with 200 full-time employees (including FTEs) that uses the monthly measurement method to identify full-time employees and offers coverage only to employees who are full-time employees (and their dependents).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Z uses the monthly measurement method. Employer Z hires Employee A on January 1, 2016. For each calendar month in 2016, Employee A averages 20 hours of service per week and is not eligible (or otherwise eligible) for an offer of coverage under the group health plan of Employer Z. Effective January 1, 2017, Employee A is promoted to a position that is eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of Employer Z, following completion of a 90-day waiting period. For

January 2017 through March 2017, Employee A meets all of the conditions for eligibility under the group health plan, other than completion of the waiting period. The coverage that would have been offered to Employee A under the terms of the plan, but for the waiting period, during those three months would have provided minimum value. Effective April 1, 2017, Employer Z offers Employee A coverage that provides minimum value. Employee A averages 40 hours of service per week for each calendar month in 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because Employer Z offers minimum value coverage to Employee A no later than the first day following the period of three full calendar months beginning with the first full calendar month in which Employee A is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of Employer Z, Employer Z is not subject to an assessable payment for January 2017 through March 2017 under section 4980H by reason of its failure to offer coverage to Employee A during those months. For calendar months after March 2017, an offer of minimum value coverage may result in an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to Employee A for any month for which the offer is not affordable and for which Employer Z has received a Section 1411 Certification. Employer Z is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H by reason of its failure to offer coverage to Employee A during each month of 2016 because for each month of 2016, Employee A was not a full-time employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same as Example 1, except that Employee A has zero hours of service during a nine week period of unpaid leave (that constitutes special unpaid leave) beginning on June 25, 2017, and ending on August 26, 2017. As a result of the nine week period during which Employee A has zero hours of service, Employee A averages less than 30 hours of service per week for July 2017 and August 2017. Employee A averages more than 30 hours of service per week for each month between and including September 2017 through December 2017. Employer Z does not use the rule of parity, set forth in paragraph (c)(4)(v) of this section, and Employer Z is not an educational organization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because Employee A resumes providing services for Employer Z after a period during which the employee was not credited with any hours of service of less than 13 consecutive weeks, Employer Z may not treat Employee A as having terminated employment and having been rehired. Therefore, Employer Z may not treat Employee A as a new employee upon the resumption of services, and, accordingly, Employer Z may not again apply the rule set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Although the nine consecutive weeks of zero hours of service constitute special unpaid leave, the averaging method for periods of special unpaid leave does not apply under the monthly measurement method. Therefore, Employer Z may treat Employee A as a non-full-time employee for July 2017 and August 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Y uses the monthly measurement method in combination with the weekly rule for purposes of determining whether an employee is a full-time employee for a particular calendar month. For purposes of applying the weekly rule, Employer Y uses the period of Sunday through Saturday as a week and includes the week that includes the first day of a calendar month and excludes the week that includes the last day of a calendar month (except in any case in which the last day of the calendar month occurs on a Saturday). Employer Y measures hours of service for the five weeks from Sunday, December 27, 2015, through Saturday, January 30, 2016, to determine an employee's full-time employee status for January 2016, for the four weeks from Sunday, January 31, 2016, through Saturday, February 27, 2016, to determine an employee's status for February 2016, and the four weeks from Sunday, February 28, 2016, through Saturday, March 26, 2016, to determine an employee's status for March 2016. For January 2016, Employer Y treats an employee as a full-time employee if the employee has at least 150 hours of service (30 hours per week x 5 weeks). For February 2016 and March 2016, Employer Y treats an employee as a full-time employee if the employee has at least 120 hours of service (30 hours per week x 4 weeks).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer Y has correctly applied the weekly rule as part of the monthly measurement method for determining each employee's status as a full-time employee for the months January, February, and March 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Look-back measurement method--(1) Ongoing employees--(i) In general. Under the look-back measurement method for ongoing employees, an applicable large employer determines each ongoing employee's full-time employee status by looking back at the standard measurement period. The applicable large employer member determines the months in which the standard measurement period starts and ends, provided that the determination must be made on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees in the same category (see paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section for a list of permissible categories). For example, if an applicable large employer

member chooses a standard measurement period of 12 months, the applicable large employer member could choose to make it the calendar year, a non-calendar plan year, or a different 12-month period, such as one that ends shortly before the start of the plan's annual open enrollment period. If the applicable large employer member determines that an employee was employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the standard measurement period, then the applicable large employer member must treat the employee as a full-time employee during a subsequent stability period, regardless of the employee's number of hours of service during the stability period, so long as he or she remains an employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Ongoing employees--(i) In general. Under the look-back measurement method for ongoing employees, an applicable large employer determines each ongoing employee's full-time employee status by looking back at the standard measurement period.

Under the look-back measurement method for ongoing employees, an applicable large employer determines each ongoing employee's full-time employee status by looking back at the standard measurement period. The applicable large employer member determines the months in which the standard measurement period starts and ends, provided that the determination must be made on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees in the same category (see paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section for a list of permissible categories).

For payroll periods that are one week, two weeks, or semi-monthly in duration, an employer is permitted to treat as a measurement period a period that ends on the last day of the payroll period preceding the payroll period that includes the date that would otherwise be the last day of the measurement period, provided that the measurement period begins on the first day of the payroll period that includes the date that would otherwise be the first day of the measurement period. An employer may also treat as a measurement period a period that begins on the first day of the payroll period that follows the payroll period that includes the date that would otherwise be the first day of the measurement period, provided that the measurement period ends on the last day of the payroll period that includes the date that would otherwise be the last day of the measurement period. For example, an employer using the calendar year as a measurement period could exclude the entire payroll period that included January 1 (the beginning of the year) if it included the entire payroll period that included December 31 (the end of that same year), or, alternatively, could exclude the entire payroll period that included December 31 of a calendar year if it included the entire payroll period that included January 1 of that calendar year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employee determined to be employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week. An employee who was employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the standard measurement period must be treated as a full-time employee for a stability period that begins immediately after the standard measurement period and any applicable administrative period. The stability period must be at least six consecutive calendar months but no shorter in duration than the standard measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Employee determined not to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week. If an employee was not employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during the standard measurement period, the applicable large employer member may treat the employee as not a full-time employee during the stability period that follows, but is not longer than, the standard measurement period. The stability period must begin immediately after the end of the measurement period and any applicable administrative period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Permissible employee categories. Different applicable large employer members of the same applicable large employer may use measurement periods and stability periods that differ either in length or in their starting or ending dates. In addition, subject to the rules governing the relationship between the length of the measurement period and the stability period, applicable large employer members may use measurement periods and stability periods that differ either in length or in their starting and ending dates for--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Collectively bargained employees and non-collectively bargained employees,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Each group of collectively bargained employees covered by a separate collective bargaining agreement,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Salaried employees and hourly employees, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Employees whose primary places of employment are in different States.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Optional administrative period. An applicable large employer member may provide for an administrative period that begins immediately after the end of a standard measurement period and that ends immediately before the associated stability period; however, any administrative period between the standard measurement period and the

stability period for ongoing employees may neither reduce nor lengthen the measurement period or the stability period. The administrative period following the standard measurement period may last up to 90 days. To prevent this administrative period from creating a period during which coverage is not available, the administrative period must overlap with the prior stability period, so that, during any such administrative period applicable to ongoing employees following a standard measurement period, ongoing employees who are enrolled in coverage because of their status as full-time employees based on a prior measurement period must continue to be covered through the administrative period. Applicable large employer members may use administrative periods that differ in length for the categories of employees identified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Change in employment status. Except as provided in paragraph (f)(2) of this section, if an ongoing employee experiences a change in employment status before the end of a stability period, the change will not affect the application of the classification of the employee as a full-time employee (or not a full-time employee) for the remaining portion of the stability period. For example, if an ongoing employee in a certain position of employment is not treated as a full-time employee during a stability period because the employee's hours of service during the prior measurement period were insufficient for full-time-employee treatment, and the employee experiences a change in employment status that involves an increased level of hours of service, the treatment of the employee as a non-full-time employee during the remainder of the stability period is unaffected. Similarly, if an ongoing employee in a certain position of employment is treated as a full-time employee during a stability period because the employee's hours of service during the prior measurement period were sufficient for full-time-employee treatment, and the employee experiences a change in employment status that involves a lower level of hours of service, the treatment of the employee as a full-time employee during the remainder of the stability period is unaffected.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the application of paragraph (d)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Facts. Employer Z is an applicable large employer member and computes hours of service following the rules in this paragraph (d)(1). Employer Z chooses to use a 12-month stability period that begins January 1 and a 12-month standard measurement period that begins October 15. Consistent with the terms of Employer Z's group health plan, only employees classified as full-time employees using the look-back measurement method are eligible for coverage. Employer Z chooses to use an administrative period between the end of the standard measurement period (October 14) and the beginning of the stability period (January 1) to determine which employees were employed on average 30 hours of service per week during the measurement period, notify them of their eligibility for the plan for the calendar year beginning on January 1 and of the coverage available under the plan, answer questions and collect materials from employees, and enroll those employees who elect coverage in the plan. Previously-determined full-time employees already enrolled in coverage continue to be offered coverage through the administrative period. Employee A and Employee B have been employed by Employer Z for several years, continuously from their start date. Employee A was employed on average 30 hours of service per week during the standard measurement period that begins October 15, 2015, and ends October 14, 2016, and for all prior standard measurement periods. Employee B also was employed on average 30 hours of service per week for all prior standard measurement periods, but averaged less than 30 hours of service per week during the standard measurement period that begins October 15, 2015, and ends October 14, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Conclusions. Because Employee A was employed for the entire standard measurement period that begins October 15, 2015, and ends October 14, 2016, Employee A is an ongoing employee with respect to the stability period running from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. Because Employee A

was employed on average 30 hours of service per week during that standard measurement period, Employee A is offered coverage for the entire 2017 stability period (including the administrative period from October 15, 2017, through December 31, 2017). Because Employee A was employed on average 30 hours of service per week during the prior standard measurement period, Employee A is offered coverage for the entire 2016 stability period and, if enrolled, would continue such coverage during the administrative period from October 15, 2016, through December 31, 2016. Because Employee B was employed for the entire standard measurement period that begins October 15, 2015, and ends October 14, 2016, Employee B is also an ongoing employee with respect to the stability period in 2017. Because Employee B was not a full-time employee based on hours of service during this standard measurement period, Employee B is not offered coverage for the stability period in 2017 (including the administrative period from October 15, 2017, through December 31, 2017). However, because Employee B was employed on average 30 hours of service per week during the prior standard measurement period, Employee B is offered coverage through the end of the 2016 stability period and, if enrolled, would continue such coverage during the administrative period from October 15, 2016, through December 31, 2016. Employer Z complies with the standards of paragraph (d)(1) of this section because the standard measurement period is no longer than 12 months, the stability period for ongoing employees who are full-time employees based on hours of service during the standard measurement period is not shorter than the standard measurement period, the stability period for ongoing employees who are not full-time employees based on hours of service during the standard measurement period is no longer than the standard measurement period, and the administrative period is no longer than 90 days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> New non-variable hour, new non-seasonal and new non-part-time employees--(i) In general. For a new employee who is reasonably expected at the employee's start date to be a full-time employee (and is not a seasonal employee), an applicable large employer member determines such employee's status as a full-time employee based on the employee's hours of service for each calendar month. If the employee's hours of service for the calendar month equal or exceed an average of 30 hours of service per week, the employee is a full-time employee for that calendar month. Once a new employee who is reasonably expected at the employee's start date to be a full-time employee (and is not a seasonal employee) becomes an ongoing employee, the rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply for determining full-time employee status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For a new employee who is reasonably expected at the employee's start date to be a full-time employee (and is not a seasonal employee), an applicable large employer member determines such employee's status as a full-time employee based on the employee's hours of service for each calendar month. If the employee's hours of service for the calendar month equal or exceed an average of 30 hours of service per week, the employee is a full-time employee for that calendar month. Once a new employee who is reasonably expected at the employee's start date to be a full-time employee (and is not a seasonal employee) becomes an ongoing employee, the rules set forth in paragraph (d)(1) of this section apply for determining full-time employee status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Factors for determining full-time employee status. Whether an employer's determination that a new employee (who is not a seasonal employee) is a full-time employee or is not a full-time employee is reasonable is based on the facts and circumstances at the employee's start date. Factors to consider in determining whether a new employee who is not a seasonal employee is reasonably expected at the employee's start date to be a full-time employee include, but are not limited to, whether the employee is replacing an employee who was (or was not) a full-time employee, the extent to which hours of service of ongoing employees in the same or comparable positions have varied above and below an average of 30 hours of service per week during recent measurement periods, and whether the job was advertised, or otherwise communicated to the new hire or otherwise documented (for example, through a contract or job description), as requiring hours of service that would average 30 (or more) hours of service per week or less than 30 hours of service per week. In all cases, no single factor is determinative. An educational organization employer cannot take into account the potential for, or likelihood of, an employment break period in determining its expectation of future hours of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Application of section 4980H to initial full three calendar months of employment. Notwithstanding paragraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, with respect to an employee who is reasonably expected at his or her start date to be a

full-time employee (and is not a seasonal employee), the employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for any calendar month of the three-month period beginning with the first day of the first full calendar month of employment if, for the calendar month, the employee is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer, provided that the employee is offered coverage by the employer no later than the first day of the fourth full calendar month of employment if the employee is still employed on that day. If the offer of coverage for which the employee is otherwise eligible during the first three full calendar months of employment, and which the employee actually is offered by the first day of the fourth month if still employed, provides minimum value, the employer also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to that employee for the first three full calendar months of employment. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(2)(iii), an employee is otherwise eligible to be offered coverage under a group health plan for a calendar month if, pursuant to the terms of the plan as in effect for that calendar month, the employee meets all conditions to be offered coverage under the plan for that calendar month, other than the completion of a waiting period, within the meaning of Sec. 54.9801-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> New variable hour employees, new seasonal employees, and new part-time employees--(i) In general. For new variable hour employees, new seasonal employees, and new part-time employees, applicable large employer members are permitted to determine whether the new employee is a full-time employee using an initial measurement period of no less than three consecutive months and no more than 12 consecutive months (as selected by the applicable large employer member) that begins on the employee's start date or on any date up to and including the first day of the first calendar month following the employee's start date (or on the first day of the first payroll period starting on or after the employee's start date, if later, as set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section). The applicable large employer member measures the new employee's hours of service during the initial measurement period and determines whether the employee was employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week during this period. The stability period for such employees must be the same length as the stability period for ongoing employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. For new variable hour employees, new seasonal employees, and new part-time employees, applicable large employer members are permitted to determine whether the new employee is a full-time employee using an initial measurement period of no less than three consecutive months and no more than 12 consecutive months (as selected by the applicable large employer member) that begins on the employee's start date or on any date up to and including the first day of the first calendar month following the employee's start date (or on the first day of the first payroll period starting on or after the employee's start date, if later, as set forth in paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section). The applicable large employer member measures the new employee's hours of service during the initial measurement period and determines whether the employee was employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week during this period. The stability period for such employees must be the same length as the stability period for ongoing employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Use of payroll periods. An applicable large employer member may apply the payroll period rule set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section for purposes of determining an initial measurement period, provided that the initial measurement period must begin on the start date or any date during the period beginning with the employee's start date and ending with the later of the first day of the first calendar month following the employee's start date and the first day of the first payroll period that starts after the employee's start date. As set forth in paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, the use of payroll periods for purposes of determining the initial measurement period applies for payroll periods that are one week, two weeks, or semi-monthly in duration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employees determined to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week. If a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee has on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, the applicable large employer member must treat the employee as a full-time employee during the stability period that begins after the initial measurement period (and any associated administrative period). The stability period must be a period of at least six consecutive calendar months that is no shorter in duration than the initial measurement period. The stability period must begin immediately after the end of the measurement period and any applicable administrative period. With respect to an employee who has on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, the employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for any calendar month during the initial measurement

period and any associated administrative period if, for the calendar month, the employee is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer, provided that the employee is offered coverage by the employer no later than the first day of the associated stability period if the employee is still employed on that day. If the offer of coverage for which the employee is otherwise eligible during the initial measurement period, and which the employee actually is offered by the first day of the stability period if still employed, provides minimum value, the employer also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to that employee during the initial measurement period and any associated administrative period. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(iii), an employee is otherwise eligible to be offered coverage under a group health plan for a month if, pursuant to the terms of the plan as in effect for that calendar month, the employee meets all conditions to be offered coverage under the plan for that month, other than the completion of a waiting period, within the meaning of Sec. 54.9801-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Employees determined not to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week. If a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee does not have on average at least 30 hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, the applicable large employer member may treat the employee as not a full-time employee during the stability period that follows the initial measurement period. Except as provided in paragraph (d)(4)(iv) of this section, the stability period for such employees must not be more than one month longer than the initial measurement period and must not exceed the remainder of the first entire standard measurement period (plus any associated administrative period) for which a variable hour employee, seasonal employee, or part-time employee has been employed. The stability period must begin immediately after the end of the measurement period and any applicable administrative period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Permissible differences in measurement or stability periods for different categories of employees. Subject to the rules governing the relationship between the length of the measurement period and the stability period, with respect to a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee, applicable large employer members may use measurement periods and stability periods that differ either in length or in their starting and ending dates for the categories of employees identified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Optional administrative period--(A) In general. Subject to the limits in paragraph (d)(3)(vi)(B) of this section, an applicable large employer member may apply an administrative period in connection with an initial measurement period and before the start of the stability period. This administrative period must not exceed 90 days in total. For this purpose, the administrative period includes all periods between the start date of a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee and the date the employee is first offered coverage under the applicable large employer member's group health plan, other than the initial measurement period. Thus, for example, if the applicable large employer member begins the initial measurement period on the first day of the first month following a new employee's start date, the period between the employee's start date and the first day of the next month must be taken into account in applying the 90-day limit on the administrative period. Similarly, if there is a period between the end of the initial measurement period and the date the employee is first offered coverage under the plan, that period must be taken into account in applying the 90-day limit on the administrative period. Applicable large employer members may use administrative periods that differ in length for the categories of employees identified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. Subject to the limits in paragraph (d)(3)(vi)(B) of this section, an applicable large employer member may apply an administrative period in connection with an initial measurement period and before the start of the stability period. This administrative period must not exceed 90 days in total. For this purpose, the administrative period includes all periods between the start date of a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee and the date the employee is first offered coverage under the applicable large employer member's group health plan, other than the initial measurement period. Thus, for example, if the applicable large employer member begins the initial measurement period on the first day of the first month following a new employee's start date, the period between the employee's start date and the first day of the next month must be taken into account in applying the 90-day limit on the administrative period. Similarly, if there is a period between the end of the initial measurement period and the date the employee is first offered coverage under the plan, that period must be taken into account in applying the 90-day limit on the administrative period. Applicable large employer members may use administrative periods that differ in length for the categories of employees identified in paragraph (d)(1)(v) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Limit on combined length of initial measurement period and administrative period. In addition to the specific limits on the initial measurement period (which must not exceed 12 months) and the administrative period (which must not exceed 90 days), there is a limit on the combined length of the initial

measurement period and the administrative period applicable to a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee. Specifically, the initial measurement period and administrative period together cannot extend beyond the last day of the first calendar month beginning on or after the first anniversary of the employee's start date. For example, if an applicable large employer member uses a 12-month initial measurement period for a new variable hour employee, and begins that initial measurement period on the first day of the first calendar month following the employee's start date, the period between the end of the initial measurement period and the offer of coverage to a new variable hour employee who is a full-time employee based on hours of service during the initial measurement period must not exceed one month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Change in employment status during the initial measurement period--(A) In general. If a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee experiences a change in employment status before the end of the initial measurement period such that, if the employee had begun employment in the new position or status, the employee would have reasonably been expected to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week (or, if applicable, would not have been a seasonal employee and would have been expected to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week), the rules set forth in the remainder of this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) apply. With respect to an employee described in this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) and subject to the rules in the next sentence, the employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H for the period before the first day of the fourth full calendar month following the change in employment status (or, if earlier and the employee averages 30 or more hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, the first day of the first month following the end of the initial measurement period (including any optional administrative period associated with the initial measurement period)). An employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to an employee described in this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) for any calendar month during the period described in the prior sentence if, for the calendar month, the employee is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer, provided that the employee is offered coverage by the employer no later than the end of the period described in the prior sentence if the employee is still employed on that date; if the offer of coverage for which the employee is otherwise eligible during the period described in the prior sentence, and which the employee is actually offered by the first day after the end of that period if still employed, provides minimum value, the employer also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to that employee during that period. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(3)(vii), an employee is otherwise eligible to be offered coverage under a group health plan for a calendar month if, pursuant to the terms of the plan as in effect for that calendar month, the employee meets all conditions to be offered coverage under the plan for that calendar month, other than the completion of a waiting period, within the meaning of Sec. 54.9801-2.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. If a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee experiences a change in employment status before the end of the initial measurement period such that, if the employee had begun employment in the new position or status, the employee would have reasonably been expected to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week (or, if applicable, would not have been a seasonal employee and would have been expected to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week), the rules set forth in the remainder of this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) apply. With respect to an employee described in this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) and subject to the rules in the next sentence, the employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H for the period before the first day of the fourth full calendar month following the change in employment status (or, if earlier and the employee averages 30 or more hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, the first day of the first month following the end of the initial measurement period (including any optional administrative period associated with the initial measurement period)). An employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to an employee described in this paragraph (d)(3)(vii) for any calendar month during the period described in the prior sentence if, for the calendar month, the employee is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage under a group health plan of the employer, provided that the employee is offered coverage by the employer no later than the end of the period described in the prior sentence if the employee is still employed on that date; if the offer of coverage for which the employee is otherwise eligible during the period described in the prior sentence, and which the employee is actually offered by the first day after the end of that period if still employed, provides minimum value, the employer also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to that employee during that period.

The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraph (d)(3)(vii) of this section. In the following example, the applicable large employer member has 200 full-time employees and offers all of its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan. The coverage is affordable within the meaning of section 36B(c)(2)(C)(i) (or is treated as affordable under one of the affordability safe harbors described in Sec. 54.4980H-5) and provides minimum value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For new variable hour employees, Employer Z uses a 12-month initial measurement period that begins on the start date and applies an administrative period from the end of the initial measurement period through the end of the first calendar month beginning on or after the end of the initial measurement period. For new variable hour employees, Employer Z offers coverage no

later than the first day of the fourteenth month after the start date if an employee averages 30 or more hours of service per week during the initial measurement period. Employer Z hires Employee A on May 10, 2015. Employee A's initial measurement period runs from May 10, 2015, through May 9, 2016, with the optional administrative period ending June 30, 2016. At Employee A's May 10, 2015, start date, Employee A is a variable hour employee. On September 15, 2015, Employer Z promotes Employee A to a position that can reasonably be expected to average at least 30 hours of service per week. For October 2015 through December 2015, Employee A is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage that provides minimum value, and, on January 1, 2016, Employee A is offered coverage by the employer that provides minimum value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer Z will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to Employee A for October 2015, November 2015, or December 2015, because for each of those months Employee A is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage and because Employee A is offered coverage by January 1, 2016 (the date that is the earlier of the first day of the fourth calendar month following the change in employment status (January 1, 2016) or the first day of the calendar month after the end of the initial measurement period plus the optional administrative period (July 1, 2016)). Because the coverage offered on January 1, 2016, provides minimum value, Employer Z also will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to Employee A for October 2015, November 2015, or December 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Transition from new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee to ongoing employee--(i) In general. Once a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee has been employed for an entire standard measurement period, the applicable large employer member must test the employee for full-time employee status, beginning with that standard measurement period, at the same time and under the same conditions as apply to other ongoing employees. Accordingly, for example, an applicable large employer member with a calendar year standard measurement period that also uses a one-year initial measurement period beginning on the employee's start date would test a new employee whose start date is April 12 for full-time employee status first based on the initial measurement period (April 12 of the year including the start date through April 11 of the following year) and again based on the calendar year standard measurement period (if the employee continues in employment for that entire standard measurement period) beginning on January 1 of the year after the start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Once a new variable hour employee, new seasonal employee, or new part-time employee has been employed for an entire standard measurement period, the applicable large employer member must test the employee for full-time employee status, beginning with that standard measurement period, at the same time and under the same conditions as apply to other ongoing employees. Accordingly, for example, an applicable large employer member with a calendar year standard measurement period that also uses a one-year initial measurement period beginning on the employee's start date would test a new employee whose start date is April 12 for full-time employee status first based on the initial measurement period (April 12 of the year including the start date through April 11 of the following year) and again based on the calendar year standard measurement period (if the employee continues in employment for that entire standard measurement period) beginning on January 1 of the year after the start date.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Employee determined to be employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week. An employee who was employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during an initial measurement period or standard measurement period must be treated as a full-time employee for the entire associated stability period. This is the case even if the employee was employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during the initial measurement period but was not employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during the overlapping or immediately following standard measurement period. In that case, the applicable large employer member may treat the employee as not a full-time employee only after the end of the stability period associated with the initial measurement period. Thereafter, the applicable large employer member must determine the employee's status as a full-time employee in the same manner as it determines such status in the case of its other ongoing employees as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Employee determined not to be employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week. If the employee was not employed an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during the initial measurement period, but was employed at least 30 hours of service per week during the overlapping or immediately following standard measurement period, the employee must be treated as a full-time employee for the entire stability period that corresponds to that standard measurement period (even if that stability period begins before the end of the stability period associated with the initial measurement period). Thereafter, the applicable large employer member must determine the employee's status as a full-time employee in the same manner as it determines such status in the case of

its other ongoing employees as described in paragraph (d)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment during periods between stability periods. If there is a period between the end of the stability period associated with the initial measurement period and the beginning of the stability period associated with the first full standard measurement period during which an employee is employed, the treatment as a full-time employee or not a full-time employee that applies during the stability period associated with the initial measurement period continues to apply until the beginning of the stability period associated with the first full standard measurement period during which the employee is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the look-back measurement methods described in paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(3) and (d)(4) of this section. In all of the following examples, the applicable large employer member has 200 full-time employees and offers all of its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan. The coverage is affordable within the meaning of section 36B(c)(2)(C)(i) (or is treated as affordable coverage under one of the affordability safe harbors described in Sec. 54.4980H-5) and provides minimum value. In Example 1 through Example 8, the new employee is a new variable hour employee, and the employer has chosen to use a 12-month standard measurement period for ongoing employees starting October 15 and a 12-month stability period associated with that standard measurement period starting January 1. (Thus, during the administrative period from October 15 through December 31 of each calendar year, the employer continues to offer coverage to employees who qualified for coverage for that entire calendar year based upon having an average of at least 30 hours of service per week during the prior standard measurement period.) In Example 9 and Example 10, the new employee is a new variable hour employee, and the employer uses a six-month standard measurement period, starting each May 1 and November 1, with six-month stability periods associated with those standard measurement periods starting January 1 and July 1. In Example 12, Example 13, and Example 14, the employer is in the trade or business of providing temporary workers to numerous clients that are unrelated to the employer and to one another; the employer is the common law employer of the temporary workers based on all of the facts and circumstances; the employer offers health plan coverage only to full-time employees (including temporary workers who are full-time employees) and their dependents; and the employer uses a 12-month initial measurement period for new variable hour employees that begins on the start date and applies an administrative period from the end of the initial measurement period through the end of the first calendar month beginning after the end of the initial measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. For new variable hour employees, Employer Z uses a 12-month initial measurement period that begins on the start date and applies an administrative period from the end of the initial measurement period through the end of the first calendar month beginning on or after the end of the initial measurement period. Employer Z hires Employee A on May 10, 2015. Employee A's initial measurement period runs from May 10, 2015, through May 9, 2016. Employee A has an average of 30 hours of service per week during this initial measurement period. Employer Z offers coverage that provides minimum value to Employee A for a stability period that runs from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. For each calendar month during the period beginning with June 2015 and ending with June 2016, Employee A is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage with respect to the coverage that is offered to Employee A on July 1, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer Z uses an initial measurement period that does not exceed 12 months; an administrative period totaling not more than 90 days; and a combined initial measurement period and administrative period that does not last beyond the final day of the first calendar month beginning on or after the one-year anniversary of Employee A's start date. Accordingly, Employer Z complies with the standards for the initial measurement period and stability periods for a new variable hour employee. Employer Z will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to Employee A for any calendar month from June

2015 through June 2016 because, for each month during that period, Employee A is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage and because coverage is offered no later than the end of the initial measurement period plus the associated administrative period (July 1, 2016). Employer Z will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to Employee A for any calendar month from June 2015 through June 2016 because the coverage Employer Z offers to Employee A provides minimum value. Employer Z will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) or (b) with respect to Employee A for May 2015 because an applicable large employer member is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to an employee for the calendar month in which falls the employee's start date if the start date is on a date other than the first day of the calendar month. Employer Z must test Employee A again based on the period from October 15, 2015, through October 14, 2016 (Employer Z's first standard measurement period that begins after Employee A's start date).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts.

Employee A's initial measurement period runs from May 10, 2015, through April 9, 2016. The administrative period associated with Employee A's initial measurement period ends on June 30, 2016.

Employee A's initial measurement period runs from June 1, 2015, through April 30, 2016. The administrative period associated with Employee A's initial measurement period ends on June 30, 2016.

Employer Z offers coverage to Employee A for a stability period that runs from August 1, 2016, through July 31, 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer Z does not satisfy the standards for the look-back measurement method in paragraph (d)(3)(vi)(B) of this section because the combination of the initial partial month delay, the 12-month initial measurement period, and the two month administrative period means that the coverage offered to Employee A does not become effective until after the first day of the second calendar month following the first anniversary of Employee A's start date.

Employer Y hires Employee B on May 10, 2015. Employee B's initial measurement period runs from May 10, 2015, through November 9, 2015, during which Employee B has an average of 30 hours of service per week. Employer Y offers coverage that provides minimum value to Employee B for a stability period that runs from January 1, 2016, through June 30, 2016. For each calendar month during the period from June 2015 through December 2015, Employee B is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage with respect to the coverage that is offered to Employee B on January 1, 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer Y uses an initial measurement period that does not exceed 12 months; an administrative period totaling not more than 90 days; and a combined initial measurement period and administrative period that does not extend beyond the final day of the first calendar month beginning on or after the one-year anniversary of Employee B's start date. Employer Y complies with the standards for the measurement and stability periods for a new variable hour employee with respect to Employee B. Employer Y is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) with respect to Employee B for any calendar month from June 2015 through December 2015 because, for each month during that period, Employee B is otherwise eligible for an offer of coverage and because Employee B is offered coverage no later than the end of the initial measurement period plus the associated administrative period (January 1, 2016). Employer Y is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to Employee B for any calendar month from June 2015 through December 2015 because the coverage Employer Y offers to Employee B no later than January 1, 2016, provides minimum value. Employer Y is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) or (b) with respect to Employee B for May 2015 because an applicable large employer member is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to an employee for the calendar month in which falls the employee's start date if the start date is on a date other than the first day of the calendar month.

Employer V hires Employee E on January 1, 2015, in a position under which Employer V will offer assignments to Employee E to provide services in temporary placements at clients of Employer V. Employees of Employer V in the same position of employment as Employee E typically are offered assignments of varying hours of service per week (so that some weeks of the assignment typically result in more than 30 hours of service per week and other weeks of the assignment typically result in less than 30 hours of service per week). Although a typical employee in the same position of employment as Employee E rarely fails to have an offer of an assignment for any period during the calendar year, employees of Employer V in the same position of employment, as part of their continuing employment, retain the right to reject an offer of placement, and typically refuse one or more offers of placement and do not perform services for periods ranging from four to twelve weeks during a calendar year. At the time Employee E is hired by Employer V, Employer V has no reason to anticipate that Employee E's position of employment will differ from the typical employee in the same position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion.

Employer T hires Employee F on January 1, 2015, in a position under which Employer T will offer assignments to Employee F to provide services in temporary placements at clients of Employer T. Employees of Employer T in the same position typically are offered assignments of 40 or more hours of service per week for periods expected to last for periods of three months to 12 months, subject to a request for renewal by the client. Employees of Employer T in similar positions to Employee F are typically offered and take new positions immediately upon cessation of a placement. At the time Employee F is hired by Employer T, Employer T has no reason to anticipate that Employee F's position of employment will differ from the typical employee in the same position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer T must assume that Employee F will be employed by Employer T and available for an offer of temporary placement for the entire initial measurement period. Under that assumption, Employer T would reasonably determine that Employee F is reasonably expected to average at least 30 hours of service per week for the 12-month initial measurement period. Accordingly, Employer T may not treat Employee F as a variable hour employee during the initial measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee G is hired on an hourly basis by Employer S to fill in for employees who are absent and to provide additional staffing at peak times. Employer S expects that Employee G will average 30 hours of service per week or more for Employee G's first few months of employment, while assigned to a specific project, but also reasonably expects that the assignments will be of

unpredictable duration, that there will be periods of unpredictable duration between assignments, that the hours per week required by subsequent assignments will vary, and that Employee G will not necessarily be available for all assignments.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Employer S cannot determine whether Employee G is reasonably expected to average at least 30 hours of service per week for the initial measurement period. Accordingly, Employer S may treat Employee G as a variable hour employee during the initial measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer R uses an 11-month initial measurement period for new variable hour, new seasonal, and new part-time employees with an administrative period that lasts from the end of the initial measurement period through the last day of the first calendar month beginning on or after the first anniversary of the employee's start date. Employer R uses a standard measurement period of October 15 through October 14, and an administrative period of October 15 through December 31. Employee H is hired as a variable hour employee on October 20, 2015, with an initial measurement period of October 20, 2015, through September 19, 2016, and an administrative period lasting through November 30, 2016. Employee H is a full-time employee based on the hours of service in the initial measurement period, and Employee H's stability period for the initial measurement period is December 1, 2016, through November 30, 2017. Employee H's first full standard measurement period begins on October 15, 2016, with an associated stability period beginning on January 1, 2018. The standard measurement period beginning on October 15, 2015, does not apply to Employee H because Employee H is not hired until October 20, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. For the period after the stability period associated with the initial measurement period and before the stability period associated with Employee H's first full standard measurement period (that is December 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017), Employer R must treat Employee H as a full-time employee because the treatment as a full-time employee (or not a full-time employee) that applies during the stability period associated with the initial measurement period continues to apply until the beginning of the stability period associated with the first full standard measurement period during which the employee is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Employees rehired after termination of employment or resuming service after other absence--(i) Treatment as a new employee after a period of absence for employees of employers other than educational organizations--(A) In general.

For purposes of applying the look-back measurement method described in paragraph (d) of this section to an employee who is not treated as a new employee under paragraph (d)(6)(i) of this section, the employer determines the employee's average hours of service for a measurement period by computing the average after excluding any special unpaid leave during that measurement period and by using that average as the average for the entire measurement period. Alternatively, for purposes of determining the employee's average hours of service for the measurement period, the employer may choose to treat the employee as credited with hours of service for any periods of special unpaid leave during that measurement period at a rate equal to the average weekly rate at which the employee was credited with hours of service during the weeks in the measurement period that are not part of a period of special unpaid leave. There is no limit on the number of hours of

service required to be excluded or credited (as the case may be) with respect to special unpaid leave. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6)(i)(B), in computing the average weekly rate, employers are permitted to use any reasonable method if applied on a consistent basis.

The rules of this paragraph (d)(6)(ii) apply only to employers that are educational institutions. An employee who resumes providing services to (or is otherwise credited with an hour of service for) an applicable large employer that is an educational organization after a period during which the employee was not credited with any hours of service may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, and therefore may be treated as a new employee upon the resumption of services, only if the employee did not have an hour of service for the applicable large employer for a period of at least 26 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the resumption of services. The rule set forth in this paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(A) applies solely for the purpose of determining whether the employee, upon the resumption of services, is treated as a new employee or as a continuing employee, and does not determine whether the employee is treated as a continuing full-time employee or a terminated employee during the period during which no hours of service are credited.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> In general. The rules of this paragraph (d)(6)(ii) apply only to employers that are educational institutions. An employee who resumes providing services to (or is otherwise credited with an hour of service for) an applicable large employer that is an educational organization after a period during which the employee was not credited with any hours of service may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, and therefore may be treated as a new employee upon the resumption of services, only if the employee did not have an hour of service for the applicable large employer for a period of at least 26 consecutive weeks immediately preceding the resumption of services.

For purposes of applying the look-back measurement method described in paragraph (d) of this section to an employee who is not treated as a new employee under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(A) of this section, an educational organization employer determines the employee's average hours of service for a measurement period by computing the average after excluding any special unpaid leave and any employment break period during that measurement period and by using that average as the average for the entire measurement period. Alternatively, for purposes of determining the employee's average hours of service for the measurement period, the employer may choose to treat the employee as credited with hours of service for any periods of special unpaid leave and any employment break period during that measurement period at a rate equal to the average weekly rate at which the employee was credited with hours of service during the weeks in the measurement period that are not part of a period of special unpaid leave or an employment break period. Notwithstanding the preceding two sentences, no more than 501 hours of service during employment break periods in a calendar year are required to be excluded (under the first sentence) or credited (under the second sentence) by an educational organization, provided that this 501-hour limit does not apply to hours of service required to be excluded or credited in respect of special unpaid leave. In applying the preceding sentence, an employer that uses the method described in the first sentence of this paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) determines the number of hours excluded by multiplying the average weekly rate for the measurement period (determined as in the second sentence of this paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B)) by the number of weeks in the employment break period. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B), in computing the average weekly rate, employers are permitted to use any reasonable method if applied on a consistent basis. In addition, if an employee's average weekly rate under this paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) is being computed for a measurement period and that measurement period is shorter than six months, the six-month period ending

with the close of the measurement period is used to compute the average hours of service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Treatment of continuing employee. Under the look-back measurement method, an employee treated as a continuing employee retains, upon resumption of services, the status that employee had with respect to the application of any stability period (for example, if the continuing employee returns during a stability period in which the employee is treated as a full-time employee, the employee is treated as a full-time employee upon return and through the end of that stability period). For purposes of the preceding sentence, a continuing employee treated as a full-time employee is treated as offered coverage upon resumption of services if the employee is offered coverage as of the first day that employee is credited with an hour of service, or, if later, as soon as administratively practicable. For this purpose, offering coverage by no later than the first day of the calendar month following resumption of services is deemed to be as soon as administratively practicable. If a continuing employee returns during a stability period in which the employee is treated as a full-time employee and the employer previously made the employee an offer of coverage with respect to the entire stability period and the employee declined the offer, the employer will continue to be treated as having offered coverage for that stability period and the employer need not make a new offer of coverage for the remainder of the ongoing stability period due to the employee's resumption of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Rule of parity. For purposes of determining the period after which an employee may be treated as having terminated employment and having been rehired, an applicable large employer may choose a period, measured in weeks, of at least four consecutive weeks during which the employee was not credited with any hours of service that exceeds the number of weeks of that employee's period of employment with the applicable large employer immediately preceding the period and that is shorter than 13 weeks (for an employee of an educational organization employer, a period that is shorter than 26 weeks). For purposes of the preceding sentence, the duration of the immediately preceding period of employment is determined after application to that period of employment of the averaging methods described in paragraphs (d)(6)(i)(B) and (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section (relating to employment break periods and special unpaid leave), if applicable.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> International transfers. An employer may treat an employee as having terminated employment if the employee transfers to a position at the same applicable large employer (including a different applicable large employer member that is part of the same applicable large employer) if the position is anticipated to continue indefinitely or for at least 12 months and if substantially all of the compensation will constitute income from sources without the United States (within the meaning of sections 861 through 863 and the regulations thereunder). With respect to an employee transferring from a position that was anticipated to continue indefinitely or for at least 12 months and in which substantially all of the compensation for the hours of service constitutes income from sources without the United States (within the meaning of sections 861 through 863 and the regulations thereunder) to a position at the same applicable large employer (including a different applicable large employer member that is part of the same applicable large employer) with respect to which substantially all of the compensation will constitute U.S. source income, the employer may treat that employee as a new hire to the extent consistent with the rules related to rehired employees in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Anti-abuse rule. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(6), any hour of service is disregarded if the hour of service is credited, or the services giving rise to the crediting of the hour of service are requested or required of the employee, for a purpose of avoiding or undermining the application of the employee rehire rules under paragraph (d)(6) of this section, or the application of the averaging method for employment break periods under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section. For example, if an employee of an educational

organization would otherwise have a period with no hours of service to which the rules under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section would apply, but for the employer's request or requirement that the employee perform one or more hours of service for a purpose of avoiding the application of those rules, any such hours of service for the week are disregarded, and the rules under paragraph (d)(6)(ii)(B) of this section will apply.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the provisions of paragraph (d)(6) of this section. All employers in these examples are applicable large employer members with 200 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees), each is in a different applicable large employer group, and each determines full-time employee status under the look-back measurement method. None of the periods during which an employee is not credited with an hour of service for an employer involve special unpaid leave or the employee being credited with hours of service for any applicable large employer member in the same applicable large employer as the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. As of April 1, 2015, Employee A has been an employee of Employer Z (which is not an educational organization) for 10 years. On April 1, 2015, Employee A terminates employment and is not credited with an hour of service until June 1, 2015, when Employer Z rehires Employee A and Employee A continues as an employee through December 31, 2015, which is the close of the measurement period as applied by Employer Z.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the period for which Employee A is not credited with any hours of service is not longer than Employee A's prior period of employment and is less than 13 weeks, Employee A is not treated as having terminated employment and been rehired for purposes of determining whether Employee A is treated as a new employee upon resumption of services. Therefore, Employee A's hours of service prior to termination are required to be taken into account for purposes of the measurement period, and Employee A's period with no hours of service is taken into account as a period of zero hours of service during the measurement period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that Employee A is rehired on December 1, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the period during which Employee A is not credited with an hour of service for Employer Z exceeds 13 weeks, Employee A is treated as having terminated employment on April 1, 2015, and having been rehired as a new employee on December 1, 2015, for purposes of determining Employee A's full-time employee status. Because Employee A is treated as a new employee, Employee A's hours of service prior to termination are not taken into account for purposes of the measurement period, and the period between termination and rehire with no hours of service is not taken into account in the new measurement period that begins after the employee is rehired.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee B is employed by Employer Y, an educational organization. Employee B is employed for 38 hours of service per week on average from September 7, 2014, through May 23, 2015, and then does not provide services (and is not otherwise credited with an hour of service) during the summer break when the school is generally not in session. Employee B resumes providing services for Employer Y on September 7, 2015, when the new school year begins.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the period from May 24, 2015 through September 5, 2015 (a total of 15 weeks), during which Employee B is not credited with an hour of service does not exceed 26 weeks, and also does not exceed the number of weeks of Employee B's immediately preceding period of employment, Employee B is not treated as having terminated employment on May 24, 2015, and having been rehired on September 6, 2015. Also, for purposes of determining Employee B's average hours of service per week for the measurement period, Employee B is credited, under the averaging method for employment break periods applicable to educational organizations, as having an average of 38 hours of service per week for the 15 weeks between May 24, 2015 and September 5, 2015, during which Employee B otherwise was credited with no hours of service. However, Employer Y is not required to credit more than 501 hours of service for the employment break period (15 weeks x 38 hours = 570 hours).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 3, except that Employee B does not resume providing services for Employer Y until December 5, 2015.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the period from May 24, 2015 through December 5, 2015, exceeds 26 weeks, Employee B may be treated as having terminated employment on May 24, 2015, and having been rehired on December 5, 2015. Because Employee B is treated as a new employee on December 5, 2015, Employee B's hours of service prior to termination are not taken into account for purposes of the measurement period, and the period between termination and rehire with no hours of service is not taken into account in

the new measurement period that begins after Employee B is rehired. The averaging method for employment break periods applicable to educational organizations does not apply because Employee B is treated as a new employee rather than a continuing employee as of the date of resumption of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Use of the look-back measurement method and the monthly measurement method for different categories of employees. Different applicable large employer members of the same applicable large employer may use different methods of determining full-time employee status (that is, either the monthly measurement method or the look-back measurement method). In addition, an applicable large employer member may use either the monthly measurement method or the look-back measurement method for each of the categories of employees set forth in paragraphs (d)(1)(v) and (d)(3)(v) of this section, and is not required to use the same method for all categories.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Changes in employment status resulting in a change in full-time employee determination method--(1) Change in employment status from a position to which a look-back measurement method applies to a position to which the monthly measurement method applies, or vice versa--(i) Change from look-back measurement method to monthly measurement method.

Employee B is employed for hours of service from October 15, 2016, through October 14, 2017, such that under the applicable look-back measurement method Employee B would be treated as a full-time employee for the period January 1,

2018, through December 31, 2018. Accordingly, Employee B must be treated as a full-time employee for the calendar year 2018. For calendar year 2019, the determination of whether Employee B is a full-time employee is made under the applicable look-back measurement method.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5 (Monthly measurement method to look-back measurement method). Same facts as Example 4, except that based on Employee B's hours of service from October 15, 2015, through October 14, 2016, Employee B would not have been treated as a full-time employee from January 1, 2017, through December 31, 2017. For the calendar months of 2017, Employer Y applies the monthly measurement method to determine Employee B's status as a full-time employee. Employee B is employed for hours of service from October 15, 2016, through October 14, 2017, such that under the applicable look-back measurement method Employee B would be treated as a full-time employee for the period January 1, 2018, through December 31, 2018. Accordingly, Employee B must be treated as a full-time employee for the calendar year 2018.

For the calendar year 2018, Employer Y must treat Employee B as a full-time employee only for calendar months during which Employee B would be a full-time employee under the monthly measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for certain employees to whom minimum value coverage has been continuously offered--(i) In general. Notwithstanding the rules in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, an employer using the look-back measurement method to determine the full-time employee status of an employee may apply the monthly measurement method to that employee beginning on the first day of the fourth full calendar month following the calendar month in which the employee experiences a change in employment status such that, if the employee had begun employment in the new position or status, the employee would have reasonably been expected not to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week (for example, the employee has changed to a part-time position of only 20 hours of service per week). This rule only applies with respect to an employee to whom the applicable large employer member offered minimum value coverage by the first day of the calendar month following the employee's initial three full calendar months of employment through the calendar month in which the change in employment status described in this paragraph (f)(2) occurs, and only if the employee actually averages less than 30 hours of service per week for each of the three full calendar months following the change in employment status. For the three full calendar months between the employee's change in employment status and the application of the monthly measurement method, the employee's full-time employee status is determined based on the employee's status during the applicable stability period(s). Under this rule, an employer may apply the monthly measurement method to an employee even if the employer does not apply the monthly measurement method to the other employees in the same category of employees under paragraph (d)(1)(v) or (d)(3)(v) of this section (for example, under this method an employer could apply the monthly measurement method to an hourly employee, even if the employer uses the look-back measurement method to determine full-time employee status of all other hourly employees). The employer may continue to apply the monthly measurement method through the end of the first full measurement period (and any associated administrative period) that would have applied had the employee remained under the applicable look-back measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Notwithstanding the rules in paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section, an employer using the look-back measurement method to determine the full-time employee status of an employee may apply the monthly measurement method to that employee beginning on the first day of the fourth full calendar month following the calendar month in which the employee experiences a change in employment status such that, if the employee had begun employment in the new position or status, the employee would have reasonably been expected not to be employed on average at least 30 hours of service per week (for example, the employee has changed to a part-time position of only 20 hours of service per week). This rule only applies with respect to an employee to whom the applicable large employer member offered minimum value coverage by the first day of the calendar month following the employee's initial three full calendar months of employment through the calendar month in which the change in employment status described in this paragraph (f)(2) occurs, and only if the employee actually averages less than 30 hours of service per week for each of the three full calendar months following the change in employment status. For the three full calendar months between the employee's change in employment status and the application of the monthly measurement method, the employee's full-time employee status is determined based on the employee's status during the applicable stability period(s). Under this rule, an employer may apply the monthly measurement method to an employee even if the employer does not apply the monthly measurement method to the other employees in the same category of employees under paragraph (d)(1)(v) or (d)(3)(v) of this section (for example, under this method an employer could apply the monthly measurement method to an hourly employee, even if the employer uses the look-back measurement method to determine full-time employee status of all other hourly employees). The employer may continue to apply the monthly measurement method through the end of the first full measurement period (and any associated administrative period) that would have applied had the employee remained under the applicable look-back measurement method.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the rule of paragraphs (f)(2) of this section. In each example, the employer is an applicable large employer with 200 full-time employees (including FTEs).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer Z, an applicable large employer, uses the look-back measurement method to determine the full-time employee status for all of its employees. On May 10, 2015, Employer Z hired Employee A who is a variable hour employee. Although Employee A is a new variable hour employee,

so that Employer Z could wait until the end of an initial measurement period to offer coverage to Employee A without an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to Employee A, Employer Z offers coverage that provides minimum value to Employee A on September 1, 2015. For its ongoing employees, Employer Z has chosen to use a 12-month standard measurement period starting October 15 and a 12-month stability period associated with that standard measurement period starting January 1. Employee A continues in employment with Employer Z for over five years and averages more than 30 hours of service per week for all measurement periods through the measurement period ending October 14, 2020. On February 12, 2021, Employee A experiences a change in position of employment with Employer Z to a position under which Employer Z reasonably expects Employee A to average less than 30 hours of service per week. For the calendar months after February 2021, Employee A averages less than 30 hours of service per week. Employer Z offered Employee A coverage that provided minimum value continuously from September 1, 2015, through May 31, 2021. Effective June 1, 2021, Employer Z elects to apply the monthly measurement method to determine Employee A's status as a full-time employee for the remainder of the stability period ending December 31, 2021, and the calendar year 2022 (which is through the end of the first full measurement period following the change in employment status plus the associated administrative period). Applying the stability period beginning January 1, 2021, Employer Z treats Employee A as a full-time employee for each calendar month from January 2021 through May 2021. Applying the monthly measurement method, for each calendar month from June 2021 through December 2022, Employer Z treats Employee A as not a full-time employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because Employer Z offered coverage that provided minimum value to Employee A from no later than the first day of the fourth full calendar month following Employee A's start date through the calendar month in which the change in employment status occurred, and because Employee A did not average 30 hours of service per week for any of the three calendar months immediately following Employee A's change in employment status to an employee not reasonably expected to average 30 hours of service per week, Employer Z may use the monthly measurement method to determine the full-time employee status of Employee A beginning on the first day of the fourth month following the change in employment status (June 1, 2021) through the end of the first full measurement period (plus any associated administrative period) immediately following the change in employment status (December 31, 2022). Because Employee A did not average at least 30 hours of service per week for any calendar month from June 2021 through December 2022, Employer Z has properly treated Employee A as not a full-time employee for those calendar months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Same facts as Example 1, except that at Employee A's start date, Employer Z reasonably expects that Employee A will average at least 30 hours of service per week. Accordingly, Employer Z offers coverage to Employee A beginning on September 1, 2015, and offers coverage continuously to Employee A for all calendar months through May 2021.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Same as Example 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Nonpayment or late payment of premiums. An applicable large employer member will not be treated as failing to offer to a full-time employee (and his or her dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for an employee whose coverage under the plan is terminated during the coverage period solely due to the employee failing to make a timely payment of the employee portion of the premium. This treatment continues only through the end of the coverage period (typically the plan year). For this purpose, the rules in Sec. 54.4980B-8, Q&A-5;(a), (c), (d) and (e) apply under this section to the payment for coverage with respect to a full-time employee in the same manner that they apply to payment for COBRA continuation coverage under Sec. 54.4980B-8.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Additional guidance.

Sec. 54.4980H-4  Assessable payments under section 4980H(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If an applicable large employer member fails to offer to its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for any

calendar month, and the applicable large employer member has received a Section 1411 Certification with respect to at least one full-time employee, an assessable payment is imposed. For the calendar month, the applicable large employer member will owe an assessable payment equal to the product of the section 4980H(a) applicable payment amount and the number of full-time employees of the applicable large employer member (other than employees in a limited non-assessment period for certain employees and as adjusted in accordance with paragraph (e) of this section). For purposes of this paragraph (a), an applicable large employer member is treated as offering such coverage to its full-time employees (and their dependents) for a calendar month if, for that month, it offers such coverage to all but five percent (or, if greater, five) of its full-time employees (provided that an employee is treated as having been offered coverage only if the employer also offers coverage to that employee's dependents). For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee in a limited non-assessment period for certain employees is not included in the calculation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Offer of coverage--(1) In general. An applicable large employer member will not be treated as having made an offer of coverage to a full-time employee for a plan year if the employee does not have an effective opportunity to elect to enroll in the coverage at least once with respect to the plan year, or does not have an effective opportunity to decline to enroll if the coverage offered does not provide minimum value or requires an employee contribution for any calendar month of more than 9.5 percent of a monthly amount determined as the federal poverty line for a single individual for the applicable calendar year, divided by 12. For this purpose, the applicable federal poverty line is the federal poverty line for the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Whether an employee has an effective opportunity to enroll or to decline to enroll is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, including adequacy of notice of the availability of the offer of coverage, the period of time during which acceptance of the offer of coverage may be made, and any other conditions on the offer. An employee's election of coverage from a prior year that continues for the next plan year unless the employee affirmatively elects to opt out of the plan constitutes an offer of coverage for purposes of section 4980H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. An applicable large employer member will not be treated as having made an offer of coverage to a full-time employee for a plan year if the employee does not have an effective opportunity to elect to enroll in the coverage at least once with respect to the plan year, or does not have an effective opportunity to decline to enroll if the coverage offered does not provide minimum value or requires an employee contribution for any calendar month of more than 9.5 percent of a monthly amount determined as the federal poverty line for a single individual for the applicable calendar year, divided by 12. For this purpose, the applicable federal poverty line is the federal poverty line for the 48 contiguous states and the District of Columbia. Whether an employee has an effective opportunity to enroll or to decline to enroll is determined based on all the relevant facts and circumstances, including adequacy of notice of the availability of the offer of coverage, the period of time during which acceptance of the offer of coverage may be made, and any other conditions on the offer. An employee's election of coverage from a prior year that continues for the next plan year unless the employee affirmatively elects to opt out of the plan constitutes an offer of coverage for purposes of section 4980H.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Offer of coverage on behalf of another entity. For purposes of section 4980H, an offer of coverage by one applicable large employer member to an employee for a calendar month is treated as an offer of coverage by all applicable large employer members for that calendar month. In addition, an offer of coverage made to an employee on behalf of a contributing employer under a multiemployer or single employer Taft-Hartley plan or multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) is treated as made by the employer. For an offer of coverage to an employee performing services for an employer that is a client of a staffing firm, in cases in which the staffing firm is not the common law employer of the individual and the staffing firm makes an offer of coverage to the employee on behalf of the client employer under a plan established or maintained by the staffing firm, the offer is treated as made by the client employer for purposes of section 4980H only if the fee the client employer would pay to the staffing firm for an employee enrolled in health coverage under the plan is higher than the fee the client employer would pay the staffing firm for the same employee if that employee did not enroll in health coverage under the plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partial calendar month. If an applicable large employer member fails to offer coverage to a full-time employee for any day of a calendar month, that employee is treated as not offered coverage during that entire month, regardless of whether the employer uses the payroll period rule set forth in Sec. 54.4980H-3(d)(1)(ii) or the weekly rule set forth in Sec. 54.4980H-3(c)(3) to determine full-time employee status for the calendar month. However, in a calendar month in which the employment of a full-time employee terminates, if the employee would have been offered coverage for the entire calendar month had the employee been employed for

the entire calendar month, the employee is treated as having been offered coverage for that entire calendar month. In addition, an applicable large employer member is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to an employee for the calendar month in which the employee's start date occurs if the start date is on a date other than the first day of the calendar month, and, in addition, with respect to the calendar month in which the start date occurs, such an employee is not included for purposes of the calculation of any potential liability under section 4980H(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Application to applicable large employer member. The liability for an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for a calendar month with respect to a full-time employee applies solely to the applicable large employer member that was the employer of that employee for that calendar month. For an employee who was an employee of more than one applicable large employer member of the same applicable large employer during a calendar month, the liability for the assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for a calendar month applies to the applicable large employer member for whom the employee has the greatest number of hours of service for that calendar month (if the employee has an equal number of hours of service for two or more applicable large employer members of the same applicable large employer for the calendar month, those applicable large employer members can treat one of those members as the employer of that employee for that calendar month for purposes of this section, and if the members do not select one member, or select in an inconsistent manner, the IRS will select a member to be treated as the employer of that employee for purposes of the assessable payment determination). For a calendar month, an applicable large employer member may be liable for an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) or under section 4980H(b), but will not be liable for an assessable payment under both section 4980H(a) and section 4980H(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Allocated reduction of 30 full-time employees. For purposes of the liability calculation under paragraph (a) of this section, with respect to each calendar month, an applicable large employer member's number of full-time employees is reduced by that member's allocable share of 30. The applicable large employer member's allocation is equal to 30 allocated ratably among all members of the applicable large employer on the basis of the number of full-time employees employed by each applicable large employer member during the calendar month (after application of the rules of paragraph (d) of this section addressing employees who work for more than one applicable large employer member during a calendar month). If an applicable large employer member's total allocation is not a whole number, the allocation is rounded to the next highest whole number. This rounding rule may result in the aggregate reduction for the entire group of applicable large employer members exceeding 30.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Example. The following example illustrates the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Applicable large employer member Z and applicable large employer member Y are the two members of an applicable large employer. Applicable large employer member Z employs 40 full-time employees in each calendar month of 2017. Applicable large employer member Y employs 35 full-time employees in each calendar month of 2017. Assume that for 2017, the applicable payment amount for a calendar month is $2,000 divided by 12. Applicable large employer member Z does not sponsor an eligible employer-sponsored plan for any calendar month of 2017, and receives a Section 1411 Certification for 2017 with respect to at least one of its full-time employees. Applicable large employer member Y sponsors an eligible employer-sponsored plan under which all of its full-time employees are eligible for minimum essential coverage.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Pursuant to section 4980H(a) and this section, applicable large employer member Z is subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for 2017 of $48,000, which is equal to 24 x $2,000 (40 full-time employees reduced by 16 (its allocable share of the 30-employee offset ((40/75) x 30 = 16)) and then multiplied by $2,000). Applicable large employer member Y is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) for 2017.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Additional guidance.

Sec. 54.4980H-5  Assessable payments under section 4980H(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> In general. If an applicable large employer member offers to its full-time employees (and their dependents) the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan for any calendar month (including an offer of coverage to all but five percent or less (or, if greater, five or less) of its full-time employees (provided that an employee is treated as having been offered coverage only if the employer also offers coverage to that employee's dependents)) and the applicable large employer member has received a Section 1411 Certification with respect to one or more full-time employees of the applicable large employer member, then there is imposed on the applicable large employer member an assessable payment equal to the product of the number of full-time employees of the applicable large employer member for which it has received a Section 1411 Certification (minus the number of those employees in a limited non-assessment period for certain employees and the number of other employees who were offered the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan that satisfied minimum value and met one or more of the affordability safe harbors described in paragraph (e) of this section) and the section 4980H(b) applicable payment amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the aggregate amount of assessable payment determined under this paragraph (a) with respect to all employees of an applicable large employer member for any calendar month may not exceed the product of the section 4980H(a) applicable payment amount and the number of full-time employees of the applicable large employer member during that calendar month (reduced by the applicable large employer member's ratable allocation of the 30 employee reduction under Sec. 54.4980H-4(e)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Offer of coverage. For purposes of this section, the same rules with respect to an offer of coverage for purposes of section 4980H(a) apply. See Sec. 54.4980H-4.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Partial calendar month. If an applicable large employer member fails to offer coverage to a full-time employee for any day of a calendar month, that employee is treated as not offered coverage during that entire month, regardless of whether the employer uses the payroll period rule set forth in Sec. 54.4980H-3(d)(1)(ii) or the weekly rule set forth in Sec. 54.4980H-3(c)(3) to determine full-time employee status for the calendar month. However, in a calendar month in which a full-time employee's employment terminates, if the employee would have been offered coverage if the employee had been employed for the entire month, the employee is treated as having been offered coverage during that month. Also, an applicable large employer member is not subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H with respect to an employee for the calendar month in which the employee's start date occurs if the start date is on a date other than the first day of the calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Applicability to applicable large employer member. The liability for an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) for a calendar month with respect to a full-time employee applies solely to the applicable large employer member that was the employer of that employee for that calendar month. For an employee who was a full-time employee of more than one applicable large employer member during that calendar month, the liability for the assessable payment under section 4980H(b) for a calendar month applies to the applicable large employer member for whom the employee has the greatest number of hours of service for that calendar month (if the employee has an equal number of hours of service for two or more applicable large employer members for the calendar month, those applicable large employer members can treat one of those members as the employer of that employee for that calendar month for purposes of this paragraph (d), and if the members

do not select one member, or select in an inconsistent manner, the IRS will select a member to be treated as the employer of that employee for purposes of the assessable payment determination). For a calendar month, an applicable large employer member may be liable for an assessable payment under section 4980H(a) or under section 4980H(b), but will not be liable for an assessable payment under both section 4980H(a) and section 4980H(b).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Affordability--(1) In general.

The affordability safe harbors set forth in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) through (iv) of this section apply solely for purposes of section 4980H(b), so that an applicable large employer member that offers minimum essential coverage providing minimum value will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to any employee receiving the applicable premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction for a period for which the coverage is determined to be affordable under the requirements of an affordability safe harbor. This rule applies even if the applicable large employer member's offer of coverage that meets the requirements of an affordability safe harbor is not affordable for a particular employee under section 36B(c)(2)(C)(i) and an applicable premium tax credit or cost-sharing reduction is allowed or paid with respect to that employee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Conditions of using an affordability safe harbor. An applicable large employer member may use one or more of the affordability safe harbors described in this paragraph (e)(2) only if the employer offers its full-time employees and their dependents the opportunity to enroll in minimum essential coverage under an eligible employer-sponsored plan that provides minimum value with respect to the self-only coverage offered to the employee. Use of any of the safe harbors is optional for an applicable large employer member, and an applicable large employer member may choose to apply the safe harbors for any reasonable category of employees, provided it does so on a uniform and consistent basis for all employees in a category. Reasonable categories generally include specified job categories, nature of compensation (hourly or salary), geographic location, and similar bona fide business criteria. An enumeration of employees by name or other specific criteria having substantially the same effect as an enumeration by name is not considered a reasonable category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Form W-2 safe harbor--(A) Full-year offer of coverage. An employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to a full-time employee if that employee's required contribution for the calendar year for the employer's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value during the entire calendar year (excluding COBRA or other continuation coverage except with respect to an active employee eligible for continuation coverage) does not exceed 9.5 percent of that employee's Form W-2 wages from the employer (and any other member of the same applicable large employer that also pays wages to that employee) for the calendar year. Application of this safe harbor is determined after the end of the calendar year and on an employee-by-employee basis, taking into account the Form W-2 wages and the required employee contribution for that year. In addition, to qualify for this safe harbor, the employee's required contribution must remain a consistent amount or percentage of all Form W-2 wages during the calendar year (or during the plan year for plans with non-calendar year plan years) so that an applicable large employer member is not permitted to make discretionary adjustments to the required employee contribution for a pay period. A periodic contribution that is based on a consistent percentage of all Form W-2 wages may be subject to a dollar limit specified by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Full-year offer of coverage. An employer will not be subject to an assessable payment under section 4980H(b) with respect to a full-time employee if that employee's required contribution for the calendar year for the employer's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value during the entire calendar year (excluding COBRA or other continuation coverage except with respect to an active employee eligible for continuation coverage) does not exceed 9.5 percent of that employee's Form W-2 wages from the employer (and any other member of the same applicable large employer that also pays wages to that employee) for the calendar year. Application of this safe harbor is determined after the end of the calendar year and on an employee-by-employee basis, taking into account the Form W-2 wages and the required employee contribution for that year.

A periodic contribution that is based on a consistent percentage of all Form W-2 wages may be subject to a dollar limit specified by the employer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Adjustment for partial-year offer of coverage. For an employee not offered coverage for an entire calendar year, the Form W-2 safe harbor is applied by

adjusting the Form W-2 wages to reflect the period for which coverage was offered, then determining whether the employee's required contribution for the employer's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value, totaled for the periods during which coverage was offered, does not exceed 9.5 percent of the adjusted amount of Form W-2 wages. To adjust Form W-2 wages for this purpose, the Form W-2 wages are multiplied by a fraction equal to the number of calendar months for which coverage was offered over the number of calendar months in the employee's period of employment with the employer during the calendar year. For this purpose, if coverage is offered during at least one day during the calendar month, or the employee is employed for at least one day during the calendar month, the entire calendar month is counted in determining the applicable fraction.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Rate of pay safe harbor. An applicable large employer member satisfies the rate of pay safe harbor with respect to an hourly employee for a calendar month if the employee's required contribution for the calendar month for the applicable large employer member's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value does not exceed 9.5 percent of an amount equal to 130 hours multiplied by the lower of the employee's hourly rate of pay as of the first day of the coverage period (generally the first day of the plan year) or the employee's lowest hourly rate of pay during the calendar month. An applicable large employer member satisfies the rate of pay safe harbor with respect to a non-hourly employee for a calendar month if the employee's required contribution for the calendar month for the applicable large employer member's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value does not exceed 9.5 percent of the employee's monthly salary, as of the first day of the coverage period (instead of 130 multiplied by the hourly rate of pay); provided that if the monthly salary is reduced, including due to a reduction in work hours, the safe harbor is not available, and, solely for purposes of this paragraph (e)(2)(iii), an applicable large employer member may use any reasonable method for converting payroll periods to monthly salary. For this purpose, if coverage is offered during at least one day during the calendar month, the entire calendar month is counted both for purposes of determining the assumed income for the calendar month and for determining the employee's share of the premium for the calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Federal poverty line safe harbor. An applicable large employer member satisfies the federal poverty line safe harbor with respect to an employee for a calendar month if the employee's required contribution for the calendar month for the applicable large employer member's lowest cost self-only coverage that provides minimum value does not exceed 9.5 percent of a monthly amount determined as the federal poverty line for a single individual for the applicable calendar year, divided by 12. For this purpose, if coverage is offered during at least one day during the calendar month, the entire calendar month is counted both for purposes of determining the monthly amount for the calendar month and for determining the employee's share of the premium for the calendar month. For this purpose, the applicable federal poverty line is the federal poverty line for the State in which the employee is employed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate the application of the affordability safe harbors described in this paragraph (e)(2). In each example, each employer is an applicable large employer member with 200 full-time employees (including full-time equivalent employees).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee A is employed by Employer Z consistently from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. In addition, Employer Z offers Employee A and his dependents minimum essential coverage during that period that provides minimum value. The employee contribution for self-only coverage is $100 per calendar month, or $1,200 for the calendar year. For 2015, Employee A's Form W-2 wages with respect to employment with Employer Z are $24,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the employee contribution for 2015 is less than 9.5 percent of Employee A's Form W-2 wages for 2015, the coverage offered is treated as affordable with respect to Employee A for 2015 ($1,200 is 5 percent of $24,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee B is employed by Employer Y from January 1, 2015, through September 30, 2015. In addition, Employer Y offers Employee B and his dependents minimum essential coverage during that period that provides minimum value. The employee contribution for self-only coverage is $100 per calendar month, or $900 for Employee B's period of employment. For 2015, Employee B's Form W-2 wages with respect to employment with Employer Y are $18,000. For purposes of applying the affordability safe harbor, the Form W-2 wages are multiplied by 9/9 (9 calendar months of coverage offered over 9 months of employment during the calendar year) or 1. Accordingly, affordability is determined by comparing the adjusted Form W-2 wages ($18,000) to the employee contribution for the period for which coverage was offered ($900).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the employee contribution for 2015 is less than 9.5 percent of Employee B's adjusted Form W-2 wages for 2015, the coverage offered is treated as affordable with respect to Employee B for 2015 ($900 is 5 percent of $18,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee C is employed by Employer X from May 15, 2015, through December 31, 2015. In addition, Employer X offers Employee C and her dependents minimum essential coverage during the period from August 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, that provides minimum value. The employee contribution for self-only coverage is $100 per calendar month, or $500 for Employee C's period of employment. For 2015, Employee C's Form W-2 wages with respect to employment with Employer X are $15,000. For purposes of applying the affordability safe harbor, the Form W-2 wages are multiplied by 5/8 (5 calendar months of coverage offered over 8 months of employment during the calendar year). Accordingly, affordability is determined by comparing the adjusted Form W-2 wages ($9,375 or $15,000 x 5/8) to the employee contribution for the period for which coverage was offered ($500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because the employee contribution of $500 is less than 9.5 percent of $9,375 (Employee C's adjusted Form W-2 wages for 2015), the coverage offered is treated as affordable with respect to Employee C for 2015 ($500 is 5.33 percent of $9,375).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employer W offers its full-time employees and their dependents minimum essential coverage that provides minimum value. For the 2016 calendar year, Employer W is using the rate of pay safe harbor to establish premium contribution amounts for full-time employees paid at a rate of $7.25 per hour (the minimum wage in Employer W's jurisdiction) for each calendar month of the entire 2016 calendar year. Employer W can apply the affordability safe harbor by using an assumed monthly income amount that is based on an assumed 130 hours of service multiplied by $7.25 per hour ($942.50 per calendar month). To satisfy the safe harbor, Employer W would set the employee monthly contribution amount at a rate that does not exceed 9.5 percent of the assumed monthly income of $942.50. Employer W sets the employee contribution for self-only coverage at $85 per calendar month for 2016.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because $85 is less than 9.5 percent of the employee's assumed monthly income at a $7.25 rate of pay, the coverage offered is treated as affordable under the rate of pay safe harbor for each calendar month of 2016 ($85 is 9.01 percent of $942.50).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee E is employed by Employer V from May 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. Employer V offers Employee E and her dependents minimum essential coverage from May 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, that provides minimum value. The employee contribution for self-only coverage is $100 per calendar month. From May 1, 2015, through October 31, 2015, Employee E is paid at a rate of $10 per hour. From November 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015, Employee E is paid at a rate of $12 per hour. For purposes of applying the affordability safe harbor for the calendar months May 2015 through October 2015, Employer V may assume that Employee E earned $1,300 per calendar month (130 hours of service multiplied by $10 (which is the lower of the employee's hourly rate of pay at the beginning of the coverage period ($10) and the lowest hourly rate of pay for the calendar month ($10)). Accordingly, affordability is determined by comparing the assumed income ($1,300 per month) to the employee contribution ($100 per calendar month). For the calendar months November 2015 through December 2015, Employer V may assume that Employee E earned $1,300 per calendar month (130 hours of service multiplied by $10 (which is the lower of the employee's hourly rate of pay at the beginning of the coverage period ($10) and the lowest hourly rate of pay for the calendar month ($12)). Accordingly, affordability is determined by comparing the assumed income ($1,300 per month) to the employee contribution ($100 per calendar month).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Because $100 is less than 9.5 percent of Employee E's assumed monthly income for each calendar month from May 2015 through December 2015, the coverage offered is treated as affordable with respect to Employee E for May 2015 through December 2015 ($100 is 7.69 percent of $1,300).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Facts. Employee F is employed by Employer T from January 1, 2015, through December 31, 2015. In addition, Employer T offers Employee F and his dependents minimum essential coverage during that period that provides minimum value. Employer T

uses the look-back measurement method. Under that measurement method as applied by Employer T, Employee F is treated as a full-time employee for the entire calendar year 2015. Employee F is regularly credited with 35 hours of service per week but is credited with only 20 hours of service during the month of March 2015 and only 15 hours of service during the month of August 2015. Assume for this purpose that the federal poverty line for 2015 for an individual is $11,670. With respect to Employee F, Employer T sets the monthly employee contribution for employee single-only coverage for each calendar month of 2015 at $92.39 (9.5 percent of $11,670, divided by 12).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Conclusion. Regardless of Employee F's actual wages for any calendar month in 2015, including the months of March 2015 and August 2015, when Employee F has lower wages because of significantly lower hours of service, the coverage under the plan is treated as affordable with respect to Employee F, because the employee contribution does not exceed 9.5 percent of the federal poverty line.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Additional guidance. With respect to assessable payments under section 4980H(b), including the determination of whether an offer of coverage is affordable for purposes of section 4980H, the Commissioner may prescribe additional guidance of general applicability, published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin (see Sec. 601.601(d)(2)(ii)(b) of this chapter).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective/applicability date.

Sec. 54.4981A-1T  Tax on excess distributions and excess accumulations (temporary).</p><p class="depth0">The following questions and answers relate to the tax on excess distributions and excess accumulations under section 4981A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as added by section 1133 of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (Pub. L. 99-514) (TRA '86).</p><p class="depth0">Table of Contents

General Provisions and Excess Distributions</p><p class="depth0">a-1: Q. What changes were made by section 1133 of TRA '86 regarding excise taxes applicable to distributions from qualified employer plans and individual retirement plans?</p><p class="depth0">A. Section 1133 of TRA '86 added section 4981A to the Code. Section 4981A imposes an excise tax of 15 percent on (a) excess distributions, as defined in section 4981A(c)(1) and Q&A; a-2 of this section, and (b) excess accumulations, as defined in section 4981A(d)(3) and Q&A; d-2 of this section. The excise tax on excess distributions generally applies to excess distributions made after December 31, 1986 (see Q&A; c-6 of this section). The excise tax on excess accumulations applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1986 (see Q&A; d-11 of this section). Excess distributions are certain distributions from qualified employer plans and individual retirement plans. Excess accumulations are certain amounts held on the date of death of an employee or individual by qualified plans and individual retirement plans.</p><p class="depth0">a-2: Q. How are excess distributions defined?</p><p class="depth0">A. Excess distributions are generally defined as the excess of the aggregate amount of distributions received by or with respect to an individual during a calendar year over the greater of (a) $150,000 (unindexed) or (b) $112,500 (indexed as provided in Q&A; a-9 of this section beginning in 1988 for cost-of-living increases). Certain individuals may elect to have the portion of their excess distributions that is subject to tax determined under a ``special grandfather'' rule that is described below (see Q&A; b-1 through b-14 of this section).</p><p class="depth0">a-3: Q. Distributions from what plans and arrangements are taken into account in applying section 4981A?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Section 4981A applies to distributions under any qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan described in section 4981A(e). For this purpose, a qualified employer plan means any--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Qualified pension, profit-sharing or stock bonus plan described in section 401(a) that includes a trust exempt from tax under section 501(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Annuity plan described in section 403(a);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Annuity contract, custodial account, or retirement income account described in section 403(b)(1), 403(b)(7) or 403(b)(9); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Qualified bond purchase plan described in section 405(a) prior to that section's repeal by section 491(a) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA '84).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Individual retirement plan. An individual retirement plan is defined in section 7701(a)(37) and means any individual retirement account described in section 408(a) or individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b). Also, an individual retirement plan includes a retirement bond described in section 409(a) prior to that section's repeal by section 491(b) of the Tax Reform Act of 1984 (TRA '84).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other distributions. (1) Distributions under any plan, contract or account that has at any time been treated as a qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Q&A; a-3 will be treated for purposes of section 4981A as distributions from a qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan whether or not such plan, contract, or account satisfies the applicable qualification requirements at the time of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Distributions under any plan, contract or account that has at any time been treated as a qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan described in paragraph (a) or (b) of this Q&A; a-3 will be treated for purposes of section 4981A as distributions from a qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan whether or not such plan, contract, or account satisfies the applicable qualification requirements at the time of the distribution.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), an employer plan will be considered to have been treated as a qualified employer plan if any employer maintaining the plan has at any time filed an income tax return and claimed deductions that would be allowable under section 404 (and that were not disallowed) only if the plan was a qualified employer plan under section 401(a) or 403(a). Similarly, if an income tax return has been filed at any time with respect to the trust (or plan or insurance company), and the income of the trust (insurance company, etc.) is reported (and is not disallowed) based on the trust (or plan) being treated as a qualified employer plan described in section 401(a), or 403 (a) or (b), then the employer plan is considered to have been treated as a qualified employer plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), an employer plan will be considered to have been treated as a qualified employer plan if any employer maintaining the plan has at any time filed an income tax return and claimed deductions that would be allowable under section 404 (and that were not disallowed) only if the plan was a qualified employer plan under section 401(a) or 403(a). Similarly, if an income tax return has been filed at any time with respect to the trust (or plan or insurance company), and the income of the trust (insurance company, etc.) is reported (and is not disallowed) based on the trust (or plan) being treated as a qualified employer plan described in section 401(a), or 403 (a) or (b), then the employer plan is considered to have been treated as a qualified employer plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this paragraph (c), an individual retirement plan (IRA) will be considered to have been treated as a qualified IRA if any contributions to the IRA were either deducted (or designated as a nondeductible contribution described in section 408(o)) on a filed individual income tax return or excluded from an individual's gross income on a filed income tax return because such contributions were reported as regular contributions or rollover contributions (such as those described in section 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8) or 408(d)(3)) to an IRA described in section 408 (a) or (b) (or section 409 of pre-1984 law). Similar treatment applies to an employer contribution to a simplified employee pension described in section 408(k), if such contribution is deducted on an employer's filed income tax return, including a self-employed individual's return.</p><p class="depth0">a-4: Q. Which distributions with respect to an individual under a qualified employer plan or an individual retirement plan are excluded from consideration for purposes of determining an individual's excess distributions?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exclusions. In determining the extent to which an individual has excess distributions for a calendar year, the following distributions are disregarded--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Any distribution received by any person with respect to an individual as a result of the death of that individual.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Any distribution with respect to an individual that is received by an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) that is includible in the income of the alternate payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Any distribution with respect to an individual that is attributable to the individual's investment in the contract as determined under the rules of section 72(f). This would include, for example, distributions that are excluded from gross income under section 72 because they are treated as a recovery of after-tax employee contributions

from a qualified employer plan or nondeductible contributions from an individual retirement plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Any portion of a distribution to the extent that it is not included in gross income by reason of a rollover contribution described in section 402(a)(5), 403(a)(4), 403(b)(8), or 408(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Any health coverage or any distribution of medical benefits provided under an arrangement described in section 401(h) to the extent that the coverage or distribution is excludible under section 104, 105, or 106.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Alternate payee. Any distributions to an alternate payee described in paragraph (a)(2) of this Q&A; a-4 must be taken into account by such alternate payee for purposes of calculating the excess distributions received by (or excess accumulations held by) the alternate payee.</p><p class="depth0">a-5: Q. If an annuity contract that represents an irrevocable commitment to provide an employee's benefits under the plan is distributed to an individual, how are the distribution of such annuity contract and distributions of amounts under such a contract taken into account for purposes of calculating excess distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Except to the extent that the value of an annuity contract is includible in income in the year the contract is distributed or any subsequent year, the distribution of an annuity contract (including a group annuity contract) in satisfaction of plan liabilities is disregarded for purposes of calculating excess distributions. Any amounts that are actually distributed under the contract to the individual (to the extent not excluded under Q&A; a-4 of this section) or are otherwise includible in income with respect to the contract (e.g., by reason of the inclusion in income of the value of the annuity contract in the year of the contract's distribution or any subsequent year) are taken into account for purposes of calculating excess distributions for the calendar year during which such amounts are received or otherwise includible in income. For purposes of this Q&A; a-5, the term plan means any qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan specified in section 4981A(e) and Q&A; a-3 of this section.</p><p class="depth0">a-6: Q. Are minimum distributions required under section 401(a)(9), 408(a)(6), 408(b)(3) or 403(b)(10) taken into account to determine excess distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. Distributions received during a calendar year are taken into account in determining an individual's excess distributions for such calendar year even though such distributions are required under section 401(a)(9), 408(a)(6), 408(b)(3) or 403(b)(10). For example, minimum distributions under section 401(a)(9) received during the 1987 calendar year for calendar years 1985 and 1986 will be subject to section 4981A as distributions for 1987.</p><p class="depth0">a-7: Q. Are distributions of excess deferrals permitted under section 402(g)(2), or distributions of excess contributions or excess aggregate contributions permitted under section 401(k) or (m), or distributions of IRA contributions permitted under section 408(d) (4) or (5) taken into account for purposes of calculating excess distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Distributions of excess deferrals, excess contributions, excess aggregate contributions, distributions of IRA contributions, and income allocable to such contributions or deferrals, that are made in accordance with the provisions of sections 402(g)(2), 401(k)(8), 401(m)(6), or 408(d) (4) or (5) are not taken into account for purposes of calculating excess distributions.</p><p class="depth0">a-8: Q. What distributions from qualified employer plans or individual retirement plans are taken into account in determining an individual's excess distributions?</p><p class="depth0">A. With the exception of distributions noted above in Q&As; a-4, a-5, and a-7 of this section, all distributions from qualified employer plans or individual retirement plans must be taken into account in determining an individual's excess distributions for the calendar year in which such distributions are received. In general, all such distributions are taken into account whether or not they are currently includible in income. Thus, for example, net unrealized appreciation in employer securities described in section 402(a) is taken into account in the year distributed. However, health coverage or distributions of medical benefits

provided under an arrangement described in section 401(h) that are excludible from income under section 104, 105, or 106 are not subject to section 4981A. In addition, distributions that are excludible from income because they are rolled over to a plan or an individual retirement account are not taken into account. (See Q&A; a-4(a) (4) and (5) of this section). Amounts that are includible in income for a calendar year are treated as distributions and, thus, are taken into account even if the amounts are not actually distributed during such year. Thus, deemed distributions to provide insurance coverage includible in income under section 72 (PS-58 amounts), loan amounts treated as deemed distributions under section 72(p), and amounts includible under section 402(b) or section 403(c) by reason of the employer plan or individual retirement plan not being qualified during the year are taken into account.</p><p class="depth0">a-9: Q. Will the dollar threshold amount used to determine an individual's excess distributions be adjusted for inflation in calendar years after 1987?</p><p class="depth0">A. Beginning in 1988, the $112,500 threshold amount is adjusted to reflect post-1986 cost-of-living increases (COLAs) at the same time and in the same manner as the adjustment described in section 415(d). The threshold amount is adjusted even though the distribution is from a defined contribution plan that is subject to a freeze on COLAs because the defined benefit plan limit is below $120,000 (see section 415(c)(1)(A)). However, the $150,000 threshold amount is not adjusted to reflect such increases.</p><p class="depth0">b. Special Grandfather Rule</p><p class="depth0">b-1: Q. How are benefits accrued before TRA '86 treated under the excise tax provisions described in section 4981A?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Grandfather amount. Certain eligible individuals may elect to use a special grandfather rule that exempts from the excise tax the portion of distributions treated as a recovery of such individual's total benefits accrued on or before August 1, 1986 (grandfather amount). However, distributions that are treated as a recovery of the grandfather amount are taken into account in determining the extent to which other distributions are excess distributions (see Q&A; b-4 of this section). Under this special grandfather rule, the grandfather amount equals the value of an individual's total benefits (as described in Q&As; b-8 and b-9 of this section) in all qualified employer plans and individual retirement plans on August 1, 1986. An individual's benefits in such plans include amounts determinable on August 1, 1986, that are payable to the individual under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) (QDRO). However, QDRO benefits that, when destributed, are includible in the income of the alternate payee are not included in the employee's grandfathered amount. Further, plan benefits that are attributable to a deceased individual and that are payable to an eligible individual as a beneficiary are generally not included in determining the eligible individual's grandfather amount. Procedures for determining the grandfather amount are described in Q&As; b-11 through b-14 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Recovery of grandfather amount. The portion of any distribution made after August 1, 1986, that is treated as a recovery of a grandfather amount depends on which of two grandfather recovery methods the individual elects. The two alternative methods are described in the Q&As; b-11 through b-14 of this section. The amount of the distribution for a year that is treated as a recovery of a grandfather amount in a year is applied to reduce the individual's unrecovered grandfather amount for future years (i.e., the individual's accrued benefits as described in Q&As; b-8 and b-9 on August 1, 1986, reduced by previous distributions treated as a recovery of a grandfather amount) on a dollar for dollar basis until the individual's unrecovered grandfather amount has been reduced to zero. When the individual's grandfather amount has been reduced to zero, the special grandfather rule ceases to apply and the entire amount of any subsequent excess distributions received is subject to the 15 percent excise tax.</p><p class="depth0">b-2: Q. Who may elect to use the special grandfather rules?</p><p class="depth0">A. Any individual whose accrued benefits as described in Q&As; b-8 and b-9 of this section in all qualified plans and individual retirement plans on August 1, 1986 (initial grandfather amount) have a value of at least $562,500 may elect to use the special grandfather rule.</p><p class="depth0">b-3: Q. How does an eligible individual make a valid election to use the special grandfather rule?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Form of election. An individual who is eligible to use the special grandfather rule must affirmatively elect to use that rule. The election is made on a Form 5329 filed with the individual's income tax return (Form 1040, etc.) for a taxable year beginning after December 31, 1986, and before January 1, 1989 (i.e., the 1987 or 1988 taxable year).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Information required. The individual must report the following information on the Form 5329:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The individual's initial grandfather amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The grandfather recovery method to be used.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Such other information as is required by the Form 5329.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Deadline for election. The deadline for filing such election is the due date, calculated with extensions, for filing the individual's 1988 income tax return. If an individual dies before the expiration of such deadline, an election, or the revocation of a prior election, may be made as part of the final income tax return filed on behalf of such deceased individual by the deceased individual's personal representative. An election or revocation of a prior election may also be filed before the expiration of such deadline with Schedule S (Form 706). See Q&A; c-7 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Revocation of election. Elections filed before the deadline may be revoked by filing an amended income tax return for any applicable year. A change in the grandfather recovery method is considered a revocation of a prior election and an amended Form 5329 must be filed for any prior year in which a different grandfather recovery method was used. Thus, a change in the election may require a change in the 1987 tax return. An individual must refile for 1987 based on the new election if additional tax is owed. However, an election (or nonelection) is irrevocable after the filing deadline for the taxable year beginning in 1988 has passed. Thus, an individual who has not made an election by the last day plus extensions for filing the 1988 return may not do so through an amended return.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Subsequent years.

Individuals who elect to use the special grandfather rule are not eligible to use the $150,000 threshold amount in computing their excess distributions for any calendar year. Instead, such electing individuals must compute their excess distributions for a calendar year using a $112,500 (indexed for cost-of-living increases) threshold amount. The rule of this paragraph (a) applies for all calendar years, including the calendar year in which an individual's unrecovered grandfather amount has been reduced to zero and all subsequent calendar years.

Although the portion of any

distribution that is treated as a recovery of an individual's grandfather amount is not subject to the excise tax, such portion must be taken into account in determining the extent to which the individual has excess distributions for a calendar year. The effect of this rule is that the amount against which the 15 percent excise tax is applied for any calendar year during which a grandfather amount is recovered equals the individual's distributions for such year reduced by the greater of (1) the applicable threshold amount for such year or (2) the grandfather amount recovered for such year.

How is the value of an individual's total accrued benefits on August 1, 1986, calculated for purposes of determining (a) whether an individual is eligible to elect the special grandfather rule and (b) the amount of any electing individual's initial grandfather amount under such rule?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. The value of an individual's total accrued benefits on August 1, 1986, is the sum of the values of the individual's accrued benefits on such date under all qualified employer plans or individual retirement plans, as determined under the Q&A; b-5. If such value exceeds $562,500, the individual may elect the special grandfather rule. In such case, the value so determined may be applied against distributions as determined under this section, whether or not such distributions are from the same plan or IRA for which such grandfather amount is determined. For purposes of determining the value of accrued benefits on August 1, 1986, an annuity contract or an individual's interest in a group annuity contract described in Q&A; a-5 of this section is treated as an accrued benefit under the qualified retirement plan or IRA from which it was distributed and an IRA is treated as a defined contribution plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Defined benefit plan--(1) General rule. The amount of an individual's accrued benefit on August 1, 1986, under a defined benefit plan is determined as of that date under the provisions of the plan based on the individual's service and compensation on that date. The present value of such benefit is determined by an actuarial valuation of such accrued benefit performed as of August 1, 1986. Alternatively, accrued benefits may be determined as of July 31, 1986. In such case, the applicable rules are applied by substituting the July 31 date for the August 1 date in the applicable provisions.

Similarly, such amounts are used by the alternate payee to compute excess distributions.</p><p class="depth0">b-8: Q. What adjustments to the grandfather amount are necessary to take into account rollovers from one qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan to another such plan?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Rollovers outstanding on valuation date. Generally, rollovers between plans result in adjustment to the grandfather amounts under the rules in Q&A; b-5 of this section. However, if a rollover amount is distributed from one plan on or before an applicable valuation date of such plan and is rolled over into the receiving plan after the receiving plan's applicable valuation date and if these events result in an inappropriate duplication or omission of the rollover amount, then an adjustment to the grandfather amount must be made to remove the duplication or omission. The Commissioner may provide necessary rules concerning this adjustment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Valuation. If the rollover amount described in paragraph (a) of this Q&A; b-8 is in a form of property other than cash, the property of which the outstanding rollover consists is valued as of the date the rollover contribution is received by the transferee qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan and that value is the amount of the rollover. If the outstanding rollover is in the form of cash, the amount of the cash is the amount of the rollover.</p><p class="depth0">b-9: Q. What is the form of the grandfather benefit under a defined benefit plan and how is it valued?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Benefit form. The grandfather amount under a defined benefit plan is determined on the basis of the form of benefit (including any subsidized form of benefit such as a subsidized early retirement benefit or a subsidized joint and survivor annunity) provided under the plan as of August 1, 1986 that has the greatest present value as determined in paragraph (b) of this b-9. If the plan provides a subsidized joint and survivor annunity, for purposes of determining the grandfather amount, it will be assumed that an unmarried individual is married and that the individual spouse is the same age as the individual. Assumptions as to future withdrawals, future salary increases or future cost-of-living increases are not permitted.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Value of grandfather amount. The grandfather amount under a defined benefit plan is the present value of the individual's benefit form determined under paragraph (a) of this Q&A; b-9. Thus, the benefit form is reduced to reflect its value on the applicable valuation date. The present value of the benefit form on August 1, 1986, or the applicable date, is computed using the factors specified under the terms of the plan as in effect on August 1, 1986, to calculate a single sum distribution if the plan provides for such a distribution. If the plan does not provide for

such a distribution form, such present value is computed using the interest rate and mortality assumptions specified in Sec. 20.2031-7 of the Estate Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">b-10: Q. Is the plan administrator (or trustee) of a qualified plan (or individual retirement account) required to report to an individual the value of the individual's benefit under the plan as of August 1, 1986?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Request required. No report is required unless the individual requests a report and the request is received before April 15, 1989. If requested, the plan administrator (or trustee or issuer) must report to such individual the value of the individual's benefit under the plan as of August 1, 1986, determined in accordance with Q&A; b-5 through b-9 of this section. Such report must be made within a reasonable time after the individual's request but not later than July 15, 1989.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other rules. Alternate payees must make their own request for valuation reports. Any report furnished to an employee who has an alternate payee with respect to the plan must include the separate values attributable to each such individual. Any report furnished to an alternate payee must include only the value attributable to the alternate payee. Reports may be furnished to individuals even if no request is made. Individuals must keep records of the reports received from plans or IRAs in order to substantiate all grandfather amounts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Authority. The rules in this Q&A; are provided under the authority in section 6047(d).</p><p class="depth0">b-11: Q. How is the portion of a distribution that is treated as a recovery of an individual's grandfather amount as described in b-1 of this section to be calculated?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. All distributions received between August 1 and December 31, 1986, inclusive, are treated as a recovery of a grandfather amount. The portion of distributions received after December 31, 1986, that is treated as a recovery of the grandfather amount is determined under either the discretionary method or the attained age method. An amount that is treated as a recovery of grandfather benefits is applied to reduce the initial grandfather amount that was calculated as of August 1, 1986, on a dollar for dollar basis until the unrecovered amount has been reduced to zero. No other recalculation of the grandfather amount is to be made for a date after August 1, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Methods, etc. The grandfather amount may be recovered by an individual under either the discretionary method or the attained age method. After the individual's total grandfather amount is treated as recovered under either method, the tax on excess distributions and excess accumulations is determined without regard to any grandfather amount.</p><p class="depth0">b-12: Q. Under the discretionary method, what portion of each distribution is treated as a return of the individual's grandfather amount?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Initial percentage. Under the discretionary method, unless the individual elects in accordance with paragraph (b) below, 10 percent of the total distributions that the individual receives during any calendar year is treated as a recovery of the grandfather amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Acceleration. The individual may elect to accelerate the rate of recovery to 100 percent of the total aggregate distributions received during a calendar year commencing with any calendar year, including 1987 (acceleration election). In such case, the rate of recovery is accelerated to 100 percent for the calendar year with respect to which the election is made and for all subsequent calendar years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Election. To recover the grandfather amount using the discretionary method, an individual must elect to use such method when making the election to use the special grandfather rule on the Form 5329. (See Q&A; b-3 of this section.) The acceleration election must be made for the individual's taxable year beginning with or within the first calendar year for which such election is made and must be filed with the individual's income tax return for that year. Such acceleration election may also be made or revoked retroactively on an amended return for such year. However, the acceleration election may not be made after the individual's death other than with the individual's final income tax return or with a return for a prior year for which a return

was not filed before the individual's death. Thus, the acceleration election may not be made on an amended return filed after the individual's death for a year for which a return was filed before the individual's death. The preceding two sentences shall not apply to deaths occurring in 1987 or 1988. The estate is entitled to use the remaining grandfather amount to determine if there is an excess accumulation. See Q&A; d-3 of this section. The acceleration election shall be made on such form and in such manner as the Commissioner prescribes in a manner consistent with the rules of this section.</p><p class="depth0">b-13: Q. Under the attained age method, what portion of each distribution is treated as a return of the individual's grandfather amount?</p><p class="depth0">A. Under the attained age method, the portion of total distributions received during any year that is treated as a recovery of an individual's grandfather amount is calculated by multiplying the individual's aggregate distributions for a calendar year by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is the difference between the individual's attained age in completed months on August 1, 1986, and the individual's attained age in months at age 35 (420 months). The denominator of the fraction is the difference between the individual's attained age in completed months on December 31 of the calendar year and the individual's attained age in months at age 35 (420 months). An individual whose 35th birthday is after August 1, 1986, may not use the attained age method.</p><p class="depth0">b-14: Q. How is the 15 percent tax with respect to excess distributions for a calendar year calculated by an individual who has elected to use the special grandfather rule?</p><p class="depth0">A. The calculation of the excise tax may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An individual (A) who participates in two retirement plans, a qualified defined contribution plan and a qualified defined benefit plan, has a total value of accrued benefits on August 1, 1986 under both plans of $1,000,000. Because this amount exceeds $562,500, A is eligible to elect to use the special grandfather rule to calculate the portion of subsequent distributions that are exempt from tax. A elects to use the discretionary grandfather recovery method and attaches a valid election to the 1987 income tax return. A does not elect to accelerate the rate of recovery for 1987. On October 1, 1986, A receives a distribution of $200,000. On February 1, 1987, A receives a distribution of $45,000 and, on November 1, 1987, receives a distribution of $200,000.

A makes a valid acceleration election for the 1989 taxable year, whereby A accelerates the rate of grandfather recovery that will apply for calendar years after 1988 to 100 percent. Assume the annual threshold amount for the 1989 calendar year is $125,000 (i.e., 112,500 indexed). The 15 percent excess tax applicable to distributions in 1989 is calculated as follows:

These two categories are the lump sum distribution and other distributions. Whether or not a particular distribution is a distribution subject to section 4981A and is in either category is determined under the rules in section 4981A and this section. Thus, the exclusions under section 4981A(c)(2) and Q&A; a-4(a) of this section apply here. For example, a distribution that is a tax-free recovery of employee contributions is not in either category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The excise tax under section 4981A(c)(1) is computed in the normal manner except that (A) it is the sum of the otherwise applicable taxes determined separately for the two categories of excess distributions and (B) a different amount (threshold amount) is subtracted from the distributions in each category in determining the amount of the excess distributions. The threshold amount that is subtracted from the portion of the distributions that is not part of the lump sum distribution is the applicable threshold amount, determined without regard to section 4981A(c)(4) and the lump sum election. Thus, the threshold amount subtracted from the amount in this category is either the $150,000 amount or the $112,500 amount (indexed). The threshold amount that is subtracted from the amount of the lump sum distribution is 5 times the applicable threshold amount as described above. Thus, the threshold amount subtracted from the lump sum distribution is

$750,000 or 5 times $112,500 indexed (initially $562,500).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Grandfather rule--(1) In general. This paragraph (b) provides special rules where an individual makes both the grandfather election described in section 4981A(c)(5) and the lump sum election described in paragraph (a) of this Q&A; c-1. See Q&A; b-11 through 14 for other rules that apply to such grandfather election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. This paragraph (b) provides special rules where an individual makes both the grandfather election described in section 4981A(c)(5) and the lump sum election described in paragraph (a) of this Q&A; c-1. See Q&A; b-11 through 14 for other rules that apply to such grandfather election.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discretionary method. If the individual uses the discretionary method, described in Q&As; b-11 and 12 of this section, the applicable threshold amount is $112,500 (indexed). Under this method, the grandfather amount is recovered at a 10 percent or 100 percent rate in any calendar year and is offset separately against distributions in each category of distributions at the appropriate rate. If, for any calendar year, distributions are received in both categories and the total of the appropriate percentage (10 percent or 100 percent) of the distributions in each category exceed the unrecovered grandfathered account, then such grandfather amount must be recovered ratably from the distributions in each category. This rule applies even if the distributions in one category are less than the threshold amount for that category and the distributions in the other category exceed the threshold amount for that category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Attained age method. If the individual uses the attained age method, described in Q&As; b-11 and 13 of this section, the threshold amount is $112,500 (indexed). Under this method, to determine the portion of the distributions in each category that is treated as a recovery of the grandfather amount, the fraction described in Q&A; b-13 of this section is applied separately to the distributions in each category of distributions. If, for any calendar year, distributions are received in both categories and the total of the amounts of the distributions in each category that are treated as a recovery of the grandfather amount exceeds that undercovered grandfather amount, then such grandfather amount must be recovered ratably from the distributions in each category. This rule applies even if the distributions in one category are less than the threshold amount for that category and the distributions in the other category exceed the threshold amount for that category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Amount in lump sum category. All amounts received from the employer that are required to be distributed to the individual in order to make a lump sum election described in paragraph (a) of this Q&A; c-1 are included in the lump sum category. Amounts are in the lump sum category even though they are not subject to income tax under the election. Thus, for example, the following amounts would be in the lump sum category: (1) Appreciation on employer securities received as part of a distribution for which a lump sum treatment is elected; and (2) amounts that are phased out when section 1122 of TRA '86 is elected. However, accumulated deductible employee contributions under the plan (within the meaning of section 72(o)(5)) are in the nonlump sum category.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. The rules in this Q&A; c-1 are illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> On January 1, 199X, individual A who is age 65 and is a calendar year taxpayer receives a lump sum distribution described in section 402(e)(4)(A) from a qualified employer plan (Plan X). A receives no other distribution in 199X. A elects 5-year income averaging under section 402(e)(4)(B) and also elects section 402(e)(4)(L) treatment (treating pre-74 participation as post-1973 participation) on A's income tax return for 199X. Thus, A also makes the lump sum election described in paragraph (a)(2), above. For 199X, the $112,500 threshold amount indexed is $125,000. A does not make a grandfather election so that A's threshold amount is $150,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A's distribution from Plan X consists of cash in the amount of $800,000. A has a section 72(f) investment in the contract. A has over the years made after tax contributions to Plan X of $50,000. A's distributions subject to section 4981A equal $750,000 because of the exclusion of A's $50,000 after-tax contributions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A's distributions consist solely of amounts in the lump sum category. A's threshold amount equals $750,000 under the rules of this paragraph (a)(iii), above, (5 times $150,000). Because A's threshold amount ($750,000) equals the amount of A's distribution from Plan X ($750,000) no part of A's distribution from Plan X is treated as an excess distribution subject to the 15-percent excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example (1), except that A receives an additional distribution from an individual retirement plan described in section 408(a) (IRA Y) in 199X of $150,000. A has made no nondeductible contributions to IRA Y and all of the $150,000 is a distribution subject to section 4981A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A's distributions consist of two categories, the lump sum category (Plan X $750,000) and the other than lump sum category (IRA Y $150,000). A separate threshold amount is subtracted from A's IRA Y distribution. This threshold amount equals $150,000 under the rules of this paragraph (a)(3), above, the same initial threshold amount that is applied against the lump sum prior to the multiplication by 5). Because A's threshold amount ($150,000) equals the amount of A's distribution from IRA Y ($150,000), no part of A's distribution from IRA Y would be treated as an excess distribution subject to the 15-percent excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example (2), except that A's distribution is $825,000 from Plan X, before reduction of $50,000 for employee contributions, instead of $800,000, so that A's distribution subject to section 4981A from Plan X is $775,000. A made a valid grandfather election. Therefore, the applicable threshold amount is $125,000 ($112,500 indexed for 199X). A's unrecovered grandfather amount as of the end of the year preceding 199X is $1,000,000 (A had a benefit under another retirement plan (Plan Z) on August 1, 1986, and A's account balance under Plan Z, which is a stock bonus plan, is $6,000,000 on January 1, 199X.) A also made a valid election of the discretionary method to recover A's grandfather amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> If A recovers A's grandfather amount in 199X at the 10 percent rate, 10 percent of A's distributions that are in the lump sum category (Plan X $775,000) is treated as a recovery of A's grandfather amount. Similarly, 10 percent of A's distributions that are in the other than lump sum category (IRA Y $150,000) is treated as a recovery of A's grandfather amount. Thus, A's grandfather amount is reduced by $92,500 ($77,500 Plan X and $15,000 IRA Y) for the 199X calendar year and is $907,500 on January 1 of the year following 199X. Because the amounts of the distributions in each category that are treated as a recovery of grandfather amount are less than the applicable threshold amount for each category ($625,000 Plan X, $125,000 IRA Y), the recovery of the grandfather amount does not affect the calculations of the 199X excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because A's distribution from IRA Y of $150,000 exceeds A's threshold amount of $125,000 ($112,500 indexed) applicable to nonlump sum distributions by $25,000 and A's distribution subject to section 4981A from Plan X of $775,000 exceeds A's threshold amount of $625,000 (5X$125,000) applicable to lump sums by $150,000, A is subject to the 15-percent excise tax. A's tax under section 4981A is $26,250 (15 percent of $25,000 plus 15 percent of $150,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example (3) except that A makes a valid acceleration election under the discretionary method with respect to A's grandfather amount of $1,000,000 for calendar year 199X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because A's grandfather amount on January 1, 199X ($1,000,000) equals or exceeds A's distribution subject to section 4981A ($925,000) for 199X, no part of A's distribution from Plan X or IRA Y would be treated as excess distribution subject to the 15-percent excise tax.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> A's distributions subject to 4981A from Plan X of $775,000 and from IRA Y of $150,000 are offset 100 percent by A's grandfather amount of $1,000,000. Therefore, A's grandfather amount on January 1 of the year following 199X is $75,000 ($1,000,000 minus $925,000). This $75,000 would be required to be offset 100 percent against any distributions received in that year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Assume the same facts as in Example (4), except that A's distribution subject to section 4981A from Plan X, after reduction of the $50,000 for employee contributions, is $1,000,000 and from IRA Y is $125,000 (equal to the threshold amount), totaling $1,125,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because the sum of the amount received in the lump sum category and the other than lump sum category of distributions is greater than the grandfather amount ($1,000,000), the grandfather amount must be allocated to each separate category on the basis of the ratio of the amount received in each category to the sum of these amounts. Thus, $888,889 ($1,000,000 X ($1,000,000 divided by $1,125,000)) is allocated to the lump-sum category and $111,111 ($1,000,000 X ($125,000 divided by $1,125,000)) is allocated to the other than lump sum category. A's distributions of $1,000,000 in the lump sum category are reduced by $888,889, the greater of $625,000 (the threshold amount) or $888,889 (grandfather amount), and equal $111,111. A's excise tax is $16,666 (15 percent of $111,111). A owes no excess distribution tax on the $125,000 received from IRA Y because it is fully offset by the threshold amount of $125,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Because A's distribution subject to section 4981A for the year of $1,125,000 ($1,000,000 plus $125,000) exceeds A's grandfather amount on January 1, 199X of $1,000,000, A's grandfather amount is zero for all subsequent calendar years.</p><p class="depth0">c-2: Q. Must retirement plans be amended to limit future benefits accruals so that the amounts that are distributed would not be subject to an excise tax under section 4981A?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. A qualified employer plan need not be amended to reduce future benefits so that the amount of annual aggregate distributions are not subject to tax under section 4981A. Section 415 does, however, require plan provisions that limit the accrual of benefits and contributions to specified amounts. The operation of the excise tax of section 4981A is independent of plan qualification requirements limiting benefits and contributions under qualified plans.</p><p class="depth0">c-3: Q. Is a plan amendment reducing accrued benefits a permitted method of avoiding the excise tax?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. Accrued benefits may not be reduced to avoid the imposition of the excise tax. Such reduction would violate employer plan qualification requirements, including section 411(d)(6).</p><p class="depth0">c-4: Q. To what extent is the 15 percent section 4981A tax reduced by the 10 percent section 72(t) tax?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The 15 percent tax on excess distributions may be offset by the 10 percent tax on early distributions to the extent that the 10 percent tax is applied to excess distributions. For example, assume that individual (A), age 56, receives a distribution of $200,000 from a qualified employer plan (Plan X) during calendar year 1987. Further, assume that the entire distribution is subject to the 10-percent tax of section 72(t). A tax of $20,000 (10% of $200,000) is imposed on the distribution under section 72(t). Assuming that the distribution is not a lump sum distribution eligible for special tax treatment under section 402, part of the distribution is subject to tax under section 4981A. If A does not elect the special grandfather rule, A's dollar limitation is $150,000 and the amount of $200,000 distribution that is an excess distribution is $50,000 ($200,000-$150,000). The 15 percent tax is $7,500 (15% of $50,000). The portion of the $20,000 section 72(t) tax on early distributions that is attributable to the excess distribution is $5,000 (10% of $50,000). This amount is credited against the section 4981A tax. Therefore, the total tax imposed on the distribution under both provisions is $22,500 ($20,000 + ($7,500-$5,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Example. (1) If some, but not all, distributions made for a calendar year are subject to the section 72(t) tax, the offset is applied only to the extent that the section 72(t) tax applies to amounts that exceed the applicable threshold amount for that calendar year. For example, assume that during 1987 individual B receives a distribution of $40,000 that is not subject to the 10 percent section 72(t) tax and a separate distribution of $160,000 that is subject to the 10 percent section 72(t) tax. A tax of $16,000 (10% of $160,000) is imposed by section 72(t). Excess distributions for the year, assuming B does not elect the special grandfather rule, are $50,000 ($40,000 + $160,000-$150,000). The tax under section 4981A is $7,500 (15% of $50,000). For purposes of determining the extent to which the 10 percent tax is applied to excess distributions, the only amounts subject to the 10 percent tax that are taken into account are distributions in excess of $150,000 (or if greater, the $112,500 (indexed) threshold for the year). The amount of distributions for 1987 to which the 10 percent tax is applicable ($160,000) exceeds $150,000 by $10,000. Thus, the portion of the section 72(t) tax of $16,000 that is attributable to excess distributions equals $1,000 (10 percent of $10,000). This amount is credited against the section 4981A tax. The total tax payable under the provisions of sections 72(t) and 4981A is $22,500 ($16,000 + ($7,500-$1,000)).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Net unrealized appreciation. A distribution consisting of net unrealized appreciation of employer securities that is excluded from gross income is not subject to section 72(t) and, therefore, there is no section 72(t) tax on such distribution that may be used to offset the tax on excess distributions.</p><p class="depth0">c-5: Q. If a distribution that is subject to both the 10 percent tax on early distributions from qualified plans imposed under section 72(t) and the 15 percent tax on excess distributions imposed under section 4981A is received by an individual who elects to calculate the 15 percent tax using the special grandfather rule, how is the offset of the 10 percent tax imposed under section 72(t) calculated?</p><p class="depth0">A. The section 4981A tax is reduced only by the amount of the 10 percent tax that is attributable to the portion of the distribution to which the section 4981A tax applies. For example, assume

that (a) an individual (A), age 57, receives during 199X a distribution from a qualified plan of $325,000 that is subject to the 10 percent section 72(t) tax; (b) the distribution is not a lump sum distribution and is subject to the 15 percent excise tax imposed by section 4981A; (c) A has elected to use the special grandfather rule; and (d) A accelerates the rate of recovery of the remaining grandfather amount of $250,000 so that only $75,000 of this distribution is subject to the section 4981A tax. Thus, the section 4981A tax is $11,250 (15% of $75,000). The portion of the section 72(t) 10 percent tax that is offset against the section 4981A tax of $11,250 is limited to $7,500 (10% of $75,000), the section 72(t) tax on the amount of distributions after taking into account the reduction under the grandfather rule.</p><p class="depth0">c-6: Q. When do distributions become subject to the excise tax under section 4981A?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. Excess distributions made after December 31, 1986, are subject to the excise tax under section 4981A.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Transitional rule--(1) Termination. Distributions prior to January 1, 1988, made on account of certain terminations of a qualified employer plan are not subject to tax under section 4981A. For a plan termination to be eligible for this transitional rule, the plan termination must occur before January 1, 1987. For purposes of applying the rules of section 4981A (except the reporting requirements), any such distribution is treated as if made on December 31, 1986. The distribution of an annuity contract is not an excepted distribution. See Q&A; a-5 of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Termination.

A lump sum distribution that an individual who separates from service in 1986 receives in calendar year 1987 before March 16 is treated as a distribution received in 1986 if such individual elects to treat it as received in 1986 under the provisions of section 1124 of TRA '86. Thus, such a qualifying section 1124 distribution is not subject to tax under section 4981A for 1987. For purposes of applying the rules of section 4981A, the amount attributable to such distribution is included in the individual's August 1, 1986 accrued benefit and such distribution is treated as if made on December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Grandfather amount recovery. If an individual described in this paragraph elects the special grandfather rule, the entire amount of distributions described in subparagraph (1) or (2) of this paragraph (b) is treated as a recovery of the individual's grandfather amount because it is treated as received on December 31, 1986. Thus, the individual's outstanding grandfather amount as of the date of the distribution is reduced by the amount of such distribution.</p><p class="depth0">c-7: Q. How is the tax on excess distributions or on excess accumulations under section 4981A reported?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Tax on excess distributions. An individual liable for tax on account on excess distributions under section 4981A must complete Form 5329 and attach it to his income tax return for the taxable year beginning with or within the calendar year during which the excess distributions are received. The amount of the tax is reported on such form and in such manner as prescribed by the Commissioner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Tax on excess accumulations--(1) General rule. If, with respect to the estate of any individual, there is a tax under section 4981A(d) on account of the individual's excess accumulations, the amount of such tax is reported on Schedule S (Form 706 or 706NR). Schedule S must be filed on or before the due date under section 6075 including extensions, for filing the estate tax return. The tax under section 4981A(d) must be paid by the otherwise applicable due date for paying the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 even if, pursuant to section 6018(a), no return is otherwise required with respect to the estate tax imposed by chapter 11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If, with respect to the estate of any individual, there is a tax under section 4981A(d) on account of the individual's excess accumulations, the amount of such tax is reported on Schedule S (Form 706 or 706NR). Schedule S must be filed on or before the due date under section 6075 including extensions, for filing the estate tax return. The tax under section 4981A(d) must be paid by the otherwise applicable due date for paying the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 even if, pursuant to section 6018(a), no return is otherwise required with respect to the estate tax imposed by chapter 11.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Earliest due date. Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this c-7, the due date for filing Schedule S (Form 706) and paying the tax on excess accumulations under section 4981A(d) is not earlier than February 1, 1988. Thus, with respect to the estates of individuals dying in January through April of 1987, the due date for filing Schedule S (Form 706) and paying any tax owed under section 4981A(d) is not earlier than February 1, 1988, even if the due date for filing the Schedule 706 and

paying the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 is an earlier date. Further, no interest or penalties will be charged for failure to pay any tax on excess accumulations under section 4981A before January 31, 1988.</p><p class="depth0">c-8: Q. Does the fact that the benefits under a qualified retirement plan or individual retirement account are community property affect the determination of the excise tax under section 4981A?</p><p class="depth0">A. Generally, no. The operation of community property law is disregarded in determining the amount of aggregate annual distributions. Thus, the excise tax under section 4981A is computed without regard to the spouse's community property interest in the individual's or decedent's distributions or accumulation. Also, any reporting to the individual by a trustee, must be done on an aggregate basis without regard to the community property law.</p><p class="depth0">d.

Section 4981A(d) provides that the estate tax imposed by chapter 11 with respect to the estate of any decedent is increased by an amount equal to 15 percent of the decedent's excess accumulation.

How is the amount of a decedent's excess accumulation determined?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. A decedent's excess accumulation is the excess of (1) the aggregate value of the decedent's interests in all qualified employer plans and individual retirement plans (decedent's aggregate interest) as of the date of the decedent's death over (2) an amount equal to the present value of a hypothetical life annuity determined under Q&A; d-7 of this section. If the personal representative for the individual's estate elects to value the property in the gross estate under section 2032, the applicable valuation date prescribed by section 2032 shall be substituted for the decedent's date of death.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Other rules.

If the personal representative for an individual's estate subject to estate tax elects to value the property in the gross estate under section 2032, the decedent's aggregate interest is valued in a manner consistent with the rules prescribed by section 2032 (and other relevant estate tax sections). No adjustments provided in chapter 11 in valuing the gross estate are made. Thus, there

is no adjustment under section 2057 (relating to the sale of certain employer securities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Amounts included. Generally, all amounts payable to beneficiaries of the decedent under any qualified employer plan (including amounts payable to a surviving spouse under a qualified joint and survivor annuity or qualified preretirement survivor annuity) or individual retirement plan, whether or not otherwise included in valuing the decedent's gross estate, are considered to be part of the decedent's interest in such plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Rollover after death. If any amount is distributed from a qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan within the 60-day period ending on the decedent's date of death and is rolled over to an IRA after such date but within 60 days of the date distributed, the decedent's aggregate interest is increased by the amount rolled over, valued as of the date received by the IRA.</p><p class="depth0">d-6. Q. Are there any reductions in the decedent's aggregate interest?</p><p class="depth0">A. The decedent's aggregate interest is reduced by the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Amount payable to alternate payee. The amount of any portion of the deceased individual's interest in a qualified employer plan that is payable to an alternate payee in whose income the amount is includible under a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of section 414(p) (QDRO). However, such portion must be taken into account in determining the excess distribution or the excess accumulation upon the death of such alternate payee for purposes of determining if there is a tax under section 4981A(a) or an increase in the estate tax under section 4981A(d) with respect to such alternate payee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Investment in the contract. The amount of the deceased individual's unrecovered investment, within the meaning of section 72(f), in any qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Life insurance proceeds. The excess of any amount payable by reason of the death of the individual under a life insurance contract held under a qualified employer plan over the cash surrender value of such contract immediately before the death of such individual (the amount excludible from income by reason of section 101(a)). Amounts excludible from gross income because of section 101(b) do not reduce the decedent's aggregate interest.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Interest as a beneficiary. The amount of the deceased individual's interest in a qualified retirement plan or individual retirement plan by reason of the death of another individual.</p><p class="depth0">d-7. Q. How is the present value of the hypothetical life annuity determined?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. The hypothetical life annuity is a single life annuity contract that provides for equal annual annuity payments commencing on the decedent's date of death for the life of an individual whose age is the same as the decedent's determined as of the date of the decedent's death. The amount of each annual payment is equal to the greater of $150,000 (unindexed) and $112,500 (as indexed until the date of death). If the decedent elected (or the decedent's personal representative elects) the special grandfather rule, the amount of each annual payment is $112,500 (as indexed until the date of death) even if there is no remaining grandfather amount.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Determination of age. The decedent's age as of the decedent's date of death for purposes of valuing the hypothetical life annuity is the decedent's attained age (in whole years) as of the decedent's date of death. For example, if the decedent was born on February 2, 1930, and died on August 3, 1990, the decedent's age for purposes of valuing the hypothetical life annuity is 60.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Interest rate assumptions. The present value of the single life annuity described above must then be calculated using the interest rate and mortality assumptions in Sec. 20.2031-7 of the Estate Tax Regulations in effect on the date of death.</p><p class="depth0">d-8: Q. Are any credits, deductions, exclusions, etc. that apply for estate tax purposes allowable as an offset against the excise tax under section 4981A(d) for excess accumulations?</p><p class="depth0">A. No. No credits, deductions, exclusions, etc. that apply for estate tax purposes are allowed to offset the tax imposed under section 4981A(d). Thus, no credits under section 2010 through

2016 or other reductions permitted by Chapter 11 are allowable against the tax under section 4981A(d) for excess accumulations. For example, no credits are allowable for the unified credit against the estate tax, for state death taxes, or for gift taxes.</p><p class="depth0">d-8A. Q. Is the estate liable for the excise tax of 15 percent on the amount of the decedent's excess accumulations?</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes. In all events, the estate is liable for the excise tax of 15 percent on the amount of the decedent's excess accumulations. Transferee liability rules under chapter 11 do apply, however. Similarly, the reimbursement provisions of section 2205 also apply. Additionally, the rules generally applicable for purposes of determining the apportionment of the estate tax apply to the apportionment of the excise tax under section 4981A(d). Thus, the decedent's will or the applicable state apportionment law may provide that the executor is entitled to recover the tax imposed under section 4981A(d) attributable to any property from the beneficiary entitled to receive such property. However, absent such a provision in the decedent's will or in the applicable state apportionment law, the executor is not entitled to recover the tax imposed under section 4981A(d) attributable to any property from the beneficiary entitled to receive such property.</p><p class="depth0">d-9: Q. How is the additional tax computed with respect to a decedent's estate under section 4981A(d)?</p><p class="depth0">A. The determination of the additional tax under section 4981A(d) is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> An individual (A) dies on February 1, 199X at age 70 and 9 months. As of A's date of death, A has an interest in a defined benefit plan described in section 401(a) (Plan X). Plan X has never provided for employee contributions. A has no section 72 (f) investment in Plan X. A does not have any interest in any other qualified employer plan or individual retirement plan. The alternate valuation date in section 2032 does not apply. A did not elect to have the special grandfather rule apply. A's interest in Plan X is in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity. The value of the remaining payments under the joint and survivor annuity as of A's date of death (determined under D-5) is $2,000,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Because A is age 70 and 9 months of A's date of death, A's life expectancy as of A's date of death is calculated using age 70 (A's attained age in whole years on A's date of death). The factor from Table A of Sec. 20.2031-7(f) used to determine the present value of a single life annuity for an individual age 70 is 6.0522. The greater of $150,000 or $112,500 indexed for 199X is 150,000. The present value of the hypothetical single life annuity is $907,830 ($150,000x6.0522)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The amount of A's excess accumulation is $1,092,170, determined as follows: $2,000,000 (value of A's interest in Plan X) minus $907,830 (value of hypothetical single life annuity contract) equals $1,092,170.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The increase in the estate tax under section 4981A(d) is $163,825 (15 percent of $1,092,170).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A's interest in Plan X consists of the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> $2,000,000, value of employer-provided portion of a qualified joint and survivor annuity determined as of A's date of death using the interest and mortality assumptions in Sec. 20.2031-7.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> $200,000, proceeds of a term life insurance contract (no cash surrender value before death).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> $100,000. amount (employer-provided portion) payable to A's former spouse pursuant to a QDRO.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> $100,000, amount of A's investment in Plan X.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The value of A's interest in Plan X for purposes of calculating A's excess accumulation is still $2,000,000. The proceeds of the term life insurance contract, the amount payable under the QDRO, and the amount of A's investment in Plan X are excluded from such value.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 1, except that A elected the special grandfather rule. A's initial grandfather amount was $1,100,000. As of A's date of death, A had received $500,000 in distributions that were treated as a return of A's grandfather amount. Thus, A's unused grandfather amount is $600,000 ($1,100,000-$500,000). In 199X, assume that $112,500 indexed is still $112,500.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A's excess retirement accumulation is determined as follows: $2,000,000 minus the greater of (1) $600,000 or (2) the present value of a period certain annuity of $112,500 a year for 16 years. The present value of a single life annuity of $112,500 a year for an individual age 70 is determined as follows: $112,500 x 6.0522=$680,827.25. $680,827.25 is greater than $600,000. Thus the amount of the excess retirement accumulation is $1,319,173 ($2,000,000 minus $680,827).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The additional estate tax under section 4981A(d) is $197,875 (15 percent of $1,319,173).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The facts are the same as in Example 3 except that, as of A's date of

death, A received $90,000 in distributions that were treated as a return of A's grandfather amount. Thus, A's unused grandfather amount is $1,010,000 ($1,100,000-$90,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> A's excess retirement accumulation is determined as follows: $2,000,000 minus the greater of (1) ($1,010,000 (A's unused grandfather amount) or (2) 680,827.25 (the present value of a single life annuity of $112,500 a year for an individual age 70). A's unused grandfather amount is greater than the present value of the hypothetical life annuity. Thus, the amount of the excess retirement accumulation is $990,000 ($2,000,000-$1,010,000).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The additional estate tax under section 4981A(d) is $148,500 (15 percent of $990,000).</p><p class="depth0">d-10: Q. if a surviving spouse rolls over a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement plan of the decedent to an individual retirement plan (IRA) established in the spouse's own name, is any distribution in a calendar year from the IRA receiving such rollover included in determining the spouse's excess distribution or excess accumulation in such calendar year?</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. If a surviving spouse rolls over a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or an individual retirement plan of the decedent to an individual retirement plan (IRA) established in the spouse's own name with the rollover contribution and no other contributions or transfers are made to the IRA receiving the rollover contribution, distributions from such IRA will be excluded in determining the spouse's excess distributions and the value of the IRA will be excluded in determining the spouse's excess accumulation. If the surviving spouse rolls over a distribution from a qualified retirement plan or IRA of the decedent to an IRA for which the spouse has prior contributions or makes additional contributions to the IRA receiving the distribution, distributions from the IRA will be included in determining the amount of the excess distributions received by the spouse for the calendar year of the distribution and the value of the IRA at the applicable valuation date will be included in determining the spouse's excess accumulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Special rules. The rule in paragraph (a) of this Q&A; d-10 also applies if a surviving spouse elects to treat an inherited IRA (described in section 408(d)(3)(C)(ii)) as the spouse's own IRA as long as the surviving spouse makes no further contributions to such IRA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Other beneficiaries. Rules similar to the rules in paragraphs (a) and (b) shall apply to an individual who elected to treat an IRA as subject to the distribution requirements of section 408(a)(6), prior to amendment by section 521(b) of TRA '84, under Sec. 1.408-2(b)(7)(ii) of the Income Tax Regulations.</p><p class="depth0">d-11. Q. To what estates does the excise tax under section 4981A(d) apply?</p><p class="depth0">A. The excise tax under section 4981A(d) applies to estates of decedents dying after December 31, 1986.</p><p class="depth0">d-12: Q. Is the aggregate interest reduced by distributions described in paragraph (b)(1) of Q&A; c-6 of this section (distributions prior to January 1, 1988, made on account of certain terminations of a qualified employer plan) which are made after the individual's death.</p><p class="depth0">A. Yes, the value of the individual's aggregate interest determined under Q&A; d-5 of this section is reduced by distributions described in paragraph (b)(1) of Q&A; c-6 of this section which are made after the individual's death.
