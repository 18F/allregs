                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Within three months after the filing date of a request for  supplemental examination, the Office will determine whether a  substantial new question of patentability affecting any claim of the  patent is raised by any of the items of information presented in the  request. The determination will generally be limited to a review of the  item(s) of information identified in the request as applied to the  identified claim(s) of the patent. The determination will be based on  the claims in effect at the time of the determination and will become a  part of the official record of the patent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Office may hold in abeyance action on any petition or other  paper filed in a supplemental examination proceeding until after the  proceeding is concluded by the electronic issuance of the supplemental  examination certificate as set forth in Sec.  1.625.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If an unauthorized or otherwise improper paper is filed in a  supplemental examination proceeding, it will not be entered into the  official file or considered, or if inadvertently entered, it will be  expunged.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The patent owner must, as soon as possible upon the discovery of  any other prior or concurrent post-patent Office proceeding involving  the patent for which the current supplemental examination is requested,  file a paper limited to notifying the Office of the post- patent Office  proceeding, if such notice has not been previously provided with the  request. The notice shall be limited to an identification of the post- patent Office proceeding, including the type of proceeding, the  identifying number of any such proceeding (e.g., a control number or  reissue application number), and the filing date of any such proceeding,  without any discussion of the issues of the current supplemental  examination proceeding or of the identified post-patent Office  proceeding(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Interviews are prohibited in a supplemental examination  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> No amendment may be filed in a supplemental examination  proceeding.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> If the Office becomes aware, during the course of supplemental  examination or of any reexamination ordered under 35 U.S.C. 257 as a  result of the supplemental examination proceeding, that a material fraud  on the Office may have been committed in connection with the patent  requested to be examined, the supplemental examination proceeding or any  reexamination proceeding ordered under 35 U.S.C. 257 will continue, and  the matter will be referred to the U.S. Attorney General in accordance  with 35 U.S.C. 257(e).</p>
