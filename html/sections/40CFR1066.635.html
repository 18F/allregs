                            <p class="depth0">For vehicles subject to an NMOG standard, determine NMOG as  described in paragraph (a) of this section. Except as specified in the  standard-setting part, you may alternatively calculate NMOG results  based on measured NMHC emissions as described in paragraphs (c) through  (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine NMOG by independently measuring alcohols and carbonyls  as described in 40 CFR 1065.805 and 1065.845. Use good engineering  judgment to determine which alcohols and carbonyls you need to measure.  This would typically require you to measure all alcohols and carbonyls  that you expect to contribute 1% or more of total NMOG. Calculate the  mass of NMOG in the exhaust, mNMOG, with the following  equation, using density values specified in Sec.  1066.1005(f):   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.127  Where:  mNMHC = the mass of NMHC and all oxygenated hydrocarbons</p><p class="depth2"><em>(OHCs)</em> in the exhaust, as determined using Eq. 1066.605-1.</p><p class="depth2">Calculate NMHC mass based on rNMHC. rNMHC = the effective C1-equivalent density of</p><p class="depth2">NMHC as specified in Sec.  1066.1005(f). mOHCi = the mass of oxygenated species i in the exhaust</p><p class="depth2">calculated using Eq. 1066.605-1. rOCHi = the C1-equivalent density of oxygenated</p><p class="depth2">species i.
