                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each fixed bridge span over a navigable channel shall be lighted  so that the center of the navigable channel under each span will be  marked by a range of two green lights, and each margin of each navigable  channel will be marked by a red light: Provided, That when a margin of a  channel is limited by a pier, only those lights prescribed in paragraph  (b) of this section shall be required to mark such channel margin. The  green lights shall each show through a horizontal arc of 360[deg]; they  shall be securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge  span structure so as to be visible from an approaching vessel. Each red  light shall show through a horizontal arc of 180[deg], and shall be  securely mounted just below the outermost edge of the bridge span  structure to show 90[deg] on either side of a line parallel to the axis  of the channel so as to be visible from an approaching vessel.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Until such time that major repairs to or replacements of  existing fixed span navigation lights colored green are made, it is  permitted that only one of these lights marking the centerline of the  same channel under a span shall be visible to an approaching vessel.  When major repairs to or replacement of such existing green lights are  made they shall conform with this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Pier lights. When the navigable channel extends from pier to  pier or when piers are located within the navigable channel, each end of  such piers shall be lighted with a red light. Each such light shall show  through a horizontal arc of 180[deg], and shall be securely fastened at  the end of the pier as low as practicable but not lower than 2 feet  above navigable high water to show 90[deg] on either side of a line  parallel to the axis of the channel so as to be visible from an  approaching vessel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Main channel. When necessary, the District Commander may  prescribe that fixed bridges having two or more spans over a navigable  channel shall have the main channel span marked with a set of three  white lights arranged in a vertical line directly above each green light  on the main channel span. Each white light shall show through a  horizontal arc of 180[deg], and shall be mounted so that \1/2\ of the  horizontal arc will show on either side of a line parallel to the axis  of the channel. These three white lights shall be securely mounted on  the bridge structure and spaced as nearly 15 feet apart as the structure  of the bridge will permit, with a minimum spacing of 7 feet. The lowest  white light in the line of three lights shall be placed not less than 10  nor more than 15 feet above each green light on the main channel span.</p><p class="depth2">Note: Until such time that major repairs to or replacements of  existing main channel lights showing white are made, it is permitted  that these lights show through a horizontal arc of not less than 60[deg]  nor more than 180[deg] with \1/2\ of such arc showing either side of   a line parallel to the axis of the main channel. When major repairs or  replacement of such existing white lights are made, they shall conform  with this paragraph.
