                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements--(1) Application of section 355. Under  section 355(b)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>, a distribution of stock, or stock and securities, of  a controlled corporation qualifies under section 355 only if--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The distributing and the controlled corporations are each  engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business immediately after  the distribution (section 355(b)(1)(A)), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Examples. Paragraph (a)(1) of this section may be illustrated by  the following examples:</p><p class="depth3">Example 1. Prior to the distribution, corporation X is engaged in  the active conduct of a trade or business and owns all of the stock of  corporation Y, which also is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or  business. X distributes all of the stock of Y to X's shareholders, and  each corporation continues the active conduct of its trade or business.  The active business requirement of section 355(b)(1)(A) is satisfied.</p><p class="depth3">Example 2. The facts are the same as in Example (1), except that X  transfers all of its assets other than the stock of Y to a new  corporation in exchange for all of the stock of the new corporation and  then distributes the stock of both controlled corporations to X's  shareholders. The active business requirement of section 355(b)(1)(B) is  satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em>. Under section 355(b)(2)(A), a corporation  is treated as engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business if it  is itself engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business or if  substantially all of its assets consist of the stock, or stock and  securities, of a corporation or corporations controlled by it  (immediately after the distribution) each of which is engaged in the  active conduct of a trade or business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Active conduct of a trade or business immediately after  distribution--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. For purposes of section 355(b), a  corporation shall be treated as engaged in the ``active conduct of a  trade or business'' immediately after the distribution if the assets and  activities of the corporation satisfy the requirements and limitations  described in paragraph (b)(2)(ii), (iii), and (iv) of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Trade or business. A corporation shall be treated as engaged in  a trade or business immediately after the distribution if a specific  group of activities are being carried on by the corporation for the  purpose of earning income or profit, and the activities included in such  group include every operation that forms a part of, or a step in, the  process of earning income or profit. Such group of activities ordinarily  must include the collection of income and the payment of expenses.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>   through the activities that it performs itself, even though some of its  activities are performed by others. Separations of real property all or  substantially all of which is occupied prior to the distribution by the  distributing or the controlled corporation (or by any corporation  controlled directly or indirectly by either of those corporations) will  be carefully scrutinized with respect to the requirements of section  355(b) and this Sec. 1.355-3.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Limitations. The active conduct of a trade or business does not  include--</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The holding for investment purposes of stock, securities, land,  or other property, or</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The ownership and operation (including leasing) of real or  personal property used in a trade or business, unless the owner performs  significant services with respect to the operation and management of the  property.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em>--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Activities which constitute a trade or business under the tests  described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section shall be treated as  meeting the requirement of the preceding sentence if such activities  were actively conducted throughout the 5-year period ending on the date  of distribution, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The fact that a trade or business underwent change during the  five-year period preceding the distribution (for example, by the  addition of new or the dropping of old products, changes in production  capacity, and the like) shall be disregarded, provided that the changes  are not of such a character as to constitute the acquisition of a new or  different business. In particular, if a corporation engaged in the  active conduct of one trade or business during that five-year period  purchased, created, or otherwise acquired another trade or business in  the same line of business, then the acquisition of that other business  is ordinarily treated as an expansion of the original business, all of  which is treated as having been actively conducted during that five-year  period, unless that purchase, creation, or other acquisition effects a  change of such a character as to constitute the acquisition of a new or  different business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Special rules for acquisition of a trade or business (Prior to  the Revenue Act of 1987 and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988)--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In general. Under section 355(b)(2)(C), a trade or business  relied upon to meet the requirements of section 355(b) must not have  been acquired by the distributing corporation, the controlled  corporation, or another member of the affiliated group during the five- year period ending on the date of the distribution unless it was  acquired in a transaction in which no gain or loss was recognized.  Similarly, under section 355(b)(2)(D), the trade or business must not  have been indirectly acquired by any of those corporations (or a  predecessor in interest of any of those corporations) during that five- year period in a transaction in which gain or loss was recognized in  whole or in part and which consisted of the acquisition of control of  the corporation directly engaged in the trade or business, or the  indirect acquisition of control of that corporation through the direct  or indirect acquisition of control of one or more other corporations. A  trade or business acquired, directly or indirectly, within the five-year  period ending on the date of the distribution in a transaction in which  the basis of the assets acquired was not determined in whole or in part  by reference to the transferor's basis does not qualify under section  355(b)(2), even though no gain or loss was recognized by the  transferror.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Example. Paragraph (b)(4)(i) of this section may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth4">Example. In 1985, corporation X, which operates a business and has  cash and other liquid assets, purchases all of the stock of corporation  Y, which is engaged in the active conduct of a trade or business. Later  in the same year, X merges into Y in a ``downstream'' statutory merger.  In 1986, Y transfers the business assets formerly owned by X to a new  subsidiary, corporation Z, and then distributes the stock of Z to Y's  shareholders. Section 355 does not apply to the distribution of the  stock of Z because the   trade or business of Y was indirectly acquired by X, a predecessor in  interest of Y, during the five-year period preceding the distribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Gain or loss recognized in certain transactions. The  requirements of section 355(b)(2)(C) and (D) are intended to prevent the  direct or indirect acquisition of a trade or business by a corporation  in anticipation of a distribution by the corporation of that trade of  business in a distribution to which section 355 would otherwise apply. A  direct or indirect acquisition of a trade or business by one member of  an affiliated group from another member of the group is not the type of  transaction to which section 355(b)(2)(C) and (D) is intended to apply.  Therefore, in applying section 355(b)(2)(C) or (D), such an acquisition,  even though taxable, shall be disregarded.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Affiliated group. For purposes of this subparagraph (4), the  term affiliated group means an affiliated group as defined in section  1504(a) (without regard to section 1504(b)), except that the term stock  includes nonvoting stock described in section 1504(a)(4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Special rules for acquisition of a trade or business (After the  Revenue Act of 1987 and Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of  1988). [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate section 355(b)(2)(A)  and (B) and paragraph (b)(1), (2), and (3) of this section. However, a  transaction that satisfies these active business requirements will  qualify under section 355 only if it satisfies the other requirements of  section 355 (a) and (b).</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. Corporation X is engaged in the manufacture and sale of  soap and detergents and also owns investment securities. X transfers the  investment securities to new subsidiary Y and distributes the stocks of  Y to X's shareholders. Y does not satisfy the requirements of section  355(b) because the holding of investment securities does not constitute  the active conduct of a trade or business. See paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. Corporation X owns, manages, and derives rental income  from an office building and also owns vacant land. X transfers the land  to new subsidiary Y and distributes the stock of Y to X's shareholders.  Y will subdivide the land, install streets and utilities, and sell the  developed lots to various homebuilders. Y does not satisfy the  requirements of section 355(b) because no significant development  activities were conducted with respect to the land during the five-year  period ending on the date of the distribution. See paragraph (b)(3) of  this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 3. Corporation X owns land on which it conducts a ranching  business. Oil has been discovered in the area, and it is apparent that  oil may be found under the land on which the ranching business is  conducted. X has engaged in no significant activities in connection with  its mineral rights. X transfers its mineral rights to new subsidiary Y  and distributes the stock of Y to X's shareholders. Y will actively  pursue the development of the oil producing potential of the property. Y  does not satisfy the requirements of section 355(b) because X engaged in  no significant exploitation activities with respect to the mineral  rights during the five-year period ending on the date of the  distribution. See paragraph (b)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 4. For more than five years, corporation X has conducted a  single business of constructing sewage disposal plants and other  facilities. X transfers one-half of its assets to new subsidiary Y.  These assets include a contract for the construction of a sewage  disposal plant in State M, construction equipment, cash, and other  tangible assets. X retains a contract for the construction of a sewage  disposal plant in State N, construction equipment, cash, and other  intangible assets. X then distributes the stock of Y to one of X's  shareholders in exchange for all of his stock of X. X and Y both satisfy  the requirements of section 355(b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 5. For the past six years, corporation X has owned and  operated two factories devoted to the production of edible pork skins.  The entire output of one factory is sold to one customer, C, while the  output of the second factory is sold to C and a number of other  customers. To eliminate errors in packaging, X opens a new factory.  Thereafter, orders from C are processed and packaged at the two original  factories, while the new factory handles only orders from other  customers. Eight months after opening the new factory, X transfers it  and related business assets to new subsidiary Y and distributes the  stock of Y to X's shareholders. X and Y both satisfy the requirements of  section 355(b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 6. Corporation X has owned and operated a men's retail  clothing store in the downtown area of the City of G for nine years and  has owned and operated another men's retail clothing store in a suburban  area of G for seven years. X transfers the store building, fixtures,  inventory, and other assets related to the operations of the suburban  store to new subsidiary Y. X also transfers to Y the delivery trucks and  delivery   personnel that formerly served both stores. Henceforth, X will contract  with a local public delivery service to make its deliveries. X retains  the warehouses that formerly served both stores. Henceforth, Y will  lease warehouse space from an unrelated public warehouse company. X then  distributes the stock of Y to X's shareholders. X and Y both satisfy the  requirements of section 355(b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 7. For the past nine years, corporation X has owned and  operated a department store in the downtown area of the City of G. Three  years ago, X acquired a parcel of land in a suburban area of G and  constructed a new department store on it. X transfers the suburban store  and related business assets to new subsidiary Y and distributes the  stock of Y to X's shareholders. After the distribution, each store has  its own manager and is operated independently of the other store. X and  Y both satisfy the requirements of section 355(b). See paragraph  (b)(3)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 8. For the past six years, corporation X has owned and  operated hardware stores in several states. Two years ago, X purchased  all of the assets of a hardware store in State M, where X had not  previously conducted business. X transfers the State M store and related  business assets to new subsidiary Y and distributes the stock of Y to  X's shareholders. After the distribution, the State M store has its own  manager and is operated independently of the other stores. X and Y both  satisfy the requirements of section 355(b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) and  (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 9. For the past eight years, corporation X has engaged in  the manufacture and sale of household products. Throughout this period,  X has maintained a research department for use in connection with its  manufacturing activities. The research department has 30 employees  actively engaged in the development of new products. X transfers the  research department to new subsidiary Y and distributes the stock of Y  to X's shareholders. After the distribution, Y continues its research  operations on a contractual basis with several corporations, including  X. X and Y both satisfy the requirements of section 355(b). See  paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. The result in this example is the  same if, after the distribution, Y continues its research operations but  furnishes its services only to X. See paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this  section. However, see Sec. 1.355-2 (d)(2)(iv)(C) (related function  device factor) for possible evidence of device.</p><p class="depth2">Example 10. For the past six years, corporation X has processed and  sold meat products. X derives income from no other source. X separates  the sales function from the processing function by transferring the  business assets related to the sales function and cash for working  capital to new subsidiary Y. X then distributes the stock of Y to X's  shareholders. After the distribution, Y purchases for resale the meat  products processed by X. X and Y both satisfy the requirements of  section 355(b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. However, see  Sec. 1.355-2(d)(2)(iv)(C) (related function device factor) for possible  evidence of device.</p><p class="depth2">Example 11. For the past eight years, corporation X has been engaged  in the manufacture and sale of steel and steel products. X owns all of  the stock of corporation Y, which, for the past six years, has owned and  operated a coal mine for the sole purpose of supplying X's coal  requirements in the manufacture of steel. X distributes the stock of Y  to X's shareholders. X and Y both satisfy the requirements of section  355 (b). See paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section. However, see Sec.  1.355-2 (d)(2)(iv)(C) (related function device factor) for possible  evidence of device.</p><p class="depth2">Example 12. For the past seven years, corporation X, a bank, has  owned an eleven-story office building, the ground floor of which X has  occupied in the conduct of its banking business. The remaining ten  floors are rented to various tenants. Throughout this seven-year period,  the building has been managed and maintained by employees of the bank. X  transfers the building to new subsidiary Y and distributes the stock of  Y to X's shareholders. Henceforth, Y will manage the building, negotiate  leases, seek new tenants, and repair and maintain the building. X and Y  both satisfy the requirements of section 355 (b). See paragraph (b)(3)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2">Example 13. For the past nine years, corporation X, a bank, has  owned a two-story building, the ground floor and one half of the second  floor of which X has occupied in the conduct of its banking business.  The other half of the second floor has been rented as storage space to a  neighboring retail merchant. X transfers the building to new subsidiary  Y and distributes the stock of Y to X's shareholders. After the  distribution, X leases from Y the space in the building that it formerly  occupied. Under the lease, X will repair and maintain its portion of the  building and pay property taxes and insurance. Y does not satisfy the  requirements of section 355 (b) because it is not engaged in the active  conduct of a trade or business immediately after the distribution. See  paragraph (b)(2)(iv)(A) of this section. This example does not address  the question of whether the activities of X with respect to the building  prior to the separation would constitute the active conduct of a trade  or business.
