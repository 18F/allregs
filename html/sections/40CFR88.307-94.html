                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> States with covered areas shall exempt any CFFV required by law  to participate in the clean-fuel fleet program or any vehicle generating  credits under Sec. 88.304-94(c) from transportation control measures  (TCMs) existing wholly or partially for air quality reasons included in  an approved state implementation plan which restrict vehicle usage based  primarily on temporal considerations, such as time-of-day and day-of- week exemptions. However, CFFVs shall not qualify for TCMs where the  temporal element is secondary to some other control element   and, in no case, shall such exemptions apply if they create a clear and  direct safety hazard. This exemption does not include access to high  occupancy vehicle (HOV) lanes, except as provided in Sec. 88.313-93.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> States shall also grant temporal TCM exemptions to qualifying  CFFVs being operated after SIP approval, but prior to the effective date  for commencement of a state's CFFV credit program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Temporal TCM exemptions provided for in paragraph (a) of this  section are not effective outside of the areas for which states can be  required to establish CFFV credit programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such exemptions shall remain effective only while the subject  vehicle remains in compliance with applicable CFFV emissions standards  and other CFFV credit program requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> CFFV TCM exemptions shall not be transferred between vehicles  within the same fleet nor shall they be sold or traded.</p>
