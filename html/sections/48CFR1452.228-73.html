If,  in the event of loss or damage to the aircraft, the Contractor receives  compensation for such loss or damage, in any form, from any source, the  amount of such compensation shall be credited to the Government in  determining the amount of the Government's liability under this clause;  except that this shall not apply to proceeds of insurance received  solely as an advance of insurance pending determination of Government  liability, or for an increment of value of the aircraft beyond the value  for which the Government is responsible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the event of loss or damage, the Government shall be  subrogated to all rights of recovery by the Contractor against third  parties for such loss or damage and such rights shall be immediately  assigned to the Government. Except as the Contracting Officer may permit  in writing, the Contractor shall neither release nor discharge any third  party from liability for such loss or damage nor otherwise compromise or  adversely affect the Government's subrogation or other rights hereunder.  The Contractor shall cooperate with the Government in any suit or action  undertaken by the Government against any such third party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Any failure to agree as to the responsibility of the Government  or the Contractor under this clause shall, after a final finding and  determination by the Contracting Officer, be considered a dispute within  the meaning of the ``Disputes'' clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth2">(End of clause)</p>
