                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A registered investment company may, subject to the limitations  of Secs. 228.10(f) and 229.10(d) of this chapter, incorporate by  reference as an exhibit, in any registration statement, application or  report filed with the Commission, any document or part thereof  previously or concurrently filed with the Commission pursuant to any act  administered by the Commission. The incorporation may be made whether  the matter incorporated was filed by such registered company or any  other person. If any modification has occurred in the text of any such  document since the filing thereof, the company shall file with the  reference a statement containing the text of any such modification and  the date thereof. If the number of copies of any document previously or  concurrently filed with the Commission is less than the number required  to be filed with the registration statement, application or report which  incorporates such document, the company shall file therewith as many  additional copies of the document as may be necessary to meet the  requirements of the registration statement, application or report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A registered investment company may, subject to the limitations  of Sec. 201.24 of this chapter, incorporate by reference, in any  registration statement, application or report filed with the Commission  any financial statement or part thereof previously or concurrently filed  with the Commission pursuant to any act administered by the Commission,  if it substantially conforms to the requirements of the form on which  such registration statement, application or report is filed. The  incorporation may be made whether the matter incorporated was filed by  such registered company or any other person. If a certificate of an  independent public accountant or accountants is required to accompany a  financial statement in any registration statement, application or  report, the incorporation by reference of a certificate previously or  concurrently filed will not be deemed a compliance with such  requirements unless the written consent of the accountant or accountants  to such incorporation is filed with the registration statement,  application or report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> In each case of incorporation by reference, the matter  incorporated shall be clearly identified in the reference. An express  statement shall be made to the effect that the specified matter is  incorporated in the registration statement, application or report at the  particular place where the information is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding any particular provision permitting  incorporation by reference, no registration statement, application or  report shall incorporate by reference any exhibit or financial statement  which:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Has been withdrawn, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Was filed in connection with a registration statement under the  Act, or a registration on a national securities exchange, which has  ceased to be effective, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Is contained in a registration statement or report subject, at  the time of the incorporation by reference, to pending proceedings under  section 8(b) or 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, section 8(e) of the  Act, or to an order entered under any of those Sections, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If it is a document that has been filed in paper with respect to  an electronic filer under a temporary hardship exemption (Sec. 232.201  of this chapter) and an electronic format copy has not been submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Notwithstanding any particular provision permitting  incorporation by reference, the Commission may refuse to permit such  incorporation in any case in which in its judgment such incorporation  would render the registration statement application, or report  incomplete, unclear, or confusing.
