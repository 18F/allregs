                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each UN pressure receptacle must meet the requirements of this section. UN pressure receptacles and service equipment constructed according to the standards applicable at the date of manufacture may continue in use subject to the continuing qualification and maintenance provisions of part 180 of this subchapter. Requirements for approval, qualification, maintenance, and testing are contained in Sec. 178.70, and subpart C of part 180 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply for the purposes of design and construction of UN pressure receptacles under this subpart:</p><p class="depth2">Alternative arrangement means an approval granted by the Associate Administrator for a MEGC that has been designed, constructed or tested to the technical requirements or testing methods other than those specified for UN pressure receptacles in part 178 or part 180 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2">Bundle of cylinders. See Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2">Design type means a pressure receptacle design as specified by a particular pressure receptacle standard.</p><p class="depth2">Design type approval means an overall approval of the manufacturer's quality system and design type of each pressure receptacle to be produced within the manufacturer's facility.</p><p class="depth2">UN tube. See Sec. 171.8 of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Following the final heat treatment, all cylinders, except those selected for batch testing must be subjected to a proof pressure or a hydraulic volumetric expansion test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Service equipment. (1) Except for pressure relief devices, UN pressure receptacle equipment, including valves, piping, fittings, and other equipment subjected to pressure must be designed and constructed to withstand at least 1.5 times the test pressure of the pressure receptacle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Except for pressure relief devices, UN pressure receptacle equipment, including valves, piping, fittings, and other equipment subjected to pressure must be designed and constructed to withstand at least 1.5 times the test pressure of the pressure receptacle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Service equipment must be configured or designed to prevent damage that could result in the release of the pressure receptacle contents during normal conditions of handling and transport. Manifold piping leading to shut-off valves must be sufficiently flexible to protect the valves and the piping from shearing or releasing the pressure receptacle contents. The filling and discharge valves and any protective caps must be secured against unintended opening. The valves must conform to ISO 10297:2006 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter), or ISO 13340 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) for non-refillable pressure receptacles, and be protected as specified in Sec. 173.301b(f) of this subchapter. Until December 31, 2008, the manufacture of a valve conforming to the requirements in ISO

10297:1999 (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter) is authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> UN pressure receptacles that cannot be handled manually or rolled, must be equipped with devices (e.g., skids, rings, straps) ensuring that they can be safely handled by mechanical means and so arranged as not to impair the strength of, nor cause undue stresses, in the pressure receptacle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Pressure receptacles filled by volume must be equipped with a level indicator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Bundles of cylinders. UN pressure receptacles assembled in bundles must be structurally supported and held together as a unit and secured in a manner that prevents movement in relation to the structural assembly and movement that would result in the concentration of harmful local stresses. The frame design must ensure stability under normal operating conditions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The frame must securely retain all the components of the bundle and must protect them from damage during conditions normally incident to transportation. The method of cylinder restraint must prevent any vertical or horizontal movement or rotation of the cylinder that could cause undue strain on the manifold. The total assembly must be able to withstand rough handling, including being dropped or overturned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The frame must include features designed for the handling and transportation of the bundle. The lifting rings must be designed to withstand a design load of 2 times the maximum gross weight. Bundles with more than one lifting ring must be designed such that a minimum sling angle of 45 degrees to the horizontal can be achieved during lifting using the lifting rings. If four lifting rings are used, their design must be strong enough to allow the bundle to be lifted by two rings. Where two or four lifting rings are used, diametrically opposite lifting rings must be aligned with each other to allow for correct lifting using shackle pins. If the bundle is filled with forklift pockets, it must contain two forklift pockets on each side from which it is to be lifted. The forklift pockets must be positioned symmetrically consistent with the bundle center of gravity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The frame structural members must be designed for a vertical load of 2 times the maximum gross weight of the bundle. Design stress levels may not exceed 0.9 times the yield strength of the material.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The frame must not contain any protrusions from the exterior frame structure that could cause a hazardous condition.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The frame design must prevent collection of water or other debris that would increase the tare weight of bundles filled by weight.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The floor of the bundle frame must not buckle during normal operating conditions and must allow for the drainage of water and debris from around the base of the cylinders.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> If the frame design includes movable doors or covers, they must be capable of being secured with latches or other means that will not become dislodged by operational impact loads. Valves that need to be operated in normal service or in an emergency must be accessible.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> For bundles of cylinders, pressure receptacle marking requirements only apply to the individual cylinders of a bundle and not to any assembly structure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Design and construction requirements for UN refillable welded cylinders. In addition to the general requirements of this section, UN refillable welded cylinders must conform to the following ISO standards, as applicable:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ISO 4706: Gas cylinders--Refillable welded steel cylinders--Test pressure 60 bar and below (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ISO 18172-1: Gas cylinders--Refillable welded stainless steel cylinders--Part 1: Test pressure 6 MPa and below (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ISO 20703: Gas cylinders--Refillable welded aluminum-alloy cylinders--Design, construction and testing (IBR, see Sec. 171.7 of this subchapter).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Design and construction requirements for UN refillable seamless steel cylinders.
