                                Sec.  668.10  Direct assessment programs.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A direct assessment program is an instructional program that,  in lieu of credit hours or clock hours as a measure of student learning,  utilizes direct assessment of student learning, or recognizes the direct  assessment of student learning by others. The assessment must be  consistent with the accreditation of the institution or program  utilizing the results of the assessment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct assessment of student learning means a measure by the  institution of what a student knows and can do in terms of the body of  knowledge making up the educational program. These measures provide  evidence that a student has command of a specific subject, content area,  or skill or that the student demonstrates a specific quality such as  creativity, analysis or synthesis associated with the subject matter of  the program. Examples of direct measures include projects, papers,  examinations, presentations, performances, and portfolios.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> All regulatory requirements in this chapter that refer to credit  or clock hours as a measurement apply to direct assessment programs.  Because a direct assessment program does not utilize credit or clock  hours as a measure of student learning, an institution   must establish a methodology to reasonably equate the direct assessment  program (or the direct assessment portion of any program, as applicable)  to credit or clock hours for the purpose of complying with applicable  regulatory requirements. The institution must provide a factual basis  satisfactory to the Secretary for its claim that the program or portion  of the program is equivalent to a specific number of credit or clock  hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An academic year in a direct assessment program is a period of  instructional time that consists of a minimum of 30 weeks of  instructional time during which, for an undergraduate educational  program, a full-time student is expected to complete the equivalent of  at least 24 semester or trimester credit hours, 36 quarter credit hours  or 900 clock hours.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A payment period in a direct assessment program for which  equivalence in credit hours has been established must be determined  under the requirements in Sec.  668.4(a), (b), or (c), as applicable,  using the academic year determined in accordance with paragraph  (a)(3)(i) of this section (or the portion of that academic year  comprising or remaining in the program). A payment period in a direct  assessment program for which equivalence in clock hours has been  established must be determined under the requirements in Sec.  668.4(c),  using the academic year determined in accordance with paragraph  (a)(3)(i) of this section (or the portion of that academic year  comprising or remaining in the program).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A week of instructional time in a direct assessment program is  any seven-day period in which at least one day of educational activity  occurs. Educational activity in a direct assessment program includes  regularly scheduled learning sessions, faculty-guided independent study,  consultations with a faculty mentor, development of an academic action  plan addressed to the competencies identified by the institution, or, in  combination with any of the foregoing, assessments. It does not include  credit for life experience. For purposes of direct assessment programs,  independent study occurs when a student follows a course of study with  predefined objectives but works with a faculty member to decide how the  student is going to meet those objectives. The student and faculty  member agree on what the student will do (e.g., required readings,  research, and work products), how the student's work will be evaluated,  and on what the relative timeframe for completion of the work will be.  The student must interact with the faculty member on a regular and  substantive basis to assure progress within the course or program.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> A full-time student in a direct assessment program is an  enrolled student who is carrying a full-time academic workload as  determined by the institution under a standard applicable to all  students enrolled in the program. However, for an undergraduate student,  the institution's minimum standard must equal or exceed the minimum  full-time requirements specified in the definition of full-time student  in Sec.  668.2 based on the credit or clock hour equivalency established  by the institution for the direct assessment program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An institution that offers a direct assessment program must  apply to the Secretary to have that program determined to be an eligible  program for title IV, HEA program purposes. The institution's  application must provide information satisfactory to the Secretary that  includes--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A description of the educational program, including the  educational credential offered (degree level or certificate) and the  field of study;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A description of how the assessment of student learning is done;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A description of how the direct assessment program is  structured, including information about how and when the institution  determines on an individual basis what each student enrolled in the  program needs to learn;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A description of how the institution assists students in gaining  the knowledge needed to pass the assessments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The number of semester or quarter credit hours, or clock hours,  that are equivalent to the amount of student learning being directly  assessed for the certificate or degree, as required by paragraph (b)(3)  of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The methodology the institution uses to determine the number of  credit   or clock hours to which the program is equivalent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The methodology the institution uses to determine the number of  credit or clock hours to which the portion of a program an individual  student will need to complete is equivalent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Documentation from the institution's accrediting agency  indicating that the agency has evaluated the institution's offering of  direct assessment program(s) and has included the program(s) in the  institution's grant of accreditation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Documentation from the accrediting agency or relevant state  licensing body indicating agreement with the institution's claim of the  direct assessment program's equivalence in terms of credit or clock  hours; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Any other information the Secretary may require to determine  whether to approve the institution's application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> To be an eligible program, a direct assessment program must meet  the requirements in Sec.  668.8 including, if applicable, minimum  program length and qualitative factors.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section, no  program offered by a foreign institution that involves direct assessment  will be considered to be an eligible program under Sec.  668.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A direct assessment program may use learning resources (e.g.,  courses or portions of courses) that are provided by entities other than  the institution providing the direct assessment program without regard  to the limitations on contracting for part of an educational program in  Sec.  668.5(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Title IV, HEA program funds may be used only for learning that  results from instruction provided, or overseen, by the institution, not  for the portion of the program that the student has demonstrated mastery  of prior to enrollment in the program or tests of learning that are not  associated with educational activities overseen by the institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Title IV, HEA program eligibility with respect to direct  assessment programs is limited to direct assessment programs approved by  the Secretary. Title IV, HEA program funds may not be used for--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)(ii)</em> and  (iii) if offered by direct assessment, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> remedial coursework described in Sec.  668.20 offered by direct  assessment. However, remedial instruction that is offered in credit or  clock hours in conjunction with a direct assessment program is eligible  for title IV, HEA program funds.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> The Secretary's approval of a direct assessment program expires  on the date that the institution changes one or more aspects of the  program described in the institution's application submitted under  paragraph (b) of this section. To maintain program eligibility, the  institution must obtain prior approval from the Secretary through  reapplication under paragraph (b) of this section that sets forth the  revisions proposed.
