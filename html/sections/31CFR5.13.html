                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(10)</em> of this part. If a debtor makes a timely request for a  hearing, administrative wage garnishment will not begin until a hearing  is held and a decision is sent to the debtor. See 31 CFR 285.11(f)(4).  If a debtor's hearing request is not timely, Treasury entities may  suspend collection by administrative wage garnishment in accordance with  the provisions of 31 CFR 285.11(f)(5). All travel expenses incurred by  the debtor in connection with an in-person hearing will be borne by the  debtor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This section does not apply to Federal salary offset, the  process by which Treasury entities collect debts from the salaries of  Federal employees (see Sec. 5.12 of this part).</p>
