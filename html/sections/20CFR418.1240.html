We will accept new modified adjusted gross income information at any time after your request until the end of the calendar year following the more recent tax year(s) that we used. For us to make a new initial determination using your new modified adjusted gross income information, you must provide evidence as described in Sec. 418.1265 to support the reduction or increase in your modified adjusted gross income. If you amend your Federal income tax return for the more recent tax year we used, we will use the rules in Sec. 418.1150.</p>
