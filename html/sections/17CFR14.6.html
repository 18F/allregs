                            <p class="depth0">Any attorney who has been suspended or disbarred by a Court of the United States or any state or territory or the District of Columbia and any person whose license to practice as an accountant has been revoked or suspended in any state or territory or the District of Columbia may not appear or practice before the Commission during the period when such suspension or revocation is in effect. A suspension or revocation shall be deemed to have occurred when the disbarring, suspending or revoking agency or tribunal enters its order, regardless of whether appeal is pending or could be taken, and includes a judgment or order on a plea of nolo contendere or the procedural equivalent of such a plea. For purposes of this section it shall be irrelevant that any attorney or accountant who has been suspended, disbarred, or otherwise disqualified from practice before a court or in a jurisdiction continues in professional good standing before other courts or in other jurisdictions.</p>
