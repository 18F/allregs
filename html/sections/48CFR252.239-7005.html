Regulatory bodies whose decisions are not subject to  judicial appeal and regulatory bodies which regulate a company owned by  the same entity which creates the regulatory body are not ``governmental  regulatory bodies.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Contractor shall furnish the services and facilities under  this agreement/contract in accordance with--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All applicable tariffs, rates, charges, rules, regulations, or  requirements;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Lawfully established by a governmental regulatory body; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Applicable to service and facilities furnished or offered by  the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's subscribers;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Rates, terms, and conditions of service and facilities furnished  or offered by the Contractor to the general public or the Contractor's  subscribers; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Rates, terms, and conditions of service as may be agreed upon,  subject, when appropriate, to jurisdiction of a governmental regulatory  body.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Government shall not prepay for services.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> For nontariffed services, the Contractor shall charge the  Government at the lowest rate and under the most favorable terms and  conditions for similar service and facilities offered to any other  customer.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Recurring charges for services and facilities shall, in each  case, start with the satisfactory beginning of service or provision of  facilities or equipment and are payable monthly in arrears.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Subject to the Cancellation or Termination of Orders clause, of  this agreement/contract, the Government may stop the use of any service  or facilities furnished under this agreement/contract at any time. The  Government shall pay the contractor all charges for services and  facilities adjusted to the effective date of discontinuance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Expediting charges are costs necessary to get services earlier  than normal. Examples are overtime pay or special shipment. When  authorized, expediting charges shall be the additional costs incurred by  the Contractor and the subcontractor. The Government shall pay  expediting charges only when--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> They are provided for in the tariff established by a  governmental regulatory body; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> They are authorized in a communication service authorization or  other contractual document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> When services normally provided are technically unacceptable and  the development, fabrication, or manufacture of special equipment is  required, the Government may--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide the equipment; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Direct the Contractor to acquire the equipment or facilities. If  the Contractor acquires the equipment or facilities, the acquisition  shall be competitive, if practicable.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If at any time the Government defers or changes its orders for  any of the services but does not cancel or terminate them, the amount  paid or payable to the Contractor for the services deferred or modified  shall be equitably adjusted under applicable tariffs filed by the  Contractor with the regulatory commission in effect at the time of  deferral or change. If no tariffs are in effect, the Government and the  Contractor shall equitably adjust the rates by mutual agreement. Failure  to agree on any adjustment shall be a dispute concerning a question of  fact within the meaning of the Disputes clause of this contract.</p><p class="depth4">(End of clause)  [56 FR 36479, July 31, 1991, as amended at 70 FR 67919, Nov. 9, 2005]</p>
