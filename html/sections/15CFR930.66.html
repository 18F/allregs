Substantially different coastal effects are reasonably  foreseeable if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The applicant makes substantial changes in the proposed activity  that are relevant to management program enforceable policies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> There are significant new circumstances or information relevant  to the proposed activity and the proposed activity's effect on any  coastal use or resource.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Substantial changes were made to the activity during the period  of the State agency's initial review and the State agency did not  receive notice of the substantial changes during its review period, and  these changes are relevant to management program enforceable policies  and/or affect coastal uses or resources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> does   not remove the requirement under subsection (a) for applicants to notify  State agencies.
