However, bulling may be done from the head of the boom  when the nature of the cargo and the surface over which it is dragged  are such that the load cannot be stalled, or when the winch actually  does not have sufficient strength, with the purchase used, to overload  the boom.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Snatch blocks shall be used to provide a fair lead for the bull  line to avoid unnecessary dragging of the bull line against coamings and  obstructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Snatch blocks shall not be used with the point of the hook  resting on the flange of a beam, but shall be hung from padeyes, straps,  or beam clamps. Snatch blocks or straps shall not be made fast to batten  cleats or other insecure fittings.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Beam frame clamps shall be so secured as to prevent their  slipping, falling, or being pulled from their stationary attachment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Falls led from cargo booms of vessels shall not be used to move  scows, lighters or railcars.</p>
