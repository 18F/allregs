The Agency has  considered these impacts and has addressed them in the preamble  published on December 3, 1982.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event that the annual precipitation falling on the  treatment facility and the drainage area contributing surface runoff to  the treatment facility exceeds the annual evaporation, a volume of water  equivalent to the difference between annual precipitation falling on the  treatment facility and the drainage area contributing surface runoff to  the treatment facility and annual evaporation may be discharged subject  to the limitations set forth in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.</p>
