year period and, if the lease is extended, each 10-year period thereafter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All leases issued prior to August 4, 1976, shall be subject to readjustment at the end of the current 20-year period and at the end of each 10-year period thereafter.

The time for transmitting the information will be as soon as possible after the notice that the lease shall be readjusted, but will not be longer than 2 years after such notice. Failure to send the decision transmitting the readjusted lease terms in the specified period shall constitute a waiver of the right to readjust, unless the delay is caused by events beyond the control of the Department.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the notification that the lease will be readjusted, the authorized officer may require the lessee to furnish information specified in Sec. 3422.3-4 of this title for review by the Attorney General as required by section 27(1) of the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920, as amended. If the authorized officer requests the information specified, no lease readjustment shall be effective until 30 days after the authorized officer has transmitted the required information to the Attorney General. The lease shall be subject to cancellation if the lessee fails to furnish the required information within the time allowed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The Governor of the affected State will be sent a copy of the readjusted lease terms.
