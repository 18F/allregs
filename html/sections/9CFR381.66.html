                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Temperatures and procedures that are necessary for  chilling   and freezing ready-to-cook poultry, including all edible portions  thereof, must be in accordance with operating procedures that ensure the  prompt removal of the animal heat, preserve the condition and  wholesomeness of the poultry, and assure that the products are not  adulterated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Chilling performance standards, except for ratites. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each  official poultry slaughter establishment must ensure that all poultry  carcasses, parts, and giblets are chilled immediately after slaughter  operations so that there is no outgrowth of pathogens, unless such  poultry is to be frozen or cooked immediately at the official  establishment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Previously chilled poultry carcasses and major portions must be  kept chilled so that there is no outgrowth of the pathogens, unless such  poultry is to be packed and frozen immediately at the official  establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After product has been chilled, the establishment must prevent  the outgrowth of pathogens on the product as long as the product remains  at the establishment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The establishment must develop, implement, and maintain written  procedures for chilling that address, at a minimum, the potential for  pathogen outgrowth, the conditions affecting carcass chilling, and when  its chilling process is completed. The establishment must incorporate  these procedures into its HACCP plan, or sanitation SOP, or other  prerequisite program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Ice and water chilling. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Only ice produced from potable water  may be used for ice and water chilling, except that water and ice used  for chilling may be reused in accordance with Sec. 416.2(g). The ice  must be handled and stored in a sanitary manner.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Poultry chilling equipment must be operated in a manner  consistent with meeting the applicable pathogen reduction performance  standards for raw poultry products as set forth in Sec. 381.94 and the  provisions of the establishment's HACCP plan.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Major portions of poultry carcasses, as defined in Sec.  381.170(b)(22), may be chilled in water and ice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Water absorption and retention. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Poultry washing, chilling,  and draining practices and procedures must be such as will minimize  water absorption and retention at time of packaging.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The establishment must provide scales, weights, identification  devices, and other supplies necessary to conduct water tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Air chilling. Air chilling is the method of chilling raw poultry  carcasses and parts predominately with air. An antimicrobial  intervention may be applied with water at the beginning of the chilling  process, provided that its use does not result in any net pick-up of  water or moisture during the chilling process. The initial antimicrobial  intervention may result in some temperature reduction of the product,  provided that the majority of temperature removal is accomplished  exclusively by chilled air.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Freezing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ready-to-cook poultry which is to be or is labeled  with descriptive terms such as ``fresh frozen,'' ``quick frozen'' or  ``frozen fresh'' or any other term implying a rapid change from a fresh  state to a frozen state shall be placed into a freezer within 48 hours  after initial chilling in accordance with paragraph (b) of this section.  During this period, if such poultry is not immediately placed into a  freezer after chilling and packaging, it shall be held at 36 [deg]F. or  lower.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ready-to-cook poultry shall be frozen in a manner so as to bring  the internal temperature of the birds at the center of the package to 0  [deg]F. or below within 72 hours from the time of entering the freezer.  Such procedures shall not apply to raw poultry product described in  Sec. 381.129(b)(6)(i) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon written request, and under such conditions as may be  prescribed by the Administrator, in specific cases, ready-to-cook  poultry which is to be frozen immediately may be moved from the official  establishment prior to freezing: Provided, That the plant and freezer  are so located and such necessary arrangements are made that the  Inspection Service will have access to the freezing room and adequate  opportunity to determine compliance with the time and temperature  requirements specified in paragraph (f)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Warm packaged ready-to-cook poultry which is to be chilled by  immediate entry into a freezer within the official establishment shall  within 2 hours from time of slaughter be placed in a plate freezer or a  freezer with a functioning circulating air system where a temperature of  -10 [deg]F. or lower is maintained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Frozen poultry shall be held under conditions which will  maintain the product in a solidly frozen state with temperature  maintained as constant as possible under good commercial practice.
