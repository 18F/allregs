                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. (i) If during the taxable year any  section 38 property the basis (or cost) of which was taken into account,  under paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.46-3, in computing the taxpayer's  qualified investment is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section  38 property or becomes public utility property (as defined in paragraph  (g) of Sec.  1.46-3) or is a qualifying commuter highway vehicle (as  defined in paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.46-11) which undergoes a change in  use (as defined in paragraph (m)(2) of this section) with respect to the  taxpayer, before the close of the estimated useful life (as determined  under subparagraph (2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of this paragraph) which was taken into  account in computing such qualified investment, then the credit earned  for the credit year (as defined in subdivision (ii)(a) of this  subparagraph) shall be recomputed under the principles of paragraph (a)  of Sec.  1.46-1 and paragraph (a) of Sec.  1.46-3 substituting, in lieu  of the estimated useful life of the property that was taken into account  originally in computing qualified investment, the actual useful life of  the property as determined under subparagraph (2)(ii) of this paragraph.  There shall also be recomputed under the principles of Sec. Sec.  1.46-1  and 1.46-2 the credit allowed for the credit year and for any other  taxable year affected by reason of the reduction in credit earned for  the credit year, giving effect to such reduction in the computation of  carryovers or carrybacks of unused credit. If the recomputation  described in the preceding sentence results in the aggregate in a  decrease (taking into account any recomputations under this paragraph in  respect of prior recapture years, as defined in subdivision (ii)(b) of  this subparagraph) in the credits allowed for the credit year and for  any other taxable year affected by the reduction in credit earned for  the credit year, then the income tax for the recapture year shall be  increased by the amount of such decrease in credits allowed. For  treatment of such increase in tax, see paragraph (b) of this section.  For rules relating to ``disposition'' and ``cessation'', see Sec.  1.47- 2. For rules relating to certain exceptions to the application   of this section, see Sec.  1.47-3. For special rules in the case of an  electing small business corporation (as defined in section 1371(b)), an  estate or trust, or a partnership, see respectively, Sec. Sec.  1.47-4,  1.47-5, or 1.47-6. For rules applicable to energy property, see  paragraph (h) of this section. For special rules relating to  recomputation of credit allowed by section 38 if progress expenditure  property (as defined in Sec.  1.46-5(d)) ceases to be progress  expenditure property with respect to the taxpayer, see paragraph (g) of  this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.47-2 through  1.47-6--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The term ``credit year'' means the taxable year in which section  38 property was taken into account in computing a taxpayer's qualified  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The term ``recapture year'' means the taxable year in which  section 38 property the basis (or cost) of which was taken into account  in computing a taxpayer's qualified investment is disposed of, or  otherwise ceases to be section 38 property or becomes public utility  property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of the estimated  useful life which was taken into account in computing such qualified  investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The term ``recapture determination'' means a recomputation made  under this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Rules for applying subparagraph (1). For purposes of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In determining whether section 38 property is disposed of, or  otherwise ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer,  before the close of the estimated useful life which was taken into  account in computing the taxpayer's qualified investment, the term  ``estimated useful life'' means the shortest life of the useful life  category within which falls the estimated useful life which was assigned  to such property under paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.46-3. Thus, section 38  property which is assigned, under paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.46-3, an  estimated useful life of 6 years shall not be treated, for purposes of  subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, as having been disposed of before  the close of its estimated useful life if such property is sold 5 years  (that is, the shortest life of the 5 years or more but less than 7 years  useful life category) after the date on which it was placed in service.  Likewise, section 38 property with an estimated useful life of 15 years  which is placed in service on January 1, 1972, shall not be treated as  having been disposed of before the close of its estimated useful life if  such property is sold at any time after January 1, 1979 (that is, 7  years or more after the date on which it was placed in service).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In determining the recomputed qualified investment with respect  to property which is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be section 38  property the term ``actual useful life'' means, except as otherwise  provided in this section and Sec. Sec.  1.47-2 through 1.47-6, the  period beginning with the date on which the property was placed in  service by the taxpayer and ending with the date of such disposition or  cessation. See paragraph (c) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> In determining the recomputed qualified investment with  respect to property which ceases to be section 38 property with respect  to the taxpayer after August 15, 1971, or which becomes public utility  property after such date, such property shall be treated as if it were  property described in section 50 at the time it was placed in service  (whether or not it was property described in section 50 at such time).  Thus, if property was placed in service on October 15, 1968, and was  assigned an estimated useful life of 4 years, there would be no increase  in tax under section 47 if the property were disposed of at any time  after October 14, 1971, that is, 3 years or more after the property was  placed in service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Increase in income tax and reduction of investment credit  carryover--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Increase in tax. Except as provided in subparagraph (2)  of this paragraph, any increase in income tax under this section shall  be treated as income tax imposed on the taxpayer by chapter 1 of the  Code for the recapture year notwithstanding that without regard to such  increase the taxpayer has no income tax liability, has a net operating  loss for such taxable year, or no income tax return was otherwise  required for such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule. Any increase in income tax under this section  shall not be treated as income tax imposed on the taxpayer by chapter 1  of the Code for purposes of determining the amount of the credits  allowable to such taxpayer under--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Section 33 (relating to taxes of foreign countries and  possessions of United States),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Section 34 (relating to dividends received by individuals  before January 1, 1965),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Section 35 (relating to partially tax-exempt interest received  by individuals),</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Section 37 (relating to retirement income), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Section 38 (relating to investment in certain depreciable  property).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reduction in credit allowed as a result of a net operating loss  carryback. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> If a net operating loss carryback from the recapture year  or from any taxable year subsequent to the recapture year reduces the  amount allowed as a credit under section 38 for any taxable year up to  and including the recapture year, then there shall be a new recapture  determination under paragraph (a) of this section for each recapture  year affected, taking into account the reduced amount of credit allowed  after application of the net operating loss carryback.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Subdivision (i) of this subparagraph may be illustrated by the  following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> of this  section. The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X  Corporation for the taxable year 1963 was increased by the $700 decrease  in its credit earned for the taxable year 1962 (that is, the $700  original credit earned minus zero recomputed credit earned).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For the taxable year 1965, X Corporation has a net operating  loss which is carried back to the taxable year 1962 and reduces its  liability for tax, as defined in paragraph (c) of Sec.  1.46-1, for such  taxable year to $200. As a result of such net operating loss carryback,  X Corporation's credit allowed under section 38 for the taxable year  1962 is limited to $200 and the excess of $500 ($700 credit earned minus  $200 limitation based on amount of tax) is an investment credit  carryover to the taxable year 1963.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> For 1965, there is a recapture determination under subdivision  (i) of this subparagraph for the 1963 recapture year. The $700 increase  in the income tax imposed on X Corporation for the taxable year 1963 is  redetermined to be $200 (that is, the $200 credit allowed after taking  into account the 1965 net operating loss minus zero credit which would  have been allowed taking into account the 1963 recapture determination).  In addition, X Corporation's $500 investment credit carryover to the  taxable year 1963 is reduced by $500 ($700 minus $200) to zero and X  Corporation is entitled to a $500 refund of the tax paid as a result of  the 1963 determination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> X Corporation, which makes its returns on the basis  of a calendar year, acquired and placed in service on January 1, 1962,  an item of section 38 property with a basis of $10,000 and an estimated  useful life of 8 years. The amount of qualified investment with respect  to such asset was $10,000. For the taxable year 1962, X Corporation's  credit earned of $700 (7 percent of $10,000) was allowed under section  38 as a credit against its liability for tax of $700. In 1963 and in  1964 X Corporation had no liability for tax and placed in service no  section 38 property. On January 3, 1965, such item of section 38  property is sold to Y Corporation. For the taxable year 1965, X  Corporation has a net operating loss which is carried back to the  taxable year 1962 and reduces its liability for tax, as defined in  paragraph (c) of Sec.  1.46-1, for such taxable year to $100.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> As a result of such net operating loss carryback, X  Corporation's credit allowed under section 38 for the taxable year 1962  is limited to $100 and the excess of $600 ($700 credit earned minus $100  limitation based on amount of tax) is an investment credit carryover to  the taxable year 1963.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Since the actual useful life of the item of section 38 property  sold to Y Corporation was only 3 years, there is a recapture  determination under paragraph (a) of this section. X Corporation's $600  investment credit carryover to 1963 is reduced by $600 to zero. The  income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X Corporation for the  taxable year 1965 is increased by the $100 reduction in credit allowed  by section 38 for 1962.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Statement of recomputation. The taxpayer shall attach to his  income tax return for the recapture year a separate statement showing in  detail the computation of the increase in income tax imposed on such  taxpayer by chapter 1 of the Code and the reduction in any investment  credit carryovers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Date placed in service and date of disposition or cessation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  General rule. For purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.47-2 through  1.47-6, in determining the actual useful life of section 38 property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Such property shall be treated as placed in service on the first  day of the month in which such property is placed in service. The month  in which property is placed in service shall be determined under the  principles of paragraph (d) of Sec.  1.46-3.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If during the taxable year such property ceases to be section  38 property with respect to the taxpayer--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> As a result of the occurrence of an event on a specific date  (for example, a sale, transfer, retirement or other disposition), such  cessation shall be treated as having occurred on the actual date of such  event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> For any reason other than the occurrence of an event on a  specific date (for example, because such property is used predominantly  in connection with the furnishing of lodging during such taxable year),  such cessation shall be treated as having occurred on the first day of  such taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule. Notwithstanding subparagraph (1) of this  paragraph, if a taxpayer uses an averaging convention (see Sec.   1.167(a)(10)) in computing depreciation with respect to section 38  property, then, for purposes of this section and Sec. Sec.  1.47-2  through 1.47-6, he may use the assumed dates of additions and  retirements in determining the actual useful life of such property  provided such assumed dates are used consistently for purposes of  subpart B of part IV of subchapter A of chapter 1 of the Code with  respect to all section 38 property for which such convention is used for  purposes of depreciation. This subparagraph shall not apply in any case  where from all the facts and circumstances it appears that the use of  such assumed dates results in a substantial distortion of the investment  credit allowed by section 38. Thus, for example, if the taxpayer  computes depreciation under a convention under which the average of the  beginning and ending balances of the asset account for the taxable year  are taken into account, he may use July 1 as the assumed date of all  additions and retirements to such account. Similarly, if the taxpayer  computes depreciation under a convention under which the average of the  beginning and ending balances of the asset account for each month is  taken into account, he may use the date determined by reference to the  weighted average of the monthly averages as the assumed date of all  additions and retirements to such account.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Example. This paragraph may be illustrated by the following  example:</p><p class="depth0">Example. Assume that section 38 property is placed in service  (within the meaning of paragraph (d) of Sec.  1.46-3) on December 1,  1965 (thus, the credit is treated as being earned in 1965) but under the  taxpayer's depreciation practice the period for depreciation with  respect to such property begins on January 1, 1966, and that the  property is actually retired on December 2, 1970. Under the general rule  of subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, the property is treated as placed  in service on December 1, 1965, and as ceasing to be section 38 property  with respect to the taxpayer on December 2, 1970, even though under the  taxpayer's depreciation practice the period for depreciation with  respect to such property begins on January 1, 1966, and terminates on  January 1, 1971. However, under the special rule of subparagraph (2) of  this paragraph the taxpayer may determine the actual useful life of the  property by reference to the assumed dates of January 1, 1966, and  January 1, 1971.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Examples. Paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section may be  illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation, which makes its returns on the basis  of the calendar year, acquired and placed in service on January 1, 1962,  three items of section 38 property each with a basis of $12,000 and an  estimated useful life of 15 years. The amount of qualified investment  with respect to each such asset was $12,000. For the taxable year 1962,  X Corporation's credit earned of $2,520 was allowed under section 38 as  a credit against its liability for tax of $4,000. On December 2, 1965,  one of the items of section 38 property is sold to Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual useful life of the item of property which is sold on  December 2, 1965, is   three years and eleven months. The recomputed qualified investment with  respect to such item of property is zero ($12,000 basis multiplied by  zero applicable percentage) and X Corporation's recomputed credit earned  for the taxable year 1962 is $1,680 (7 percent of $24,000). The income  tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X Corporation for the taxable  year 1965 is increased by the $840 decrease in its credit earned for the  taxable year 1962 (that is, $2,520 original credit earned minus $1,680  recomputed credit earned).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 and in  addition on December 2, 1966, a second item of section 38 property  placed in service in the taxable year 1962 is sold to Y Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual useful life of the item of property which is sold on  December 2, 1966, is four years and eleven months. The recomputed  qualified investment with respect to such item of property is $4,000  ($12,000 basis multiplied by 33\1/3\ percent applicable percentage) and  X Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is  $1,120 (7 percent of $16,000). The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of  the Code on X Corporation for the taxable year 1966 is increased by $560  (that is, $1,400 ($2,520 original credit earned minus $1,120 recomputed  credit earned) reduced by the $840 increase in tax for 1965).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The facts are the same as in example 1 except that  for the taxable year 1962 X Corporation's liability for tax under  section 46(a)(3) is only $1,520. Therefore, for such taxable year X  Corporation's credit allowed under section 38 is limited to $1,520 and  the excess of $1,000 ($2,520 credit earned minus $1,520 limitation based  on amount of tax) is an unused credit. Of such $1,000 unused credit,  $100 is allowed as a credit under section 38 for the taxable year 1963,  $100 is allowed for 1964, and $800 is carried to the taxable year 1965.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual useful life of the item of property which is sold on  December 2, 1965, is three years and eleven months. The recomputed  qualified investment with respect to such item of property is zero  ($12,000 basis multiplied by zero applicable percentage) and X  Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is  $1,680 (7 percent of $24,000). If such $1,680 recomputed credit earned  had been taken into account in place of the $2,520 original credit  earned, X's credit allowed for 1962 would have been $1,520, and of the  $160 unused credit from 1962 $100 would have been allowed as a credit  under section 38 for 1963, and $60 would have been allowed for 1964. X  Corporation's $800 investment credit carryover to the taxable year 1965  is reduced by $800 to zero. The income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the  Code on X Corporation for the taxable year 1965 is increased by $40  (that is, the aggregate reduction in the credits allowed by section 38  for 1962, 1963, and 1964).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation, which makes its returns on the basis  of the calendar year, acquired and placed in service on November 1,  1962, an item of section 38 property with a basis of $12,000 and an  estimated useful life of 10 years. The amount of qualified investment  with respect to such property was $12,000. For the taxable year 1962, X  Corporation's credit earned of $840 was allowed under section 38 as a  credit against its liability for tax of $840. For each of the taxable  years 1963 and 1964 X Corporation's liability for tax was zero and its  credit earned was $400; therefore, for each of such years its unused  credit was $400. For the taxable year 1965 its liability for tax was  $200 and its credit earned was zero; therefore, $200 of the $400 unused  credit from 1963 was allowed as credit for 1965 and $600 ($200 from 1963  and $400 from 1964) is an investment credit carryover to 1966. On  February 2, 1966, such item of section 38 property is sold to Y  Corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual useful life of such item of property is three years  and three months. The recomputed qualified investment with respect to  such property is zero ($12,000 basis multipled by zero) and X  Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the taxable year 1962 is  zero. If such zero recomputed credit earned had been taken into account  in place of the $840 original credit earned, the entire $400 unused  credit from 1963 (including the $200 portion which was originally  allowed as a credit for 1965) and the $400 unused credit from 1964 would  have been allowed as investment credit carrybacks against X  Corporation's liability for tax of $840 for 1962. (See Sec.  1.46-2 for  rules relating to the carryback of unused credits.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Therefore, the $600 carryover from 1963 and 1964 to 1966 is  eliminated and the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the Code on X  Corporation for the taxable year 1966 is increased by the $240 aggregate  reduction in the credits allowed by section 38 for the taxable years  1962 and 1965 (that is, $1,040 credit allowed minus $800 which would  have been allowed).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> X Corporation, which makes its returns on the basis  of the calendar year, acquired and placed in service on November 1,  1962, an item of section 38 property with a basis of $10,000 and an  estimated useful life of 8 years. The amount of qualified investment  with respect to such asset was $10,000. For the taxable year 1962, X  Corporation's credit earned of $700 was allowed as a credit against its  liability for tax. For each of the taxable years 1963, 1964, and 1965 X  had no taxable income. On July 3, 1966, the item of section 38 property  is sold to Y Corporation. For the taxable year 1966 X Corporation has a  net operating loss of $3,000.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The actual useful life of the item of property is three years  and eight months.   The recomputed qualified investment with respect to such item of  property is zero and X Corporation's recomputed credit earned for the  taxable year 1962 is zero. Notwithstanding the $3,000 net operating loss  for the taxable year 1966, the income tax imposed by chapter 1 of the  Code on X Corporation for such year is $700 (that is, the decrease in  its credit earned for the taxable year 1962).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Identification of property--(1) General rule--(i) Record  requirements. In general, the taxpayer must maintain records from which  he can establish, with respect to each item of section 38 property, the  following facts:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The date the property is disposed of or otherwise ceases to be  section 38 property,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The estimated useful life which was assigned to the property  under paragraph (e) of Sec.  1.46-3,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The month and the taxable year in which the property was placed  in service, and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> The basis (or cost), actually or reasonably determined, of the  property.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Recapture determination. For purposes of determining whether  section 38 property is disposed of, or otherwise ceases to be section 38  property with respect to the taxpayer, before the close of its estimated  useful life, and for purposes of determining recomputed qualified  investment, the taxpayer must establish from his records the facts  required by subdivision (i) of this subparagraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. If the taxpayer fails to maintain records from which  he can establish the facts required by subdivision (i) of this  subparagraph, then this section shall be applied to the taxpayer in the  manner indicated in the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Corporation X, organized on January 1, 1964, files its  income tax return on the basis of a calendar year. During the years 1964  and 1965, X places in service several items of machinery to which it  assigns estimated useful lives of 8 years. X places the items of  machinery in a composite account for purposes of computing depreciation.  When X's 1966 return is being audited, X is unable to establish whether  the items placed in service in 1964 and 1965 were still on hand at the  end of 1966. Therefore, for purposes of paragraph (a) of this section, X  is treated as having disposed of, in 1966, all of the items of machinery  placed in service in 1964 and 1965.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Corporation Y, organized on January 1, 1960, files its  income tax return on the basis of a calendar year. During each of the  years 1960 through 1965, Y places in service four items of machinery to  each of which it assigns an estimated useful life of 8 years for  depreciation purposes (and for purposes of computing qualified  investment for relevant years). Y places the items of machinery in a  composite account for purposes of computing depreciation (and for  purposes of computing qualified investment for relevant years). When Y's  1965 return is being audited, Y can establish that it retired during  1965 only six items of this machinery. However, Y cannot establish the  date on which these six items were placed in service, nor can Y  establish that the items placed in service in 1963 or 1964 are still on  hand as of the end of 1965. No previous recapture has taken place with  respect to any of the items placed in service in 1963 or 1964.

A places such containers in a multiple asset account to which is  assigned a 5-year average useful life for purposes of computing  depreciation.

Taking into account only the fact  that 10 percent of the containers placed in service in 1965 had an  actual life of 5 years rather than the 6 years estimated useful life  assigned to them, A's recomputed qualified investment is $300,000 and  A's credit earned for 1965 is $21,000.

A cessation occurs in any taxable year in which  the bus is no longer a qualifying bus under Sec.  1.48-9(q)(6). A  qualified intercity bus does not cease to be energy property for a  taxable year subsequent to the one in which it was placed in service by  reason of a decrease in operating capacity (see Sec.  1.48-9(q)(9)) for  that year compared to any prior taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Recordkeeping requirement.

Assume further that the boiler is not a part of a  qualified rehabilitated building (as defined in section 48(g)(1)) or a  single purpose agricultural or horticultural structure (as defined in  section 48(p)). Z is allowed only an energy credit since the boiler is a  structural component of a building. In 1984, Z modifies the boiler to  use oil as the primary fuel.

For purposes of this section  and Sec.  1.47-1 and Sec. Sec.  1.47-3 through 1.47-6, the term  ``disposition'' includes a sale in a sale-and-leaseback transaction, a  transfer upon the foreclosure of a security interest and a gift, but  such term does not include a mere transfer of title to a creditor upon  creation of a security interest.

On January 1, 1965, A removes the item of  section 38 property from use in his trade or business by converting such  item to personal use. Therefore no deduction for depreciation with  respect to such item of property is allowable to A for the taxable year  1965. On January 1, 1965, such item of property ceases to be section 38  property with respect to A.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2.

With respect to such item, A is  allowed deductions for depreciation of $5,000 for 1965, $2,500 for 1966,  and $500 for 1967. A is not allowed a deduction for depreciation for  1968 although he continues to use such item in his trade or business.

For purposes of paragraph (a)  of Sec.  1.47-1, generally the mere leasing of section 38 property by a  lessor who took the basis of such property into account in computing his  qualified investment for the credit year shall not be considered to be a  disposition. However, in a case where a lease is treated as a sale for  income tax purposes such transaction is considered to be a disposition.  Leased section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with respect  to the lessor if, in any taxable year subsequent to the credit year,  such property would not qualify as section 38 property (as defined in  Sec.  1.48-1) in the hands of the lessor, the lessee, or any sublessee.  Thus, if, in a taxable year subsequent to the credit year, a lessee uses  the property predominantly outside the United States, such property  shall be considered to have ceased to be section 38 property with  respect to the lessor.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where lessor elects to treat lessee as purchaser.

Thus,  for example, if, in a taxable year subsequent to the credit year, a  sublessee uses the property predominantly outside the United States, the  property ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the lessee.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Reduction in basis of section 38 property--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> General rule. If,  in the credit year or in any taxable year subsequent to the credit year,  the basis (or cost) of section 38 property is reduced, for example, as a  result of a refund of part of the cost of the property, then such  section 38 property shall be treated as having ceased to be section 38  property with respect to the taxpayer to the extent of the amount of  such reduction in basis (or cost) on the date the refund which results  in such reduction in basis (or cost) is received or accrued, except that  for purposes of Sec.  1.47-1(a) the actual useful life of the property  treated as having ceased to be section 38 property shall be considered  to be less than 3 years.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Example. Subparagraph (1) of this paragraph may be illustrated  by the following example:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> of Sec.  1.1385-1, the basis of the  asset in A's hands is reduced by $10.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Under subparagraph (1) of this paragraph, on June 1, 1963, the  item of section 38 property ceases to be section 38 property with  respect to A to the extent of $10 of the original $100 basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Retirements.

Further, property  ceases to be section 38 property with respect to the taxpayer to the  extent that a deduction for depreciation thereon is disallowed under  section 274 (relating to disallowance of certain entertainment, etc.,  expenses).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Examples.

Thus, for the  taxable year 1962 only 80 percent of the basis of the automobile  qualified as section 38 property since a deduction for depreciation was  allowable to A only with respect to 80 percent of the basis of the  automobile. In the taxable year 1963 the automobile is used by A only 60  percent of the time in his trade or business.
