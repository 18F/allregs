                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Conventions--(1) Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, assume that P, S, T, X, Y, N, HC, D, D1, D2, D3, and C are corporations, A and B are individuals, shareholders are not treated as one person under section 355(d)(7), stock has been owned for more than five years and section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(4) of this section do not apply, no election under section 338 (if available) is made, and all transactions described are respected under general tax principles, including the step transaction doctrine. No inference should be drawn from any example as to whether any requirements of section 355 other than those of section 355(d), as specified, are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Examples. For purposes of the examples in this section, unless otherwise stated, assume that P, S, T, X, Y, N, HC, D, D1, D2, D3, and C are corporations, A and B are individuals, shareholders are not treated as one person under section 355(d)(7), stock has been owned for more than five years and section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(4) of this section do not apply, no election under section 338 (if available) is made, and all transactions described are respected under general tax principles, including the step transaction doctrine. No inference should be drawn from any example as to whether any requirements of section 355 other than those of section 355(d), as specified, are satisfied.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Five-year period. For purposes of this section, the term five-year period means the five-year period (determined after applying section 355(d)(6) and paragraph (e)(4) of this section) ending on the date of the distribution, but in no event beginning earlier than October 10, 1990.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Distributing securities. For purposes of determining if stock of any controlled corporation received in the distribution is disqualified stock described in section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii)(II) (relating to a distribution of controlled corporation stock on any securities in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period), references in this section to stock of a corporation that is or becomes a distributing corporation includes securities of the corporation. Similarly, a reference to stock in paragraph (c)(4) of this section (relating to a plan or arrangement) includes securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Marketable securities. Unless otherwise stated, any reference in this section to marketable stock includes marketable securities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> General rules and purposes of section 355(d)--(1) Disqualified distributions in general. In the case of a disqualified distribution, any stock or securities in the controlled corporation shall not be treated as qualified property for purposes of section 355(c)(2) or 361(c)(2). In general, a disqualified distribution is any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates thereto) applies if, immediately after the distribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Disqualified distributions in general. In the case of a disqualified distribution, any stock or securities in the controlled corporation shall not be treated as qualified property for purposes of section 355(c)(2) or 361(c)(2). In general, a disqualified distribution is any distribution to which section 355 (or so much of section 356 as relates thereto) applies if, immediately after the distribution--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Any person holds disqualified stock in the distributing corporation that constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any person holds disqualified stock in the controlled corporation (or, if stock of more than one controlled corporation is distributed, in any controlled corporation) that constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Disqualified stock--(i) In general. Disqualified stock is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> In general. Disqualified stock is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Any stock in any controlled corporation--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acquired by purchase during the five-year period; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Received in the distribution to the extent attributable to distributions on any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase during the five-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Purchase. For the definition of a purchase for purposes of section 355(d) and this section, see section 355(d)(5) and paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exceptions--(A) Purchase eliminated. Stock (or an interest in another entity) that is acquired by purchase (including stock (or another interest) that is treated as acquired by purchase under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section) ceases to be acquired by that purchase if (and when) the basis resulting from the purchase is eliminated. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), basis resulting from the purchase is basis in the stock (or in an interest in another entity) that is directly purchased during the five-year period or that is treated as acquired by purchase during such period under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Purchase eliminated. Stock (or an interest in another entity) that is acquired by purchase (including stock (or another interest) that is treated as acquired by purchase under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section) ceases to be acquired by that purchase if (and when) the basis resulting from the purchase is eliminated. For purposes of this paragraph (b)(2)(iii), basis resulting from the purchase is basis in the stock (or in an interest in another entity) that is directly purchased during the five-year period or that is treated as acquired by purchase during such period under paragraph (e)(2), (3), or (4) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Deemed purchase eliminated. Stock (or an interest in another entity) that is deemed purchased under section 355(d)(8) or paragraph (e)(1) of this section shall cease to be treated as purchased if (and when) the basis resulting from the purchase that effects the deemed purchase is eliminated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Elimination of basis--(1) General rule. Basis in the stock of a corporation (or in an interest in another entity) is eliminated if (and when) it would no longer be taken into account by any person in determining gain or loss on a sale or exchange of any stock of such corporation (or an interest in the other entity). Basis is not eliminated, however, if it is allocated between stock of two corporations under Sec. 1.358-2(a).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Special rule for transferred and exchanged basis property. Basis of stock (or an interest in another entity) resulting from a purchase (the first purchase) is eliminated if (and when) such stock (or other interest) is subsequently transferred to another person in an exchange or other transfer to which paragraph (e)(2) or (3) of this section applies (the second purchase). The elimination of basis in stock (or in another interest) resulting from the first purchase, however, does not eliminate the basis resulting from the second purchase in the stock (or other interest) that is treated as acquired by purchase by the acquirer in a transaction

to which paragraph (e)(2) of this section applies or by the person making the exchange in a transaction to which paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Special rule for Split-offs and Split-ups. Under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii) and paragraph (b)(2)(i)(B)(2) of this section, disqualified stock includes controlled corporation stock received in exchange for distributing corporation stock acquired by purchase. Solely for purposes of determining whether controlled corporation stock received in a distribution in exchange for distributing corporation stock is disqualified stock described in that section and paragraph immediately after the distribution, paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C)(2) of this section does not apply to the exchange to eliminate basis resulting from a purchase of that distributing corporation stock (notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies to the exchange).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Special rule if basis allocated between two corporations. If the shareholder of a distributing corporation, pursuant to Sec. 1.358-2, allocates basis resulting from a purchase between the stock of two or more corporations then, following such allocation, the determination of whether such basis has been eliminated shall be made separately with respect to the stock of each such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain distributions not disqualified distributions because purposes of section 355(d) not violated--(i) In general. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 355(d)(2) and this paragraph (b), a distribution is not a disqualified distribution if the distribution does not violate the purposes of section 355(d) as provided in this paragraph (b)(3).

Notwithstanding the provisions of section 355(d)(2) and this paragraph (b), a distribution is not a disqualified distribution if the distribution does not violate the purposes of section 355(d) as provided in this paragraph (b)(3). A distribution does not violate the purposes of section 355(d) if the effect of the distribution is neither--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To increase ownership (combined direct and indirect) in the distributing corporation or any controlled corporation by a disqualified person; nor</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To provide a disqualified person with a purchased basis in the stock of any controlled corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Disqualified person. A disqualified person is any person (taking into account section 355(d)(7) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section) that, immediately after a distribution, holds (directly or indirectly under section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section) disqualified stock in the distributing corporation or controlled corporation that--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The person--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Acquired by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Received in the distribution to the extent attributable to distributions on any stock in the distributing corporation acquired by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section by that person during the five-year period; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation (under section 355(d)(4) and paragraph (c) of this section).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Purchased basis. In general, a purchased basis is basis in controlled corporation stock that is disqualified stock. However, basis in controlled corporation stock that is disqualified stock will not be treated as purchased basis if the controlled corporation stock and any distributing corporation stock with respect to which the controlled corporation stock is distributed are treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The prior sentence will not apply, however, if the distributing corporation stock is treated as acquired by purchase under the attribution rules as a result of the acquisition of an interest in a partnership (the purchased partnership), and following the distribution, the controlled corporation stock is directly held by the purchased partnership (or a chain of partnerships that includes the purchased partnership).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Increase in interest because of payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Any increase in direct or indirect ownership in the distributing corporation or any controlled corporation by a disqualified person because of a payment of cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares will be disregarded for purposes of paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section if the payment of the cash is solely to avoid the expense and inconvenience of issuing fractional share interests, and

does not represent separately bargained for consideration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Other exceptions. The Commissioner may provide by guidance published in the Internal Revenue Bulletin that other distributions are not disqualified distributions because they do not violate the purposes of section 355(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate this paragraph (b)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Stock distributed in spin-off; no purchased basis. D owns all of the stock of D1, and D1 owns all the stock of C. A purchases 60 percent of the D stock for cash. Within five years of A's purchase, D1 distributes the C stock to D. A is treated as having purchased 60 percent of the stock of both D1 and C on the date A purchases 60 percent of the D stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The C stock received by D is attributable to a distribution on purchased D1 stock under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii). Accordingly, the D1 and C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and A is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are not violated. A did not increase direct or indirect ownership in D1 or C. In addition, D's basis in the C stock is not a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because both the D1 and the C stock are treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Accordingly, D1's distribution of the C stock to D is not a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Stock distributed in spin-off; purchased basis. The facts are the same as Example 1, except that D immediately further distributes the C stock to its shareholders (including A) pro rata. The D and C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and A is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are violated. A did not increase direct or indirect ownership in D or C. However, A's basis in the C stock is a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because the D stock is not treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the further distribution is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Stock distributed in split-off with ownership increase; purchased basis. The facts are the same as Example 1, except that D immediately further distributes the C stock to A in exchange for A's purchased stock in D. The C stock received by A is attributable to a distribution on purchased D stock under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii), and A's basis in the C stock is determined by reference to the adjusted basis of A's purchased D stock under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(B)(3) of this section, the basis resulting from A's purchase of D stock is not eliminated solely for purposes of determining if the C stock acquired by A is disqualified stock immediately after the distribution, notwithstanding that paragraph (e)(3) of this section applies to the exchange.) Accordingly, the D stock and the C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and A is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are violated because A increased its ownership in C from a 60 percent indirect interest to a 100 percent direct interest, and because A's basis in the C stock is a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section. Accordingly, the further distribution is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Stock distributed in spin-off; purchased basis. D1 owns all the stock of C. D purchases all of the stock of D1 for cash. Within five years of D's purchase of D1, P acquires all of the stock of D1 from D in a section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization that is not a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E), and D1 distributes all of its C stock to P. P is treated as having acquired the D1 stock by purchase on the date D acquired it under the transferred basis rule of section 355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section. P is treated as having purchased all of the C stock on the date D purchased the D1 stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section, and the C stock received by P is attributable to a distribution on purchased D1 stock under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii). Accordingly, the D1 and C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and P is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are violated. P did not increase direct or indirect ownership in D1 or C. However, P's basis in the C stock is a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because the D1 stock is not treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Accordingly, D1's distribution of the C stock to P is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 5. Stock distributed in split-off with ownership increase; no purchased basis. P owns 50 percent of the stock of D, the remaining D stock is owned by unrelated persons, D owns all the stock of C, and A purchases all of the P stock from the P shareholders. Within five years of A's purchase, D distributes all of the C stock to P in exchange for P's D stock. A is treated as having purchased 50 percent of the stock of both D and C on the date A purchases the P stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The C stock received by P is attributable to a distribution on purchased D stock under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii). Accordingly, the D stock and the C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and A is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are violated because, even though P's basis in the C stock is not a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section, A increased its direct or indirect ownership in C from a 50 percent indirect interest to a 100 percent indirect interest. Accordingly, D's distribution of the C stock to P is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6. Stock distributed in split-off with no ownership increase; no purchased basis. A purchases all of the stock of T. T later merges into D in a section 368(a)(1)(A) reorganization and A exchanges its purchased T stock for 60 percent of the stock of D. D owns all of the stock of D1 and D2, D1 and D2 each owns 50 percent of the stock of D3, and D3 owns all of the stock of C. Within five years of A's purchase of the T stock, D3 distributes the C stock to D1 in exchange for all of D1's D3 stock. A is treated as having acquired 60 percent of the D stock by purchase on the date A purchases the T stock under paragraph (e)(3) of this section. A is treated as having purchased 60 percent of the stock of D1, D2, D3, and C on the date A purchases the T stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. The C stock received by D1 is attributable to a distribution on purchased D3 stock under section 355(d)(3)(B)(ii). Accordingly, the D3 stock and the C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and A is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. However, the purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are not violated. A did not increase direct or indirect ownership in D3 or C, and D1's basis in the C stock is not a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because the D3 stock is treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Accordingly, D3's distribution of the C stock to D1 is not a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 7. Purchased basis eliminated by liquidation; stock distributed in spin-off. P owns 30 percent of the stock of D, D owns all of the stock of D1, and D1 owns all of the stock of C. P purchases the remaining 70 percent of the D stock for cash. Within five years of P's purchase, P liquidates D in a transaction qualifying under sections 332 and 337(a), and D1 then distributes the stock of C to P. Prior to the liquidation, P is treated as having purchased 70 percent of the stock of D1 and C on the date P purchases the D stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8)(B) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. After the liquidation, however, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, P is not treated as having acquired by purchase the D1 or the C stock under section 355(d)(8)(B) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section because P's basis in the D stock is eliminated in the liquidation of D. Under section 334(b)(1), P's basis in the D1 stock is determined by reference to D's basis in the D1 stock and not by reference to P's basis in D. Paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section does not treat the D1 stock as newly purchased in P's hands because no gain or loss was recognized by D in the liquidation. Accordingly, neither the D1 stock nor the C stock is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section in P's hands, and the distribution is not a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 8. Purchased basis eliminated by upstream merger; stock distributed in spin-off. D owns all of the stock of D1, and D1 owns all of the stock of C. P purchases 60 percent of the D stock for cash. Within five years of P's purchase, D merges into P in a section 368(a)(1)(A) reorganization, with the D shareholders other than P receiving solely P stock in exchange for their D stock, and D1 then distributes the stock of C to P. Prior to the merger, P is treated as having purchased 60 percent of the stock of D1 and C on the date P purchases the D stock under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. After the merger, however, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section, P is not treated as having acquired by purchase the D1 or the C stock under section 355(d)(8)(B) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section because P's basis in the D stock is eliminated in the merger. Under section 362(b), P's basis in the D1 stock is determined by reference to D's basis in the D1 stock and not by reference to P's basis in D. Paragraph (d)(2)(i)(B) of this section does not treat the D1 stock as newly purchased in P's hands because no gain or loss was recognized by D in the merger. Accordingly, neither the D1 stock nor the C stock is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of

this section in P's hands, and the distribution is not a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 9. Purchased basis eliminated by distribution; stock distributed in spin-off. A purchases all the stock of C for cash on Date 1. D acquires all of the stock of C from A in a section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization that is not a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(A)(1)(E). A receives ten percent of the D stock in the transaction. The remaining D stock is owned by B. Within five years of A's purchase of the C stock, D distributes all the stock of C pro rata to A and B. Under the transferred basis rule of paragraph (e)(2) of this section, D is treated as having purchased all of the C stock on the date A acquired it. Under the exchanged basis rule of paragraph (e)(3) of this section, A is treated as having purchased its D stock on Date 1 and A is treated as having purchased ten percent of the C stock on Date 1 under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(3) of this section. Moreover, under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(C) of this section, A's basis in the C stock resulting from A's Date 1 purchase of C stock is eliminated. After the distribution, A's and B's bases in their C stock are determined by reference to the bases of their D stock under Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2) (and not by reference to D's basis in the C stock). D's basis in the stock of C resulting from its deemed purchase of that stock under paragraph (e)(2) of this section is eliminated by the distribution of the C stock because it would no longer be taken into account by any person in determining gain or loss on the sale of C stock. Therefore, the C stock distributed to A and B is not disqualified stock as a result of D's purchase of C. However, A's basis in its D stock resulting from its deemed purchase of that stock under paragraph (e)(3) of this section is not eliminated. Therefore, A's ten percent interest in the stock of D is disqualified stock. Furthermore, A's ten percent interest in the stock of C is disqualified stock because the distribution of the C stock is attributable to A's D stock that was acquired by purchase. However, there has not been a disqualified distribution because no person, immediately after the distribution, holds disqualified stock in either D or C that constitutes a 50 percent or greater interest in such corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> P owns all the stock of D. D purchases all the stock of D1 for cash on Date 1. D1 owns all the stock of C (which owns all the stock of C1) and S. Within five years of Date 1, D1 distributes all the stock of C to D. The D1 and C stock each is disqualified stock under section 355(d)(3) and paragraph (b)(2) of this section, and D is a disqualified person under paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section. The purposes of section 355(d) under paragraph (b)(3)(i) of this section are violated. D did not increase direct or indirect ownership in D1 or C. However, D's basis in the C stock is a purchased basis under paragraph (b)(3)(iii) of this section because the D1 stock is not treated as acquired by purchase solely under the attribution rules of section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section. Accordingly, the distribution is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section. D's basis in the D1 stock is allocated pursuant to Sec. 1.358-2 between the D1 stock and the C stock. Therefore, under paragraph (e)(4) of this section, the C stock is deemed to be acquired by purchase on Date 1, the date D purchased all the stock of D1. If thereafter, and within five years of Date 1, C were to distribute all the stock of C1 to D, that distribution would also be a disqualified distribution because of D's deemed purchase of the stock of C.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Following the distribution of the stock of C by D1, and within five years of Date 1, D distributes all the stock of D1 to P. Under paragraph (b)(2)(iii)(D) of this section, the determination of whether D's basis in D1 has been eliminated shall be made without regard to D's allocated basis in C. After the distribution, P's basis in the D1 stock is determined by reference to its basis in its D stock under Sec. 1.358-2(a)(2) (and not by reference to D's basis in the D1 stock). D's basis in the D1 stock resulting from the purchase of that stock is eliminated by the distribution of the D1 stock because it would no longer be taken into account by any person in determining gain or loss on the sale of D1 stock. Therefore, the D1 stock distributed to P is not disqualified stock as a result of D's purchase of D1.

The following examples illustrate this paragraph (c)(3):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D owns all of the stock of C. A purchases 40 percent of D's only class of stock and an option to purchase D stock from D, that if deemed exercised, would result in A owning a total of 60 percent of the stock of D. Assume that no control premium or minority or blockage discount applies to the D stock underlying the option. The option permits A to acquire the D stock at $30 per share, and D's stock has a fair market value of $27 per share on the date the option is issued. The option is subject to no contingencies or restrictive covenants, may be exercised within five years after its issuance, and is not described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section (regarding instruments generally not treated as options). Within five years of A's purchase of the D stock and option, D distributes the stock of its subsidiary C pro rata and A receives 40 percent of the C stock in the distribution. Immediately after the distribution, D's stock has a fair market value of $30 per share and C's stock has a fair market value of $15 per share. At the time of the distribution, A exchanges A's option for an option to purchase 20 percent of the D stock at $20 per share and an option to purchase 20 percent of the C stock at $10 per share. The exchange of the options in D for options in D and C did not materially increase the likelihood that the options would be exercised. Nonetheless, based on all the facts and circumstances, it is reasonably certain, immediately after the distribution, that A will exercise its options. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the substituted options are treated as issued on the date the original option was issued. Accordingly, the options are treated as exercised by A on the date that A purchased the original option. A is treated as owning 60 percent of the D stock and 60 percent of the C stock that is disqualified stock, and the distribution is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. D owns all of the stock of C. A purchases 37 percent of D's only class of stock. B owns 38 percent of the D stock, and the remaining 25 percent is owned by 20 individuals, each of whom owns less than five percent of D's stock. A purchases an option to purchase an additional 14 percent of the D stock from shareholders other than B for $50 per share. The option is subject to no contingencies or restrictive covenants, may be exercised within five years after its issuance, and is not described in paragraph (c)(3)(vi) of this section. Within five years of A's purchase of the option and 37 percent interest in D, D distributes the stock of its subsidiary C pro rata and A receives 37 percent of the C stock in the distribution. At the time of the distribution, A exchanges its option for an option to purchase 14 percent of the D stock at $25 per share and an option to purchase 14 percent of the C stock at $25 per share. Assume that, although a shareholder that owned no D or C stock would pay only $20 per share for D or C stock immediately after the distribution, a shareholder in A's position would pay $30 per share for 14 percent of the stock of D or C because of the control premium which attaches to the shares. The control premium is taken into account under paragraph (c)(3)(vii)(A) of this section to determine whether A is reasonably certain to exercise the options. The exchange of the options in D for options in D and C did not materially increase the likelihood that the options would be exercised. Nonetheless, based on all the facts and circumstances, it is reasonably certain, immediately after the distribution, that A will exercise its options. Under paragraph (c)(3)(iii)(C) of this section, the substituted options are treated as issued on the date the original option was issued. Accordingly, the options are treated as exercised by A on the date that A purchased the original option. Under paragraph (c)(2) of this section, all shares of D and C are considered to have the same value to determine the amount of stock A is treated as purchasing under the options. A is treated as owning 51 percent of the D stock and 51 percent of the C stock that is disqualified stock, and the distribution is a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Plan or arrangement--(i) In general.

For purposes of section 355(d)(7)(B), two or more persons who are (or will after an acquisition become) shareholders (or are treated as shareholders under paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section) act pursuant to a plan or arrangement with respect to an acquisition of stock only if they have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. A principal element in determining if such an understanding exists is whether the investment decision of each person is based on the investment decision of one or more other existing or prospective shareholders. However, the participation by creditors in formulating a plan for an insolvency workout or a reorganization in a title 11 or similar case (whether as members of a creditors' committee or otherwise) and the receipt of stock by creditors in satisfaction of indebtedness pursuant to the workout or reorganization do not cause the creditors to be considered as acting pursuant to a plan or arrangement.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Examples. The following examples illustrate paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section:</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. D has 1,000 shares of common stock outstanding. A group of 20 unrelated individuals who previously owned no D stock (the Group) agree among themselves to acquire 50 percent or more of D's stock. The Group is not a person under section 7701(a)(1). Subsequently, pursuant to their understanding, the members of the Group purchase 600 shares of D common stock from the existing D shareholders (a total of 60 percent of the D stock), with each member purchasing 30 shares. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the members of the Group have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. Their interests are therefore aggregated under section 355(d)(7)(B), and they are treated as one person that purchased 600 shares of D's stock for purposes of section 355(d).</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. D has 1,000 shares of outstanding stock owned by unrelated individuals. D's management is concerned that D may become subject to a takeover bid. In separate meetings, D's management meets with potential investors who own no stock and are friendly to management to convince them to acquire D's stock based on an understanding that D will assemble a group that in the aggregate will acquire more than 50 percent of D's stock. Subsequently, 15 of these investors each purchases four percent of D's outstanding stock. Under paragraph (c)(4)(ii) of this section, the 15 investors have a formal or informal understanding among themselves to make a coordinated acquisition of stock. Their interests are therefore aggregated under section 355(d)(7)(B), and they are treated as one person that purchased 600 shares of D stock for purposes of section 355(d).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> D has 1,000 shares of outstanding stock owned by unrelated individuals. An investment advisor advises its clients that it believes D's stock is undervalued and recommends that they acquire D stock. Acting on the investment advisor's recommendation, 20 unrelated individuals each purchases 30 shares of the outstanding D stock. Each client's decision was not based on the investment decisions made by one or more other clients. Because there is no formal or informal understanding among the clients to make a coordinated acquisition of D stock, their interests are not aggregated under section 355(d)(7)(B) and they are treated as making separate purchases.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3, except that the investment advisor is also the underwriter (without regard to whether it is a firm commitment or best efforts underwriting) for a primary or secondary offering of D stock. The result is the same.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The facts are the same as in paragraph (i) of this Example 3, except that, instead of an investment advisor recommending that clients purchase D stock, the trustee of several trusts qualified under section 401(a) sponsored by unrelated corporations causes each trust to purchase the D stock. The result is the same, provided that the trustee's investment decision made on behalf of each trust was not based on the investment decision made on behalf of one or more of the other trusts.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Exception--(A) Subsequent disposition. If two or more persons do not act pursuant to a plan or arrangement within the meaning of this paragraph (c)(4) with respect to an acquisition of stock in a corporation (the first corporation), a subsequent acquisition in which such persons exchange their stock in the first corporation for stock in another corporation (the second corporation) in a transaction in which the basis of the second corporation's stock in the hands of such persons is determined in whole or in part by reference to the basis of their stock in the first corporation, will not result in such persons being treated as one person, even

The D shareholders approve the plan by a two-thirds vote, as required by state law. Under section 358(a), each shareholder's basis in its P stock is determined by reference to the basis of the D stock it purchased. Under paragraph (e)(3) of this section, the former D shareholders are treated as purchasing their P stock on Date 1.

The T stock is not marketable stock under section 355(d)(5)(B)(ii) and paragraph (d)(3)(ii) of this section. A is treated under section 304(a)(1) as receiving a distribution in redemption of the P stock. Under section 302(d), the deemed redemption is treated as a section 301 distribution. Assume that under sections 304(b)(2) and 301(c)(1), all of the distribution is a dividend.

Transferred items may be considered necessary for reasonably anticipated future needs only if the transferor and transferee have specific, definite, and feasible plans for their use. Those plans must require that items intended for anticipated future needs rather than present needs be used as expeditiously as possible consistent with the business purpose for retention of the items. Future needs are not reasonably anticipated if they are uncertain or vague or where the execution of the plan for their use is substantially postponed.

Accordingly, P is treated under section 355(d)(5)(B) and paragraph (d)(3)(iv) of this section as having purchased $50 of the S stock (attributable to the marketable stock), but is not deemed to have purchased the remaining $150 of the S stock.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Special rules for triangular asset reorganizations, other reverse triangular reorganizations, and group structure changes.

On Date 1, A purchases 10 percent of the stock of P, which has held 100 percent of the stock of T for more than five years at the time of A's purchase. A is deemed to have purchased 10 percent of P's T stock on Date 1. If A later purchases an additional 41 percent of the stock of P on Date 2, A is deemed to have purchased an additional 41 percent of P's T stock on Date 2. Because A and P are now related persons under section 267(b), they are treated as one person under section 355(d)(7)(A), and A is treated as owning all of P's T stock. A is treated as acquiring 51 percent of the T stock by purchase at the times of A's respective purchases of P stock on Date 1 and Date 2. The remaining 49 percent of T stock is treated as acquired when P acquired the T stock, more than five years before Date 1. If P distributes T after Date 2 and within five years after Date 1, the distribution will be a disqualified distribution under section 355(d)(2) and paragraph (b)(1) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. A has owned 60 percent of the stock of P for more than five years, and P has owned 40 percent of the stock of T for more than five years. A and P are treated as one person, and A is treated as owning 40 percent of the stock of T for more than five years.

If A then purchases an additional 10 percent of the stock of P on Date 2, under paragraph (e)(1)(i) of this section, A is deemed to have purchased on Date 2 an additional four percent of the T stock (10 percent of the 40 percent that P originally owned). In addition, even though A and P were already treated as one person under section 355(d)(7)(A), A also is deemed to have purchased two percent of the T stock on Date 2 (10 percent of the 20 percent of the T stock that it was treated as purchasing on Date 1). A is still treated as owning all 60 percent of the T stock owned by P. However, of the 60 percent, A is treated as having purchased 18 percent of the T stock on Date 1 and 6 percent of the T stock on Date 2, for a total of 24 percent purchased stock.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. A purchases a 20 percent interest in partnership M on Date 1. M has owned 30 percent of the stock and 25 percent of the securities of P for more than five years. P has owned 40 percent of the stock and 100 percent of the securities of T for more than five years. Under section 318(a)(2)(C) as modified by section 355(d)(8)(A), M is deemed to own 12 percent of the stock (30 percent of the 40 percent P owns) and 30 percent of the securities (30 percent of the 100 percent P owns) of T. Under sections 318(a)(2)(A) and 355(d)(8)(B), A is deemed to have purchased 2.4 percent of the stock (20 percent of the 12 percent M is deemed to own) and 6 percent of the securities (20 percent of the 30 percent M is deemed to own) of T on Date 1. Similarly, A is deemed to have purchased 6 percent of the stock (20 percent of the 30 percent M owns) and five percent of the securities (20 percent of the 25 percent M owns) of P on Date 1. If M later purchases an additional 10 percent of P stock on Date 2, M is deemed to have purchased four percent of the stock (10 percent of the 40 percent P owns) and 10 percent of the securities (10 percent of the 100 percent P owns) of T on Date 2. A is deemed to have purchased two percent of the stock of P on Date 2 (20 percent of the 10 percent M purchased).

If B later purchases 50 percent of the P stock from A on Date 1, A and B are still treated as one person. However, under paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of this section, the 50 percent of P stock that B purchased from A is treated as purchased on Date 1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Transferred basis rule.

The rule in this paragraph (e)(3) applies only to exchanges that are not otherwise treated as purchases under section 355(d)(5) and paragraph (d) of this section. The rule in this paragraph (e)(3) applies, for example, where stock of a corporation acquired by purchase is subsequently exchanged for other stock in a section 351, 354, or 1036(a) exchange.

In determining whether section 355(d) applies to a distribution of controlled corporation stock, a distributing corporation must determine whether a disqualified person holds its stock or the stock of any distributed controlled corporation.

A distributing corporation is deemed to have knowledge of the existence and contents of all schedules, forms, and other documents filed with or under the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation any Schedule 13D or 13G (or any similar schedules) and amendments, with respect to any relevant corporation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Presumption as to securities filings.

Reporting stock is stock that is described in Rule 13d-1(i) of Regulation 13D (17 CFR 240.13d-1(i)) (or any rule or regulation to generally the same effect) promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78a et seq.).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Presumption as to less-than-five-percent shareholders. Absent actual knowledge (or deemed knowledge under paragraph (f)(2) of this section) immediately after the distribution to the contrary with regard to a particular shareholder, a distributing corporation may presume that no less-than-five-percent shareholder of a corporation acquired stock or securities by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period. For purposes of this paragraph (f), a less-than-five-percent shareholder is a person that, at no time during the five-year period, holds directly (or by application of paragraph (c)(3)(ii) of this section, but not by application of section 355(d)(7) or (8)) stock possessing five percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote or the total value of shares of all classes of stock of a corporation.

The following examples illustrate this paragraph (f):</p><p class="depth0">Example 1. Publicly traded corporation; no schedules filed. D is a widely held and publicly traded corporation with a single class of reporting stock and no other class of stock. Assume that applicable federal law requires any person that directly holds five percent or more of the D stock to file a schedule with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 10 days after an acquisition. D distributes its wholly owned subsidiary C pro rata. D determines that no schedule, form, or other document has been filed with respect to its stock or the stock of any other relevant corporation during the five-year period or within 10 days after the distribution. Immediately after the distribution, D has no knowledge that any of its shareholders are (or were at any time during the five-year period) not less-than-five-percent shareholders, or that any particular shareholder acquired D stock by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period. Under paragraph (f)(3) of this section, D may presume it has no shareholder that is or was not a less-than-five-percent shareholder during the five-year period due to the absence of any filed schedules, forms, or other documents. Under paragraph (f)(4) of this section, D may presume that none of its less-than-five-percent shareholders acquired D's stock by purchase during the five-year period. Accordingly, D may presume that section 355(d) does not apply to the distribution of C.</p><p class="depth0">Example 2. Publicly traded corporation; schedule filed. The facts are the same as those in Example 1, except that D determines that, as of 10 days after the distribution, only one schedule has been filed with respect to its stock. That schedule discloses that X acquired 15 percent of the D stock one year before the distribution. Absent contrary knowledge, D may rely on the presumptions in paragraph (f)(3) of this section and so may presume that X is its only shareholder that is or was not a less-than-five-percent shareholder during the five-year period. D may not rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(4) of this section with respect to X. In addition, D may not rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(4) of this section with respect to any less-than-five-percent shareholder that, at any time during the five-year period, is related to X under section 355(d)(7)(A), acted pursuant to a plan or arrangement with X under section 355(d)(7)(B) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section with respect to acquisitions of D stock, or holds stock that is attributed to X under section 355(d)(8)(A). Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to determine whether section 355(d) applies, D must determine: whether X acquired its directly held D stock by purchase under section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2) and (3) of this section during the five-year period; whether X is treated as having purchased any additional D stock under section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section during the five-year period; and whether X is related to, or acquired its D stock pursuant to a plan or arrangement with, one or more of D's other shareholders during the five-year period under section 355(d)(7)(A) or (B) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and if so, whether those shareholders acquired their D stock by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3. Acquisition of publicly traded corporation. The facts are the same as those in Example 1, except that P acquires all of the D stock in a section 368(a)(1)(B) reorganization that is not also a reorganization under section 368(a)(1)(A) by reason of section 368(a)(2)(E), and D distributes C to P one year later. Because D was widely held, P applies statistical sampling procedures that involve less than 50% of D's outstanding shares, to estimate the basis of all shares acquired, instead of surveying each shareholder. Under the deemed purchase rule of section 355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section, P is treated as having acquired the D stock by purchase on the date the D shareholders acquired the D stock by purchase. Even though D has no less-than-five-percent shareholder immediately after the distribution, D may rely on the presumptions in paragraphs (f)(3) and (4) of this section to determine whether and to what extent the D stock is treated as purchased during the five-year period in P's hands under the deemed purchase rule of section

355(d)(5)(C) and paragraph (e)(2) of this section. Accordingly, D may presume that section 355(d) does not apply to the distribution of C to P. This result would not change even if the statistical sampling that involves less than 50 percent of D's outstanding shares indicated that more than 50% of D's shares were acquired by purchase during the five-year period.</p><p class="depth0">Example 4. Non-publicly traded corporation. D is owned by 20 shareholders and has a single class of stock that is not reporting stock. D knows that A owns 40 percent of the D stock, and D does not know that any other shareholder has owned as much as five percent of the D stock at any time during the five-year period. D may not rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(3) of this section because its stock is not reporting stock. D may not rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(4) of this section with respect to A. In addition, D may not rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(4) of this section for any less-than-five-percent shareholder that, at any time during the five-year period, is related to A under section 355(d)(7)(A), acted pursuant to a plan or arrangement with A under section 355(d)(7)(B) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section with respect to acquisitions of D stock, or holds stock that is attributed to A under section 355(d)(8)(A). D may rely on the presumption in paragraph (f)(4) of this section for less-than-five-percent shareholders that during the five-year period are not related to A, did not act pursuant to a plan or arrangement with A, and do not hold stock attributed to A. Accordingly, under paragraph (f)(1) of this section, to determine whether section 355(d) applies, D must determine: that A is its only shareholder that is (or was at any time during the five-year period) not a less-than-five-percent shareholder; whether A acquired its directly held D stock by purchase under section 355(d)(5) and paragraphs (d) and (e)(2) and (3) of this section during the five-year period; whether A is treated as having purchased any additional D stock under section 355(d)(8) and paragraph (e)(1) of this section during the five-year period; and whether A is related to, or acquired its D stock pursuant to a plan or arrangement with, one or more of D's other shareholders during the five-year period under section 355(d)(7)(A) or (B) and paragraph (c)(4) of this section, and if so, whether those shareholders acquired their D stock by purchase under section 355(d)(5) or (8) and paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section during the five-year period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Effective date. This section applies to distributions occurring after December 20, 2000, except that they do not apply to any distributions occurring pursuant to a written agreement which is (subject to customary conditions) binding on December 20, 2000, and at all times thereafter.
