                            <p class="depth0">Military police are authorized to receive, process, safeguard and dispose of evidence, to include non-narcotic controlled substances, in accordance with AR 195-5. If no suitable facility is available for the establishment of a military police evidence depository or other operational circumstances so dictate, the evidence custodian of the appropriate USACIDC element may be requested to receipt for and assume responsibility for military police evidence. Personnel selected as military police evidence custodians need not be trained as MPI and should not be issued MPI credentials, unless they are also employed as operational MPI. Further information concerning evidence collection and examination procedures can be found in Field Manual (FM) 3-19.13, Law Enforcement Investigations.</p>
