When abstracts are furnished on a per-item or per-page  basis, the contents must be carefully reviewed by a qualified  representative of the Division or District Engineer, to insure that  bills are not excessive and that abstracts do not include superfluous  material.

Payments for title evidence will be  made by the Contracting Officer from available funds for the project to  which the title evidence pertains, upon receipt of certified and  approved vouchers.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Preparation of Invoices for Title Services.
