If the certificate holder does not have any existing rates on file with the appropriate state regulatory agency for city-gate service, the certificate holder may make the rate election specified in Sec. 284.123(b)(1) only if:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The certificate holder's existing rates are approved by an appropriate state regulatory agency,</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The rates and charges for any transportation are computed by using the portion of the certificate holder weighted average annual unit revenue (per MMBtu) generated by existing rates which is attributable to the cost of gathering, treatment, processing, transportation, delivery or similar service (including storage service), and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The Commission has approved the method for computing rates and charges specified in paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Volumetric test.
