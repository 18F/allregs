Additionally, you must list those resource providers that you have contracted to provide these services. You may list multiple resource providers for each service, but you must identify which one is your primary resource provider for each Captain of the Port (COTP) zone in which you operate. A method of contact, consistent with the requirements in Secs. 155.1035(e)(6)(ii), 155.1040(e)(5)(ii), and 155.5035(e)(6)(ii) must also be listed, in the geographical-specific appendices of your VRP, adjacent to the name of the resource provider.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Table 155.4030(b) lists the required salvage and marine firefighting services and response timeframes.</p><p class="depth2">Table 155.4030(b)--Salvage and Marine Firefighting Services and Response Timeframes</p><p class="depth2">Service           Location of incident response activity</p><p class="depth3"><em>(1)</em> Salvage.......................................................

If another resource provider, not listed in the approved plan for the specific service required, is to be contracted for a specific response, justification for the selection of that resource provider needs to be provided to, and approved by, the FOSC. Only under exceptional circumstances will the FOSC authorize deviation from the resource provider listed in the approved vessel response plan in instances where that would best affect a more successful response.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Worker health and safety. Your resource providers must have the capability to implement the necessary engineering, administrative, and personal protective equipment controls to safeguard their workers when providing salvage and marine firefighting services, as found in 33 CFR 155.1055(e) and 29 CFR 1910.120(q).</p>
