                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 416.211 (b) and (c), a recipient is ineligible for benefits for the first full calendar month in which he or she is a resident of a public institution (as defined in Sec. 416.201) throughout the calendar

month (as defined in Sec. 416.211(a)), and payments are suspended effective with such first full month. Such ineligibility continues for so long as such individual remains a resident of a public institution.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Resumption of payments. If benefits are otherwise payable, they will be resumed effective with the earliest day of the month in which a recipient is no longer a resident of a public institution. See Sec. 416.421. A transfer from one public institution to another or a temporary absence from the institution lasting 14 days or less, however, will not change his or her status as a resident, and the suspension will continue.
