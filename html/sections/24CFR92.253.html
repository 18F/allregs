                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Lease. There must be a written lease between the tenant and the  owner of rental housing assisted with HOME funds that is for a period of  not less than one year, unless by mutual agreement between the tenant  and the owner a shorter period is specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Prohibited lease terms. The lease may not contain any of the  following provisions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Agreement to be sued. Agreement by the tenant to be sued, to  admit guilt, or to a judgment in favor of the owner in a lawsuit brought  in connection with the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Treatment of property. Agreement by the tenant that the owner  may take, hold, or sell personal property of household members without  notice to the tenant and a court decision on the rights of the parties.  This prohibition, however, does not apply to an agreement by the tenant  concerning disposition of personal property remaining in the housing  unit after the tenant has moved out of the unit. The owner may dispose  of this personal property in accordance with State law;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Excusing owner from responsibility. Agreement by the tenant not  to hold the owner or the owner's agents legally responsible for any  action or failure to act, whether intentional or negligent;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Waiver of notice. Agreement of the tenant that the owner may  institute a lawsuit without notice to the tenant;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Waiver of legal proceedings. Agreement by the tenant that the  owner may evict the tenant or household members without instituting a  civil court proceeding in which the tenant   has the opportunity to present a defense, or before a court decision on  the rights of the parties;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Waiver of a jury trial. Agreement by the tenant to waive any  right to a trial by jury;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Waiver of right to appeal court decision. Agreement by the  tenant to waive the tenant's right to appeal, or to otherwise challenge  in court, a court decision in connection with the lease;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Tenant chargeable with cost of legal actions regardless of  outcome. Agreement by the tenant to pay attorney's fees or other legal  costs even if the tenant wins in a court proceeding by the owner against  the tenant. The tenant, however, may be obligated to pay costs if the  tenant loses; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Mandatory supportive services. Agreement by the tenant (other  than a tenant in transitional housing) to accept supportive services  that are offered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Termination of tenancy. An owner may not terminate the tenancy  or refuse to renew the lease of a tenant of rental housing assisted with  HOME funds, except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and  conditions of the lease; for violation of applicable Federal, State, or  local law; for completion of the tenancy period for transitional housing  or failure to follow any required transitional housing supportive  services plan; or for other good cause. Good cause does not include an  increase in the tenant's income or refusal of the tenant to purchase the  housing. To terminate or refuse to renew tenancy, the owner must serve  written notice upon the tenant specifying the grounds for the action at  least 30 days before the termination of tenancy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Tenant selection. An owner of rental housing assisted with HOME  funds must comply with the affirmative marketing requirements  established by the participating jurisdiction pursuant to Sec.  92.351(a). The owner must adopt and follow written tenant selection  policies and criteria that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Limit the housing to very low- income and low-income families;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are reasonably related to the applicants' ability to perform the  obligations of the lease (i.e., to pay the rent, not to damage the  housing; not to interfere with the rights and quiet enjoyment of other  tenants);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limit eligibility or give a preference to a particular segment  of the population if permitted in its written agreement with the  participating jurisdiction (and only if the limitation or preference is  described in the participating jurisdiction's consolidated plan).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Any limitation or preference must not violate nondiscrimination  requirements in Sec. 92.350. A limitation or preference does not  violate nondiscrimination requirements if the housing also receives  funding from a Federal program that limits eligibility to a particular  segment of the population (e.g., the Housing Opportunity for Persons  with AIDS program under 24 CFR part 574, the Shelter Plus Care program  under 24 CFR part 582, the Supportive Housing program under 24 CFR part  583, supportive housing for the elderly or persons with disabilities  under 24 CFR part 891), and the limit or preference is tailored to serve  that segment of the population.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a project does not receive funding from a Federal program  that limits eligibility to a particular segment of the population, the  project may have a limitation or preference for persons with  disabilities who need services offered at a project only if:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The limitation or preference is limited to the population of  families (including individuals) with disabilities that significantly  interfere with their ability to obtain and maintain housing;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Such families will not be able to obtain or maintain themselves  in housing without appropriate supportive services; and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Such services cannot be provided in a nonsegregated setting. The  families must not be required to accept the services offered at the  project. In advertising the project, the owner may advertise the project  as offering services for a particular type of disability; however, the  project must be open to all otherwise eligible persons with disabilities  who may benefit from the services provided in the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Do not exclude an applicant with a certificate or voucher under  the Section 8 Tenant-Based Assistance: Housing Choice Voucher Program  (24 CFR   part 982) or an applicant participating in a HOME tenant-based rental  assistance program because of the status of the prospective tenant as a  holder of such certificate, voucher, or comparable HOME tenant-based  assistance document.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Provide for the selection of tenants from a written waiting list  in the chronological order of their application, insofar as is  practicable; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Give prompt written notification to any rejected applicant of  the grounds for any rejection.  [61 FR 48750, Sept. 16, 1996, as amended at 67 FR 61756, Oct. 1, 2002;  78 FR 44674, July 24, 2013]</p>
