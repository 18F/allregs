When an  individual requests access to records pertaining to the individual that  include medical and/or psychological information, the ASC, if it deems  it necessary under the particular circumstances, may require the  individual to submit with the request a signed statement by the  individual's physician or a mental health professional indicating that,  in his or her opinion, disclosure of the requested records or  information directly to the individual will not have an adverse effect  on the individual.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Designation of physician or mental health professional to  receive records. If the ASC believes, in good faith, that disclosure of  medical and/or psychological information, directly to an individual  could have an adverse effect on that individual, the individual may be  asked to designate in writing a physician or mental health professional  to whom the individual would like the records to be disclosed, and  disclosure that otherwise would be made to the individual will instead  be made to the designated physician or mental health professional.</p>
