                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Conditions for split payment. If the beneficiary assigns the claim after paying part of the bill, payment may be made partly to the beneficiary and partly to the supplier.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Payment to the supplier. Payment to the supplier who submits the assigned claim is for whichever of the following amounts is less:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The reasonable charge minus the amount the beneficiary had already paid to the supplier; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The full Part B benefit due for the services furnished.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Payment to the beneficiary. Any part of the Part B benefit which, on the basis of paragraph (b) of this section, is not payable to the supplier, is paid to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Examples.</p><p class="depth2">Example 1. An assigned bill of $300 on which partial payment of $100 has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that $300 is the reasonable charge for the service furnished. Total payment due is 80 percent of $300 or $240. Of this amount, $200 (the difference between the $100 partial payment and the $300 reasonable charge) is paid to the supplier. The remaining $40 is paid to the beneficiary.</p><p class="depth2">Example 2. An assigned bill of $325 on which partial payment of $275 has been made is submitted to the carrier. The carrier determines that $275 is the reasonable charge for the services. Total payment due is 80 percent of $275 or $220. The $220 is paid to the beneficiary, since any payment to the supplier, when added to the $275 partial payment would exceed the reasonable charge for the services furnished.
