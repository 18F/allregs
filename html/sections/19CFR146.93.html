                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Attribution. All final products removed from or consumed within  a petroleum refinery subzone must be attributed to feedstock admitted  into said petroleum refinery subzone in the current or prior  manufacturing period. Attribution must be based on records maintained by  the operator. Attribution may be made by applying one of the authorized  methods set forth in this section. Records must be maintained on a  weight or volume basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Producibility. The producibility method of attribution requires  that records be kept to attribute final products to feedstocks which are  eligible for attribution as set forth in this section during the current  or prior manufacturing period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Actual production records. An operator may use its actual  production records as provided for under Sec. 146.95(b) of this  subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other inventory method. An operator may use the FIFO (first-in,  first-out) method of accounting (see Sec. 191.22(c) of this chapter).  The use of this method is illustrated in the appendix to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Feedstock eligible for attribution. Only a feedstock that has  been admitted into the refinery subzone is eligible for attribution. For  a given manufacturing period, the quantity of feedstock eligible for  attribution may be computed as beginning inventory, plus receipts less  shipments of feedstock out of the subzone, and less ending inventory.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Consumption or removal of final product. Each final product that  is consumed in or removed from a refinery subzone must be attributed to  a feedstock eligible for attribution during the current or a prior  manufacturing period. Each final product attributed as being produced  from the separation of a privileged foreign status feedstock must be  assigned the proper relative value as set forth in paragraph (d) of this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relative value. A relative value calculation is required when  two or more final products are produced as the result of the separation  of privileged foreign status feedstock. Ad valorem and compound rates of  duty must be converted to specific rates of duty in order to make a  relative value calculation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Privileged status after admission. Nonprivileged status  feedstock is eligible for privileged status only if the request shows to  the satisfaction of the Customs Service that there was no manipulation  or manufacture of the feedstock to change its tariff classification  before the request is granted. The absence of such manipulation or  manufacture can be shown by demonstrating that the feedstock was placed  in an empty tank, in a tank that contained only feedstock with the same  nominal specifications or providing a sample which shows there was no  change in tariff status. The existence of negligible amounts of other  feedstocks may be disregarded only in accordance with Sec. 146.95(b). A  request for after-admission privileged foreign status shall be denied  unless the feedstock's tank records from admission to the time that the  request is made accompany the request. A refiner who makes such a  request shall not put any other feedstock having different nominal  specifications into the tank until the request for privileged status is  granted. The Customs Service will deny or revoke a post-admission  request if a refiner fails to retain the integrity of the feedstock in  the tank.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Consistent use required. The operator must use the selected  method, measurement (weight or volume), and the price of product  consistently (see Sec. 146.92(g) of this subpart and paragraph (a) of  this section).</p>
