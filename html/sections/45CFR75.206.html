                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Paperwork clearances. The HHS awarding agency may only use application information collections approved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and OMB's implementing regulations in 5 CFR part 1320. Consistent with these requirements, OMB will authorize additional information collections only on a limited basis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If applicable, the HHS awarding agency may inform applicants and recipients that they do not need to provide certain information otherwise required by the relevant information collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Forms for applying for HHS financial assistance. HHS awarding agencies should use the Standard Form 424 (SF-424 Application for Federal Assistance) series (or its successor) and its program narrative whenever possible. Alternative mechanisms may be used for formula grant programs which do not require applicants to apply for funds on a project basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Applicants shall use the SF-424 series or those forms and instructions prescribed by the HHS awarding agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For Federal programs covered by Executive Order 12372, as amended by Executive Order 12416, the applicant shall complete the appropriate sections of the SF-424 indicating whether the application was subject to review by the State Single Point of Contact (SPOC). The name and address of the SPOC for a particular State can be obtained from the HHS awarding agency or the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance. The SPOC shall advise the applicant whether the program for which application is made has been selected by that State for review. (See also 45 CFR part 100.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> HHS awarding agencies that do not use the SF-424 series will indicate on the application form they prescribe whether the application is subject to review by the State under Executive Order 12372.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> This section does not apply to applications for subawards.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Except where otherwise noted, or granted by HHS deviation, HHS awarding agencies shall direct applicants to apply for HHS financial assistance through Grants.gov, an OMB-designated Web site for Find and Apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> State plans. The statutes for some programs require States to submit plans before receiving grants. Under regulations implementing Executive Order 12372, States are allowed to simplify, consolidate and substitute plans. This section contains additional provisions for plans that are subject to regulations implementing Executive Order 12372.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Requirements. A State need meet only Federal administrative or programmatic requirements for a plan that are in statutes or codified regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assurances. In each plan, the State will include an assurance that the State will comply with all applicable Federal statutes and regulations in effect with respect to the periods for which it receives grant funding. For this assurance and other assurances required in this plan, the State may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Cite by number the statutory or regulatory provisions requiring the assurances and affirm that it gives the assurances required by those provisions,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Repeat the assurance language in the statutes or regulations, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Develop its own language to the extent permitted by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Amendments. A State will amend a plan whenever necessary to reflect:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> New or revised Federal statutes or regulations, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A material change in any State law, organization, policy, or State agency operation. The State will obtain approval for the amendment and its effective date but need submit for approval only the amended portions of the plan.</p>
