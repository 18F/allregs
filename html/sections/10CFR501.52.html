                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> OFE may prohibit by order the use of petroleum or natural gas as  a primary energy source or in amounts in excess of the minimum amount  necessary to maintain reliability of operation consistent with  maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency in an existing powerplant if the  owner or operator of the powerplant certifies, and OFE concurs in such  certification in accordance with the requirements of Secs. 504.5, 504.6  and 504.8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notice of order and participation. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OFE may hold a conference  with the   proposed order recipient, at the recipient's election, prior to issuing  the proposed order. The conference may resolve any questions regarding  the certification required by section 301 of the Act, as amended, and  Secs. 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, and OFE's review and concurrence therein.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Pursuant to section 701(b) of FUA, prior to the issuance of a  final order to a certifying powerplant owner or operator, OFE must  publish in the Federal Register, a proposed prohibition order stating  the reasons for such order. OFE will review all of the information  submitted by a proposed order recipient within 60 days after receipt by  OFE. If the certification is complete, OFE will, within 30 days after  the end of the 60 day review period, publish in the Federal Register a  Notice of Acceptance of certification together with a proposed  prohibition order stating therein the reasons for such order. This  commences the prohibition order proceeding. If OFE does not believe it  is able to concur in the certification, OFE shall notify the proposed  order recipient and shall publish a Notice of Proposed Non-Concurrence  in the Federal Register within 30 days after the end of the 60 day  review period. If OFE finds that the certification with compliance  schedule is incomplete, OFE will notify the proposed prohibition order  recipient as to the deficiencies, and provide an additional period of 30  days for the certification to be amended and resubmitted. If a complete  certification is not submitted within this period, the proceeding shall  be terminated in accordance with Sec. 501.52(b)(5). OFE will notify the  proposed order recipient and other parties to the proceeding of the  termination and publish a notice in the Federal Register. OFE, on its  own motion, may extend any period of time by publishing a notice to that  effect in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The publication of the Notice of Acceptance or Notice of  Proposed Non-Concurrence commences a period of 45 days during which  interested persons may submit written comments or request a public  hearing. During this period, the recipient of the proposed order and any  other interested person may submit any evidence that they have available  relating to the proposed order, the certification or the concurrence  that OFE must make. A proposed order recipient may submit additional new  evidence at any time prior to the close of the public comment period  which follows the commencement of the proceeding or prior to the close  of the record of any public hearing, whichever occurs later. A request  for an extension of the 45 day period may be granted at OFE's  discretion. In the case of a Notice of Acceptance, as set forth in  Sec. 504.9, no final prohibition order can be issued until any necessary  environmental review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act  of 1969, 42 U.S.C 4321 et seq. (NEPA) has been completed. Upon  completion of the NEPA review and unless OFE determines on the basis of  the record of the proceeding that the certification fails to meet the  requirements of Secs. 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8, OFE shall publish a final  prohibition order, together with the information required by paragraph  (c) of this section. In the case of a Notice of Proposed Non- Concurrence, at the end of the 45 day comment period, OFE will notify  the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and publish a  final Notice of Non-Concurrence in the Federal Register, if OFE  determines it cannot concur in the certification based upon additional  information submitted during the proceeding. If, at the end of the 45  day period, OFE believes it can concur in the certification, OFE will  notify the proposed order recipient and parties to the proceeding and  publish a Notice of Acceptance followed by a new 45 day comment period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a hearing has been requested, OFE shall provide interested  persons with an opportunity to present oral data, views and arguments at  a public hearing held in accordance with subpart C of this part. The  hearing may consider, among other matters, the sufficiency of the  certification of the owner or operator of the powerplant required by  section 301 of FUA, as amended, and Secs. 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of  these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> OFE may terminate a prohibition order proceeding at any time  prior to the date upon which a final prohibition order is issued  whenever OFE believes,   from any information contained in the record of the proceeding, that the  certification does not meet the requirements of section 301 of the Act,  as amended, or Secs. 504.5, 504.6, and 504.8 of these regulations. If  OFE terminates the proceeding or publishes a final Notice of Non- Concurrence, or the proposed order recipient fails to submit a complete  certification, OFE will notify the proposed order recipient and other  parties to the proceeding and publish a notice in the Federal Register.  In such event, the proposed order recipient may submit a new  certification under any provision of section 301 of the Act, as amended,  at a later date. Specifically, a Notice of Non-Concurrence under either  section 301(b) or 301(c) shall not affect a proposed order recipient's  ability to make a certification under the other subsection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Record and decision to issue a final order. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> OFE will base  its determination to issue an order on consideration of the whole record  or those parts thereof cited by a party and supported by and in  accordance with reliable, probative and substantial evidence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> OFE shall include in the final order a written statement of the  basis upon which the final order is issued, and its concurrence in the  required certification. A copy of the final order and a summary of the  basis therefor will be published in the Federal Register. While the  prohibition order is final for purposes of judicial review under section  702 of FUA, the prohibitions contained in the final order shall not  become effective for purposes of amendment under section 301(d) of FUA,  as amended, and Sec. 501.52(d) of these regulations until the effective  date of the prohibitions stated in the order, or, where the order is  subject to one or more conditions subsequent listed in the prohibition  order compliance schedule, until all its conditions are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em>, or its certification under section 301 of FUA, as  amended, and Secs. 504.5, 504.6 and 504.8 of these regulations in order  to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances at any  time prior to the effective date of the prohibitions contained in the  final prohibition order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Rescission of prohibition orders. The rescission or modification  of final prohibition orders issued to existing electric powerplants will  be governed by the procedure in Sec. 501.101 of these regulations.
