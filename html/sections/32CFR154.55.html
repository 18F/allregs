                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. For purposes of this part, an unfavorable administrative action includes any adverse action which is taken as a result of a personnel security determination, as defined at Sec. 154.3 and any unfavorable personnel security determination, as defined at Sec. 154.3. This subpart is intended only to provide guidance for the internal operation of the Department of Defense and is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon, to create or enlarge the jurisdiction or review authority of any court or administrative tribunal, including the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Referral for action. (1) Whenever derogatory information relating to the criteria and policy set forth in Sec. 154.7(a) and appendix H of this part is developed or otherwise becomes available to any DoD element, it shall be referred by the most expeditious means to the commander or the security officer of the organization to which the individual is assigned for duty. The commander or security officer of the organization to which the subject of the information is assigned shall review the information in terms of its security significance and completeness. If further information is needed to confirm or disprove the allegations, additional investigation should be requested. The commander of the duty organization shall insure that the parent Component of the individual concerned is informed promptly concerning the derogatory information developed and any actions taken or anticipated with respect thereto. However, referral of derogatory information to the commander or security officer shall in no way affect or limit the responsibility of the central adjudication facility to continue to process the individual for denial or revocation of clearance or access to classified information, in accordance with Sec. 154.56(b), if such action is warranted and supportable by the criteria and policy contained in Sec. 154.7(a) and appendix H. No unfavorable administrative action as defined in Sec. 154.3 may be taken by the organization to which the individual is assigned for duty without affording the person the full range of protections contained in Sec. 154.56(b) or, in the case of SCI, Annex B, DCID 1/14.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The Director DIS shall establish appropriate alternative means whereby information with potentially serious security significance can be reported

other than through DoD command or industrial organization channels. Such access shall include utilization of the DoD Inspector General ``hotline'' to receive such reports for appropriate follow-up by DIS. DoD Components and industry will assist DIS in publicizing the availability of appropriate reporting channels. Additionally, DoD Components will augment the system when and where necessary. Heads of DoD Components will be notified immediately to take action if appropriate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Suspension. (1) The commander or head of the organization shall determine whether, on the basis of all facts available upon receipt of the initial derogatory information, it is in the interests of national security to continue subject's security status unchanged or to take interim action to suspend subject's access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination), if information exists which raises serious questions as to the individual's ability to intent to protect classified information or execute sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination) until a final determination is made by the appropriate authority designated in appendix F to this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Whenever a determination is made to suspend a security clearance for access to classified information or assignment to sensitive duties (or other duties requiring a trustworthiness determination), the individual concerned must be notified of the determination in writing by the commander, or head of the component or adjudicative authority, to include a brief statement of the reason(s) for the suspension action consistent with the interests of national security.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Component field elements must promptly report all suspension actions to the appropriate central adjudicative authority, but not later than 10 working days from the date of the suspension action. The adjudicative authority will immediately update the DCII Eligibility and Access fields to alert all users to the individual's changed status.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Every effect shall be made to resolve suspension cases as expeditiously as circumstances permit. Suspension cases exceeding 180 days shall be closely monitored and managed by the DoD Component concerned until finally resolved. Suspension cases pending in excess of 12 months will be reported to the DASD(CI&SCM;) for review and appropriate action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> A final security clearance eligibility determination shall be made for all suspension actions and the determination entered in the DCII. If, however, the individual under suspension leaves the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense and no longer requires a clearance (or trustworthiness determination), entry of the ``Z'' Code (adjudication action incomplete due to loss of jurisdiction) if the clearance eligibility field is appropriate. In no case shall a ``suspension'' code (Code Y) remain as a permanent record in the DCII.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> A clearance or access entry in the DCII shall not be suspended or downgraded based solely on the fact that a periodic reinvestigation was not conducted precisely within the 5 year time period for TOP SECRET/SCI or within the period prevailing for SECRET clearances under departmental policy. While every effort should be made to ensure that PRs are conducted within the prescribed time frame, agencies must be flexible in their administration of this aspect of the personnel security program so as not to undermine the ability of the Department of Defense to accomplish its mission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Final unfavorable administrative actions. The authority to make personnel security determinations that will result in an unfavorable administrative action is limited to those authorities designated in appendix E, except that the authority to terminate the employment of a civilian employee of a military department or Defense agency is vested solely in the head of the DoD component concerned and in such other statutory official as may be designated. Action to terminate civilian employees of the Office of the Secretary of Defense and DoD Components, on the basis of criteria listed in Sec. 154.7 (a) through (f), shall be coordinated with the Deputy Under Secretary

of Defense for Policy prior to final action by the head of the DoD Component. DoD civilian employees or members of the Armed Forces shall not be removed from employment or separated from the Service under provisions of this part if removal or separation can be effected under OPM regulations or administrative (nonsecurity) regulations of the military departments. However, actions contemplated in this regard shall not affect or limit the responsibility of the central adjudication facility to continue for process the individual for denial or revocation of a security clearance, access to classified information on or assignment to a sensitive position if warranted and supportable by the criteria and standards contained in this part.
