                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The owner or operator of a hazardous waste disposal unit must  have a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the annual cost  of post-closure monitoring and maintenance of the facility in accordance  with the applicable post-closure regulations in Secs. 265.117 through  265.120, 265.228, 265.258, 265.280, and 265.310.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The post-closure cost estimate must be based on the costs to the  owner or operator of hiring a third party to conduct post-closure care  activities. A third party is a party who is neither a parent nor  subsidiary of the owner or operator. (See definition of parent  corporation in Sec. 265.141(d).)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The post-closure cost estimate is calculated by multiplying the  annual post-closure cost estimate by the number of years of post-closure  care required under Sec. 265.117.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> and (2).  The inflation factor is the result of dividing the latest published  annual   Deflator by the Deflator for the previous year.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The first adjustment is made by multiplying the post-closure  cost es ti mate by the inflation factor. The result is the adjusted  post-closure cost estimate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Subsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest  adjusted post-closure cost estimate by the latest inflation factor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> During the active life of the facility, the owner or operator  must revise the post-closure cost estimate no later than 30 days after a  revision to the post-closure plan which increases the cost of post- closure care. If the owner or operator has an approved post-closure  plan, the post-closure cost estimate must be revised no later than 30  days after the Regional Administrator has approved the request to modify  the plan, if the change in the post-closure plan increases the cost of  post-closure care. The revised post-closure cost estimate must be  adjusted for inflation as specified in Sec. 265.144(b).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator must keep the following at the facility  during the operating life of the facility: the latest post-closure cost  estimate prepared in accordance with Sec. 265.144 (a) and (c) and, when  this estimate has been adjusted in accordance with Sec. 265.144(b), the  latest adjusted post-closure cost estimate.
