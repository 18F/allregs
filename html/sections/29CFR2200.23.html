If the first document  filed on behalf of a party or intervenor is signed by a representative,  he shall be recognized as representing that party. No separate entry of  appearance by him is necessary, provided the document contains the  information required by Sec. 2200.6.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Subsequent appearance. Where a representative has not previously  appeared on behalf of a party or intervenor, he shall file an entry of  appearance with the Executive Secretary, or Judge if the case has been  assigned. The entry of appearance shall be signed by the representative  and contain the information required by Sec. 2200.6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Withdrawal of counsel. Any counsel or representative of record  desiring to withdraw his appearance, or any party desiring to withdraw  the appearance of counsel or representative of record for him, must file  a motion with the Commission or Judge requesting leave therefor, and  showing that prior notice of the motion has been given by him to his  client or counsel or representative, as the case may be. The motion of  counsel to withdraw may, in the discretion of the Commission or Judge,  be denied where it is necessary to avoid undue delay or prejudice to the  rights of a party or intervenor.</p>
