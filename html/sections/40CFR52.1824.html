Skie, EPA, dated February 14, 1992, Dana K. Mount, Director  of the Division of Environmental Engineering, stated:</p><p class="depth2">To clarify this issue, the State of North Dakota will commit to  meeting all requirements of the EPA Guideline for air quality modeling  demonstrations associated with the permitting of new PSD sources, PSD  major modifications, and sources which will be located in nonattainment  areas. If any conflict exists, the EPA Guideline will take precedence  for these source categories.
