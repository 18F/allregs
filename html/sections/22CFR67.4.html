                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In accordance with the Statement of Principles and Objectives,  NED is currently developing and funding programs in five substantive  areas:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Pluralism. NED encourages the development of strong, independent  private-sector organizations, especially trade unions and business  associations. It also supports cooperatives, civic and women's  organizations, and youth groups, among other organizations. Programs in  the areas of labor and business are carried out, respectively, through  the Free Trade Union Institute and the Center for International Private  Enterprise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Democratic governance and political processes. NED seeks to  promote strong, stable political parties committed to the democratic  process. It also supports programs in election administration and law,  as well as programs that promote dialogue among different sectors of  society and advance democratic solutions to national problems.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Education, culture and communications. NED funds programs that  nourish a strong democratic civic culture, including support for  publications and other communications media and training programs for  journalists; the production and dissemination of books and other  materials to strengthen popular understanding and intellectual advocacy  of democracy; and programs of democratic education.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Research. A modest portion of NED's resources is reserved for  research, including studies of particular regions or countries where NED  has a special interest, and evaluations of previous or existing efforts  to promote democracy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> International cooperation. NED seeks to encourage regional and  international cooperation in promoting democracy, including programs  that strengthen cohesion among democracies and enhance coordination  among democratic forces.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As a grantmaking organization, NED has certain responsibilities  that govern its relationship with all potential and actual grantees.  Briefly, these are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Setting program priorities within the framework of the purposes  outlined in NED's articles of incorporation and contained in the  legislation, and guided by the general policy Statement of the Board of  Directors;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reviewing and vetting proposals, guided by the general  guidelines and selection criteria adopted by the NED Board;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Coordinating among all grantees to avoid duplication and to  assure maximum program effectiveness;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Negotiating a grant agreement which ensures a high standard of  accountability on the part of each grantee;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Financial and programmatic monitoring following the approval and  negotiation of a grant, and ongoing and/or follow-up evaluation of  programs prior to any subsequent funding of either a particular grantee  or a specific program. Grantees will also be expected to monitor  projects, to provide regular reports to NED on the progress of programs,  and to inform NED promptly of any significant problems that could affect  the successful implementation of the project. NED grantees will also  conduct their own evaluations of programs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As a recipient of congressionally appropriated funds, NED has a  special responsibility to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Operate openly,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Provide relevant information on programs and operations to the  public, and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ensure that funds are spent wisely, efficiently, and in  accordance with all relevant regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Institutes representing business, labor, and the major political  parties carry out programs which are central to NED's purposes. As a  result of their unique relationship to NED, institute programs are an  integral part of NED's priorities and the institutes themselves are  ``core'' grantees. As such, the institutes, while subject to all the  normal procedures governing NED's relationships with grantees, will be  treated differently in the following respects:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The institutes will have the mandate to carry out programs  funded by NED in their respective sectors of business, labor and  political parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an integral part of the process of budgeting and setting  program priorities, the NED Board will target a certain amount of its  annual resources for institute programs in their respective fields of  activity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Unlike its practice for the majority of its grantees, NED will  fund significant administrative costs for each of the core grantees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Institute staff will assume responsibility for program  development and preparation of proposals for the Board in each field of  activity for which it has a special mandate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> NED will expect its core grantees to perform their monitoring/ evaluation function described in programmatic monitoring under Financial  and programmatic monitoring above in a manner that will minimize the  need to devote NED resources for these purposes. (Individual copies of  the Grants Policy are available from the NED office.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> As stated above, in awarding grants the Board is guided by  established grant selection critieria. In addition to evaluating how a  program fits within NED's overall priorities, the Board considers  factors such as the urgency of a program, its relevance to specific  needs and conditions in a particular country, and the democratic  commitment and experience of the applicant. NED is especially interested  in proposals that originate with indigenous democratic groups. It is  also interested in nonpartisan programs seeking to strengthen democratic  values among all sectors of the democratic political spectrum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Selection criteria. In determining the relative merit of a  particular proposal NED considers whether the grant application:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Proposes a program that will make a concrete contribution to  assisting foreign individuals or groups who are working for democratic  ends and who need NED's assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Proposes a program, project or activity which is consistent with  current NED program priorities and contributes to overall program  balance and effectiveness.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Proposes an activity that meets an especially urgent need.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Does not overlap with what others are doing well.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Proposes a program that will encourage an intellectual climate  which is favorable to the growth of democratic institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Proposes a program that is not only culturally or intellectually  appealing, but will affect the education and the awareness of minorities  and/or the less privileged members of a society.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Originates from an organization within a particular country  representing the group whose needs are to be addressed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Appears to be well thought out, avoiding imprudent activities  and possibilities for negative repercussions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Takes into consideration not only what objectively could be  significant to a certain society, but how the cultural traditions and  values of that society will react to the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Incorporates an analysis of the problem of democracy in the  area in question and the method by which the proposed program will have  a constructive impact on the problem.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Proposes a program that will enhance our understanding of what  really helps in aiding democracy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Creatively enlists supports for foreign democratic  organizations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Encourages democratic solutions and peaceful resolution of  conflict in situations otherwise fraught with violence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Proposes a program, project or activity that is clearly  relevant to NED program objectives and not better funded by other  government or private organizations. (Proposing organizations will be be  referred to other funding organizations where substantial overlap  exists.)</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Proposes a program or strategy that is appropriate to the  circumstances in the country concerned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Proposes a program that can be expected to have a multiplier  effect, hence having an impact broader than that of the specific project  itself; or establishes a model that could be readily replicated in other  countries or institutions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Proposes appropriate, qualified staff who have a demonstrated  ability to administer programs capably so as to accomplish stated goals  and objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Proposes an appropriate ratio of administrative to program  funds.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> Is responsive to NED suggestions with regard to program  revisions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Proposes a realistic budget that is consistent with NED  perceptions of project value and is performed within a stated and  realistic time frame; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Proposes a program that has, as one of its principal aspects, a  major impact on the role of women and/or minorities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The following guidelines also apply to all projects funded by  NED.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The proposing organization must be able to show that it is a  responsible, credible organization or group that has a serious and  demonstrable commitment to democratic values. (Various factors may be  considered in this regard: recognized democratic orientation;  established professional reputation; proven ability to perform;  existence of organization charter, board of directors, regular audits,  etc.);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The proposing organization must be willing to comply with all  provisions of the National Endowment for Democracy Act as well as all  provisions of current and subsequent agreements between the USIA and  NED;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The proposing organization must agree not to use grant funds for  the purpose of educating, training, or informing United States audiences  of any U.S. political party's policy or practice, or candidate for  office. (This condition does not exclude making grants or expenditures  for the purpose of educating, training or informing audiences of other  countries on the institutions and values of democracy that may  incidentally educate, train, or inform American participants);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The proposing organization must agree that no NED funds will be  used for lobbying or propaganda that is directed at influencing public  policy decisions of the government of the United States or of any state  or locality thereof;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The proposing organization must agree that there shall be no  expenditure of NED funds for the purpose of supporting physical violence  by individuals, groups or governments;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The proposing organization may not employ any person engaged in  intelligence activity on behalf of the   United States government or any other government;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> NED will not normally reimburse grantees for expenses incurred  prior to the signing of a grant agreement with NED;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Each grant made by NED will be an independent action implying no  future commitment on NED's part to a project or program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> NED may, from time to time, fund feasibility studies.  Applications for grants in this category should include, but not be  limited to, the following: Scope, method and objective of the study;  Calendar; Proposed administration of the study; and Detailed budget. The  funding of a feasibility study by NED does not imply support for any  project growing out of the study. It does, however, imply interest by  NED in the area under study and a willingness to entertain a project  proposal growing out of the study; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> The proposing organization may not use NED funds to finance the  campaigns of candidates for public office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> All proposals received by NED are reviewed by the staff in order  to determine their congruence with NED's purposes as stated in the  organization's Articles of Incorporation and the NED Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Grant applications must contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A one-page summary of the proposed program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Organizational background and biographical information on staff  and directors in the U.S. and abroad;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A complete project description, including a statement of  objectives, a project calendar, and a description of anticipated  results;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> A statement describing how the project relates to NED's  purposes;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> A description of the methods to be used to evaluate the project  in relation to its objectives;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> A detailed budget, including an explanation of any counterpart  support anticipated by the applicant, whether monetary or in-kind,  domestic or foreign; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> The names and addresses of all other funding organizations to  which the proposal has been submitted or will be submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> After an award determination has been made by the Board, NED  enters into a grant agreement with the recipient. That agreement is made  in accordance with NED policy, the terms of NED's grant agreement with  USIA, and the terms of the Act, and the terms of NED's standard grant  agreement as they apply to the specific project in question. The NED  Board of Directors approved a revised Statement of General Procedures  and Guidelines on September 12, 1986. The statement, outlined above, is  available from the NED office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> NED Staff welcomes preliminary letters of inquiry prior to  submission of a formal proposal. Letters of inquiry and formal proposals  should be submitted to: Director of Program, National Endowment for  Democracy 1101 15th Street, NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-5000.
