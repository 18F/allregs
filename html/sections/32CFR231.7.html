                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General policy. Given their role in promoting morale and welfare, on-base credit unions shall be recognized and assisted by DoD Components at all levels. These financial institutions shall provide services to DoD personnel of all ranks and grades within their respective fields of membership.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Establishment. A demonstrated need for credit union services may be addressed by establishing a new full-service credit union or by opening a branch office or facility of an existing credit union under the common bond principle.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> DoD personnel seeking to establish a new full-service credit union shall submit a proposal to the installation commander for review. In addition to the information identified in Sec. 231.5(b)(1), the proposal shall include a request for the establishment of a field of membership that includes all personnel at the installation. Upon installation commander concurrence, the proposal shall be forwarded through DoD Component channels to the Secretary of the Military Department (or designee).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee) shall:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Obtain a list of credit unions that could establish eligibility to serve the installation's military members and civilian employees from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) Regional Office that has geographic jurisdiction and the applicable state regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Prepare and send formal solicitation letters to eligible credit unions informing them of an opportunity to establish a branch office at the installation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> In coordination with the installation commander, establish the criteria for selection of a specific credit union in accordance with Sec. 231.5(c)(4). Proposals shall be evaluated, and a selection made, based upon the factors and weights developed for the solicitation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Upon approval by the Secretary of the Military Department (or designee), the NCUA or applicable state regulatory agency shall be notified and asked to establish or amend the selected credit union's charter to include the new location.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> No commitment may be made to a credit union regarding its proposal until the appropriate regulatory agency has approved the requested charter change.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Terminations--(1) Voluntary credit union terminations. (i) When a credit union plans to end operations on a DoD installation, it shall be required to notify the installation commander 180 days before the closing date. Such notification shall be required to precede public announcement of the planned closure. When appropriate, the commander shall attempt to negotiate an agreement permitting the credit union to continue operations until the installation has made other arrangements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Voluntary credit union terminations. (i) When a credit union plans to end operations on a DoD installation, it shall be required to notify the installation commander 180 days before the closing date. Such notification shall be required to precede public announcement of the planned closure. When appropriate, the commander shall attempt to negotiate an agreement permitting the credit union to continue operations until the installation has made other arrangements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> When a credit union plans to end operations on a DoD installation, it shall be required to notify the installation commander 180 days before the closing date. Such notification shall be required to precede public announcement of the planned closure. When appropriate, the commander shall attempt to negotiate an agreement permitting the credit union to continue operations until the installation has made other arrangements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The installation commander shall inform the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee)

immediately upon receiving notification of a closing. The report shall include a recommendation about continued credit union service on the installation. Paragraph (b) of this section applies if continued service is needed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Termination for cause. If, after discussion with credit union officials, an installation commander determines that the operating policies of a credit union are inconsistent with this Regulation, a recommendation for termination of logistical support and space arrangements may be made through the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee). A credit union shall be removed from the installation only with approval of the Secretary of the Military Department (or designee) after coordination with the USD(C) through the Director, DFAS, and the appropriate regulatory agency.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Termination in the interest of national defense. At the option of the government, leases may be terminated in the event of national emergency or as a result of installation deactivation, closing, or other disposal action.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Termination resulting from merger, acquisition, or change of control. When merger, acquisition, change of control or other action results in violation of the terms and conditions of the existing operating agreement, the Secretary of the Military Department (or designee) shall, subsequent to coordination with the USD(C), through the Director, DFAS, terminate the operating agreement with the existing credit union. When the merger, acquisition, change of control or other action does not result in violation of the terms and conditions of the existing operating agreement, the Secretary of the Military Department (or designee) shall initiate a novation action of the operating agreement identifying the change in control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Termination of lease. The lessee shall provide written notice 180 days prior to a voluntary termination of the lease. Upon lease termination, the government has the option to cause the title of all structures and other improvements to be conveyed to the United States without reimbursement, or require the lessee to remove the improvements and restore the land to its original condition.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Use of space, logistical support, and military real property for domestic credit unions--(1) Criteria for use of space in Government-owned real property. (i) Criteria governing the assignment of space and construction of new space for credit unions are in DoD 4270.1-M.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Criteria for use of space in Government-owned real property. (i) Criteria governing the assignment of space and construction of new space for credit unions are in DoD 4270.1-M.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Criteria governing the assignment of space and construction of new space for credit unions are in DoD 4270.1-M.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A credit union may be furnished space on a DoD installation at one or more locations for periods not exceeding 5 years except where the credit union uses its own funds to improve existing government space as outlined in paragraphs (d)(1)(ii)(C) and (d)(1)(ii)(D) of this section. The cumulative total of space furnished shall be subject to the limitations of DoD 4270.1-M.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The furnishing of office space (including ATM placement) to on-base credit unions is governed by section 170 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1770). The provision of no-cost office space for a period not to exceed 5 years is limited to credit unions if at least 95 percent of the membership to be served by the allotment of space is composed of individuals who are, or who were at the time of admission into the credit union, military personnel or federal employees, or members of their families. A written statement to the effect that the credit union meets the 95 percent criterion shall be required to justify and document the allotment of free government space. This statement shall be prepared on the credit union's letterhead and signed either by the chairman of the board of directors or the president. A certification also shall be required whenever there is a merger, takeover, or significant change in a field of membership. This certification shall serve as justification and documentation for the continued allocation of free government space including space renovated with credit union funds. The statement shall be updated every 5 years and on renewal of each no-cost permit or license. (See appendix C of this part for a sample format of the statement.)</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Credit unions that fail to meet the 95 percent criterion shall be charged fair market rental for space provided. Except where more than one credit union exists on an installation prior to June 9, 2000, credit unions giving less than full service or not serving

all assigned DoD personnel are not authorized no-cost office space.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> When a credit union that meets the 95 percent criterion uses its own funds to expand, modify, or renovate government-owned space, it may be provided a no-cost permit or license for a period commensurate with the extent of the improvements not to exceed 25 years as determined by the DoD Component concerned. The permit or license shall be effective until the agreed date of expiration or until the credit union ceases to satisfy the 95 percent criterion. In this latter case, the no-cost permit shall be cancelled in favor of a lease immediately negotiated at fair market value under the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(B) of this section. If the credit union desires, this permit or license may extend through the period identified in the original permit or license not to exceed 25 years.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Similarly, a credit union not meeting the 95 percent criterion that uses its own funds to expand, modify, or renovate government-owned space, may be provided a lease at fair market value for a period not to exceed 25 years subject to periodic review every 5 years to assess changes in fair market value. Duration of this lease shall be commensurate with the extent of the improvements as determined by the DoD Component concerned.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> All space assigned by the GSA, whether leased or in a federal office building, is reimbursable to the GSA at the standard level user charge. Consequently, the GSA shall charge the benefiting DoD Component for any space assigned for credit union operations. Such space is subject to the provisions of paragraph (d)(1)(i) and (ii) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Logistical support. When available, custodial and janitorial services to include garbage disposal and outdoor maintenance (such as grass cutting and snow removal), heating and air conditioning, utilities (i.e., electricity, natural gas or fuel oil, water, and sewage), fixtures, and maintenance shall be furnished without cost to credit unions occupying no-cost office space in government buildings. With the exception of intrastation telephone service, credit unions shall be required to pay for all communication services to include telephone lines, long distance data services and Internet connections. Credit unions also shall pay for space alterations. Should a credit union fail to meet the 95 percent membership criterion, any logistical support furnished shall be on a reimbursable basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Leases executed before the issuance of this part may not be altered solely as a result of the provisions of this part unless a lessee specifically requests a renegotiation under these provisions. No lease may be negotiated or renegotiated, nor may any rights be waived or surrendered without compensation to the government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> When a credit union participates in the construction of a shopping mall complex the lease shall cover only land where the branch or facility physically is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Administrative fees. All administrative fees associated with the initiation, modification, or renewal of an outgrant shall be borne by the installation, provided that the credit union satisfies the 95 percent membership criterion requirement for no-cost office space as outlined paragraph (d)(1)(ii)(A) of this section, and that the fees are associated with the no-cost space.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Land leases. Credit unions entering into a land lease to construct a building on a DoD installation shall do so in accordance with Sec. 231.5(f).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Construction. Credit unions constructing a building on a DoD installation shall do so in accordance with Sec. 231.5(g).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Credit unions offering ATM service shall do so in accordance with Sec. 231.4(d).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Staffing. (1) On-base credit unions shall provide full service. To do so, credit union offices shall be staffed by:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On-base credit unions shall provide full service. To do so, credit union offices shall be staffed by:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> An official authorized to act on loan applications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An individual authorized to sign checks; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> A qualified financial counselor available to serve members during operating hours.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Exceptions to paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section may be approved by the installation commander with advice from the Secretary of the Military Department concerned (or designee) in

the case of newly organized credit unions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> When an on-base credit union can support only minimum staffing, one of the positions required in paragraph (h)(1)(i) of this section or paragraph (h)(1)(ii) of this section also may be subsumed under the counselor duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Credit union remote service locations at the same installation may be staffed with one person alone, provided that a direct courier or an electronic or automated message service links each remote location to the credit union's main office.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Credit union liaison officer (CULO). When a credit union office is located on an installation, the commander shall appoint a CULO. As appropriate, the CULO responsibility should be assigned to comptroller or resource management personnel. The CULO's name and duty telephone number shall be displayed prominently at each credit union office on the installation. Anyone who serves as a credit union board member or in any other official credit union capacity may not serve as a CULO. The duties of a CULO are the same as the duties listed for a BLO (see Sec. 231.5(h)).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> In-store banking. In-store banking services may be provided in accordance with Sec. 231.5(i) except that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Credit unions interested in submitting proposals to provide requested in-store banking services shall provide a statement from the NCUA or applicable state regulatory agency certifying the credit union's authority to offer the requested financial services to the commissary, Military Exchange, or other on-base facilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Space granted to a credit union selected to provide in-store banking services should be issued through a no-cost license in accordance with section 170 of the Federal Credit Union Act (12 U.S.C. 1770).</p>
