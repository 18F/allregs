                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Presenting evidence. Presenting evidence at the hearing shall be limited to material evidence relevant to the issues as drawn by the pleadings or as defined in the report of prehearing conference, subject to such later modifications of the issues as may be necessary to protect the public interest or to prevent injustice, and shall not be unduly repetitious. Evidence shall be presented in such form by all parties as the administrative law judge may direct.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Objections to evidence. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objections relied upon, and the transcript shall not include argument or debate except as ordered by the administrative law judge. Rulings on such objections shall be a part of the transcript.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Exhibits. When exhibits are offered in evidence, one copy must be furnished to each of the parties at the hearing, and two copies to the administrative law judge, unless the parties previously have been furnished with copies or the administrative law judge directs otherwise. If the administrative law judge has not fixed a time for the exchange of exhibits, the parties shall exchange copies of exhibits at the earliest practicable time, preferably before the hearing or, at the latest, at the commencement of the hearing. Copies of exhibits may, at the discretion of the administrative law judge or the DOT decisionmaker, be furnished by use of electronic media in lieu of or in addition to a paper record copy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Substitution of copies for original exhibits. In his or her discretion, the administrative law judge may permit a party to withdraw original documents offered in evidence and substitute true copies in lieu thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Designation of parts of documents. When relevant and material matter offered in evidence by any party is embraced in a book, paper, or document containing other matter not material or relevant, the party offering the same shall plainly designate the matter so offered. The immaterial and irrelevant parts shall be excluded and shall be segregated insofar as practicable. If the volume of immaterial or irrelevant matter would unduly encumber the record, such submission will not be received in evidence, but may be marked for identification, and, if properly authenticated, the relevant or material matter may be read into the record, or, if the administrative law judge so directs, a true copy of such matter, in proper form, shall be received as an exhibit, and like copies delivered by the party offering the same to opposing parties or their attorneys appearing at the hearing, who shall be afforded an opportunity to examine the submission, and to offer in evidence in like manner other portions of the exhibit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Records in other proceedings. In case any portion of the record in any other proceeding or civil or criminal action is offered in evidence, a true copy of such portion shall be presented for the record in the form of an exhibit unless:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The portion is specified with particularity in such manner as to be readily identified;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The party offering the same agrees unconditionally to supply such copies later, or when required by the DOT decisionmaker;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The parties represented at the hearing stipulate upon the record that such portion may be incorporated by reference, and that any portion offered by any other party may be incorporated by like reference upon compliance with paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The administrative law judge directs such incorporation or waives the requirement in paragraph (f)(3) of this section with the consent of the parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Official notice of facts contained in certain documents. (1) Without limiting, in any manner or to any extent, the discretionary powers of the DOT decisionmaker and the administrative law judge to notice other matters or documents properly the subject of official notice, facts contained in any document within the categories enumerated in this subdivision are officially noticed in all formal economic proceedings except those subject to subpart D of this part. Each such category shall include any document antedating the final Department decision in the proceeding where such notice is taken. The matters officially noticed under the provisions of this paragraph are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Without limiting, in any manner or to any extent, the discretionary powers of the DOT decisionmaker and the administrative law judge to notice other matters or documents properly the subject of official notice, facts contained in any document within the categories enumerated in this subdivision are officially noticed in all formal economic proceedings except those subject to subpart D of this part.
