                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The detail and depth of records required as backup support for  proposals, billings, or claims shall be that which is adequate to  establish and maintain visibility of identified unallowable costs  (including directly associated costs), their accounting status in terms  of their allocability to contract cost objectives, and the cost  accounting treatment which has been accorded such costs. Adherence to  this cost accounting principle does not require that allocation of  unallowable costs to final cost objectives be made in the detailed cost  accounting records. It does require that unallowable costs be given  appropriate consideration in any cost accounting determinations  governing the content of allocation bases used for distributing indirect  costs to cost objectives. Unallowable costs involved in the  determination of rates used for standard costs, or for indirect-cost  bidding or billing, need be identified only at the time rates are  proposed, established, revised or adjusted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The visibility requirement of paragraph (a) of this  subsection, may be satisfied by any form of cost identification which is  adequate for purposes of contract cost determination and verification.  The Standard does not require such cost identification for purposes  which are not relevant to the determination of Government contract cost.  Thus, to provide visibility for incurred costs, acceptable alternative  practices would include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The segregation of unallowable costs in separate accounts  maintained for this purpose in the regular books of account,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The development and maintenance of separate accounting records  or workpapers, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The use of any less formal cost accounting techniques which  establishes and maintains adequate cost identification to permit audit  verification of the accounting recognition given unallowable costs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Educational institutions may satisfy the visibility requirements  for estimated costs either:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> By designation and description (in backup data, workpapers,  etc.) of the amounts and types of any unallowable costs which have  specifically been identified and recognized in making the estimates, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> By description of any other estimating technique employed to  provide appropriate recognition of any unallowable costs pertinent to  the estimates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Specific identification of unallowable costs is not required in  circumstances where, based upon considerations of materiality, the  Government and the educational institution reach agreement on an  alternate method that satisfies the purpose of the Standard.</p>
