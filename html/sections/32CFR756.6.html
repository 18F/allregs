                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Claims from NAFIs should be processed primarily through  procedures, regulations, and statutes applicable to similar appropriated  fund activity claims.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When the NAFI is insured. When a NAFI is insured, the insurer or  the contracted third-party claims administrator (TPA) will normally  conduct negotiations with claimants. The TCU Norfolk shall monitor the  negotiations conducted by the insurer or TPA. Monitoring is normally  limited to ascertaining that someone has been assigned to negotiate, to  obtain periodic status reports, and to close files on settled claims.  Any dissatisfaction with the insurer's or TPA's handling of the  negotiations should be referred directly to the Judge Advocate General  (Claims and Tort Litigation) for appropriate action. If requested by the  insurer or TPA, the TCU Norfolk may conduct negotiations. If TCU Norfolk  negotiates a final settlement, however, request for payment will be  forwarded to the insurer or TPA for payment. Concurrence by the insurer  or TPA in the amount of the settlement is not necessary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When the NAFI is not insured. When there is no private  commercial insurer and the NAFI has made no independent arrangements for  negotiations, the TCU Norfolk is responsible for conducting  negotiations. When an appropriate settlement is negotiated by the Navy,  the recommended award will be forwarded to the NAFI for payment from  non-appropriated funds.  [72 FR 53425, Sept. 19, 2007]</p>
