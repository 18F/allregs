The savings association must first deduct from assets and, thus, core capital the amount by which any investments in such subsidiary(ies) exceed the amount of such investments held by the savings association as of April 12, 1989. Next the savings association must deduct from assets and, thus, core capital the lesser of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The savings association's investments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary as of April 12, 1989; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The savings association's investments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary on the date as of which the savings association's capital is being determined.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> If a savings association holds a subsidiary (either directly or through a subsidiary) that is itself a domestic depository institution, the Office may, in its sole discretion upon determining that the amount of core capital that would be required would be higher if the assets and liabilities of such subsidiary were consolidated with those of the parent savings association than the amount that would be required if the parent savings association's investment were deducted pursuant to paragraphs (a)(2)(iv) and (a)(2)(v) of this section, consolidate the assets and liabilities of that subsidiary with those of the parent savings association in calculating the capital adequacy of the parent savings association, regardless of whether the subsidiary would otherwise be an includable subsidiary as defined in Sec. 567.1 of this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Deferred tax assets that are not includable in core capital pursuant to Sec. 567.12 of this part are deducted from assets and capital in computing core capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Supplementary Capital. Supplementary capital counts towards a savings association's total capital up to a maximum of 100% of the savings association's core capital.

All maturing capital instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989, are includable in supplementary capital to the extent such instruments were includable in capital pursuant to the regulations of the OTS in effect as of that date, including any applicable amortization schedules. With the prior approval of the OTS, a savings association may include maturing capital instruments issued on or before November 7, 1989, in supplementary capital in accordance with the treatment set forth in paragraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section.

A savings association issuing maturing capital instruments after November 7, 1989, may choose, subject to paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(C) of this section, to include such instruments pursuant to either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> At the beginning of each of the last five years of the life of the maturing capital instrument, the amount that is eligible to be included as supplementary capital is reduced by 20% of the original amount of that instrument (net of redemptions). \6\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\6\ Capital instruments may be redeemed prior to maturity and without the prior approval of the Office, as long as the instruments are redeemed with the proceeds of, or replaced by, a like amount of a similar or higher quality capital instrument. However, the Office must be notified in writing at least 30 days in advance of such redemption.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Only the aggregate amount of maturing capital instruments that mature in any one year during the seven years immediately prior to an instrument's maturity that does not exceed 20% of an institution's capital will qualify as supplementary capital.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Once a savings association selects either paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) or (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section for the issuance of a maturing capital instrument, it must continue to elect that option for all subsequent issuances of maturing capital instruments for as long as there is a balance outstanding of such post-November 7, 1989 issuances. Only when such issuances have all been repaid and the savings association has no balance of such issuances outstanding may the savings association elect the other option.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Allowance for loan and lease losses. Allowance for loan and lease losses established under OTS regulations and memoranda to a maximum of 1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets. \7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">\7\ The amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that may be included in capital is based on a percentage of risk-weighted assets. The gross sum of risk-weighted assets used in this calculation includes all risk-weighted assets, with the exception of assets required to be deducted under Sec. 567.6 in establishing risk-weighted assets. ``Excess reserves for loan and lease losses'' is defined as assets required to be deducted from capital under Sec. 567.5(a)(2). A savings association may deduct excess reserves for loan and lease losses from the gross sum of risk-weighted assets (i.e., risk-weighted assets including allowance for loan and lease losses) in computing the denominator of the risk-based capital standard. Thus, a savings assocation will exclude the same amount of excess allowance for loan and lease losses from both the numerator and the denominator of the risk-based capital ratio.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Unrealized gains on equity securities. Up to 45 percent of unrealized gains on available-for-sale equity securities with readily determinable fair

values may be included in supplementary capital. Unrealized gains are unrealized holding gains, net of unrealized holding losses, before income taxes, calculated as the amount, if any, by which fair value exceeds historical cost. The OTS may disallow such inclusion in the calculation of supplementary capital if the Office determines that the equity securities are not prudently valued.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Total capital. (1) A savings association's total capital equals the sum of its core capital and supplementary capital (to the extent that such supplementary capital does not exceed 100% of its core capital).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> A savings association's total capital equals the sum of its core capital and supplementary capital (to the extent that such supplementary capital does not exceed 100% of its core capital).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following assets, in addition to assets required to be deducted elsewhere in calculating core capital, are deducted from assets for purposes of determining total capital:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Reciprocal holdings of depository institution capital instruments; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> All equity investments.
