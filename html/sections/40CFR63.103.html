                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Table 3 of this subpart specifies the provisions of subpart A that apply and those that do not apply to owners and operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Initial performance tests and initial compliance determinations shall be required only as specified in subparts G and H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Performance tests and compliance determinations shall be conducted according to the schedule and procedures in Sec. 63.7(a) of subpart A of this part and the applicable sections of subparts G and H of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator shall notify the Administrator of the intention to conduct a performance test at least 30 calendar days before the performance test is scheduled to allow the Administrator the opportunity to have an observer present during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Performance tests shall be conducted according to the provisions of Sec. 63.7(e) of subpart A of this part, except that performance tests shall be conducted at maximum representative operating conditions for the process. During the performance test, an owner or operator may operate the control or recovery device at maximum or minimum representative operating conditions for monitored control or recovery device parameters, whichever results in lower emission reduction.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Data shall be reduced in accordance with the EPA-approved methods specified in the applicable subpart or, if other test methods are used, the data and methods shall be validated according to the protocol in Method 301 of appendix A of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Performance tests may be waived with approval of the Administrator as specified in Sec. 63.7(h)(2) of subpart A of this part. Owners or operators of sources subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part who apply for a waiver of a performance test shall submit the application by the dates specified in paragraph (b)(5)(i) of this section rather than the dates specified in Sec. 63.7(h)(3) of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If a request is made for an extension of compliance under Sec. 63.151(a)(6) of subpart G or Sec. 63.6(i) of subpart A of this part, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall accompany the information required for the request for an extension of compliance. If no extension of compliance is requested, the application for a waiver of an initial performance test shall be submitted no later than 90 calendar days before the Notification of Compliance Status required in Sec. 63.152(b) of subpart G of this part is due to be submitted.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Any application for a waiver of a performance test shall include information justifying the owner or operator's request for a waiver, such as the technical or economic infeasibility, or the impracticality, of the source performing the required test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The owner or operator of a flexible operation unit shall conduct all required compliance demonstrations during production of the primary product. The owner or operator is not required to conduct compliance demonstrations for operating conditions during production of a product other than the primary product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart or in subpart G or subpart H of this part, as applicable, the owner or operator shall operate each control device, recovery device, and/or recapture device that is required or used for compliance, and associated monitoring systems, without regard for whether the product that is being produced is the primary product or a different product. Except as otherwise provided in this subpart, subpart G and/or subpart H of this part, as applicable, operation of a control device, recapture device and/or recovery device required or used for compliance such that the daily average of monitored parameter values is outside the parameter range established pursuant to Sec. 63.152(b)(2), or such that the monitoring data show operation inconsistent with the monitoring plan established pursuant to Sec. 63.120(d)(2) or Sec. 63.181(g)(1)(iv), shall constitute a violation of the required operating conditions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of a source subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep copies of all applicable reports and records required by subparts F, G, and H of this part for at least 5 years; except that, if subparts G or H require records to be maintained for a time period different than 5 years, those records shall be maintained for the time specified in subpart G or H of this part. If an owner or operator submits copies of reports to the applicable EPA Regional Office, the owner or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports. If the EPA Regional Office has waived the requirement of Sec. 63.10(a)(4)(ii) for submittal of copies of reports, the owner

or operator is not required to maintain copies of reports.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All applicable records shall be maintained in such a manner that they can be readily accessed. The most recent 6 months of records shall be retained on site or shall be accessible from a central location by computer or other means that provides access within 2 hours after a request. The remaining four and one-half years of records may be retained offsite. Records may be maintained in hard copy or computer-readable form including, but not limited to, on paper, microfilm, computer, floppy disk, magnetic tape, or microfiche.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator subject to subparts F, G, and H of this part shall keep the records specified in this paragraph, as well as records specified in subparts G and H.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Records of the occurrence and duration of each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction of operation of process equipment or of air pollution control equipment or continuous monitoring systems used to comply with this subpart F, subpart G, or H of this part during which excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.102(a)(4)) occur.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each start-up, shutdown, and malfunction during which excess emissions (as defined in Sec. 63.102(a)(4)) occur, records that the procedures specified in the source's start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan were followed, and documentation of actions taken that are not consistent with the plan. For example, if a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan includes procedures for routing a control device to a backup control device (e.g., the incinerator for a halogenated stream could be routed to a flare during periods when the primary control device is out of service), records must be kept of whether the plan was followed. These records may take the form of a ``checklist,'' or other form of recordkeeping that confirms conformance with the start-up, shutdown, and malfunction plan for the event.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> For continuous monitoring systems used to comply with subpart G of this part, records documenting the completion of calibration checks and maintenance of continuous monitoring systems that are specified in the manufacturer's instructions or other written procedures that provide adequate assurance that the equipment would reasonably be expected to monitor accurately.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Records of start-up, shutdown and malfunction and continuous monitoring system calibration and maintenance are not required if they pertain solely to Group 2 emission points, as defined in Sec. 63.111 of subpart G of this part, that are not included in an emissions average.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All reports required under subparts F, G, and H of this part shall be sent to the Administrator at the addresses listed in Sec. 63.13 of subpart A of this part, except that requests for permission to use an alternative means of compliance as provided for in Sec. 63.102(b) of this subpart and application for approval of a nominal efficiency as provided for in Sec. 63.150 (i)(1) through (i)(6) of subpart G of this part shall be submitted to the Director of the EPA Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards rather than to the Administrator or delegated authority.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Wherever subpart A of this part specifies ``postmark'' dates, submittals may be sent by methods other than the U.S. Mail (e.g., by fax or courier). Submittals shall be sent on or before the specified date.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If acceptable to both the Administrator and the owner or operator of a source, reports may be submitted on electronic media.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The owner or operator of a chemical manufacturing process unit which meets the criteria of Sec. 63.100(b)(1) and Sec. 63.100(b)(3), but not the criteria of Sec. 63.100(b)(2), shall comply with the requirements of either paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Retain information, data, and analysis used to determine that the chemical manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant. Examples of information that could document this include, but are not limited to, records of chemicals purchased for the process, analyses of process stream composition, engineering calculations, or process knowledge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> When requested by the Administrator, demonstrate that the chemical

manufacturing process unit does not use as a reactant or manufacture as a product or co-product any organic hazardous air pollutant.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> To qualify for the exemption specified in Sec. 63.100(b)(4) of this subpart, the owner or operator shall maintain the documentation of the information required pursuant to Sec. 63.100(b)(4)(i), and documentation of any update of this information requested by the EPA Regional Office, and shall provide the documentation to the EPA Regional Office upon request. The EPA Regional Office will notify the owner or operator, after reviewing such documentation, if the source does not qualify for the exemption specified in Sec. 63.100(b)(4) of this section. In such cases, compliance with subpart H shall be required no later than 90 days after expiration of the applicable compliance date in Sec. 63.100(k)(3), but in no event earlier than 90 days after the date of such notification by the EPA Regional Office. Compliance with this subpart F and subpart G of this part shall be no later than April 22, 1997, or as otherwise specified in Sec. 63.100(k)(2)(ii) of this subpart, unless an extension has been granted by the EPA Regional Office or permitting authority as provided in Sec. 63.6(i) of subpart A of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An owner or operator who elects to use the compliance extension provisions of Sec. 63.100(k)(6)(i) or (ii) shall submit a compliance extension request to the appropriate EPA Regional Office no later than 45 days before the applicable compliance date in Sec. 63.100(k)(3), but in no event is submittal required earlier than May 10, 1995. The request shall contain the information specified in Sec. 63.100(k)(5)(iv) and the reason compliance can not reasonably be achieved without a process unit shutdown, as defined in 40 CFR 63.161 or without replacement of the compressor or recasting of the distance piece.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> An owner or operator who elects to use the compliance extension provisions of Sec. 63.100(k)(8) shall submit to the appropriate EPA Regional Office a brief description of the process change, identify the HAP eliminated, and the expected date of cessation of use or production of HAP. The description shall be submitted no later than May 10, 1995, or with the Notice of Compliance Status as required in Sec. 63.182(c) of subpart H, whichever is later.
