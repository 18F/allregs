                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must  have a door or other physical barrier to prevent inadvertent entry of  personnel if the sources are not in the shielded   position. Product conveyor systems may serve as barriers as long as they  reliably and consistently function as a barrier. It must not be possible  to move the sources out of their shielded position if the door or  barrier is open. Opening the door or barrier while the sources are  exposed must cause the sources to return promptly to their shielded  position. The personnel entrance door or barrier must have a lock that  is operated by the same key used to move the sources. The doors and  barriers must not prevent any individual in the radiation room from  leaving.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In addition, each entrance to a radiation room at a panoramic  irradiator must have an independent backup access control to detect  personnel entry while the sources are exposed. Detection of entry while  the sources are exposed must cause the sources to return to their fully  shielded position and must also activate a visible and audible alarm to  make the individual entering the room aware of the hazard. The alarm  must also alert at least one other individual who is onsite of the  entry. That individual shall be trained on how to respond to the alarm  and prepared to promptly render or summon assistance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A radiation monitor must be provided to detect the presence of  high radiation levels in the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator  before personnel entry. The monitor must be integrated with personnel  access door locks to prevent room access when radiation levels are high.  Attempted personnel entry while the monitor measures high radiation  levels, must activate the alarm described in paragraph (b) of this  section. The monitor may be located in the entrance (normally referred  to as the maze) but not in the direct radiation beam.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Before the sources move from their shielded position in a  panoramic irradiator, the source control must automatically activate  conspicuous visible and audible alarms to alert people in the radiation  room that the sources will be moved from their shielded position. The  alarms must give individuals enough time to leave the room before the  sources leave the shielded position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Each radiation room at a panoramic irradiator must have a  clearly visible and readily accessible control that would allow an  individual in the room to make the sources return to their fully  shielded position.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Each radiation room of a panoramic irradiator must contain a  control that prevents the sources from moving from the shielded position  unless the control has been activated and the door or barrier to the  radiation room has been closed within a preset time after activation of  the control.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Each entrance to the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator  and each entrance to the area within the personnel access barrier of an  underwater irradiator must be posted as required by 10 CFR 20.1902.  Radiation postings for panoramic irradiators must comply with the  posting requirements of 10 CFR 20.1902, except that signs may be  removed, covered, or otherwise made inoperative when the sources are  fully shielded.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> If the radiation room of a panoramic irradiator has roof plugs  or other movable shielding, it must not be possible to operate the  irradiator unless the shielding is in its proper location. This  requirement may be met by interlocks that prevent operation if shielding  is not placed properly or by an operating procedure requiring inspection  of shielding before operating.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Underwater irradiators must have a personnel access barrier  around the pool which must be locked to prevent access when the  irradiator is not attended. Only operators and facility management may  have access to keys to the personnel access barrier. There must be an  intrusion alarm to detect unauthorized entry when the personnel access  barrier is locked. Activation of the intrusion alarm must alert an  individual (not necessarily onsite) who is prepared to respond or summon  assistance.
