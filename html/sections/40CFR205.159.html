He may designate the quantity of vehicles and the duration of time he reasonably requires for the purpose of conducting tests in accordance with test procedures described in appendix I. The manner in which the Administrator conducts such tests, the EPA test facility, and the test procedures employed will be based upon good engineering practice and meet or exceed the requirements of appendix I of the regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In order for the Administrator to determine whether such vehicles or a manufacturer's test facility conform to applicable regulations, the Administrator may require that vehicles to be tested pursuant to the Act be submitted to him, at such place and time as he reasonably designates. He may designate the quantity of vehicles and the duration of time he reasonably requires for the purpose of conducting tests in accordance with test procedures described in appendix I. The manner in which the Administrator conducts such tests, the EPA test facility, and the test procedures employed will be based upon good engineering practice and meet or exceed the requirements of appendix I of the regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrator specifies that he will conduct such testing at the manufacturer's facility, the manufacturer shall make available instrumentation and equipment of the type required for test operations by these regulations. The Administrator may conduct such tests with his own equipment, having specifications equal to or exceeding the performance specifications of the instrumentation and equipment required in these regulations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The manufacturer may observe tests conducted by the Administrator pursuant to this section on vehicles produced by the manufacturer and may copy the data accumulated from such tests. The manufacturer may inspect any of the vehicles before and after testing by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> If, based on tests conducted by the Administrator, or on other relevant information, the Administrator determines that the test facility does not meet the requirements of appendix I (or the requirements for an alternative test procedure approved under Sec. 205.154), the Administrator will give notice to the manufacturer in writing of his determination and the reasons underlying it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If, based on tests conducted by the Administrator, or on other relevant information, the Administrator determines that the test facility does not meet the requirements of appendix I (or the requirements for an alternative test procedure approved under Sec. 205.154), the Administrator will give notice to the manufacturer in writing of his determination and the reasons underlying it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The manufacturer may, at any time within 15 days after receipt of a notice issued under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, request a hearing conducted in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 554 on the issue of whether his test facility met the requirements as specified in appendix I (or the alternative procedure). Such notice will not take effect until 15 days after its receipt by the manufacturer or, if a hearing is requested under this paragraph, until adjudication by the Administrative law judge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After any notice issued under paragraph (b)(1) of this section has taken effect, no data thereafter derived from that test facility will be acceptable for purposes of this subpart.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The manufacturer may request in writing that the Administrator reconsider his determination under paragraph (b)(1) of this section based on data or information which indicates that changes have been made to the test facility and that those changes have resolved the reasons for disqualification.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Within 10 working days after receipt of the manufacturer's request for reconsideration pursuant to paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the Administrator will notify the manufacturer of his determination and of the reasons underlyng it with regard to the requalification of the test facility.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Administrator will assume all reasonable costs associated with shipment of vehicles to the place designated pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section except with respect to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any production verification testing performed at a place other than the manufacturer's facility as provided in Sec. 205.157-2(a), or as a result of the manufacturer's not owning or having access to a test facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Testing of a reasonable number of vehicles (i) for purposes of selective enforcement auditing under Sec. 205.160, (ii) or if the manufacturer has failed to establish that there is a correlation between its test facility and the EPA test facility, (iii) or the Administrator has reason to believe, and provides the manufacturer with a statement of such reason, that the vehicles to be tested would fail to meet the standard prescribed in this subpart if tested at the EPA test facility even though they would meet such standard if tested at the manufacturer's test facility;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Any testing performed during a period when a notice issued pursuant to paragraph (b) of this section is in effect;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Any testing performed at a place other than the manufacturer's facility as a result of the manufacturer's failure to permit the Administrator to conduct or monitor testing as required by this subpart; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Testing of up to 10 percent of the manufacturer's test vehicles for a model year if the Administrator determines testing these vehicles at the EPA test site is necessary to assure that a manufacturer has acted or is acting in compliance with the Act.
