                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of investigations; limitation. Except as permitted under  Sec. 11.14, the Commission will conduct an investigation to obtain  information for establishing headwater benefits charges under this  subpart. The Commission will investigate and determine charges for a  project downstream from a non-Federal headwater project only if the  parties are unable to agree to a settlement and one of the parties  requests the Commission to determine charges.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Notification. The Commission will notify each downstream project  owner and each headwater project owner when it initiates an  investigation under this section, and the period of project operations  to be studied will be specified. An investigation will continue until a  final charge has been established for all years studied in the  investigation.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Jurisdictional objections. If any project owner wishes to object  to the assessment of a headwater benefits charge on jurisdictional  grounds, such objection must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be raised within 30 days after the notice of the investigation  is issued; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> State in detail the grounds for its objection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Investigations. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For any downstream project for which a final  charge pursuant to an investigation has never been established, the  Commission will conduct an initial investigation to determine a final  charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Commission may, for good cause shown by a party or on its  own motion, initiate a new investigation of a river basin to determine  whether, because of any change in the hydrology, project development, or  other characteristics of the river basin that effects headwater  benefits, it should:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Establish a new final charge to replace a final charge  previously established under Sec. 11.17(b)(5); or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Revise any variable of the headwater benefits formula that has  become a constant in calculating a final charge.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Scope of investigations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The Commission will establish a  final charge pursuant to an investigation based on information available  to the Commission through the annual data submission requirements of  Sec. 11.16, if such information is adequate to establish a reasonably  accurate final charge.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the information available to the Commission is not  sufficient to provide a reasonably accurate calculation of the final  charge, the Commission will request additional data and conduct any  studies, including studies   of the hydrology of the river basin and project operations, that it  determines necessary to establish the charge.</p>
