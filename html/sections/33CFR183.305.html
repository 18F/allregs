                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For the purpose of this section, a boat is level when it is  supported on its keel at the two points shown in Figure 2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> As used in this subpart, the term ``passenger carrying area''  means each area in a boat in which persons can sit in a normal sitting  position or stand while the boat is in operation. Passenger carrying  areas are illustrated in Figures 3 through 8.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The length of each passenger carrying area is the distance along  the centerline of the boat between two vertical lines, one at the  forward end and one at the aft end of the passenger carrying area, when  the boat is level, as illustrated in Figures 3 and 4. For boats with a  curved stem inside the passenger carrying area, the forward vertical  line is where a line 45 degrees to the horizontal when the boat is level  is tangent to the curve of the stem, as illustrated in Figure 5. For  boats with cabins, the forward vertical line is where there is a minimum  distance of two feet between the inside top of the cabin and the water  line formed when the boat is swamped and loaded with weights under  Sec. 183.320 as illustrated in Figure 6.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The breadth of the passenger carrying area is the distance  beteen two vertical lines at the mid-length, excluding consoles, of the  passenger carrying area when the boat is level as illustrated in Figures  7 and 8. For boats with round chines inside the passenger carrying area,  the vertical line is where a transverse line 45 degrees to the  horizontal is tangent to the arc of the chine, as illustrated in Figure  7.
