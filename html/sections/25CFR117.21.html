All fees will be determined on a  quantum merit basis and paid upon completion of the services. The  superintendent may approve the employment of an attorney, determine the  fee, and disburse the surplus funds of the Indian in payment thereof  when the fee does not exceed $500. Upon application by the Indian and  upon the presentation of properly authenticated vouchers, the  superintendent may disburse the surplus funds of the Indian in an amount  not to exceed $200 in payment of necessary expenses incurred by the  attorney.</p>
