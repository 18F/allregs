                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Scope. (1) This standard applies to occupational exposures to chromium (VI) in all forms and compounds in shipyards, marine terminals, and longshoring, except:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Exposures that occur in the application of pesticides regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency or another Federal government agency (e.g., the treatment of wood with preservatives);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Exposures to portland cement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Where the employer has objective data demonstrating that a material containing chromium or a specific process, operation, or activity involving chromium cannot release dusts, fumes, or mists of chromium (VI) in concentrations at or above 0.5 [micro]gm/m\3\ as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) under any expected conditions of use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following definitions apply:</p><p class="depth0">Action level means a concentration of airborne chromium (VI) of 2.5 micrograms per cubic meter of air (2.5

[micro]gm/m\3\) calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA).</p><p class="depth0">Assistant Secretary means the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Occupational Safety and Health, U.S. Department of Labor, or designee.</p><p class="depth0">Chromium (VI) [hexavalent chromium or Cr(VI)] means chromium with a valence of positive six, in any form and in any compound.</p><p class="depth0">Director means the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or designee.</p><p class="depth0">Emergency means any occurrence that results, or is likely to result, in an uncontrolled release of chromium (VI). If an incidental release of chromium (VI) can be controlled at the time of release by employees in the immediate release area, or by maintenance personnel, it is not an emergency.</p><p class="depth0">Employee exposure means the exposure to airborne chromium (VI) that would occur if the employee were not using a respirator.</p><p class="depth0">High-efficiency particulate air [HEPA] filter means a filter that is at least 99.97 percent efficient in removing mono-dispersed particles of 0.3 micrometers in diameter or larger.</p><p class="depth0">Historical monitoring data means data from chromium (VI) monitoring conducted prior to May 30, 2006, obtained during work operations conducted under workplace conditions closely resembling the processes, types of material, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions in the employer's current operations.</p><p class="depth0">Objective data means information such as air monitoring data from industry-wide surveys or calculations based on the composition or chemical and physical properties of a substance demonstrating the employee exposure to chromium (VI) associated with a particular product or material or a specific process, operation, or activity. The data must reflect workplace conditions closely resembling the processes, types of material, control methods, work practices, and environmental conditions in the employer's current operations.</p><p class="depth0">Physician or other licensed health care professional [PLHCP] is an individual whose legally permitted scope of practice (i.e., license, registration, or certification) allows him or her to independently provide or be delegated the responsibility to provide some or all of the particular health care services required by paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0">This section means this Sec. 1915.1026 chromium (VI) standard.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Permissible exposure limit (PEL). The employer shall ensure that no employee is exposed to an airborne concentration of chromium (VI) in excess of 5 micrograms per cubic meter of air (5 [micro]gm/m\3\), calculated as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Exposure determination--(1) General. Each employer who has a workplace or work operation covered by this section shall determine the 8-hour TWA exposure for each employee exposed to chromium (VI). This determination shall be made in accordance with either paragraph (d)(2) or paragraph (d)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Scheduled monitoring option. (i) The employer shall perform initial monitoring to determine the 8-hour TWA exposure for each employee on the basis of a sufficient number of personal breathing zone air samples to accurately characterize full shift exposure on each shift, for each job classification, in each work area. Where an employer does representative sampling instead of sampling all employees in order to meet this requirement, the employer shall sample the employee(s) expected to have the highest chromium (VI) exposures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> If initial monitoring indicates that employee exposures are below the action level, the employer may discontinue monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> If monitoring reveals employee exposures to be at or above the action level, the employer shall perform periodic monitoring at least every six months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> If monitoring reveals employee exposures to be above the PEL, the employer shall perform periodic monitoring at least every three months.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> If periodic monitoring indicates that employee exposures are below the action level, and the result is confirmed by the result of another monitoring taken at least seven days later,

the employer may discontinue the monitoring for those employees whose exposures are represented by such monitoring.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The employer shall perform additional monitoring when there has been any change in the production process, raw materials, equipment, personnel, work practices, or control methods that may result in new or additional exposures to chromium (VI), or when the employer has any reason to believe that new or additional exposures have occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Performance-oriented option. The employer shall determine the 8-hour TWA exposure for each employee on the basis of any combination of air monitoring data, historical monitoring data, or objective data sufficient to accurately characterize employee exposure to chromium (VI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Employee notification of determination results. (i) Within 5 work days after making an exposure determination in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) or paragraph (d)(3) of this section, the employer shall individually notify each affected employee in writing of the results of that determination or post the results in an appropriate location accessible to all affected employees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Whenever the exposure determination indicates that employee exposure is above the PEL, the employer shall describe in the written notification the corrective action being taken to reduce employee exposure to or below the PEL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Accuracy of measurement. Where air monitoring is performed to comply with the requirements of this section, the employer shall use a method of monitoring and analysis that can measure chromium (VI) to within an accuracy of plus or minus 25 percent (25%) and can produce accurate measurements to within a statistical confidence level of 95 percent for airborne concentrations at or above the action level.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Observation of monitoring. (i) Where air monitoring is performed to comply with the requirements of this section, the employer shall provide affected employees or their designated representatives an opportunity to observe any monitoring of employee exposure to chromium (VI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> When observation of monitoring requires entry into an area where the use of protective clothing or equipment is required, the employer shall provide the observer with clothing and equipment and shall assure that the observer uses such clothing and equipment and complies with all other applicable safety and health procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Methods of compliance--(1) Engineering and work practice controls. (i) Except as permitted in paragraph (e)(1)(ii) of this section, the employer shall use engineering and work practice controls to reduce and maintain employee exposure to chromium (VI) to or below the PEL unless the employer can demonstrate that such controls are not feasible. Wherever feasible engineering and work practice controls are not sufficient to reduce employee exposure to or below the PEL, the employer shall use them to reduce employee exposure to the lowest levels achievable, and shall supplement them by the use of respiratory protection that complies with the requirements of paragraph (f) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Where the employer can demonstrate that a process or task does not result in any employee exposure to chromium (VI) above the PEL for 30 or more days per year (12 consecutive months), the requirement to implement engineering and work practice controls to achieve the PEL does not apply to that process or task.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Prohibition of rotation. The employer shall not rotate employees to different jobs to achieve compliance with the PEL.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Respiratory protection--(1) General. Where respiratory protection is required by this section, the employer must provide each employee an appropriate respirator that complies with the requirements of this paragraph. Respiratory protection is required during:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Periods necessary to install or implement feasible engineering and work practice controls;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Work operations, such as maintenance and repair activities, for which engineering and work practice controls are not feasible;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Work operations for which an employer has implemented all feasible engineering and work practice controls

and such controls are not sufficient to reduce exposures to or below the PEL;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Work operations where employees are exposed above the PEL for fewer than 30 days per year, and the employer has elected not to implement engineering and work practice controls to achieve the PEL; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Emergencies.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Respiratory protection program. Where respirator use is required by this section, the employer shall institute a respiratory protection program in accordance with Sec. 1910.134, which covers each employee required to use a respirator.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Protective work clothing and equipment--(1) Provision and use. Where a hazard is present or is likely to be present from skin or eye contact with chromium (VI), the employer shall provide appropriate personal protective clothing and equipment at no cost to employees, and shall ensure that employees use such clothing and equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Removal and storage. (i) The employer shall ensure that employees remove all protective clothing and equipment contaminated with chromium (VI) at the end of the work shift or at the completion of their tasks involving chromium (VI) exposure, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall ensure that no employee removes chromium (VI)-contaminated protective clothing or equipment from the workplace, except for those employees whose job it is to launder, clean, maintain, or dispose of such clothing or equipment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> When contaminated protective clothing or equipment is removed for laundering, cleaning, maintenance, or disposal, the employer shall ensure that it is stored and transported in sealed, impermeable bags or other closed, impermeable containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The employer shall ensure that bags or containers of contaminated protective clothing or equipment that are removed from change rooms for laundering, cleaning, maintenance, or disposal are labeled in accordance with the requirements of the Hazard Communication Standard, Sec. 1910.1200.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Cleaning and replacement.

Where protective clothing and equipment is required, the employer shall provide change rooms in conformance with 29 CFR 1910.141. Where skin contact with chromium (VI) occurs, the employer shall provide washing facilities in conformance with 29 CFR 1915.97. Eating and drinking areas provided by the employer shall also be in conformance with Sec. 1915.97.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Change rooms. The employer shall assure that change rooms are equipped with separate storage facilities for protective clothing and equipment and for street clothes, and that these facilities prevent cross-contamination.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Washing facilities. (i) The employer shall provide readily accessible washing facilities capable of removing chromium (VI) from the skin, and shall ensure that affected employees use these facilities when necessary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall ensure that employees who have skin contact with chromium (VI) wash their hands and faces at the end of the work shift and prior to eating, drinking, smoking, chewing tobacco or gum, applying cosmetics, or using the toilet.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Eating and drinking areas. (i) Whenever the employer allows employees to consume food or beverages at a worksite where chromium (VI) is present, the employer shall ensure that eating and drinking areas and surfaces are maintained as free as practicable of chromium (VI).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall ensure that employees do not enter eating and drinking areas with protective work clothing or equipment unless surface chromium (VI) has been removed from the clothing and equipment by methods that do not disperse chromium (VI) into the air or onto an employee's body.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prohibited activities. The employer shall ensure that employees do not eat, drink, smoke, chew tobacco or gum, or apply cosmetics in areas where skin or eye contact with chromium (VI) occurs; or carry the products associated with these activities, or store such products in these areas.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Medical surveillance--(1) General. (i) The employer shall make medical surveillance available at no cost to the employee, and at a reasonable time and place, for all employees:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Who are or may be occupationally exposed to chromium (VI) at or above the action level for 30 or more days a year;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Experiencing signs or symptoms of the adverse health effects associated with chromium (VI) exposure; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Exposed in an emergency.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The employer shall assure that all medical examinations and procedures required by this section are performed by or under the supervision of a PLHCP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Frequency.
