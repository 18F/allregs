                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Remedies for noncompliance. If a grantee or subgrantee materially fails to comply with any term of an award, whether stated in a Federal statute or regulation, an assurance, in a State plan or application, a notice of award, or elsewhere, the awarding agency may take one or more of the following actions, as appropriate in the circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Temporarily withhold cash payments pending correction of the deficiency by the grantee or subgrantee or more severe enforcement action by the awarding agency,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disallow (that is, deny both use of funds and matching credit for) all or part of the cost of the activity or action not in compliance,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Wholly or partly suspend or terminate the current award for the grantee's or subgrantee's program,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Withhold further awards for the program, or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Take other remedies that may be legally available.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hearings, appeals. In taking an enforcement action, the awarding agency will provide the grantee or subgrantee an opportunity for such hearing, appeal, or other administrative proceeding to which the grantee or subgrantee is entitled under any statute or regulation applicable to the action involved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effects of suspension and termination. Costs of grantee or subgrantee resulting from obligations incurred by the grantee or subgrantee during a suspension or after termination of an award are not allowable unless the awarding agency expressly authorizes them in the notice of suspension or termination or subsequently. Other grantee or subgrantee costs during suspension or after termination which are necessary and not reasonably avoidable are allowable if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The costs result from obligations which were properly incurred by the grantee or subgrantee before the effective date of suspension or termination,

are not in anticipation of it, and, in the case of a termination, are noncancellable, and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The costs would be allowable if the award were not suspended or expired normally at the end of the funding period in which the termination takes effect.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Relationship to debarment and suspension. The enforcement remedies identified in this section, including suspension and termination, do not preclude grantee or subgrantee from being subject to ``Debarment and Suspension'' under E.O. 12549 (see Sec. 33.35).
