                                Sec. 121.106  How does SBA calculate number of employees?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In determining a concern's number of employees, SBA counts all  individuals employed on a full-time, part-time, or other basis. This  includes employees obtained from a temporary employee agency,  professional employee organization or leasing concern. SBA will consider  the totality of the circumstances, including criteria used by the IRS  for Federal income tax purposes, in determining whether individuals are  employees of a concern. Volunteers (i.e., individuals who receive no  compensation, including no in-kind compensation, for work performed) are  not considered employees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Where the size standard is number of employees, the method for  determining a concern's size includes the following principles:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The average number of employees of the concern is used  (including the employees of its domestic and foreign affiliates) based  upon numbers of employees for each of the pay periods for the preceding  completed 12 calendar months.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Part-time and temporary employees are counted the same as full- time employees.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If a concern has not been in business for 12 months, the average  number of employees is used for each of the pay periods during which it  has been in business.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average number of employees of a business concern with  affiliates is calculated by adding the average number of employees of  the business concern with the average number of employees of each  affiliate. If a concern has acquired an affiliate or been acquired as an  affiliate during the applicable period of measurement or before the date  on which it self-certified as small, the employees counted in  determining size status include the employees of the acquired or  acquiring concern. Furthermore, this aggregation applies for the entire  period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The employees of a former affiliate are not counted if  affiliation ceased before the date used for determining size. This  exclusion of employees of a former affiliate applies during   the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after  which affiliation ceased.  [61 FR 3286, Jan. 31, 1996, as amended at 69 FR 29203, May 21, 2004]</p>
