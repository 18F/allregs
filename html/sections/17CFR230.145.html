                                Sec. 230.145  Reclassification of securities, mergers, consolidations
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Preliminary Note: Rule 145 (Sec. 230.145 of this chapter) is  designed to make available the protection provided by registration under  the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (Act), to persons who are offered  securities in a business combination of the type described in paragraphs  (a) (1), (2) and (3) of the rule. The thrust of the rule is that an  offer, offer to sell, offer for sale, or sale occurs when there is  submitted to security holders a plan or agreement pursuant to which such  holders are required to elect, on the basis of what is in substance a  new investment decision, whether to accept a new or different security  in exchange for their existing security. Rule 145 embodies the  Commission's determination that such transactions are subject to the  registration requirements of the Act, and that the previously existing  no-sale theory of Rule 133 is no longer consistent with the   statutory purposes of the Act. See Release No. 33-5316 (October 6, 1972)  [37 FR 23631]. Securities issued in transactions described in paragraph  (a) of Rule 145 may be registered on Form S-4 or F-4 (Sec. 239.25 or  Sec. 239.34 of this chapter) or Form N-14 (Sec. 239.23 of this  chapter) under the Act.</p><p class="depth0">Transactions for which statutory exemptions under the Act, including  those contained in sections 3(a)(9), (10), (11) and 4(2), are otherwise  available are not affected by Rule 145. Reference is made to Rule 153a  (Sec. 230.153a of this chapter) describing the prospectus delivery  required in a transaction of the type referred to in Rule 145. A  reclassification of securities covered by Rule 145 would be exempt from  registration pursuant to section 3(a)(9) or (11) of the Act if the  conditions of either of these sections are satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Transactions within this section. An offer, offer to sell, offer  for sale, or sale shall be deemed to be involved, within the meaning of  section 2(3) of the Act, so far as the security holders of a corporation  or other person are concerned where, pursuant to statutory provisions of  the jurisdiction under which such corporation or other person is  organized, or pursuant to provisions contained in its certificate of  incorporation or similar controlling instruments, or otherwise, there is  submitted for the vote or consent of such security holders a plan or  agreement for:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Reclassifications. A reclassification of securities of such  corporation or other person, other than a stock split, reverse stock  split, or change in par value, which involves the substitution of a  security for another security;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mergers of consolidations. A statutory merger or consolidation  or similar plan or acquisition in which securities of such corporation  or other person held by such security holders will become or be  exchanged for securities of any person, unless the sole purpose of the  transaction is to change an issuer's domicile solely within the United  States; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Transfers of assets. A transfer of assets of such corporation or  other person, to another person in consideration of the issuance of  securities of such other person or any of its affiliates, if:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such plan or agreement provides for dissolution of the  corporation or other person whose security holders are voting or  consenting; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such plan or agreement provides for a pro rata or similar  distribution of such securities to the security holders voting or  consenting; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The board of directors or similar representatives of such  corporation or other person, adopts resolutions relative to paragraph  (a)(3) (i) or (ii) of this section within 1 year after the taking of  such vote or consent; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The transfer of assets is a part of a preexisting plan for  distribution of such securities, notwithstanding paragraph (a)(3) (i),  (ii), or (iii) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Communications before a Registration Statement is filed.  Communications made in connection with or relating to a transaction  described in paragraph (a) of this section that will be registered under  the Act may be made under Sec. 230.135, Sec. 230.165 or Sec. 230.166.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Persons and parties deemed to be underwriters. For purposes of  this section, if any party to a transaction specified in paragraph (a)  of this section is a shell company, other than a business combination  related shell company, as those terms are defined in Sec. 230.405, any  party to that transaction, other than the issuer, or any person who is  an affiliate of such party at the time such transaction is submitted for  vote or consent, who publicly offers or sells securities of the issuer  acquired in connection with any such transaction, shall be deemed to be  engaged in a distribution and therefore to be an underwriter thereof  within the meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Resale provisions for persons and parties deemed underwriters.  Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (c), a person or party  specified in that paragraph shall not be deemed to be engaged in a  distribution and therefore not to be an underwriter of securities  acquired in a transaction specified in paragraph (a) that was registered  under the Act if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The issuer has met the requirements applicable to an issuer of  securities in paragraph (i)(2) of Sec. 230.144; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> One of the following three conditions is met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Such securities are sold by such person or party in accordance  with the   provisions of paragraphs (c), (e), (f), and (g) of Sec. 230.144 and at  least 90 days have elapsed since the date the securities were acquired  from the issuer in such transaction; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Such person or party is not, and has not been for at least  three months, an affiliate of the issuer, and at least six months, as  determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 230.144, have  elapsed since the date the securities were acquired from the issuer in  such transaction, and the issuer meets the requirements of paragraph (c)  of Sec. 230.144; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Such person or party is not, and has not been for at least  three months, an affiliate of the issuer, and at least one year, as  determined in accordance with paragraph (d) of Sec. 230.144, has  elapsed since the date the securities were acquired from the issuer in  such transaction.</p><p class="depth4">Note to Sec. 230.145(c) and (d):</p><p class="depth4">Paragraph (d) is not available with respect to any transaction or  series of transactions that, although in technical compliance with the  rule, is part of a plan or scheme to evade the registration requirements  of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The term affiliate as used in paragraphs (c)  and (d) of this section shall have the same meaning as the definition of  that term in Sec. 230.144.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The term party as used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section  shall mean the corporations, business entities, or other persons, other  than the issuer, whose assets or capital structure are affected by the  transactions specified in paragraph (a) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The term person as used in paragraphs (c) and (d) of this  section, when used in reference to a person for whose account securities  are to be sold, shall have the same meaning as the definition of that  term in paragraph (a)(2) of Sec. 230.144.
