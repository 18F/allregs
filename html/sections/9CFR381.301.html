                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Examination and cleaning of empty containers. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Empty  containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock shall be evaluated  by the establishment to ensure that they are clean and free of  structural defects and damage that may affect product or container  integrity. Such an examination should be based upon a statistical  sampling plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> All empty containers, closures, and flexible pouch roll stock  shall be stored, handled, and conveyed in such a manner that will  prevent soiling and damage that could affect the hermetic condition of  the sealed container.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Just before filling, rigid containers shall be cleaned to  prevent incorporation of foreign matter into the finished product.  Closures, semirigid containers, preformed flexible pouches, and flexible  pouch roll stock contained in original wrappings do not need to be  cleaned before use.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Closure examinations for rigid containers (cans). </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Visual  examinations. A closure technician shall visually examine the double  seams formed by each closing machine head. When seam defects (e.g.,  cutovers, sharpness, knocked down flanges, false seams, droops) are  observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing  the closing machine, shall be taken. In addition to the double seams,  the entire container shall be examined for product leakage or obvious  defects. A visual examination shall be performed on at least one  container from each closing machine head, and the observations, along  with any corrective actions, shall be recorded. Visual examinations  shall be recorded. Visual examinations shall be conducted with  sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure and should be conducted at  least every 30 minutes of continuous closing machine operation.  Additional visual examinations shall be made by the closure technician  at the beginning   of production, immediately following every jam in the closing machine  and after closing machine adjustment (including adjustment for changes  in container size).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Teardown examinations. Teardown examinations of double seams  formed by each closing machine head shall be performed by a closure  technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure. These  examinations should be made at intervals of not more than 4 hours of  continuous closing machine operation. At least one container from each  closing head shall be examined on the packer's end during each regular  examination period. Examination results along with any necessary  corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine,  shall be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment  shall have container specification guidelines for double seam integrity  on file and available for review by Program employees. A teardown  examination of the can maker's end shall be performed on at least one  container selected from each closing machine during each examination  period except when teardown examinations are made on incoming empty  containers or when, in the case of self-manufactured containers, the  containers are made in the vicinity of the establishment and the  container plant records are made available to Program employees.  Additional teardown examinations on the packer's end should be made at  the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in a  closing machine and after closing machine adjustment (including  adjustment for a change in container size). The following procedures  shall be used in teardown examinations of double seams:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> One of the following two methods shall be employed for  dimensional measurements of the double seam.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Micrometer measurement. For cylindrical containers, measure the  following dimensions (Figure 1) at three points approximately 120  degrees apart on the double seam excluding and at least one-half inch  from the side seam juncture:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Double seam length--W;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Double seam thickness--S;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Body hook length--BH; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Cover hook length--CH.  Maximum and minimum values for each dimensional measurement shall be  recorded by the closure technician. [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TC11SE91.046</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Seamscope or seam projector. Required measurements of the seam  include thickness, body hook, and overlap. Seam thickness shall be  obtained by micrometer. For cylindrical containers, at least two  locations, excluding the side seam juncture, shall be used to obtain the  required measurements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Seam tightness. Regardless of the dimensional measurement  method used to measure seam dimensions, at a minimum, the seam(s)  examined shall be stripped to assess the degree of wrinkling.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Side seam juncture rating. Regardless of the dimensional  measurement method used to measure seam dimensions, the cover hook shall  be stripped to examine the cover hook droop at the juncture for  containers having side seams.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Examination of noncylindrical containers. Examination of  noncylindrical containers (e.g., square, rectangular, ``D''-shaped, and  irregularly-shaped) shall be conducted as described in paragraphs (b)(2)  (i), (ii), and (iii) of this section except that the required  dimensional measurements shall be made on the double seam at the points  listed in   the establishment's container specification guidelines.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Closure examinations for glass containers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Visual  examinations. A closure technician shall visually assess the adequacy of  the closures formed by each closing machine. When closure defects, such  as loose or cocked caps, fractured or cracked containers and low vacuum  jars, are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or  repairing the closing machine, shall be taken and recorded. In addition  to the closures, the entire container shall be examined for defects.  Visual examinations shall be made with sufficient frequency to ensure  proper closure and should be conducted at least every 30 minutes of  continuous closing machine operation. Additional visual examinations  shall be made by the closure technician and the observations recorded at  the beginning of production, immediately following every jam in the  closing machine, and after closing machine adjustment (including  adjustment for a change in container size).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Closure examinations and tests. Depending upon the container and  closure, tests shall be performed by a closure technician at a frequency  sufficient to ensure proper closure. These examinations should be made  either before or after thermal processing and at intervals of not more  than 4 hours of continuous closing machine operation. At least one  container from each closing machine shall be examined during each  regular examination period. Examination results along with any necessary  corrective actions, such as adjusting or repairing the closing machine,  shall be promptly recorded by the closure technician. The establishment  shall have specification guidelines for closure integrity on file and  available for review by Program employees. Additional closure  examinations should be made at the beginning of production, immediately  following every jam in the closing machine and after closing machine  adjustment (including adjustment for a change in container size).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Closure examinations for semirigid and flexible containers--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em>  Heat seals--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Visual examinations. A closure technician shall visually  examine the seals formed by each sealing machine. When sealing defects  are observed, necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or  repairing the sealing machine, shall be taken and recorded. In addition  to examining the heat seals, the entire container shall be examined for  product leakage or obvious defects. Visual examinations shall be  performed before and after the thermal processing operation with  sufficient frequency to ensure proper closure. These examinations should  be conducted at least in accordance with a statistical sampling plan.  All defects noted and corrective actions taken shall be promptly  recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Physical tests. Tests determined by the establishment as  necessary to assess container integrity shall be conducted by the  closure technician at a frequency sufficient to ensure proper closure.  These tests shall be performed after the thermal processing operation  and should be made at least every 2 hours of continuous production. The  establishment's acceptance guidelines for each test procedure shall be  on file and available for review by Program employees. Test results  along with any necessary corrective actions, such as adjusting or  repairing the sealing machine, shall be recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Double seams on semirigid or flexible containers shall be  examined and the results recorded as provided in paragraph (b) of this  section. Any additional measurements specified by the container  manufacturer shall also be made and recorded.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Container coding. Each container shall be marked with a  permanent, legible, identifying code mark. The mark shall, at a minimum,  identify in code the product (unless the product name is lithographed or  printed elsewhere on the container) and the day and year the product was  packed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Handling of containers after closure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Containers and  closures shall be protected from damage which may cause defects that are  likely to affect the hermetic condition of the containers. The  accumulation of stationary containers on moving conveyors should be  minimized to avoid damage to the containers.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The maximum time lapse between closing and initiation of thermal  processing shall be 2 hours. However, the Administrator may specify a  shorter period of time when considered necessary to ensure product  safety and stability. A longer period of time between closing and the  initiation of thermal processing may be permitted by the Administrator.
