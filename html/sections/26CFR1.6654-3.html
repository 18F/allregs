The provisions of section 6654, with certain  modifications relating to the application of section 6654(d), which are  explained in paragraph (b) of this section, are applicable in the case  of a short taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Rules as to application of section 6654(d). (1) In any case in  which the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax exists  is a short taxable year due to a change in annual accounting periods, in  determining the tax:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Shown on the return for the preceding taxable year (for purposes  of section 6654(d)(1)), or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Based on the personal exemptions and rates for the current  taxable year but otherwise on the basis of the facts shown on the return  for the preceding taxable year, and the law applicable to such year (for  purposes of section 6654(d)(4)),   the tax will be reduced by multiplying it by the number of months in the  short taxable year and dividing the resulting amount by 12.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If the taxable year for which an underpayment of estimated tax  exists is a short taxable year due to a change in annual accounting  periods, in annualizing the taxable income for the months in the taxable  year preceding an installment date, for purposes of section  6654(d)(1)(C), the personal exemptions allowed as deductions under  section 151 shall be reduced to the same extent that they are reduced  under section 443(c) in computing the tax for a short taxable year.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> If ``the preceding taxable year'' referred to in section  6654(d)(4) was a short taxable year, for purposes of determining the  applicability of the exception described in section 6654(d)(4), the tax,  computed on the basis in the facts shown on the return for the preceding  year, shall be the tax computed on the annual basis in the manner  described in section 443(b)(1) (prior to its reduction in the manner  described in the last sentence thereof). If the tax rates or the  taxpayer's status with respect to personal exemptions for the taxable  year with respect to which the underpayment occurs differ from such  rates or status applicable to the preceding taxable year, the tax  determined in accordance with this subparagraph shall be recomputed to  reflect the rates and status applicable to the year with respect to  which the underpayment occurs.
