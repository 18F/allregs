It replaces 1972 APC 3 for process sources, approved at paragraph (b), and SIP 1974 APC 3 for combustion sources, approved in part at subparagraph (c)(14). Indiana does not intend 325 IAC 5-1 to regulate the emission points in Lake County listed in Table 2 of 325 IAC 6-1-110.2 (subparagraph (c)(57)). USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1 for these sources. Indiana does not intend 325 IAC 5-1 to regulate certain coke battery emission sources listed in 325 IAC 11-3 (subparagraph (c)(42)). USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to the provisions of 325 IAC 11-3 which USEPA disapproved at (c)(42), i.e., pushing and quenching sources throughout the State and coke oven doors in Lake and Marion Counties. Additionally, Indiana has modified 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to the stack emission points in Porter County listed at 325 IAC 6-6-4. USEPA disapproved 325 IAC 5-1 as it applies to these Porter County sources on February 5, 1987 (52 FR 3640). For those source categories where USEPA is disapproving 325 IAC 5-1, they remain regulated by the previously approved opacity SIP which consists of SIP 1974 APC 3 for combustion sources and 1972 APC 3 for process sources. Additionally, as long as the Bethlehem Steel Corporation No. 2 Coke Oven Battery Underfire Stack EVEL (subparagraph (c)(49)) remains approved, it replaces 325 IAC 5-1.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference.

USEPA is taking no action on changes to 325 IAC 8-1.1-2(f), Methods of Compliance, and the repeal of 325 IAC 8-5-6, Perchloroethylene Dry Cleaning, because these exempt the compound perchloroethylene from control without the State justifying that such exemption is consistent with the Part D reasonably available control technology (RACT) requirements.</p><p class="depth0">Note: If Indiana allows use of a non-USEPA test method in the future, its use must be submitted to USEPA as a SIP revision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Incorporation by reference.
