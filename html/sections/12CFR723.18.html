                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">To obtain the exception, a federal credit union must submit documentation to the Regional Director, demonstrating that it meets the criteria of one of the exceptions. A state chartered federally insured credit union must submit documentation to its state supervisory authority. The state supervisory authority will forward its decision to NCUA. The exception does not expire unless revoked by the state supervisory authority for a state chartered federally insured credit union or the Regional Director for a federal credit union. If an exception request is denied for a federal credit union, it may be appealed to the NCUA Board within 60 days of the denial by the Regional Director. Until the NCUA Board acts on the appeal, the credit union can continue to make new member business loans.</p>
