                                Sec. 63.11895  How do I assert an affirmative defense for exceedance
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">In response to an action to enforce the standards set forth in  Sec. 63.11880, you may assert an affirmative defense to a claim for  civil penalties for violations of such standards that are caused by  malfunction, as defined at 40 CFR 63.2. Appropriate penalties may be  assessed, however, if you fail to meet your burden of proving all of the  requirements in the affirmative defense. The affirmative defense shall  not be available for claims for injunctive relief.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Evidence. To establish the affirmative defense in any action to  enforce such a standard, you must timely meet the notification  requirements in paragraph (b) of this section, and must prove by a  preponderance of evidence that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The violation:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Was caused by a sudden, infrequent, and unavoidable failure of  air pollution control and monitoring   equipment, process equipment, or a process to operate in a normal or  usual manner.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Could not have been prevented through careful planning, proper  design or better operation and maintenance practices.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Did not stem from any activity or event that could have been  foreseen and avoided, or planned for.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Were not part of a recurring pattern indicative of inadequate  design, operation or maintenance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Repairs were made as expeditiously as possible when violation  occurred. Off-shift and overtime labor were used, to the extent  practicable to make these repairs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The frequency, amount and duration of the violation (including  any bypass) were minimized to the maximum extent practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the violation resulted from a bypass of control equipment or  a process, then the bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,  personal injury, or severe property damage.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> All possible steps were taken to minimize the impact of the  violations on ambient air quality, the environment and human health.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All emissions monitoring and control systems were kept in  operation if at all possible, consistent with safety and good air  pollution control practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> All of the actions in response to the violations were documented  by properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> At all times, the affected source was operated in a manner  consistent with good practices for minimizing emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A written root cause analysis has been prepared, the purpose of  which is to determine, correct, and eliminate the primary causes of the  malfunction and the violations resulting from the malfunction event at  issue. The analysis shall also specify, using best monitoring methods  and engineering judgment, the amount of excess emissions that were the  result of the malfunction.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> with all necessary  supporting documentation, that it has met the requirements set forth in  this section.</p>
