                            <p class="depth0">You must meet the following additional BOP testing requirements:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Use water to test a surface BOP system;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Stump test a subsea BOP system before installation. You must use water to conduct this test. You may use drilling fluids to conduct subsequent tests of a subsea BOP system. You must perform the initial subsea BOP test on the seafloor within 30 days of the stump test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Alternate tests between control stations and pods;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Pressure test the blind or blind-shear ram BOP during stump tests and at all casing points;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The interval between any blind or blind-shear ram BOP pressure tests may not exceed 30 days;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Pressure test variable bore-pipe ram BOPs against the largest and smallest sizes of pipe in use, excluding drill collars and bottom-hole tools;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Pressure test affected BOP components following the disconnection or repair of any well-pressure containment seal in the wellhead or BOP stack assembly;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Function test annular and ram BOPs every 7 days between pressure tests;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Actuate safety valves assembled with proper casing connections before running casing;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> Test all ROV intervention functions on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. Each ROV must be fully compatible with the BOP stack ROV intervention panels. You must also test and verify closure of at least one set of rams during the initial test on the seafloor through an ROV hot stab. You must submit test procedures, including how you will test each ROV intervention function, with your APD or APM for BSEE District Manager approval. You must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Ensure that the ROV hot stabs are function tested and are capable of actuating, at a minimum, one set of pipe rams, one set of blind-shear rams, and unlatching the Lower Marine Riser Package (LMRP);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Notify the appropriate BSEE District Manager a minimum of 72 hours prior to the stump test and initial test on the seafloor; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Function test autoshear and deadman systems on your subsea BOP stack during the stump test. You must also test the deadman system and verify closure of at least one set of blind-shear rams during the initial test on the seafloor. When you conduct the initial deadman system test on the seafloor you must ensure the well is secure and, if hydrocarbons have been present, appropriate barriers are in place to isolate hydrocarbons from the wellhead. You must also have an ROV on bottom during the test.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You must submit test procedures with your APD or APM for District Manager approval. The procedures for these function tests must include documentation of the controls and circuitry of the system utilized during each test. The procedure must also describe how the ROV will be utilized during this operation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You must document all your test results and make them available to BSEE upon request.
