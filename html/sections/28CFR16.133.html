                                Sec.  16.133  Exemption of Department of Justice Regional Data Exchange
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The Department of Justice Regional Data Exchange System (RDEX), DOJ-012, is exempted from subsections (c)(3) and (4); (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4); (e)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (8); and (g) of the Privacy Act pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2). These exemptions apply only to the extent that information in a record is subject to exemption pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 552a(j)(2).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> This system is exempted from the following subsections for the reasons set forth below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> From subsection (c)(3) because making available to a record subject the accounting of disclosures of criminal law enforcement records concerning him or her could inform that individual of the existence, nature, or scope of an investigation, or could otherwise seriously impede law enforcement efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> From subsection (c)(4) because this system is exempt from subsections (d)(1), (2), (3), and (4).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> From subsection (d)(1) because disclosure of criminal law enforcement information could interfere with an investigation, reveal the identity of confidential sources, and result in an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of others.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> From subsection (d)(2) because amendment of the records would interfere with ongoing criminal law enforcement proceedings and impose an impossible administrative burden by requiring investigations to be continuously reinvestigated.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> From subsections (d)(3) and (4) because these subsections are inapplicable to the extent that exemption is claimed from subsections (d)(1) and (2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> From subsection (e)(1) because it is often impossible to determine in advance if criminal law enforcement records contained in this system are relevant and necessary, but, in the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and provide investigative leads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> From subsection (e)(2) because collecting information from the subject individual could serve notice that he or she is the subject of a criminal law enforcement matter and thereby present a serious impediment to law enforcement efforts. Further, because of the nature of criminal law enforcement matters, vital information about an individual frequently can be obtained only from other persons who are familiar with the individual and his or her activities and it often is not practicable to rely on information provided directly by the individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> From subsection (e)(3) because informing individuals as required by this subsection could reveal the existence of a criminal law enforcement matter and compromise criminal law enforcement efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> From subsection (e)(5) because it is often impossible to determine in advance if criminal law enforcement

records contained in this system are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete, but, in the interests of effective law enforcement, it is necessary to retain this information to aid in establishing patterns of activity and obtaining investigative leads.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> From subsection (e)(8) because serving notice could give persons sufficient warning to evade criminal law enforcement efforts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> From subsection (g) to the extent that this system is exempt from other specific subsections of the Privacy Act.
