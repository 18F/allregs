                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The deformable face is rigidly attached to the edge of the fixed rigid barrier or to some rigid structure attached thereto. The front of the fixed rigid barrier to which the deformable face is attached is flat (continuous over the height and width of the face and vertical 1 degree and perpendicular 1 degree to the axis of the run-up track). The edge of the deformable face is aligned with the edge of the fixed rigid barrier appropriate for the side of the vehicle to be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The deformable face is attached to the fixed rigid barrier by means of ten bolts, five in the top mounting flange and five in the bottom, such that the bottom of the bumper element honeycomb is 200 mm (7.8 in) 15 mm (0.6 in) from the ground. These bolts are at least 8 mm (0.3 in) in diameter. Steel clamping strips are used for both the top and bottom mounting flanges (Figure 1). These strips are 60 mm (2.4 in) high and 1000 mm (39.4 in) wide and have thickness of at least 3 mm (0.12 in). Five clearance holes of 20 mm (0.8 in) diameter are drilled in both strips to correspond with those in the mounting flange on the deformable face cladding sheet (see Sec. 586.17(c)).</p><p class="depth2">Sec.</p><p class="depth2">Sec.
