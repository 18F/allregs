                                Sec. 761.347  First level sampling--waste from existing piles.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. Sample piles that are either specifically configured  for sampling (see paragraph (b) of this section) or that are of conical  shape (see paragraph (c) of this section). If sampling from either of  these shapes is not possible, conduct contemporaneous sampling, in  accordance with the procedures in Sec. 761.348, or obtain the approval  of the Regional Administrator for an alternate sampling plan in  accordance with Sec. 761.62(c).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Specifically configured piles. A specifically configured pile is  a single flattened pile in the shape of a square or rectangle having no  restrictions on length or width but restricted to 30 cm (1 foot) in  depth. A square shaped pile facilitates sampling site selection for the  first level sample. Select eight 19-liter samples from the pile and  composite them into one 19-liter sample as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Divide the pile into quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Divide each of the quarter sections into quarters (i.e., into  sixteenths of the original pile).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Select two sixteenths from each of the four quarters, according  to one of the two following options:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Randomly select the two sixteenths from one quarter and sample  the sixteenths occupying the same positions in each of the other three  quarters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Randomly select two sixteenths from each of the four quarters  (i.e., perform a random selection four different times).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> At this point the eight selected sixteenths undergo further  division and sample selection. Divide each of the eight selected  sixteenths into four equal parts. Using a random number generator or  random number table, select one of the four equal parts from each of the  eight equal areas. If each of the four equal parts has a volume  76 liters when projected downwards 30 cm, continue to divide  each selected area into four equal parts, and select one of the parts,  until each selected area has a volume of <76 liters but =19  liters. When projected to a depth of 30 cm, a square having a 25 cm side  or a circle having a diameter of approximately 28.5 cm equals a volume  of approximately 19 liters. The volume of 76 liters is equal to the  volume enclosed by a square having a side of 50 cm (or other shape  having an area of 250 cm\2\) projected to a depth of 30 cm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Take one sample of approximately 19 unsorted liters of waste  from each of the eight selected areas. Place each sample into a separate  19-liter container, allowing only sufficient space at the top of the  container to secure the lid.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Composite the eight 19-liter samples in accordance with Sec.  761.350.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Conical-shaped piles. If it is necessary to sample a pile which  is too large to be spread on the site to a uniform thickness of 1 foot  or 30 cm, or if there are too many piles to spread out in the space  available, use the following procedure to sample the piles. This  procedure assumes that the shape of the piles is analogous to a cone;  that   is, having a circular base with PCB bulk product waste or PCB  remediation waste destined for off-site disposal stacked up uniformly to  a peak that is a point centered above the center of the circular base.  Collect eight 19-liter samples as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Collecting samples from more than one pile. If the PCB bulk  product waste or PCB remediation waste consists of more than one pile or  container, assign each pile or container an integer number and then  generate seven random integer numbers to select the piles from which you  will collect samples. It is possible that this random selection  procedure will result in selecting the same pile number more than once,  even if seven or more piles are present. If so, sample the pile once and  restart the sampling collection process to collect additional samples.  Do not collect multiple samples from the same location in the pile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Collecting samples from a single pile. If only one pile or  container is present, collect all eight samples from the same pile.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Setting up the sample site selection system from a pile. Locate  a sample in a pile by the use of three parameters: a particular radial  direction, ``r,'' from the peak at the center of the pile to the outer  edge at the base of the pile; a point, ``s,'' along that radial  direction between the peak of the pile and the outer edge of the base of  the pile; and a depth, ``t'', beneath point ``s.'' The top of the sample  material will be below depth t, at point s, on radius r. Use a rod,  dowel, stake, or broom handle as a marker. Nail or otherwise fasten to  the top of the marker two pieces of string or cord of sufficient length  and strength to reach from the top of the marker at the top of the pile  to the farthest peripheral edge at the bottom of the pile, when the  marker is positioned at the top or apex of the pile. Pound or push the  marker into the top center (apex) of the pile, downward toward the  center of the base. Insert the marker for at least 30 cm or one foot  until the marker is rigidly standing on its own, even when the cord is  pulled tight to the bottom peripheral edge of the pile. Ensure that the  marker protrudes from the top of the pile sufficiently to allow the  strings to move easily around the pile when they are pulled tight.  Select the three parameters and the sampling location as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine the radial component (r) of the location for each  sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Tie to a stake or otherwise fasten one of the strings at ``b,''  the bottom of the pile, as a reference point for finding r.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Measure the circumference ``c,'' the distance around the bottom  of the pile. Determine r from b in one of two ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiply c by a randomly generated fraction or percentage of  one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Select a random number between one and the total number of  centimeters in c.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Locate r by starting at b, the place where the fixed string  meets the base of the pile, and travel clockwise around the edge of the  pile at the base for the distance you selected in paragraph (c)(3)(i)(B)  of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Fasten the second string at the selected distance. The second  string marks the first parameter r.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Determine the second parameter s of the location for each  sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Measure the distance, l, along the string, positioned in  paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, from the top to the bottom of  the pile at the selected radial distance r. Determine the distance s  from l in one of two ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Multiply l by a randomly generated fraction or percentage of  one.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Select a random number between one and the total number of  centimeters in l.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Mark, for example by placing a piece of tape on the string  positioned according to paragraph (c)(3)(i)(D) of this section, the  distance s, up from the bottom of the pile on the string at r.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Determine the third and final parameter t of the location for  each sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Mark and number 1 cm intervals from one end of a rigid device,  for example a rod, dowel, stake, or broom handle, for measuring the  distance from the top of the pile to the bottom at the point s selected  in paragraph (c)(3)(ii)(B) of this section. The marked and numbered  device shall be of sufficient strength to be forced down through the  maximum depth of the pile   and sufficient length to measure the depth of the waste in the pile at  any point.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Take the measuring device, constructed according to paragraph  (c)(3)(iii)(A) of this section, and at position s, push the end of the  device marked with zero straight down into the pile until it reaches the  bottom of the pile or ground level. The vertical distance ``v'' is the  number of centimeters from the surface of the pile at point s on the  string to the bottom of the pile or ground level. Read the distance v on  the measuring device at the surface of the pile. From the distance v,  determine t, in one of two ways:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Randomly generate a fraction of one and multiply the fraction  times v.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Select a random number between zero and the total number of  centimeters of the vertical distance v.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Dig a hole straight down into the pile for t centimeters  (inches) from the surface of the pile at s.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)(C)</em> of this section. It is possible that some of the  eight sampling locations will not provide 19 liters of sample.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For a depth of 30 cm.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Until the container is full.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Until the ground level is reached.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Compositing the samples. Composite the eight 19-liter samples  and subsample in accordance with Sec. 761.350. Send the subsample to a  laboratory for further sampling as described in Sec. Sec. 761.353 and  761.355 and for chemical extraction and analysis. If there is  insufficient sample for a 19-liter sample from the composite sample  composed of the eight iterations of sample site selection, according to  the procedures in paragraphs (c)(3)(i) through (c)(3)(v) of this  section, select additional sample sites, collect additional samples and  composite the additional waste in the samples until a minimum of 19  liters is in the composite.
