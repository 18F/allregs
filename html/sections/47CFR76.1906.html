                                Sec.  76.1906  Encoding rules for undefined business models.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Upon public notice and subject to requirements as set forth  herein, a covered entity may launch a program service pursuant to an  undefined business model. Subject to Commission review upon complaint,  the covered entity may initially encode programs pursuant to such  undefined business model without regard to limitations set forth in  Sec.  76.1904(b).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notice. Concurrent with the launch of an undefined business  model by a covered entity, the covered entity shall issue a press  release to the PR Newswire so as to provide public notice of the  undefined business model, and the proposed encoding terms. The notice  shall provide a concise summary of the commercial audiovisual content to  be provided pursuant to the undefined business model, and of the terms  on which such content is to be available to consumers. Immediately upon  request from a party entitled to be a complainant, the covered entity  shall make available information that indicates the proposed encoding  terms, including the use of copy never or copy one generation encoding,  and the encoding of content with respect to ``pause'' as defined in  Sec.  76.1904(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Complaint process. Any interested party (``complainant'') may  file a complaint with the Commission objecting to application of  encoding as set forth in the notice.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pre-complaint resolution. Prior to initiating a complaint with  the Commission under this section, the complainant shall notify the  covered entity that it may file a complaint under this section. The  notice must be sufficiently detailed so that the covered entity can  determine the specific nature of the potential complaint. The potential  complainant must allow a minimum of thirty (30) days from such notice  before filing such complaint with the Commission. During this period the  parties shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the issue(s) in dispute.  If the parties fail to reach agreement within this 30 day period,  complainant may initiate a complaint in accordance with the procedures  set forth herein.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Complaint. Within two years of publication of a notice under  paragraph (a)(1) of this section, a complainant may file a complaint  with the Commission objecting to application of the encoding terms to  the service at issue. Such complaint shall state with particularity the  basis for objection to the encoding terms.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The complaint shall contain the name and address of the  complainant and the name and address of the covered entity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The complaint shall be accompanied by a certification of service  on the named covered entity.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The complaint shall set forth with specificity all information  and arguments relied upon. Specific factual allegations shall be  supported by a declaration of a person or persons with actual knowledge  of the facts, and exhibits shall be verified by the person who prepares  them.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The complaint shall set forth attempts made by the complainant  to resolve its complaint pursuant to paragraph (a)(2)(i) of this  section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Public notice. The Commission shall give public notice of the  filing of the complaint. Once the Commission has issued such public  notice, any person otherwise entitled to be a complainant shall instead  have the status of a person submitting comments under paragraph  (a)(2)(iv) of this section rather than a complainant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Comments and reply. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Any person may submit comments  regarding the complaint within thirty (30) days after the date of public  notice by the Commission. Comments shall be served on the complainant  and the covered entity and on any persons listed in relevant  certificates of service, and shall contain a detailed full statement of  any facts or considerations relied on. Specific factual allegations  shall be supported by a declaration of a person or persons with actual  knowledge of the facts, and exhibits shall be verified by the person who  prepares them.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The covered entity may file a response to the complaint and  comments within twenty (20) days after the date that comments are due.  Such response shall be served on all persons who have filed complaints  or comments and shall also contain a detailed full showing, supported by  affidavit or declaration, of any additional facts or considerations  relied on. Replies shall be due ten (10) days from the date for filing a  response.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Basis for Commission determination as to encoding terms for an  undefined business model. In a permit-but-disclose proceeding, unless  otherwise specified by the Commission, to determine whether encoding  terms as noticed may be applied to an undefined business model, the  covered entity shall have the burden of proof to establish that  application of the encoding terms in the undefined business model is in  the public interest. In making any such determination, the Commission  shall take into account the following factors:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Whether the benefit to consumers of the new service, including  but not limited to earlier release windows, more favorable terms,  innovation or original programming, outweighs the limitation on the  consumers' control over the new service;</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Ways in which the new service differs from services offered by  any covered entity prior to December 31, 2002;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Determination procedures. The Commission may specify other  procedures, such as oral argument, evidentiary hearing, or further  written submissions directed to particular aspects, as it deems  appropriate.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Complaint regarding a service not subject to notice. In an  instance in   which an interested party has a substantial basis to believe and  believes in good faith that a service pursuant to an undefined business  model has been launched without requisite notice, such party may file a  complaint pursuant to Sec.  76.7.</p>
