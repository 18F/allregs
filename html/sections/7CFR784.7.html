In the event that approval of all  eligible applications would result in expenditures in excess of the  amount available, FSA shall prorate the available funds by a national  factor to reduce the expected payments to be made to the amount  available. The payment shall be made based on the national factored rate  as determined by FSA. FSA shall prorate the payments in such manner as  it, in its sole discretion, finds appropriate and reasonable.</p>
