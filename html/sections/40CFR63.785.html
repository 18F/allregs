(c)(3)(vi) of this section] is less than or equal to the total allowable volume of thinner for the group [paragraph (c)(3)(v) of this section], then compliance is demonstrated for the group for the previous month, unless a violation is revealed using Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Demonstration of compliance through an alternative (i.e., other than Method 24 of appendix A to 40 CFR part 60) test method.

A violation revealed through the recordkeeping procedures described in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(4) of this section shall result in a 30-day violation for enforcement purposes, unless the owner or operator provides sufficient data to demonstrate the specific days during which noncompliant coatings were applied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Continuous compliance requirements. You must demonstrate continuous compliance with the emissions standards and operating limits by using the performance test methods and procedures in Sec.  63.786 for each affected source.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General requirements. (i) You must monitor and collect data, and provide a site specific monitoring plan, as required by Sec. Sec.  63.783, 63.785, 63.786 and 63.787.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> You must monitor and collect data, and provide a site specific monitoring plan, as required by Sec. Sec.  63.783, 63.785, 63.786 and 63.787.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Except for periods of monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions, and required monitoring system quality assurance or quality control activities (including, as applicable, calibration checks and required zero and span adjustments), you must operate the monitoring system and collect data at all required intervals at all times the affected source is operating, and periods of malfunction. Any period for which data collection is required and the operation of the Continuous Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS) is not otherwise exempt and for which the monitoring system is out-of-control and data are not available for required calculations constitutes a deviation from the monitoring requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> You may not use data recorded during monitoring system malfunctions, repairs associated with monitoring system malfunctions or required monitoring system quality assurance or control activities in calculations used to report emissions or operating levels. A monitoring system malfunction is any sudden, infrequent, not reasonably preventable failure of the monitoring system to provide valid data. Monitoring system failures that are caused in part by poor maintenance or careless operation are not malfunctions. The owner or operator must use all the data collected during all other periods in assessing the operation of the control device and associated control system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]
