                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section describes coastdown procedures that are unique to  vehicles above 14,000 pounds GVWR. These procedures are valid for  calculating road-load coefficients for chassis and post-transmission  powerpack testing and for calculating drag area (CDA) for use  in the GEM simulation tool under 40 CFR part 1037.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Determine road-load coefficients by performing a minimum of 16  valid coastdown runs (8 in each direction).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> have the meaning given in SAE J1263 or J2263 unless  specified otherwise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The test condition specifications of SAE J1263 apply except as  follows for wind and road conditions:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> We recommend that you do not perform coastdown testing on days  for which winds are forecast to exceed 6.0 mph.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The grade of the test track or road must not be excessive  (considering factors such as road safety standards and effects on the  coastdown results). Road conditions should follow Section 7.4 of SAE  J1263, except that road grade may exceed 0.5%. If road grade is greater  than 0.02% over the length of the test surface, you must incorporate  into the analysis road grade as a function of distance along the length  of the test surface. Use Section 11.5 of SAE J2263 to calculate the  force due to grade.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em>.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Gather data regarding wind speed and direction, in coordination  with time-of-day data, using at least one stationary electro-mechanical  anemometer and suitable data loggers meeting the specifications of SAE  J1263, as well as the following additional specifications for the  anemometer placed adjacent to the test surface:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Calibrate the equipment by running the zero-wind and zero-angle  calibrations within 24 hours before conducting the coastdown procedures.  If the coastdown procedures are not complete 24 hours after calibrating  the equipment, repeat the calibration for another 24 hours of data  collection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Record the location of the anemometer using a GPS measurement  device adjacent to the test surface (approximately) at the midway  distance along the test surface used for coastdowns.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Position the anemometer such that it will be at least 2.5 but  not more than 3.0 vehicle widths from the test vehicle's centerline as  the test vehicle passes the anemometer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Mount the anemometer at a height that is within 6 inches of  half the test vehicle's maximum height.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Place the anemometer at least 50 feet from the nearest tree and  at least 25 feet from the nearest bush (or equivalent roadside  features).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The height of the grass surrounding the stationary anemometer  may not exceed 10% of the anemometer's mounted height, within a radius  equal to the anemometer's mounted height.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> You may split runs as per Section 9.3.1 of SAE J2263, but we  recommend whole runs. If you split a run, analyze each portion  separately, but count the split runs as one run with respect to the  minimum number of runs required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> You may perform consecutive runs in a single direction, followed  by consecutive runs in the opposite direction, consistent with good  engineering judgment. Harmonize starting and stopping points to the  extent practicable to allow runs to be paired.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> All valid coastdown run times in each direction must be within  2.0 standard deviations of the mean of the valid coastdown run times  (from the specified maximum speed down to 15 mph) in that direction.  Eliminate runs outside this range. After eliminating these runs you must  have at least eight valid runs in each direction. You may use coastdown  run times that do not meet these standard deviation requirements if we  approve it in advance. In your request, describe why the vehicle is not  able to meet the specified standard deviation requirements and propose  an alternative set of requirements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Analyze data for chassis and post-transmission powerpack testing  or for use in the GEM simulation tool as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Follow the procedures specified in Section 10 of SAE J1263 or  Section 11 of SAE J2263 to calculate coefficients for chassis and post- transmission powerpack testing.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Determine drag area, CDA, as follows instead of  using the procedure specified in Section 10 of SAE J1263:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Measure vehicle speed at fixed intervals over the coastdown run  (generally at 10 Hz), including speeds at or above 15 mph and at or  below the specified maximum speed. Establish the elevation corresponding  to each interval as described in SAE J2263 if you need to incorporate  the effects of road grade.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Calculate the vehicle's effective mass, Me, in kg by  adding 56.7 kg to the measured vehicle mass for each tire making road  contact. This accounts for the rotational inertia of the wheels and  tires.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> Calculate the road-load force for each measurement interval,  Fi, using the following equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.082  Where:  i = an interval counter, starting with i=1 for the first interval. The</p><p class="depth5">designation (i-1) corresponds to the end of the previous</p><p class="depth5">interval or, for the first interval, to the start of the test</p><p class="depth5">run. Me = the vehicle's effective mass, expressed to at least the</p><p class="depth5">nearest 0.1 kg. v = vehicle speed at the beginning and end of the measurement interval. [Delta]t = elapsed time over the measurement interval, in seconds.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> Plot the data from all the coastdown runs on a single plot of  Fi vs. vi\2\ to determine the slope correlation,  D, based on the following equation:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.083  Where:  g = gravitational acceleration = 9.81 m/s\2\. [Delta]h = change in elevation over the measurement interval, in m.</p><p class="depth5">Assume dh = 0 if you are not correcting for grade. [Delta]s = distance the vehicle travels down the road during the</p><p class="depth5">measurement interval, in m. Am = the calculated value of the y-intercept based on the</p><p class="depth5">curve-fit.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Calculate drag area, CDA, in m\2\ using the following  equation: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.084  Where:  r = air density at reference conditions = 1.17 kg/m. \3\ [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR28AP14.085  T = mean ambient absolute temperature during testing, in K. pact = average ambient pressuring during the test, in kPa.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Determine the A, B, and C coefficients identified in Sec.   1066.210 as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> For chassis and post-transmission powerpack testing, follow the  procedures specified in Section 10 of SAE J1263 or Section 12 of SAE  J2263.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For the GEM simulation tool, use the following values:  A = Am B = 0 C = Dadj</p>
