The responsibilities of an appeals coordinator may include presiding over informal hearings.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Appeal procedures--(1) Filing. An appeal under this part must be received by the Under Secretary for Industry and Security, Bureau of Industry and Security, U.S. Department of Commerce, Room 3898, 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, NW., Washington, DC 20230 not later than 45 days after the date appearing on the written notice of administrative action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Content of appeal.

In addition to the written statement submitted in support of an appeal, an appellant may request, in writing, at the time an appeal is filed, an opportunity for an informal hearing. The Under Secretary may grant or deny a request for an informal hearing. Any hearings will be held in the District of Columbia unless the Under Secretary determines, based upon good cause shown, that another location would be better.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Informal hearing procedures--(i) Presentations. The Under Secretary shall provide an opportunity for the appellant to make an oral presentation based on the materials previously submitted by the appellant or made available by the Department in connection with the administrative action.

The Under Secretary has the authority to limit the number of people attending the hearing, to impose any time or other limitations deemed reasonable, and to determine all procedural questions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Transcript. A transcript of an informal hearing shall not be made, unless the Under Secretary determines that the national interest or other good cause warrants it, or the appellant requests a transcript. If the appellant requests a transcript, the appellant will be responsible for paying all expenses related to production of the transcript.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Report. Any person designated by the Under Secretary to conduct an informal hearing shall submit a written report containing a summary of the hearing and recommend action to the Under Secretary.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Decisions--(1) Determination of appeals. In addition to the documents specifically submitted in connection with the appeal, the Under Secretary shall consider any recommendations, reports, or relevant documents available to BIS in determining the appeal, but shall not be bound by any such recommendation, nor prevented from considering any other information, or consulting with any other person or groups, in making a determination. The Under Secretary may adopt any other procedures deemed necessary and reasonable for considering an appeal. The Under Secretary shall decide an appeal within a reasonable time after receipt of the appeal. The decision shall be issued to the appellant in writing and contain a statement of the reasons for the action.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Effect of the determination. The decision of the Under Secretary shall be final.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Effect of appeal. Acceptance and consideration of an appeal shall not affect any administrative action, pending or in effect, unless the Under Secretary, upon request by the appellant and with opportunity for response, grants a stay.
