                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Termination agreement or notice. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State Conservationist,  NRCS, may, based on evidence of failure to comply with the terms of the  grant agreement, issue a notice of intent to terminate the grant  agreement. The notice of intent to terminate has the force and effect of  extending or modifying the conditions of the suspend order. Any  modification of the conditions of the suspend order shall be shown in  the notice and discussed with the administering agency. The State  Conservationist shall give not less than ten (10) days written notice to  the administering agency (certified mail, return receipt requested) of  intent to terminate the grant in whole or in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> After the administering agency has been afforded an opportunity  for consultation, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may request  authorization from the Administrator, NRCS, to terminate the grant in  whole or in part. If the Administrator, NRCS, concurs in the termination  action, the proposed termination notice will be forwarded to the  Administrator, EPA, for concurrence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> After the Administrators, NRCS and EPA, have been informed of  any expressed views of the administering agency and concurred in the  proposed termination, the State Conservationist, NRCS, may, in writing  (certified mail, return receipt requested), terminate the grant in whole  or in part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Termination of all or part of the grant agreement may be carried  out by either execution of a termination agreement by the State  Conservationist, NRCS, or issuance of a grant termination notice by the  State Conservationist, NRCS. The agreement or notice shall establish the  effective date of termination of the grant, the basis for settlement of  grant termination   costs, and the amount and date of payment of any sums due either party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Basis for termination. A grant may be terminated by NRCS for  good cause subject to negotiation and payment of appropriate termination  settlement costs. Cause for termination by NRCS includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Failure by the administering agency to make satisfactory  progress toward achieving an adequate level of participation; or other  evidence satisfactory to the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the  Administrator, NRCS, that the administering agency has failed or is  unable to perform in accordance with the provisions of the grant  agreement; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure through no fault of the administering agency to achieve  an adequate level of participation; or other evidence satisfactory to  the NRCWCC, Administrator, EPA, and the Administrator, NRCS, that the  planned actions approved in the project application cannot be achieved.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effect of grant termination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em></p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In those cases where cause  for grant termination is based on the administering agency's failure or  inability to perform (Sec. 634.17(b)(1)), upon termination, the  administering agency must refund or credit to the United States that  portion of the grant funds paid or owed to the administering agency and  allocable to the terminated project work. Funds needed to meet  unavoidable commitments may be retained. All other funds, including  unexpended cost-sharing monies for existing RCWP contracts executed  prior to the termination date, shall be refunded to the United States.  The administering agency shall not make any new commitments or enter  into any new RCWP contracts. The administering agency shall reduce the  amount of other outstanding commitments insofar as possible and report  to the State Conservationist, NRCS, the uncommitted balance of funds  awarded under the grant. The allowability of termination costs will be  determined in conformance with applicable Federal cost principles.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Upon termination of a grant agreement, existing RCWP contracts  and their related obligations will immediately, and in no case later  than 5 calendar days be transferred to the ASCS county office to assure  continuity in payments to participants. The State Conservationist, NRCS,  will immediately initiate action under Sec. 634.15 to establish a new  administering agency for completion of the project.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those cases where cause for grant termination is based on  failure to achieve the planned actions through no fault of the  administering agency, the termination agreement and amended grant  agreement are to permit the administering agency to fulfill the  obligations of its existing RCWP contracts. The administering agency  shall not make any new commitments or enter into any new RCWP contracts  without NRCS approval.</p>
