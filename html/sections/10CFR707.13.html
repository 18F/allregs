                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> All test results shall be submitted for medical review by the  MRO. A confirmed positive test for drugs shall consist of an initial  test performed by the immunoassay method, with positive results on that  initial test confirmed by another test, performed by the gas  chromatography/mass spectrometry method (GC/MS). This procedure is  described in paragraphs 2.4 (e) and (f) of the HHS Mandatory Guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The Medical Review Officer will consider the medical history of  the employee or applicant, as well as any other relevant biomedical  information. When there is a confirmed positive test result, the  employee or applicant will be given an opportunity to report to the MRO  the use of any prescription or over-the-counter medication. If the MRO  determines that there is a legitimate medical explanation for a  confirmed positive test result, consistent with legal and non-abusive  drug use, the MRO will certify that the test results do not meet the  conditions for a determination of use of illegal drugs. If no such  certification can be made, the MRO will make a determination of use of  illegal drugs. Determinations of use of illegal drugs will be made in  accordance with the criteria provided in the Medical Review Officer  Manual issued by the Department of Health and Human Services [DHHS  Publication No. (ADM) 88-1526].</p>
