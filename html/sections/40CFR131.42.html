High Quality  Waters are to be identified by EQB on a parameter-by-parameter basis.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Outstanding National Resources Waters (ONRWs):</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Are waters classified as SA or SE in the PRWQSR, as amended, or  any other water designated by Resolution of the Governing Board of EQB.  ONRWs are waters that are recreationally or ecologically important,  unique or sensitive.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Antidegradation Review Procedure. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The antidegradation review  will commence with the submission of the CWA Section 401 water quality  certification request. EQB uses a parameter-by-parameter approach for  the implementation of the anti-degradation policy and will review each  parameter separately as it evaluates the request for certification. The  401 certification/antidegradation review shall comply with Article  4(B)(3) of the Puerto Rico Environmental Public Policy Act (Law No. 416  of September 22, 2004, as amended (12 LPRA 8001 et seq.)). Compliance  with Article 4(B)(3) shall be conducted in accordance with the  Reglamento de la Junta de Calidad Ambiental para el Proceso de  Presentaci[oacute]n, Evaluaci[oacute]n y Tr[aacute]mite de Documentos  Ambientales (EQB's Environmental Documents Regulation). As part of the  evaluation of the Environmental Document an alternatives analysis shall  be conducted (12 LPRA 8001(a)(5), EQB's Environmental Documents  Regulation, e.g., Rules 211E and 253C), and a public participation  period and a public hearing shall be provided (12 LPRA 8001(a), EQB's  Environmental Documents Regulation, Rule 254).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> In conducting an antidegradation review, EQB will sequentially  apply the following steps:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Determine which level of antidegradation applies</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Tier 1--Protection of Existing and Designated Uses.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Tier 2--Protection of High Quality Waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Tier 3--Protection of ONRWs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Review existing water quality data and other information  submitted by the applicant. The applicant shall provide EQB with the  information regarding the discharge, as required by the PRWQSR  including, but not limited to the following:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A description of the nature of the pollutants to be discharged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Treatment technologies applied to the pollutants to be  discharged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nature of the applicant's business.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Daily maximum and average flow to be discharged.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Effluent characterization.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Effluent limitations requested to be applied to the discharge  according to Section 6.11 of the PRWQSR.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Location of the point of discharge.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Receiving waterbody name.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> Water quality data of the receiving waterbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> Receiving waterbody minimum flow (7Q2 and 7Q10) for stream  waters.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> Location of water intakes within the waterbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> In the event that the proposed discharge will result in the  lowering of water quality, data and information demonstrating that the  discharge is necessary to accommodate important economic or social  development in the   area where the receiving waters are located.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Determine if additional information or assessment is necessary  to make the decision.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Prepare an intent to issue or deny the 401 water quality  certificate and publish a notice in a newspaper of wide circulation in  Puerto Rico informing the public of EQB's preliminary decision and  granting a public participation period of at least thirty (30) days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Address the comments received from the interested parties and  consider such comments as part of the decision making process.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Make the final determination to issue or deny the requested 401  certification. Such decision is subject to the reconsideration procedure  established in Law 170 of August 12, 1988, Ley de Procedimiento  Administrativo Uniforme del Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico (3 LPRA  2165).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Implementation Procedures. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Activities Regulated by NPDES  Permits</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Tier 1--Protection of Existing and Designated Uses:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Tier 1 waters are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Those waters of Puerto Rico (except Tier 2 or Tier 3 waters)  identified as impaired and that have been included on the list required  by Section 303(d) of the CWA; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Those waters of Puerto Rico (except Tier 2 and Tier 3 waters)  for which attainment of applicable water quality standards has been or  is expected to be, achieved through implementation of effluent  limitations more stringent than technology-based controls (Best  Practicable Technology, Best Available Technology and Secondary  Treatment).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> To implement Tier 1 antidegradation, EQB shall determine if a  discharge would lower the water quality to the extent that it would no  longer be sufficient to protect and maintain the existing and designated  uses of that waterbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> When a waterbody has been affected by a parameter of concern  causing it to be included on the 303(d) List, then EQB will not allow an  increase of the concentration of the parameter of concern or pollutants  affecting the parameter of concern in the waterbody. This no increase  will be achieved by meeting the applicable water quality standards at  the end of the pipe. Until such time that a Total Maximum Daily Load  (TMDL) is developed for the parameter of concern for the waterbody, no  discharge will be allowed to cause or contribute to further degradation  of the waterbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> When the assimilative capacity of a waterbody is not sufficient  to ensure maintenance of the water quality standard for a parameter of  concern with an additional load to the waterbody, EQB will not allow an  increase of the concentration of the parameter of concern or pollutants  affecting the parameter of concern in the waterbody. This no increase  will be achieved by meeting the applicable water quality standards at  the end of the pipe. Until such time that a TMDL is developed for the  parameter of concern for the waterbody, no discharge will be allowed to  cause or contribute to further degradation of the waterbody.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Tier 2--Protection of High Quality Waters:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> To verify that a waterbody is a high quality water for a  parameter of concern which initiates a Tier 2 antidegradation review,  EQB shall evaluate and determine:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The existing water quality of the waterbody;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The projected water quality of the waterbody pursuant to the  procedures established in the applicable provisions of Articles 5 and 10  of the PRWQSR including but not limited to, Sections 5.2, 5.3, 5.4,  10.2, 10.3, 10.4, 10.5, and 10.6;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> That the existing and designated uses of the waterbody will be  fully maintained and protected in the event of a lowering of water  quality.</p><p class="depth0">In multiple discharge situations, the effects of all discharges  shall be evaluated through a waste load allocation analysis in  accordance with the applicable provisions of Article 10 of the PRWQSR or  the applicable provisions of Article 5 regarding mixing zones.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> In order to allow the lowering of water quality in high quality  waters, the applicant must show and justify the necessity for such  lowering of water quality through compliance with the requirements of  Section 6.11 of the PRWQSR. EQB will not allow the entire assimilative  capacity of a   waterbody for a parameter of concern to be allocated to a discharger, if  the necessity of the requested effluent limitation for the parameter of  concern is not demonstrated to the full satisfaction of EQB.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Tier 3--Protection of ONRWs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> EQB may designate a water as Class SA or SE (ONRWs) through a  Resolution (PRWQSR Sections 2.1.1 and 2.2.1). Additionally, any  interested party may nominate a specific water to be classified as an  ONRW and the Governing Board of EQB will make the final determination.  Classifying a water as an ONRW may result in the water being named in  either Section 2.1.1 or 2.2.2 of the PRWQSR, which would require an  amendment of the PRWQSR. The process for amending the PRWQSR, including  public participation, is set forth in Section 8.6 of said regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The existing characteristics of Class SA and SE waters shall not  be altered, except by natural causes, in order to preserve the existing  natural phenomena.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> No point source discharge will be allowed in ONRWs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Activities Regulated by CWA Section 404 or Rivers and Harbors  Action Section 10 Permits (Discharge of Dredged or Fill Material)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> EQB will only allow the discharge of dredged or fill material  into a wetland if it can be demonstrated that such discharge will not  have an unacceptable adverse impact either individually or in  combination with other activities affecting the wetland of concern. The  impacts to the water quality or the aquatic or other life in the wetland  due to the discharge of dredged or fill material should be avoided,  minimized and mitigated.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The discharge of dredged or fill material shall not be  certified if there is a practicable alternative to the proposed  discharge which would have less adverse impact on the recipient  ecosystem, so long as the alternative does not have other more  significant adverse environmental consequences. Activities which are not  water dependent are presumed to have practicable alternatives, unless  the applicant clearly demonstrates otherwise. No discharge of dredged  and fill material shall be certified unless appropriate and practicable  steps have been taken which minimize potential adverse impacts of the  discharge on the recipient ecosystem. The discharge of dredged or fill  material to ONRWs, however, shall be governed by paragraph (d)(1)(iii)  of this section.  [72 FR 70524, Dec. 12, 2007]</p>
