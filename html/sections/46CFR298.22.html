No other proposed method of amortization will be allowed which would reduce the amount of periodic amortization below that determined under the level principal or level payment basis at any time prior to maturity of the Obligations, except where:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> You can demonstrate to our satisfaction that there will be adequate funds to discharge the Obligations at maturity;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> You establish a fund with the Depository in which you deposit an equal

annual amount necessary to redeem the outstanding Obligations at maturity; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> With regard to Eligible Export Vessels, in accordance with such other terms as we determine to be more favorable and to be compatible with export credit terms offered by foreign governments for the sale of vessels built in foreign shipyards.
