                            <p class="depth0">As used in this subpart, all terms not defined herein shall have the meaning given them in the Act, in subpart A of part 61, or in specific subparts of part 61; and the following terms shall have specific meaning given them:</p><p class="depth0">Bottoms receiver means a tank that collects distillation bottoms before the stream is sent for storage or for further downstream processing.</p><p class="depth0">Closed-vent system means a system that is not open to atmosphere and that is composed of hard-piping, ductwork, connections, and, if necessary, flow-inducing devices that transport gas or vapor from a piece or pieces of equipment to a control device or back to a process.</p><p class="depth0">Connector means flanged, screwed, welded, or other joined fittings used to connect two pipe lines or a pipe line and a piece of equipment. For the purpose of reporting and recordkeeping, connector means flanged fittings that are not covered by insulation or other materials that prevent location of the fittings.</p><p class="depth0">Control device means an enclosed combustion device, vapor recovery system, or flare.</p><p class="depth0">Double block and bleed system means two block valves connected in series

with a bleed valve or line that can vent the line between the two block valves.</p><p class="depth0">Duct work means a conveyance system such as those commonly used for heating and ventilation systems. It is often made of sheet metal and often has sections connected by screws or crimping. Hard-piping is not ductwork.</p><p class="depth0">Equipment means each pump, compressor, pressure relief device, sampling connection system, open-ended valve or line, valve, connector, surge control vessel, bottoms receiver in VHAP service, and any control devices or systems required by this subpart.</p><p class="depth0">First attempt at repair means to take rapid action for the purpose of stopping or reducing leakage of organic material to atmosphere using best practices.</p><p class="depth0">In gas/vapor service means that a piece of equipment contains process fluid that is in the gaseous state at operating conditions.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas means gases that are combusted to derive useful work or heat.</p><p class="depth0">Fuel gas system means the offsite and onsite piping and flow and pressure control system that gathers gaseous stream(s) generated by onsite operations, may blend them with other sources of gas, and transports the gaseous stream for use as fuel gas in combustion devices or in-process combustion equipment, such as furnaces and gas turbines, either singly or in combination.</p><p class="depth0">Hard-piping means pipe or tubing that is manufactured and properly installed using good engineering judgement and standards such as ASME B31.3, Process Piping (available from the American Society of Mechanical Engineers, PO Box 2900, Fairfield, NJ 07007-2900).</p><p class="depth0">In liquid service means that a piece of equipment is not in gas/vapor service.</p><p class="depth0">In-situ sampling systems means nonextractive samplers or in-line samplers.</p><p class="depth0">In vacuum service means that equipment is operating at an internal pressure which is at least 5 kilopascals (kPa) (0.7 psia) below ambient pressure.</p><p class="depth0">In VHAP service means that a piece of equipment either contains or contacts a fluid (liquid or gas) that is at least 10 percent by weight a volatile hazardous air pollutant (VHAP) as determined according to the provisions of Sec. 61.245(d). The provisions of Sec. 61.245(d) also specify how to determine that a piece of equipment is not in VHAP service.</p><p class="depth0">In VOC service means, for the purposes of this subpart, that (a) the piece of equipment contains or contacts a process fluid that is at least 10 percent VOC by weight (see 40 CFR 60.2 for the definition of volatile organic compound or VOC and 40 CFR 60.485(d) to determine whether a piece of equipment is not in VOC service) and (b) the piece of equipment is not in heavy liquid service as defined in 40 CFR 60.481.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum true vapor pressure means the equilibrium partial pressure exerted by the total VHAP in the stored or transferred liquid at the temperature equal to the highest calendar-month average of the liquid storage or transfer temperature for liquids stored or transferred above or below the ambient temperature or at the local maximum monthly average temperature as reported by the National Weather Service for liquids stored or transferred at the ambient temperature, as determined:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> In accordance with methods described in American Petroleum Institute Publication 2517, Evaporative Loss From External Floating-Roof Tanks (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 61.18); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> As obtained from standard reference texts; or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> As determined by the American Society for Testing and Materials Method D2879-83, Standard Test Method for Vapor Pressure-Temperature Relationship and Initial Decomposition Temperature of Liquids by Isoteniscope (incorporated by reference as specified in Sec. 61.18); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Any other method approved by the Administrator.</p><p class="depth2">Open-ended valve or line means any valve, except pressure relief valves, having one side of the valve seat in contact with process fluid and one side open to atmosphere, either directly or through open piping.</p><p class="depth2">Pressure release means the emission of materials resulting from the system pressure being greater than the set pressure of the pressure relief device.</p><p class="depth2">Process unit means equipment assembled to produce a VHAP or its derivatives as intermediates or final products, or equipment assembled to use a VHAP in the production of a product. A process unit can operate independently if supplied with sufficient feed or raw materials and sufficient product storage facilities.</p><p class="depth2">Process unit shutdown means a work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit. An unscheduled work practice or operational procedure that stops production from a process unit or part of a process unit for less than 24 hours is not a process unit shutdown. The use of spare equipment and technically feasible bypassing of equipment without stopping production are not process unit shutdowns.</p><p class="depth2">Repaired means that equipment is adjusted, or otherwise altered, to eliminate a leak.</p><p class="depth2">Sampling connection system means an assembly of equipment within a process unit used during periods of representative operation to take samples of the process fluid. Equipment used to take non-routine grab samples is not considered a sampling connection system.</p><p class="depth2">Semiannual means a 6-month period; the first semiannual period concludes on the last day of the last month during the 180 days following initial startup for new sources; and the first semiannual period concludes on the last day of the last full month during the 180 days after the effective date of a specific subpart that references this subpart for existing sources.</p><p class="depth2">Sensor means a device that measures a physical quantity or the change in a physical quantity, such as temperature, pressure, flow rate, pH, or liquid level.</p><p class="depth2">Stuffing box pressure means the fluid (liquid or gas) pressure inside the casing or housing of a piece of equipment, on the process side of the inboard seal.</p><p class="depth2">Surge control vessel means feed drums, recycle drums, and intermediate vessels. Surge control vessels are used within a process unit when in-process storage, mixing, or management of flow rates of volumes is needed on a recurring or ongoing basis to assist in production of a product.</p><p class="depth2">Volatile hazardous air pollutant or VHAP means a substance regulated under this part for which a standard for equipment leaks of the substance has been proposed and promulgated. Benzene is a VHAP. Vinyl chloride is a VHAP.
