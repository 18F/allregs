                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The in vivo bone marrow cytogenetic test is a mutagenicity test for the detection of structural chromosomal aberrations. Chromosomal aberrations are generally evaluated in first post-treatment mitoses. With the majority of chemical mutagens, induced aberrations are of the chromatid type but chromosome type aberrations also occur.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. (1) Chromosome-type aberrations are changes which result from damage expressed in both sister chromatids at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Chromosome-type aberrations are changes which result from damage expressed in both sister chromatids at the same time.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Chromatid-type aberrations are damage expressed as breakage of single chromatids or breakage and/or reunion between chromatids.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Reference substances. Not applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test method--(1) Principle. Animals are exposed to test chemicals by appropriate routes and are sacrificed at sequential intervals. Chromosome preparations are made from bone marrow cells. The stained preparations are examined and metaphase cells are scored for chromosomal aberrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Principle. Animals are exposed to test chemicals by appropriate routes and are sacrificed at sequential intervals. Chromosome preparations are made from bone marrow cells. The stained preparations are examined and metaphase cells are scored for chromosomal aberrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Description. The method employs bone marrow of laboratory rodents which have been exposed to test chemicals. Prior to sacrifice, animals are further treated with a spindle inhibitor,

(e.g., colchicine or Colcemid [supreg]) to arrest the cells in c-metaphase. Chromosome preparations from the cells are stained and scored for chromosomal aberrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Animal selection--(i) Species and strain. Any appropriate mammalian species may be used. Examples of commonly used rodent species are rats, mice, and hamsters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain. Any appropriate mammalian species may be used. Examples of commonly used rodent species are rats, mice, and hamsters.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Age. Healthy young adult animals shall be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Number and sex. At least five female and five male animals per experimental and control group shall be used. Thus, 10 animals would be sacrificed per time per group treated with the test compound if several test times after treatment are included in the experimental schedule. The use of a single sex or smaller number of animals should be justified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Assignment to groups. Animals shall be randomized and assigned to treatment and control groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Control groups--(1) Concurrent controls. (i) Concurrent positive and negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in the assay.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Concurrent positive and negative (vehicle) controls shall be included in the assay.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Positive controls. A single dose positive control showing a significant response at any one time point is adequate. A compound known to produce chromosomal aberrations in vivo shall be employed as the positive control.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Test chemicals--(i) Vehicle. When possible, test chemicals shall be dissolved in isotonic saline or distilled water. Water insoluble chemicals may be dissolved or suspended in appropriate vehicles. The vehicles used shall neither interfere with the test chemical nor produce toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test compound should be employed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Vehicle.

The vehicles used shall neither interfere with the test chemical nor produce toxic effects. Fresh preparations of the test compound should be employed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Dose levels. For an initial assessment, one dose of the test substance may be used, the dose being the maximum tolerated dose (to a maximum of 5,000 mg/kg) or that producing some indication of cytotoxicity (e.g., partial inhibition of mitosis) or shall be the highest dose attainable (to a maximum of 5,000 mg/kg). Additional dose levels may be used. For determination of dose-response, at least three dose levels should be used.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Route of administration. The usual routes are oral or by intraperitoneal injection. Other routes may be appropriate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Treatment schedule. In general, test substances should be administered once only. However, based on toxicological information a repeated treatment schedule may be employed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Test performance--(1) Generally the test may be performed in two assays. (i) Animals should be treated with the test substance once at the selected dose(s). Samples should be taken at three times after treatment. For rodents, the central sampling interval is 24 hours. Since cell cycle kinetics can be influenced by the test substance, one earlier and one later sampling interval adequately spaced within the range of 6 to 48 hours shall be applied. Where the additional dose levels are tested in a subsequent experiment, samples shall be taken at the predetermined most sensitive interval or, if this is not established, at the central sampling time. If the most sensitive interval is known and documented with data, only this one time point shall be sampled.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Generally the test may be performed in two assays.

Where the additional dose levels are tested in a subsequent experiment, samples shall be taken at the predetermined most sensitive interval or, if this is not established, at 6 hours after the last treatment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Administration of spindle inhibitor. Prior to sacrifice, animals shall be injected IP with an appropriate dose of a spindle inhibitor (e.g., colchicine or Colcemid [supreg]) to arrest cells in c-metaphase.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Preparation of slides. Immediately after sacrifice, the bone marrow shall be obtained, exposed to hypotonic solution, and fixed. The cells shall then be spread on slides and stained. Chromosome preparations shall be made following standard procedures.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Analysis. The number of cells to be analyzed per animal should be based upon the number of animals used, the negative control frequency, the predetermined sensitivity, and the power chosen for the test. Slides shall be coded before microscopic analysis.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Data and report--(1) Treatment of results. Data should be presented in tabular form for both cells and animals. Different types of structural chromosomal aberrations should be listed with their numbers and a mean frequency per cell for each animal in all treated and control groups. Gaps (achromatic lesions) should be recorded separately and not included in the total abberration frequency. Differences among animals within each group should be considered before making comparisons between treated and control groups.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results.

Data should be evaluated by appropriate statistical methods.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Interpretation of results. (i) There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of structual chromosomal aberrations or abnormal metaphase figures. Another criterion may be based upon detection of a reproducible and statistically significant positive response for a least one of the test points.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> There are several criteria for determining a positive result, one of which is a statistically significant dose-related increase in the number of structual chromosomal aberrations or abnormal metaphase figures.
