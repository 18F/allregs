                                Sec. 1.165-11  Election in respect of losses attributable to a disaster.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In general. Section 165(h) provides that a taxpayer who has sustained a disaster loss which is allowable as a deduction under section 165(a) may, under certain circumstances, elect to deduct such loss for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Loss subject to election. The election provided by section 165(h) and paragraph (a) of this section applies only to a loss:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Arising from a disaster resulting in a determination referred to in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph and occurring--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> After December 31, 1971, or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1972, and during the period following the close of a particular taxable year of the taxpayer and on or before the due date for filing the income tax return for that taxable year (determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Occurring in an area subsequently determined by the President of the United States to warrant assistance by the Federal Government under the Disaster Relief Act of 1974; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Constituting a loss otherwise allowable as a deduction for the year in which the loss occurred under section 165(a) and the provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.165-1 through 1.165-10 which are applicable to such losses.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Amount of loss to which election applies. The amount of the loss to which section 165(h) and this section apply shall be the amount of the loss sustained during the period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section computed in accordance with the provisions of section 165 and those provisions of Sec. Sec. 1.165-1 through 1.165-10 which are applicable to such losses. However, for purposes of making such computation, the period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section shall be deemed to be a taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Scope and effect of election. An election made pursuant to section 165(h) and this section in respect of a loss arising from a particular disaster shall apply to the entire loss sustained by the taxpayer from such disaster during the period specified in paragraph (b)(1) of this section in the area specified in paragraph (b)(2) of this section. If such an election is made, the disaster to which the election relates will be deemed to have occurred in the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred, and the loss to which the election applies will be deemed to have been sustained in such preceding taxable year.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Time and manner of making election. An election to claim a deduction with respect to a disaster loss described in paragraph (b) of this section for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred must be made by filing a return, an amended return, or a claim for refund clearly showing that the election provided by section 165(h) has been made. In general, the return or claim should specify the date or dates of the disaster which gave rise to the loss, and the city, town, county, and State in which the property which was damaged or destroyed was located at the time of the disaster. An election in respect of a loss arising from a particular disaster occurring after December 31, 1971, must be made on or before the later of (1) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred, or (2) the due date of filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred. Such election shall be irrevocable after the later of (1) 90 days after the date on which the election was made, or (2) March 6, 1973. No revocation of such election shall be effective unless the amount of any credit or refund which resulted from such election is paid to the Internal Revenue Service within the revocation period described in the preceding sentence. However, in the case of a revocation made before receipt by the taxpayer of

a refund claimed pursuant to such election, the revocation shall be effective if the refund is repaid within 30 calendar days after such receipt. An election in respect of a loss arising from a particular disaster occurring after December 31, 1961, and before January 1, 1972, must be made on or before the later of (1) the 15th day of the third month following the month in which falls the date prescribed for the filing of the income tax return (determined without regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred, or (2) the due date for filing the income tax return (determined with regard to any extension of time granted the taxpayer for filing such return) for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year in which the disaster actually occurred. Such election shall be irrevocable after the date by which it must be made.
