L. 91-76 (42 U.S.C. 2461) which provides that the President may award the Medal to any ``astronaut who in the performance of his duties has distinguished himself by exceptionally meritorious efforts and contributions to the welfare of the Nation and of mankind.''</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Only one Congressional Space Medal of Honor may be awarded to a person. However, for each succeeding act that would otherwise justify the award of the Medal, the President may award a suitable bar or other device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The Medal may be awarded to any person who is or has been designated to travel in space and who has distinguished himself or herself while undertaking duties in preparation for, execution of, or subsequent to, but in connection with, a space flight.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The Medal may be awarded for actions occurring before the effective date of this subpart 1221.2, and, when appropriate, posthumously.</p>
