                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Valid program status of exchange visitor. Sponsors must notify  the Department of State via SEVIS of the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Validation of program participation. Sponsors must promptly  validate an exchange visitor's participation in their program. This will  change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from  ``Initial'' to ``Active.'' SEVIS records with program durations (e.g.,  the period between the ``Program Begin Date'' and ``Program End Date'')  of 30 days or more must be validated within 30 days following the  ``Program Begin Date'' identified in SEVIS. SEVIS records with program  durations that are less than 30 days must be validated prior to the  ``Program End Date'' reflected in SEVIS. As part of the validation  process, sponsors may amend the program begin date and must update the  SEVIS record to reflect the actual and current U.S. address and site of  activity in SEVIS. The status of SEVIS records that are not validated  according to this schedule will automatically change to ``Invalid'' or  ``No Show''. Accompanying spouses and dependents' SEVIS records are  automatically validated upon validation of the exchange visitors' SEVIS  records.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Failure of an exchange visitor to begin program. Sponsors must  report in SEVIS, no later than 30 calendar days after the ``Program  Begin Date'' listed in SEVIS, the failure of an exchange visitor to  report to his or her sponsor upon entry in the United States (i.e.,  failure of exchange visitor to begin an exchange visitor program as  scheduled). This will change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS  record from ``Initial'' to ``No Show.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> End of an exchange visitor's program. Sponsors must report in  SEVIS any withdrawal from or early completion of an exchange visitor's  program that occurs prior to the ``Program End Date'' listed in SEVIS on  the exchange visitor's Form DS-2019. Sponsors must not alter the  ``Program End Date'' field, but should enter the date of program  completion in the ``Effective Date of Completion'' field. This will  change the status of the exchange visitor's SEVIS record from ``Active''  to ``Inactive.'' Such notification in SEVIS ends a sponsor's  programmatic obligations to the exchange visitor and/or his or her  accompanying spouse and dependents.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Accompanying spouse and dependent records. Sponsors must report  in SEVIS if accompanying spouses and/or dependents depart from the  United States prior to the exchange visitors' departure dates.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Termination of an exchange visitor's program. Sponsors must  promptly report in SEVIS the involuntary termination of an exchange  visitor's program. Sponsors must not alter the ``Program End Date''  field, but should enter the date of program termination in the  ``Effective Date of Termination'' field. This will change the status of  the SEVIS record from ``Active'' to ``Terminated''. Such notification in  SEVIS ends a sponsor's programmatic obligation to the exchange visitor  and his or her accompanying spouse and dependents, if any, and prevents  the sponsor from thereafter extending the exchange visitor's duration of  participation, transferring the exchange visitor to another program, or  changing the exchange visitor's category. Sponsors must not terminate  the program of an exchange visitor who voluntarily ends his or her  program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Change of circumstance of an exchange visitor. Sponsors must  promptly notify the Department of State via SEVIS of any of the  following circumstances:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Change in the actual and current U.S. address. Sponsors must  ensure that the actual and current U.S. addresses of an exchange visitor  are reported in SEVIS:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Sponsors must report the U.S. mailing address (i.e., provide a  P.O. Box number) in SEVIS in those limited cases where mail cannot be  delivered to the exchange visitor's actual and current U.S. address  (e.g., the exchange visitor resides in a campus setting); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If a U.S. mailing address is reported to SEVIS, sponsors must  also maintain records in SEVIS of actual and current U.S. addresses  (e.g., dormitory, building and room number) for such exchange visitors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in site of activity. Sponsors must report in SEVIS any  change   to an exchange visitor's site of activity by entering the new site  within ten business days of notification of such a change where sponsor  rules or regulations permit such a change. Sponsors must promptly enter  any change in the site of activity in those instances where the sponsor  is responsible for the placement. Sponsors must identify the ``primary''  site of activity of an exchange visitor if multiple sites of activity  are reported in SEVIS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Change in sponsor's circumstance. Sponsors must report within  ten business days in SEVIS or directly to the Department of State, if  appropriate, any material changes to their exchange visitor program as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Change of business and/or mailing address, telephone number,  facsimile number, or email address;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Change in the composition of the sponsor organization that  affects its status as a United States Person as defined in Sec. 62.2,  which includes a new Employment Identification Number (EIN);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Change of Responsible Officer or Alternate Responsible Officer;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Major change of ownership or control of the sponsor's  organization as defined in Sec. 62.60(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Change of the sponsor's principal place of business to a  location outside the United States;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Change in financial circumstances that may render the sponsor  unable to comply with its obligations as set forth in Sec. 62.9(e);</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Loss of licensure or accreditation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Loss or theft of Forms DS-2019, in which case a sponsor must  notify the Department of State promptly by telephone or email of the  SEVIS identification numbers of such Forms DS-2019 that have been lost  or stolen;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> A decision by the sponsor to voluntarily cancel (withdraw) its  exchange visitor program designation; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Any other material facts or events that may have an impact on  the sponsor's ability to properly administer or conduct its exchange  visitor program.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Serious problem or controversy. Sponsors must inform the  Department of State on or before the next business day by telephone  (confirmed promptly in writing by facsimile or email) of any  investigations of an exchange visitor's site of activity or serious  problem or controversy that could be expected to bring the Department of  State, the Exchange Visitor Program, or the sponsor's exchange visitor  program into notoriety or disrepute, including any potential litigation  related to a sponsor's exchange visitor program, in which the sponsor or  an exchange visitor may be a named party.
