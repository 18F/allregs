                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Public service is a public trust. Each employee has a responsibility to the United States Government and its citizens to place loyalty to the Constitution, laws and ethical principles above private gain. To ensure that every citizen can have complete confidence in the integrity of the Federal Government, each employee shall respect and adhere to the principles of ethical conduct set forth in this section, as well as the implementing standards contained in this part and in supplemental agency regulations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General principles. The following general principles apply to every employee and may form the basis for the standards contained in this part. Where a situation is not covered by the standards set forth in this part, employees shall apply the principles set forth in this section in determining whether their conduct is proper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Public service is a public trust, requiring employees to place loyalty to the Constitution, the laws and ethical principles above private gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Employees shall not hold financial interests that conflict with the conscientious performance of duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Employees shall not engage in financial transactions using nonpublic Government information or allow the improper use of such information to further any private interest.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> An employee shall not, except as permitted by subpart B of this part, solicit or accept any gift or other item of monetary value from any person or entity seeking official action from, doing business with, or conducting activities regulated by the employee's agency, or whose interests may be substantially affected by the performance or nonperformance of the employee's duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Employees shall put forth honest effort in the performance of their duties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Employees shall not knowingly make unauthorized commitments or promises of any kind purporting to bind the Government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Employees shall not use public office for private gain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Employees shall act impartially and not give preferential treatment to any private organization or individual.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Employees shall protect and conserve Federal property and shall not use it for other than authorized activities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Employees shall not engage in outside employment or activities, including seeking or negotiating for employment, that conflict with official Government duties and responsibilities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Employees shall disclose waste, fraud, abuse, and corruption to appropriate authorities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Employees shall satisfy in good faith their obligations as citizens, including all just financial obligations, especially those--such as Federal, State, or local taxes--that are imposed by law.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Employees shall adhere to all laws and regulations that provide equal opportunity for all Americans regardless of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or handicap.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> Employees shall endeavor to avoid any actions creating the appearance that they are violating the law or the ethical standards set forth in this part. Whether particular circumstances create an appearance that the law or these standards have been violated shall be determined from the perspective of a reasonable person with knowledge of the relevant facts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Related statutes. In addition to the standards of ethical conduct set forth in this part, there are conflict of interest statutes that prohibit certain conduct. Criminal conflict of interest statutes of general applicability to all employees, 18 U.S.C. 201, 203, 205, 208, and 209, are summarized in the appropriate subparts of this part and must be taken into consideration in determining whether conduct is proper. Citations to other generally applicable statutes relating to employee conduct are set forth in subpart I and employees are further cautioned that there may be additional statutory and regulatory restrictions applicable to them generally or as employees of their specific agencies. Because an employee is considered to be on notice of the requirements of any statute, an employee should not rely upon any description or synopsis of a statutory restriction, but should refer to the statute itself and obtain the advice of an agency ethics official as needed.</p>
