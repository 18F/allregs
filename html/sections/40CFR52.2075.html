                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The requirements of Sec. 51.211 of this chapter are not met since the plan lacks adequate legal authority to require owners or operators of stationary sources to maintain records of, and periodically report information as may be necessary to enable the state to determine whether such sources are in compliance with applicable portions of the control strategy.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Regulation for source recordkeeping and reporting.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The owner or operator of all stationary sources which have the potential to emit a total of 100 tons or more per year of any one air contaminant for which there is a national standard shall maintain records of, and submit to the Director, data on operational processes, fuel usage, emission, stack parameters, boiler capacities, types of equipment generating air contaminants and air contaminant control devices that may be necessary to determine if the source is in compliance with applicable rules and regulations of the Department. Upon notification of the Administrator, or the Director of the Rhode Island Department of Health, sources with the potential to emit less than 100 tons per year of any air contaminant shall also be subject to the requirements of this paragraph. For the purposes of this paragraph, potential emissions shall be calculated at the design load assuming no control equipment is in use and fuel having a sulfur content of 2.2 percent by weight (dry basis) is being burned.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information recorded by the owner or operator of a stationary source shall be summarized and reported to the Director of the Department of Health on forms furnished by him. They shall be submitted within 30 days following the end of the reporting period. Reporting periods are January 1 to June 30 and July 1 to December 31.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Information recorded by the owner or operator and copies of the summarizing reports submitted to the Director shall be retained by the owner or operator for two years after the date on which the pertinent report is submitted.
