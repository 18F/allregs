If there were no deviations from the requirements of this section during the reporting period, then the compliance report must include a statement that there were no deviations. For purposes of this section, deviations include, but are not limited to, emissions in excess of applicable emission standards established by this section, failure to continuously operate an air pollution control device in accordance with operating requirements designed to assure compliance with emission standards, failure to continuously operate CEMS required by this section, and failure to maintain records or submit reports required by this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(7)</em> Each owner or operator of a CEMS required by this section must submit quarterly excess emissions and monitoring system performance reports for each pollutant monitored for each BART affected unit monitored. All reports must be postmarked by the 30\th\ day following the end of each three-month period of a calendar year (January-March, April-June, July-September, October-December) and must include, at a minimum, the requirements at paragraphs (e)(7)(i)-(xv) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Company name and address.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Identification and description of the process unit being monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> The dates covered by the reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Total source operating hours for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Monitor manufacturer, monitor model number and monitor serial number.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Pollutant monitored.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Emission limitation for the monitored pollutant.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> Date of latest CEMS certification or audit.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ix)</em> A description of any changes in continuous monitoring systems, processes, or controls since the last reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(x)</em> A table summarizing the total duration of excess emissions, as defined at paragraphs (e)(7)(x)(A)-(B) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of those excess emissions (startup/shutdown, control equipment problems, process problems, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of excess emissions (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(x)(C) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of this section, an excess emission is defined as any 30-day rolling average period, including periods of startup, shutdown and malfunction, during which the 30-day rolling average emissions of either regulated pollutant (SO2 and NOX), as measured by a CEMS, exceeds the applicable emission standards in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of this section, if a facility calculates a 30-day rolling average emission rate in accordance with this section which exceeds the applicable emission standards of this section, then it will be considered 30 days of excess emissions. If the following 30-day rolling average emission rate is calculated and found to exceed the applicable emission standards of this section as well, then it will add one more day to the total days of excess emissions (i.e., 31 days). Similarly, if an excess emission is calculated for a 30-day rolling average period and no additional excess emissions are calculated until 15 days after the first, then that new excess emission will add 15 days to the total days of excess emissions (i.e.,

30 + 15 = 45). For purposes of this section, if an excess emission is calculated for any period of time within a reporting period, there will be no fewer than 30 days of excess emissions but there should be no more than 121 days of excess emissions for a reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> For purposes of this section, the total percent of excess emissions will be determined by summing all periods of excess emissions (in days) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total BART affected unit operating days for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period. An operating day, as defined previously, is any day during which fuel is fired in the BART affected unit for any period of time. Because of the possible overlap of 30-day rolling average excess emissions across quarters, there are some situations where the total percent of excess emissions could exceed 100 percent. This extreme situation would only result from serious excess emissions problems where excess emissions occur for nearly every day during a reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xi)</em> A table summarizing the total duration of monitor downtime, as defined at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(A) of this section, for the reporting period broken down by the cause of the monitor downtime (monitor equipment malfunctions, non-monitor equipment malfunctions, quality assurance calibration, other known causes, unknown causes), and the total percent of monitor downtime (for all causes) for the reporting period calculated as described at paragraph (e)(7)(xi)(B) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> For purposes of this section, monitor downtime is defined as any period of time (in hours) during which the required monitoring system was not measuring emissions from the BART affected unit. This includes any period of CEMS QA/QC, daily zero and span checks, and similar activities.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> For purposes of this section, the total percent of monitor downtime will be determined by summing all periods of monitor downtime (in hours) for the reporting period, dividing that number by the total number of BART affected unit operating hours for the reporting period, and then multiplying by 100 to get the total percent of excess emissions for the reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xii)</em> A table which identifies each period of excess emissions for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xii)(A)-(F) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of each excess emission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The beginning and end time of each excess emission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The pollutant for which an excess emission occurred.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The magnitude of the excess emission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> The cause of the excess emission.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(F)</em> The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted to minimize or eliminate the excess emissions and prevent such excess emission from occurring again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiii)</em> A table which identifies each period of monitor downtime for the reporting period and includes, at a minimum, the information in paragraphs (e)(7)(xiii)(A)-(D) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The date of each period of monitor downtime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The beginning and end time of each period of monitor downtime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The cause of the period of monitor downtime.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> The corrective action taken or preventative measures adopted for system repairs or adjustments to minimize or eliminate monitor downtime and prevent such downtime from occurring again.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xiv)</em> If there were no periods of excess emissions during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of excess emissions during this reporting period.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(xv)</em> If there were no periods of monitor downtime, except for daily zero and span checks, during the reporting period, then the excess emission report must include a statement which says there were no periods of monitor downtime during this reporting period except for the daily zero and span checks.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(8)</em> The owner or operator of each CEMS required by this section must develop and submit for review and approval by the Regional Administrator a site specific monitoring plan.
