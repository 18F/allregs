                            <p class="depth0">This part sets forth the conditions that all laboratories must meet  to be certified to perform testing on human specimens under the Clinical  Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA). It implements sections  1861(e) and (j), the sentence following section 1861(s)(13), and  1902(a)(9) of the Social Security Act, and section 353 of the Public  Health Service Act, as amended by section 2 of the Taking Essential  Steps for Testing Act of 2012. This part applies to all laboratories as  defined under ``laboratory'' in Sec. 493.2 of this part. This part also  applies to laboratories seeking payment under the Medicare and Medicaid  programs. The requirements are the same for Medicare approval as for  CLIA certification.  [57 FR 7139, Feb. 28, 1992, as amended at 79 FR 25480, May 2, 2014]</p>
