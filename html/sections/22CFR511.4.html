have occurred by reason of the incident. The claimant may, if he/she desires, file a brief with his/her claim setting forth the law or other arguments in support of his/her claim. In cases involving claims by more than one person arising from a single accident or incident, individual claim forms shall be used. A claim which should have been presented to the Board, but which was mistakenly addressed to or filed with another Federal Agency, shall be deemed to have been presented to the Board as of the date the claim is received by the Board. If a claim is mistakenly addressed to or filed with the Board, the Board shall transfer it forthwith to the appropriate Agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A claimant shall mail, or deliver his/her claim to the Office of the General Counsel and Congressional Liaison, Broadcasting Board of Governors, 301 4th Street, SW., Washington, DC 20547.
