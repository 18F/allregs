This waiver shall not relieve a commercial vessel loading or unloading explosives at the Department of Defense waterfront installations from the requirement of securing a permit from the Coast Guard for such operations with respect to quantitative or other restrictions imposed by the Coast Guard on the basis of each vessel's ability to meet prescribed stowage and handling requirements.
