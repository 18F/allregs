An application for further review shall contain the following information:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Information identifying the protest to which it applies and the protesting party and his importer number;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Allegations that the protesting party:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Has not previously received an adverse administrative decision from the Commissioner of Customs or his designee nor has presently pending an application for an administrative decision on the same claim with respect to the same category of merchandise; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Has not received a final adverse decision from the Customs courts on the same claim with respect to the same category of merchandise and does not have an action involving such a claim pending before the Customs courts.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A statement of any facts or additional legal arguments, not part of the record, upon which the protesting party relies, including the criterion set forth in Sec. 174.24 which justifies further review. A showing of facts that support the allegation of a criterion set forth in Sec. 174.24(c) will constitute a ground for the granting of further review in circumstances where the applicant's inability to affirmatively make the allegations described in paragraph (b)(2) of this section would otherwise result in its denial.
