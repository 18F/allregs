                                Sec. 702.506  Annual supervisory stress testing.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The supervisory stress tests consist of  baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios, which NCUA will  provide by December 1 of a calendar year. The tests will be based on the  covered credit union's financial data as of September 30 of that year,  or such other date as directed by NCUA. The tests will take into account  all relevant exposures and activities of a credit union to evaluate its  ability to absorb losses in specified scenarios over a 9-quarter  horizon. The minimum stress test capital ratio is 5 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> NCUA-run tests. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this  section, NCUA will conduct the tests described in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Credit union-run tests under NCUA supervision. After NCUA has  completed three consecutive supervisory stress tests, a covered credit  union may, with NCUA approval, conduct the tests described in this  section. A covered credit union must submit its request to NCUA to  conduct its own stress test by July 31 for the following annual cycle.  NCUA will approve or decline the credit union's request by August 31.  The credit union must include the results of the tests in the capital  plan it submits under Sec. 702.504. NCUA reserves the ability to conduct  the tests described in this section on any covered credit union at any  time. Where both NCUA and a covered credit union have conducted the  tests, the results of NCUA's tests will determine whether the covered  credit union has met the requirements of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Newly covered credit union. A credit union that becomes a  covered credit union after the effective date of this regulation must  have three NCUA-run stress tests before it can seek NCUA approval to  conduct credit union-run stress tests.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Potential impact on capital. In conducting a stress test under  this subpart, during each quarter of the stress test horizon, NCUA or  the covered credit union will estimate the following for each scenario:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Losses, pre-provision net revenues, loan and lease loss  provisions, and net income; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The potential impact on the stress test capital ratio,  incorporating the effects of any capital action over the 9-quarter  stress test horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses  appropriate for credit exposures throughout the horizon. NCUA or the  covered credit union will conduct the stress test without assuming any  risk mitigation actions on the part of the   covered credit union, except those existing and identified as part of  the covered credit union's balance sheet, or off-balance sheet  positions, such as asset sales or derivatives positions, on the date of  the stress test.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Information collection. Upon request, the covered credit union  must provide NCUA with any relevant qualitative or quantitative  information requested by NCUA pertinent to the stress test under this  section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Stress test results. NCUA will provide each covered credit union  with the results of the stress test by May 31 of the year following the  effective testing date. A credit union conducting its own stress test  must provide NCUA the results of its stress test with its capital plan  by February 28 of the year following the effective testing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Supervisory actions. If NCUA-run stress tests show that a  covered credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test  capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed  conditions in each quarter of the 9-quarter horizon, the credit union  must provide NCUA, within 90 days of receipt of the stress test results,  a stress test capital enhancement plan showing how it will meet that  target. If the credit union-run stress tests show that it does not have  the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more  under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the 9-quarter  horizon, the credit union must incorporate a stress test capital  enhancement plan into its capital plan. Any affected credit union  operating without a stress test capital enhancement plan accepted by  NCUA may be subject to supervisory actions on the part of NCUA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Consultation on proposed action. Before taking any action under  this section against a federally insured, state-chartered credit union,  NCUA will consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate State  official.</p>
