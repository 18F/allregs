                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General requirements. The supervisory stress tests consist of baseline, adverse, and severely adverse scenarios, which NCUA will provide by February 28 of each year. The tests will be based on the credit union's financial data as of December 31 of the preceding calendar year, or such other date as directed by NCUA. The tests will take into account all relevant exposures and activities of a credit union to evaluate its ability to absorb losses in specified scenarios over a 9-quarter horizon. The minimum stress test capital ratio is 5 percent.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> NCUA-run tests. Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, NCUA will conduct the tests described in this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Credit union-run tests under NCUA supervision. After NCUA has completed three consecutive supervisory stress tests of a covered credit union, the covered credit union may, with NCUA approval, conduct the tests described in this subpart. A covered credit union must submit its request to NCUA to conduct its own stress test by November 30 for the following annual cycle. NCUA will approve or decline the credit union's request by December 31 of the year in which the credit union submitted its request. NCUA reserves the right to conduct the tests described in this section on any covered credit union at any time. Where both NCUA and a covered credit union have conducted the tests, the results of NCUA's tests will determine whether the covered credit union has met the requirements of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Potential impact on capital. In conducting stress tests under this subpart, NCUA or the covered credit union will

estimate the following for each scenario during each quarter of the stress test horizon:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Losses, pre-provision net revenues, loan and lease loss provisions, and net income; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The potential impact on the stress test capital ratio, incorporating the effects of any capital action over the 9-quarter stress test horizon and maintenance of an allowance for loan losses appropriate for credit exposures throughout the horizon. NCUA or the covered credit union will conduct the stress tests without assuming any risk mitigation actions on the part of the covered credit union, except those existing and identified as part of the covered credit union's balance sheet, or off-balance sheet positions, such as asset sales or derivatives positions, on the date of the stress test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Information collection. Upon request, the covered credit union must provide NCUA with any relevant qualitative or quantitative information requested by NCUA pertinent to the stress tests under this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Stress test results. NCUA will provide each covered credit union with the results of the stress tests by August 31 of the year in which it conducted the tests. A credit union conducting its own stress tests must incorporate the test results in its capital plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> Supervisory actions. If NCUA-run stress tests show that a covered credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the 9-quarter horizon, the credit union must provide NCUA, by November 30 of the calendar year in which NCUA conducted the tests, a stress test capital enhancement plan showing how it will meet that target. If credit union-run stress tests show that a covered credit union does not have the ability to maintain a stress test capital ratio of 5 percent or more under expected and stressed conditions in each quarter of the 9-quarter horizon, the credit union must incorporate a stress test capital enhancement plan into its capital plan. Any affected credit union operating without a stress test capital enhancement plan accepted by NCUA may be subject to supervisory actions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Consultation on proposed action. Before taking any action under this section against a federally insured, state-chartered credit union, NCUA will consult and work cooperatively with the appropriate State official.
[79 FR 24315, Apr. 30, 2014, as amended at 80 FR 48012, Aug. 11, 2015]</p><p class="depth0">Sec. Appendix A to Part 702--Gross-Up Approach, and Look-Through</p><p class="depth0">Approaches</p><p class="depth0">Instead of using the risk weights assigned in Sec. 702.104(c)(2) a credit union may determine the risk weight of certain investment funds, and the risk weight of a non-subordinated or subordinated tranche of any investment as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gross-up approach--(1) Applicability. Section 702.104(c)(3)(iii)(A) of this part provides that, a credit union may use the gross-up approach in this appendix to determine the risk weight of the carrying value of non-subordinated or subordinated tranches of any investment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Calculation. To use the gross-up approach, a credit union must calculate the following four inputs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Pro rata share, which is the par value of the credit union's exposure as a percent of the par value of the tranche in which the securitization exposure resides;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Enhanced amount, which is the par value of tranches that are more senior to the tranche in which the credit union's securitization resides;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Exposure amount, which is the amortized cost for investments classified as held-to-maturity and available-for-sale, and the fair value for trading securities; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Risk weight, which is the weighted-average risk weight of underlying exposures of the securitization as calculated under this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Credit equivalent amount. The ``credit equivalent amount'' of a securitization exposure under this part equals the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The exposure amount of the credit union's exposure; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The pro rata share multiplied by the enhanced amount, each calculated in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Risk-weighted assets. To calculate risk-weighted assets for a securitization exposure under the gross-up approach, a credit union must apply the risk weight required under paragraph (a)(2) of this appendix to the credit equivalent amount calculated in paragraph (a)(3) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> Securitization exposure defined. For purposes of this this paragraph (a), ``securitization exposure'' means:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> A credit exposure that arises from a securitization; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> An exposure that directly or indirectly references a securitization exposure described in paragraph (a)(5)(i) of this appendix.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(6)</em> Securitization defined. For purposes of this paragraph (a), ``securitization'' means a transaction in which:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The credit risk associated with the underlying exposures has been separated into at least two tranches reflecting different levels of seniority;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Performance of the securitization exposures depends upon the performance of the underlying exposures; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> All or substantially all of the underlying exposures are financial exposures (such as loans, receivables, asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, or other debt securities).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Look-through approaches.--(1) Applicability. Section 702.104(c)(3)(iii)(B) provides that, a credit union may use one of the look-through approaches in this appendix to determine the risk weight of the exposure amount of any investment fund, or the holding of separate account insurance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Full look-through approach. (i) General. A credit union that is able to calculate a risk-weighted asset amount for its proportional ownership share of each exposure held by the investment fund may set the risk-weighted asset amount of the credit union's exposure to the fund equal to the product of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> The aggregate risk-weighted asset amounts of the exposures held by the fund as if they were held directly by the credit union; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The credit union's proportional ownership share of the fund.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Holding report. To calculate the risk-weighted amount under paragraph (b)(2)(i) of this appendix, a credit union should:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Use the most recently issued investment fund holding report; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Use an investment fund holding report that reflects holding that are not older than 6-months from the quarter-end effective date (as defined in Sec. 702.101(c)(1).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Simple modified look-through approach. Under the simple modified look-through approach, the risk-weighted asset amount for a credit union's exposure to an investment fund equals the exposure amount multiplied by the highest risk weight that applies to any exposure the fund is permitted to hold under the prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar agreement that defines the fund's permissible investments (excluding derivative contracts that are used for hedging rather than speculative purposes and that do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Alternative modified look-through approach. Under the alternative modified look-through approach, a credit union may assign the credit union's exposure amount to an investment fund on a pro rata basis to different risk weight categories under subpart A of this part based on the investment limits in the fund's prospectus, partnership agreement, or similar contract that defines the fund's permissible investments. The risk-weighted asset amount for the credit union's exposure to the investment fund equals the sum of each portion of the exposure amount assigned to an exposure type multiplied by the applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part. If the sum of the investment limits for all exposure types within the fund exceeds 100 percent, the credit union must assume that the fund invests to the maximum extent permitted under its investment limits in the exposure type with the highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part and continues to make investments in order of the exposure type with the next highest applicable risk weight under subpart A of this part until the maximum total investment level is reached. If more than one exposure type applies to an exposure, the credit union must use the highest applicable risk weight. A credit union may exclude derivative contracts held by the fund that are used for hedging rather than for speculative purposes and do not constitute a material portion of the fund's exposures.</p><p class="depth0">Effective Date Note: At 80 FR 66722, Oct. 29, 2015, appendix A to part 702 was added, effective January 1, 2019.</p>
