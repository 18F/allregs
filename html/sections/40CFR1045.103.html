                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Duty-cycle emission standards. Starting in the 2010 model year,  exhaust emissions from your outboard and personal watercraft engines may  not exceed emission standards as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measure emissions using the applicable steady-state test  procedures described in subpart F of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The exhaust emission standards from the following table apply:</p><p class="depth3">Table 1 to Sec.   1045.103--Emission Standards for Outboard and Personal Watercraft Engines (g/kW-hr) ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3">Pollutant                       Power \1\                         Emission standard ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- HC + NOX.............................  P <=4.3 kW.............  30.0</p><p class="depth3">P 4.3 kW....  2.1 + 0.09 x (151 + 557/P\0.9\) CO...................................  P <=40 kW..............  500 - 5.0 x P</p><p class="depth3">P 40 kW.....  300 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ Power (P) = maximum engine power for the engine family, in kilowatts (kW).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For engines whose standard depends on maximum engine power,  round the calculated HC+NOX emission standard to the nearest  0.1 g/kW-hr; round the calculated CO emission standard to the nearest g/ kW-hr. Determine maximum engine power for the engine family as described  in Sec.  1045.140.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Averaging, banking, and trading. You may generate or use  emission credits under the averaging, banking, and trading (ABT) program  described in subpart H of this part for demonstrating compliance with  HC+NOX emission standards. For CO emissions, you may generate  or use emission credits for averaging as described in subpart H of this  part, but such credits may not be banked or traded. To generate or use  emission credits, you must specify a family emission limit for each  pollutant you include in the ABT program for each engine family. These  family emission limits serve as the emission standards for the engine  family with respect to all required testing instead of the standards  specified in this section. An engine family meets emission standards  even if its family emission limit is higher than the standard, as long  as you show that the whole averaging set of applicable engine families  meets the emission standards using emission credits and the engines  within the family meet the family emission limit. The following FEL caps  apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For engines with maximum engine power at or below 4.3 kW, the  maximum value of the family emission limit for HC+NOX is 81.0  g/kW-hr. For all other engines, the maximum value of the family emission  limit for HC+NOX is defined by the following formula, with  results rounded to the nearest 0.1 g/kW-hr: [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR08OC08.088</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For engines with maximum engine power above 40 kW, the maximum  value of the family emission limit for CO is 450 g/kW-hr. For all other  engines, the maximum value is defined by the following formula, with  results rounded to the nearest g/kW-hr:  FELmax,CO = 650 - 5.0 x P</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Not-to-exceed emission standards. Exhaust emissions may not  exceed the not-to-exceed standards specified in Sec.  1045.107.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Fuel types. The exhaust emission standards in this section apply  for engines using the fuel type on which the engines in the engine  family are designed to operate. You must meet the numerical emission  standards for hydrocarbons in this section based on the following types  of hydrocarbon emissions for engines powered by the following fuels:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Alcohol-fueled engines: THCE emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Natural gas-fueled engines: NMHC emissions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other engines: THC emissions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Useful life. Your engines must meet the exhaust emission  standards in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section over the full  useful life as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For outboard engines, the minimum useful life is 350 hours of  engine operation or 10 years, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For personal watercraft engines, the minimum useful life is 350  hours of engine operation or 5 years, whichever comes first.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> You must specify a longer useful life in terms of hours for the  engine family if the average service life of your vehicles is longer  than the minimum value, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except as allowed by paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section, your  useful life (in hours) may not be less than either of the following:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Your projected operating life from advertisements or other  marketing materials for any engines in the engine family.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Your basic mechanical warranty for any engines in the engine  family.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Your useful life may be based on the average service life of  vehicles in the engine family if you show that the average service life  is less than the useful life required by paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this  section, but more than the minimum useful life (350 hours of engine  operation). In determining the actual average service life of vehicles  in an engine family, we will consider all available information and  analyses. Survey data is allowed but not required to make this showing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Applicability for testing. The duty-cycle emission standards in  this subpart apply to all testing performed according to the procedures  in Sec.  1045.505, including certification, production-line, and in-use  testing. The not-to-exceed standards apply for all testing performed  according to the procedures of subpart F of this part.  [73 FR 59194, Oct. 8, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 23019, Apr. 30, 2010]</p>
