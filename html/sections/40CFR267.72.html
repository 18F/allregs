                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manifest discrepancies are differences between the quantity or type of hazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity or type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives. Significant discrepancies in quantity are:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For batch waste, any variation in piece count, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload. Significant

discrepancies in type are obvious differences which can be discovered by inspection or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not reported on the manifest or shipping paper.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Upon discovering a significant discrepancy, the owner or operator must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or transporter (e.g., with telephone conversations). If the discrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner or operator must immediately submit to the Regional Administrator a letter describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a copy of the manifest or shipping paper at issue.</p>
