                                Sec. 600.115-11  Criteria for determining the fuel economy label calculation method.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">This section provides the criteria to determine if the derived 5- cycle method for determining fuel economy label values, as specified in  Sec. 600.210-08(a)(2) or (b)(2) or Sec. 600.210-12(a)(2) or (b)(2), as  applicable, may be used to determine label values. Separate criteria  apply to city and highway fuel economy for each test group. The  provisions of this section are optional. If this option is not chosen,  or if the criteria provided in this section are not met, fuel economy  label values must be determined according to the vehicle-specific 5- cycle method specified in Sec. 600.210-08(a)(1) or (b)(1) or  Sec. 600.210-12(a)(1) or (b)(1), as applicable. However, dedicated  alternative-fuel vehicles, dual fuel vehicles when operating on the  alternative fuel, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles while operating in  charge-depleting mode, MDPVs, and vehicles imported by Independent  Commercial Importers may use the derived 5-cycle method for determining  fuel economy label values whether or not the criteria provided in this  section are met. Manufacturers may alternatively account for this effect  by multiplying 2-cycle fuel economy values by 0.7 and dividing 2-cycle  CO2 emission values by 0.7.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> City fuel economy criterion. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For each test group certified  for emission compliance under Sec. 86.1848 of this chapter, the FTP,  HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests determined to be official under  Sec. 86.1835 of this chapter are used to calculate the vehicle-specific  5-cycle city fuel economy which is then compared to the derived 5-cycle  city fuel economy, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The vehicle-specific 5-cycle city fuel economy from the official  FTP, HFET, US06, SC03 and Cold FTP tests for the test group is  determined according to the provisions of Sec. 600.114-08(a) or (c) or  Sec. 600.114-12(a) or (c) and rounded to the nearest one tenth of a mile  per gallon.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Using the same FTP data as used in paragraph (a)(1)(i) of this  section, the corresponding derived 5-cycle city fuel economy is  calculated according to the following equation:   [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR06JY11.033  Where:  City Intercept = Intercept determined by the Administrator.
