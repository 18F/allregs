Except as provided in Sec. 64.604, the  Commission shall not refuse to certify a state program based solely on  the method such state will implement for funding intrastate TRS, but  funding mechanisms, if labeled, shall be labeled in a manner that  promote national understanding of TRS and do not offend the public.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Suspension or revocation of state certification. The  Commission may suspend or revoke such certification if, after notice and  opportunity for hearing, the Commission determines that such  certification is no longer warranted.

A provider  that fails to file a compliance plan shall not be entitled to  compensation for the provision of VRS during the period of  noncompliance.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> If, at any time, the Commission determines that a VRS provider's  compliance plan currently on file is inadequate to prevent waste, fraud,  and abuse of the TRS Fund, the Commission shall so notify the provider,  shall explain the reasons the plan is inadequate, and shall direct the  provider to correct the identified defects and submit an amended  compliance plan reflecting such correction within a specified time  period not to exceed 60 days. A provider that fails to comply with such  directive shall not be entitled to compensation for the provision of VRS   during the period of noncompliance. A submitted compliance plan shall  not be prima facie evidence of the plan's adequacy; nor shall it be  evidence that the provider has fulfilled its obligations under Sec.  64.604(c)(13) of this subpart.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Unauthorized service interruptions. </p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Each certified VRS  provider must provide Internet-based TRS without unauthorized voluntary  service interruptions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A VRS provider seeking to voluntarily interrupt service for a  period of 30 minutes or more in duration must first obtain Commission  authorization by submitting a written request to the Commission's  Consumer and Governmental Affairs Bureau (CGB) at least 60 days prior to  any planned service interruption, with detailed information of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Its justification for such interruption;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Its plan to notify customers about the impending interruption;  and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Its plans for resuming service, so as to minimize the impact  of such disruption on consumers through a smooth transition of temporary  service to another provider, and restoration of its service at the  completion of such interruption. CGB will grant or deny such a request  and provide a response to the provider at least 35 days prior to the  proposed interruption, in order to afford an adequate period of  notification to consumers. In evaluating such a request, CGB will  consider such factors as the length of time of the proposed  interruption, the reason for such interruption, the frequency with which  such requests have been made by the provider in the past, the potential  impact of the interruption on consumers, and the provider's plans for a  smooth service restoration.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> In the event of an unforeseen service interruption due to  circumstances beyond an Internet-based TRS service provider's control,  or in the event of a VRS provider's voluntary service interruption of  less than 30 minutes in duration, the provider must submit a written  notification to CGB within two business days of the commencement of the  service interruption, with an explanation of when and how the provider  has restored service or the provider's plan to do so imminently. In the  event the provider has not restored service at the time such report is  filed, the provider must submit a second report within two business days  of the restoration of service with an explanation of when and how the  provider has restored service. The provider also must provide  notification of service outages covered by this paragraph to consumers  on an accessible Web site, and that notification of service status must  be updated in a timely manner.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> A VRS provider that fails to obtain prior Commission  authorization for a voluntary service interruption or fails to provide  written notification after a voluntary service interruption of less than  30 minutes in duration, or an Internet-based TRS provider that fails to  provide written notification after the commencement of an unforeseen  service interruption due to circumstances beyond the provider's control  in accordance with this subsection, may be subject to revocation of  certification, suspension of payment from the TRS Fund, or other  enforcement action by the Commission, as appropriate.
