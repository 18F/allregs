EPA will not attempt to make any inspections which it has been informed that local law forbids. However, if local law makes it impossible to do what is necessary to insure the accuracy of data generated at a facility, no informed judgment that a locomotive or locomotive engine is certifiable or is covered by a certificate can properly be based on those data. It is the responsibility of the manufacturer or remanufacturer to locate its testing and manufacturing and/or remanufacturing facilities in jurisdictions where this situation will not arise.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> For purposes of this section:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> ``Presentation of credentials'' shall mean display of the document designating a person as an EPA Enforcement Officer.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where locomotive, component or engine storage areas or facilities are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all times during which personnel other than custodial personnel are at work in the vicinity of the area or facility and have access to it.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Where facilities or areas other than those covered by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section are concerned, ``operating hours'' shall mean all times during which an assembly line is in operation or all times during which testing, maintenance, mileage (or service) accumulation, production or compilation of records, or any other procedure or activity related to certification testing, to translation of designs from the test stage to the production stage, or to locomotive (or engine) manufacture, remanufacture, or assembly is being carried out in a facility.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> ``Reasonable assistance'' includes, but is not limited to, clerical, copying, interpretation and translation services, the making available on request of personnel of the facility being inspected during their working hours to inform the EPA Enforcement Officer

of how the facility operates and to answer his questions, and the performance on request of emissions tests on any locomotive (or engine) which is being, has been, or will be used for certification testing. Such tests shall be nondestructive, but may require appropriate mileage (or service) accumulation. A manufacturer or remanufacturer may be compelled to cause the personal appearance of any employee at such a facility before an EPA Enforcement Officer by written request for his appearance, signed by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, served on the manufacturer or remanufacturer. Any such employee who has been instructed by the manufacturer or remanufacturer to appear will be entitled to be accompanied, represented and advised by counsel.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any entry without 24 hour prior written or oral notification to the affected manufacturer or remanufacturer shall be authorized in writing by the Assistant Administrator for Air and Radiation or the Assistant Administrator for Enforcement and Compliance Assurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> EPA may void a certificate of conformity ab initio for locomotives or locomotive engines introduced into commerce if the manufacturer or remanufacturer (or contractor for the manufacturer or remanufacturer, if applicable) fails to comply with any provision of this section.
