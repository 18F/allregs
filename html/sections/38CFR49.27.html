                            <p class="depth0">For each kind of recipient, there is a set of Federal principles for  determining allowable costs. Allowability of costs shall be determined  in accordance with the cost principles applicable to the entity  incurring the costs. Thus, allowability of costs incurred by State,  local or federally-recognized Indian tribal governments is determined in  accordance with the provisions of OMB Circular A-87, ``Cost Principles  for State, Local, and Indian Tribal Governments.'' The allowability of  costs incurred by non-profit organizations is determined in accordance  with the provisions of OMB Circular A-122, ``Cost Principles for Non- Profit Organizations.'' The allowability of costs incurred by  institutions of higher education is determined in accordance with the  provisions of OMB Circular A-21, ``Cost Principles for Educational  Institutions.'' The allowability of costs incurred by hospitals is  determined in accordance with the provisions of Appendix E of 45 CFR  part 74, ``Principles for Determining Costs Applicable to Research and  Development Under Grants and Contracts with Hospitals.'' The  allowability of costs incurred by commercial organizations and those  non-profit organizations listed in Attachment C to Circular A-122 is  determined in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Acquisition  Regulation (FAR) at 48 CFR part 31.  (Authority: Pub. L. 104-156; 110 Stat. 1396)</p>
