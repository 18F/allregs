Temporary structures are permitted to the extent described above, provided prior notice has been given to the Regional Director, except that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Structures are not permitted on the White House sidewalk.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> All such temporary structures shall be erected in such a manner so as not to harm park resources unreasonably and shall be removed as soon as practicable after the conclusion of the permitted demonstration or special event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The Regional Director may impose reasonable restrictions upon the use of temporary structures in the interest of protecting the park areas involved, traffic and public safety considerations, and other legitimate park value concerns.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any structures utilized in a demonstration extending in duration beyond the time limitations specified in paragraphs (g)(5)(iv) (A) and (B) of this section shall be capable of being removed upon 24 hours notice and the site restored, or, the structure shall be secured in such a fashion so as not to interfere unreasonably with use of the park area by other permittees authorized under this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(E)</em> Individuals or groups of 25 persons or fewer demonstrating under the small group permit exemption of paragraph (g)(2)(i) of this section are not allowed to erect temporary structures other than small lecterns or speakers'
