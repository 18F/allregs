For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter)  such an amount of sick leave would be 1968 hours (246 days, based on a  260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division  firefighter, such an amount would be 2,069 hours (341 days divided by  360 days per year times 2,184 hours per year). The Federal Benefit  Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 23 years, 11 months,  and 23 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997, and 6  months and 4 days of other service. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is  based on 20 years departmental and 6 months of other service at the 2.5  percent accrual rate and 3 years and 11 months of service at the 3.0  percent accrual rate.

In this example, an individual covered by the Police and  Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At  retirement, he is age 55 with 32 years and 17 days of departmental  service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based  on the 31 years, 3 months, and 17 days of departmental service performed  as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20  years of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 11 years and 3  months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate. However, the annuity  is limited to 80 percent of the average salary at time of retirement.  (This limitation does not apply to the unused sick leave credit.) The  annuity computed as of   June 30, 1997, equals the full benefit payable; therefore, the Federal  Benefit Payment is the total benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3A--Police Optional</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-80 hire] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Birth date: 06/12/42 Hire date: 03/14/66 Separation date: 03/30/98 Department service: 32/00/17 Other service: Sick leave: .025 service: 20 .03 service: 12 Average salary: $75,328.30 Total: $64,782.34 Total/month: $5,399.00 Maximum: $60,262.64 Maximum/month: $5,022.00 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Birth date: 06/12/42 Hire date: 03/14/66 Freeze date: 03/30/97 Department service: 31/03/17 Other service: Sick leave: .025 service: 20 .03 service: 11.25 Average salary: $75,328.30 Total: $63,087.45 Total/month: $5,257.00 Maximum: $60,262.64 Maximum/month: $5,022.00 Total federal/month / total/month: 1.0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">B. In this example, the individual in example 3A also has 6 months  of unused sick leave at retirement. The sick leave credit is not subject  to the 80% limitation and does not become creditable service until the  date of separation. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division  firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1040 hours (130 days,  based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting  division firefighter, such an amount would be 1092 hours (180 days  divided by 360 days per year times 2184 hours per year). Six months of  unused sick leave increases the annual total benefit by 1.5 percent of  the average salary, or in the example by $94 per month. The District is  responsible for the portion of the annuity attributable to the unused  sick leave because it became creditable at retirement, that is, after  June 30, 1997.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3B--Police Optional</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-80 hire] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Birth date: 06/12/42 Hire date: 03/14/66 Separation date: 03/30/98 Department service: 32/00/17 Other service: Sick leave: 00/06/00 .025 service: 20 .03 service: 12 Average salary: $75,328.30 Total wo/sl credit: $64,782.34 Total/month: $5,399.00 Max wo/sl credit: $60,262.64 Max w/sl credit: $61,392.57 Monthly benefit: $5,116.00 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Birth date: 06/12/42 Hire date: 03/14/66 Freeze date: 06/30/97 Department service: 31/03/17 Other service: Sick leave: none .025 service: 20 .03 service: 11.25 Average salary: $75,328.30 Total: $63,087.45 Total/month: $5,257.00 Maximum: $60,262.64 Monthly benefit: $5,022.00 Total federal/month / total/month: 0.981626 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 4: Excess Leave Without Pay</p><p class="depth0">In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired  before 1996 retires in February 1998. At retirement, she is age 64 with  27 years of departmental service and 6 years, 7 months, and 28 days of  other service (creditable before June 30, 1997). However, only 6 months  of leave in a fiscal year without pay may be credited toward retirement  under the Teachers Plan. She had 3 months and 18 days of excess leave  without pay as of June 30, 1997. Since the excess leave without pay  occurred before June 30, 1997, the time attributable to the excess leave  without pay is subtracted from the service used in both the Federal  Benefit Payment and the total benefit computations. The Federal Benefit  Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 32 years and 8 months  of service (32 years, 11 months, and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days  and the partial month dropped); 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent  accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and  22 years and 8   months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.

In this example, as in the prior example, a teacher dies in  service on April 1, 1998 after 15 years of departmental service.  However, in this example, the teacher was age 40 on the hire date. The  amount of service used in the survivor annuity calculation equals the  amount of service that the teacher would have had if the teacher  continued covered employment until age 60. Because the survivor annuity  is based on projected service, a form of the guaranteed minimum, the  Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the total benefit.

However, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on plan  provisions in effect on June 29, 1997, which provided for a survivor  annuity equal to 40 percent of the officer's pay at the time of death.  Because the Federal Benefit Payment is not service-based and the officer  had 167 months of service as of the freeze date and 216 months of  service, including unused sick leave, at death, the Federal Benefit  Payment equals 167/216ths of the total benefit calculated according to  plan provisions in effect on July 1, 1997.

Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated  based on the plan rules for deferred retirees. Under the Police and  Firefighters Plan, if a separated police officer or firefighter eligible  for deferred retirement dies before reaching age 55, the survivor is  eligible to receive an annuity. The survivor annuity is based on the  firefighter's adjusted average pay. Therefore, the survivor's Federal  Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the survivor annuity.
