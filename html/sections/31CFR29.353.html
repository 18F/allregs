For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1968 hours (246 days, based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division firefighter, such an amount would be 2,069 hours (341 days divided by 360 days per year times 2,184 hours per year). The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 23 years, 11 months, and 23 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997, and 6 months and 4 days of other service. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years departmental and 6 months of other service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 3 years and 11 months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate.

In this example, an individual covered by the Police and Firefighters Plan hired before 1980 retires in March 1998. At retirement, he is age 55 with 32 years and 17 days of departmental service. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 31 years, 3 months, and 17 days of departmental service performed as of June 30, 1997. Thus, the Federal Benefit Payment is based on 20 years of service at the 2.5 percent accrual rate and 11 years and 3 months of service at the 3.0 percent accrual rate. However, the annuity is limited to 80 percent of the average salary at time of retirement. (This limitation does not apply to the unused sick leave credit.) The annuity computed as of

June 30, 1997, equals the full benefit payable; therefore, the Federal Benefit Payment is the total benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3A--Police Optional</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-80 hire]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 06/12/42Hire date: 03/14/66Separation date: 03/30/98Department service: 32/00/17Other service:Sick leave:.025 service: 20.03 service: 12Average salary: $75,328.30Total: $64,782.34Total/month: $5,399.00Maximum: $60,262.64Maximum/month: $5,022.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 06/12/42Hire date: 03/14/66Freeze date: 03/30/97Department service: 31/03/17Other service:Sick leave:.025 service: 20.03 service: 11.25Average salary: $75,328.30Total: $63,087.45Total/month: $5,257.00Maximum: $60,262.64Maximum/month: $5,022.00Total federal/month / total/month: 1.0------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">B. In this example, the individual in example 3A also has 6 months of unused sick leave at retirement. The sick leave credit is not subject to the 80% limitation and does not become creditable service until the date of separation. For a police officer (or a non-firefighting division firefighter) such an amount of sick leave would be 1040 hours (130 days, based on a 260-day year, times 8 hours per day). For a firefighting division firefighter, such an amount would be 1092 hours (180 days divided by 360 days per year times 2184 hours per year). Six months of unused sick leave increases the annual total benefit by 1.5 percent of the average salary, or in the example by $94 per month. The District is responsible for the portion of the annuity attributable to the unused sick leave because it became creditable at retirement, that is, after June 30, 1997.</p><p class="depth0">Example 3B--Police Optional</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-80 hire]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 06/12/42Hire date: 03/14/66Separation date: 03/30/98Department service: 32/00/17Other service:Sick leave: 00/06/00.025 service: 20.03 service: 12Average salary: $75,328.30Total wo/sl credit: $64,782.34Total/month: $5,399.00Max wo/sl credit: $60,262.64Max w/sl credit: $61,392.57Monthly benefit: $5,116.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 06/12/42Hire date: 03/14/66Freeze date: 06/30/97Department service: 31/03/17Other service:Sick leave: none.025 service: 20.03 service: 11.25Average salary: $75,328.30Total: $63,087.45Total/month: $5,257.00Maximum: $60,262.64Monthly benefit: $5,022.00Total federal/month / total/month: 0.981626------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 4: Excess Leave Without Pay</p><p class="depth0">In this example, an individual covered by the Teachers Plan hired before 1996 retires in February 1998. At retirement, she is age 64 with 27 years of departmental service and 6 years, 7 months, and 28 days of other service (creditable before June 30, 1997). However, only 6 months of leave in a fiscal year without pay may be credited toward retirement under the Teachers Plan. She had 3 months and 18 days of excess leave without pay as of June 30, 1997. Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, the time attributable to the excess leave without pay is subtracted from the service used in both the Federal Benefit Payment and the total benefit computations. The Federal Benefit Payment begins at retirement. It is based on the 32 years and 8 months of service (32 years, 11 months, and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days and the partial month dropped); 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 22 years and 8

months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate. The total annuity is based on 33 years and 4 months of service (33 years, 7 months and 28 days minus 3 months and 18 days and the partial month dropped) 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate and 23 years and 4 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.</p><p class="depth0">Note: For the Teachers Plan, section 1230(a) of title 31 of the D.C.

Since the excess leave without pay occurred before June 30, 1997, the deferred Federal Benefit Payment is based on the 23 years and 6 months of service; 5 years of service at the 1.5 percent accrual rate, 5 years of service at the 1.75 percent accrual rate, and 13 and 6 months of service at the 2 percent accrual rate.</p><p class="depth0">Example 6B--Teachers Disability Age 49</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-96 hire]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 03/09/48Hire date: 09/01/70Separation date: 12/31/97Department service: 27/04/00Other service:Excess LWOP: 03/03/14.015 service: 5.0175 service: 5.02 service: 14Average salary: $53,121.00Total: $23,506.04Total/month: $1,959.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 03/09/48Hire date: 09/01/70Freeze date: 06/30/97Department service: 26/10/00Other service:Excess LWOP: 03/03/14.015 service: 5.0175 service: 5.02 service: 13.5Average salary: $53,121.00Total: $22,974.83Total/month: $1,915.00; deferredTotal federal/month / total/month: 0.0 (at time of retirement)------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Example 7: Disability Occurs After Eligibility for Optional Retirement</p><p class="depth0">A.

Since the teacher had 171 months of service as of the freeze date and 180 months of service at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 171/180ths of the total benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13E--Teachers Death Benefits</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-96 hire]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 04/01/43Hire date: 04/01/83Separation date: 04/01/98Death date: 04/01/98Department service: 15/00/01Departmental Service projected to age 60: 20/00/01.015 service: 5.0175 service: 5.02 service: 10Average salary: $36,000.00Months of service: 180Total: $7,177.50Total/month: $598.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 04/01/43Hire date: 04/01/83Freeze date: 06/30/97Death date: 04/01/98Department service: 14/03/00Average salary: $36,000.00Months of service: 171Federal service / total service: 0.950000Total: $6,818.63Total/month: $568.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">F. In this example, a police officer dies in the line of duty on July 31, 2001 after 18 years of departmental service. The survivor annuity is equal to 100 percent of the officer's pay at the time of death, as provided by District legislation effective October 1, 2000. However, the Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on plan provisions in effect on June 29, 1997, which provided for a survivor annuity equal to 40 percent of the officer's pay at the time of death. Because the Federal Benefit Payment is not service-based and the officer had 167 months of service as of the freeze date and 216 months of service, including unused sick leave, at death, the Federal Benefit Payment equals 167/216ths of the total benefit calculated according to plan provisions in effect on July 1, 1997. The difference between the total benefit paid and the Federal Benefit Payment calculated according to plan provisions in effect on June 29, 1997 is the responsibility of the District government.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13F--Police Death Benefits</p><p class="depth0">[Pre-96 hire]------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 07/13/62Hire date: 08/01/83Death date: 07/31/2001Department service: 18/00/00Average salary: $54,000.00Final salary: $56,000.00Months of service: 216Total: $56,004.00Total/month: $4,667.00Total based on July 1, 1997 provisions: $21,600.00Total/month based on July 1, 1997 provisions: $1,800.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 07/13/62Hire date: 08/01/83Freeze date: 06/30/97Death date: 07/31/2001Department service: 13/11/00Months of service: 167Federal service / total service: 0.773148Total: $16,704.00Total/month: $1,392.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">G. In this example, a firefighter dies on July 1, 1999 at age 47 after retiring based on a disability in the line of duty in November 1997. At separation, the firefighter was not eligible for optional retirement but was eligible to receive a deferred retirement annuity at age 55. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on the plan rules for deferred retirees. Under the Police and Firefighters Plan, if a separated police officer or firefighter eligible for deferred retirement dies before reaching age 55, the survivor is eligible to receive an annuity. The survivor annuity is based on the firefighter's adjusted average pay. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is a prorated portion of the survivor annuity. Since the firefighter had 217 months of service as of the freeze date and 222 months of service at retirement, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment equals 217/222nds of the total survivor benefit.</p><p class="depth0">Example 13G--Firefighters Disability/Early Voluntary Death Benefits------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">-------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Total Annuity Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 08/20/52Hire date: 05/14/79Separation date: 11/28/97Death date: 07/01/99Department service: 18/06/15Adjusted average salary: $45,987.00Months of service: 222Total: $18,396.00Total/month: $1,533.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">Federal Benefit Payment Computation------------------------------------------------------------------------Birth date: 08/20/52Hire date: 05/14/79Freeze date: 06/30/97Death date: 07/01/99Department service: 18/01/17Adjusted average salary: $45,987.00Months of service: 217Federal service / total service: .977477Total: $17,976.00Total/month: $1,498.00------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">H. In this example, a teacher dies on August 3, 1999 at age 58 after retiring based on a disability in April 1998. At separation, the teacher was not eligible for optional retirement but was eligible to receive a deferred retirement annuity at age 62. Therefore, the survivor's Federal Benefit Payment is calculated based on the plan rules for deferred retirees. Under the Teachers Plan, if a separated teacher eligible for deferred retirement dies before reaching age 62, the survivor is not eligible to receive an annuity.
