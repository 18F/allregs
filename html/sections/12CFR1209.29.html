                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General rule. (1) Limits on discovery. Subject to the limitations set out in paragraphs (a)(2), (b), (d), and (e) of this section, a party to a proceeding under this part may obtain document discovery by serving upon any other party in the proceeding a written request to produce documents. For purposes of such requests, the term ``documents'' may be defined to include records, drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings, or data stored in electronic form or other data compilations from which information can be obtained or translated, if necessary, by the parties through detection devices into reasonably usable form (e.g., electronically stored information), as well as written material of all kinds.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Discovery plan. (i) In the initial scheduling conference held in accordance with Sec.  1209.36, or otherwise at the earliest practicable time, the presiding

officer shall require the parties to confer in good faith to develop and submit a joint discovery plan for the timely, cost-effective management of document discovery (including, if applicable, electronically stored information). The discovery plan should provide for the coordination of similar discovery requests by multiple parties, if any, and specify how costs are to be apportioned among those parties. The discovery plan shall specify the form of electronic productions, if any. Documents are to be produced in accordance with the technical specifications described in the discovery plan.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Discovery in the proceeding may commence upon the approval of the discovery plan by the presiding officer. Thereafter, the presiding officer may interpret or modify the discovery plan for good cause shown or in his or her discretion due to changed circumstances.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Nothing in paragraph (a)(2) of this section shall be interpreted or deemed to require the production of documents that are privileged or not reasonably accessible because of undue burden or cost, or to require any document production otherwise inconsistent with the limitations on discovery set forth in this part.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Relevance and scope. (1) A party may obtain document discovery regarding any matter not privileged that is materially relevant to the charges or allowable defenses raised in the pending proceeding.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The scope of available discovery shall be limited in accordance with subpart C of this part. Any request for the production of documents that seeks to obtain privileged information or documents not materially relevant under paragraph (b)(1) of this section, or that is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, unduly burdensome, cumulative, or repetitive of any prior discovery requests, shall be denied or modified.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> A request for document discovery is unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome--and shall be denied or modified--if, among other things, the request:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Fails to specify justifiable limitations on the relevant subject matter, time period covered, search parameters, or the geographic location(s) or data repositories to be searched;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Fails to identify documents with sufficient specificity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Seeks material that is duplicative, cumulative, or obtainable from another source that is more accessible, cost-effective, or less burdensome;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Calls for the production of documents to be delivered to the requesting party or his or her designee and fails to provide a written agreement by the requestor to pay in advance for the costs of production in accordance with Sec.  1209.30, or otherwise fails to take into account costs associated with processing electronically stored information or any cost-sharing agreements between the parties;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Fails to afford the responding party adequate time to respond; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> Fails to take into account retention policies or security protocols with respect to Federal information systems.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Forms of discovery. Discovery shall be limited to requests for production of documents for inspection and copying. No other form of discovery shall be allowed. Discovery by use of interrogatories is not permitted. This paragraph shall not be interpreted to require the creation of a document.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Privileged matter. (1) Privileged documents are not discoverable. (i) Privileges include the attorney-client privilege, work-product privilege, any government's or government agency's deliberative process privilege, and any other privileges provided by the Constitution, any applicable act of Congress, or the principles of common law.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The parties may enter into a written agreement to permit a producing party to assert applicable privileges of a document even after its production and to request the return or destruction of privileged matter (claw back agreement). The parties shall file the claw back agreement with the presiding officer. To ensure the enforceability of the terms of any such claw back agreement, the presiding officer shall enter an order. Any party may petition the presiding officer for an order specifying claw back procedures for good cause shown.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> No effect on examination authority. The limitations on discoverable matter

provided for in this part are not intended and shall not be construed to limit or otherwise affect the examination, regulatory or supervisory authority of FHFA.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time limits. All discovery matters, including all responses to discovery requests, shall be completed at least 20 days prior to the date scheduled for the commencement of the testimonial phase of the hearing. No exception to this discovery time limit shall be permitted, unless the presiding officer finds on the record that good cause exists for waiving the 20-day requirement of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Production. Documents must be produced as they are kept in the usual course of business, or labeled and organized to correspond with the categories in the request, or otherwise produced in a manner determined by mutual agreement between the requesting party and the party or non-party to whom the request is directed in accordance with this part.</p>
