To make an election, employees may use either the  paper election form provided by the TSP, or, if available from their  employing agency, electronic media. If an electronic medium is used, all  relevant elements contained on the paper form must be included in the  electronic medium.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> A contribution election must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Be completed in accordance with the instructions on the form, if  a paper form is used;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Be made in accordance with the employing agency's instructions,  if the submission is made electronically; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Not exceed the maximum contribution limitations described in  Sec. 1600.22.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A contribution election will become effective no later than the  first full pay period after it is received by the employing agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> A uniformed service member may elect to contribute sums to the  TSP from basic pay and special or incentive pay (including bonuses).  However, in order to contribute to the TSP from special or incentive pay  (including bonuses), the uniformed service member must also elect to  contribute to the TSP from basic pay. A uniformed service member may  elect to contribute   from special pay or incentive pay (including bonuses) in anticipation of  receiving such pay (that is, he or she does not have to be receiving the  special or incentive pay (including bonuses) when the contribution  election is made); those elections will take effect when the uniformed  service member receives the special or incentive pay (including  bonuses).
