                            <p class="depth0">The Department of Justice, or the U.S. Attorneys, are charged with  the duty and responsibility of interpreting and enforcing criminal  statutes, and   the final determination as to whether the evidence in any case is  sufficient to warrent prosecution is a matter solely for their  determination. If the Department of Justice or U.S. Attorney decides to  initiate action, the Regional Counsel will cooperate as may be  requested. The Regional Counsel will promptly bring to the attention of  the General Counsel any case wherein he or she is of the opinion that  criminal or civil action should be initiated notwithstanding a decision  by the U.S. Attorney not to bring such action; any case where action has  been inordinately delayed; and any case which would cause significant  publicity or notoriety.  (Authority: 38 U.S.C. 501)  [50 FR 24767, June 13, 1985, as amended at 68 FR 17551, Apr. 10, 2003]</p>
