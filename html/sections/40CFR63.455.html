Performance test data must be submitted in the  file format generated through use of the EPA's Electronic Reporting Tool  (ERT) (see http://www.epa.gov/ttn/chief/ert/index.html). Only data  collected using test methods on the ERT Web site are subject to this  requirement for submitting reports electronically to WebFIRE. Owners or  operators who claim that some of the information being submitted for  performance tests is confidential business information (CBI) must submit  a complete ERT file including information claimed to be CBI on a compact  disk, flash drive or other commonly used electronic storage media to the  EPA. The electronic media must be clearly marked as CBI and mailed to  U.S. EPA/OAPQS/CORE CBI Office, Attention: WebFIRE Administrator, MD  C404-02, 4930 Old Page Rd., Durham, NC 27703. The same ERT file with the  CBI omitted must be submitted to the EPA via CDX as described earlier in  this paragraph. At the discretion of the delegated authority, the owner  or operator must also submit these reports, including the CBI, to the  delegated authority in the format specified by the delegated authority.  For any performance test conducted using test methods that are not  listed on the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the  results of the performance test to the Administrator at the appropriate  address listed in Sec. 63.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within 60 days after the date of completing each CEMS  performance evaluation test as defined in Sec. 63.2, the owner or  operator must submit relative accuracy test audit (RATA) data to the  EPA's CDX by using CEDRI in accordance with paragraph (2) of this  section. Only RATA pollutants that can be documented with the ERT (as  listed on the ERT Web site) are subject to this requirement. For any  performance evaluations with no corresponding RATA pollutants listed on  the ERT Web site, the owner or operator must submit the results of the  performance evaluation to the Administrator at the appropriate address  listed in Sec. 63.13.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> All reports required by this subpart not subject to the  requirements in paragraphs (h)(2) and (3) of this section must be sent  to the Administrator at the appropriate address listed in Sec. 63.13.  The Administrator or the delegated authority may request a report in any  form suitable for the specific case (e.g., by commonly used electronic  media such as Excel spreadsheet, on CD or hard copy). The Administrator  retains the right to require submittal of reports subject to paragraphs  (h)(2) and (3) of this section in paper format  [63 FR 18617, Apr. 15, 1998, as amended at 65 FR 80763, Dec. 22, 2000;  77 FR 55711, Sept. 11, 2012]</p>
