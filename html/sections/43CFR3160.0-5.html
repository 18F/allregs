Hydraulic fracturing does not include enhanced secondary recovery such  as water flooding, tertiary recovery, recovery through steam injection,  or other types of well stimulation operations such as acidizing.</p><p class="depth0">Hydraulic fracturing fluid means the liquid or gas, and any  associated solids, used in hydraulic fracturing, including constituents  such as water, chemicals, and proppants.</p><p class="depth0">Isolating or to isolate means using cement to protect, separate, or  segregate usable water and mineral resources.</p><p class="depth0">Knowingly or willfully means a violation that constitutes the  voluntary or conscious performance of an act that is prohibited or the  voluntary or conscious failure to perform an act or duty that is  required. It does not include performances or failures to perform that  are honest mistakes or merely inadvertent. It includes, but does not  require, performances or failures to perform that result from a criminal  or evil intent or from a specific intent to violate the law. The knowing  or willful nature of conduct may be established by plain indifference to  or reckless disregard of the requirements of the law, regulations,  orders, or terms of the lease. A consistent pattern of performance or  failure to perform also may be sufficient to establish the knowing or  willful nature of the conduct, where such consistent pattern is neither  the result of honest mistakes or mere inadvertency. Conduct that is  otherwise regarded as being knowing or willful is rendered neither  accidental nor mitigated in character by the belief that the conduct is  reasonable or legal.</p><p class="depth0">Lease means any contract, profit-share arrangement, joint venture or  other agreement issued or approved by the United States under a mineral  leasing law that authorizes exploration for, extraction of or removal of  oil or gas.</p><p class="depth0">Lease site means any lands, including the surface of a severed  mineral estate, on which exploration for, or extraction and removal of,  oil or gas is authorized under a lease.</p><p class="depth0">Lessee means any person holding record title or owning operating  rights in a lease issued or approved by the United States.</p><p class="depth0">Lessor means the party to a lease who holds legal or beneficial  title to the mineral estate in the leased lands.</p><p class="depth0">Major violation means noncompliance that causes or threatens  immediate, substantial, and adverse impacts on public health and safety,  the environment, production accountability, or royalty income.</p><p class="depth0">Master hydraulic fracturing plan means a plan containing the  information required in section 3162.3-3(d) of this part for a group of  wells where the geologic characteristics for each well are substantially  similar.</p><p class="depth0">Maximum ultimate economic recovery means the recovery of oil and gas  from leased lands which a prudent operator could be expected to make  from that field or reservoir given existing knowledge of reservoir and  other pertinent facts and utilizing common industry practices for  primary, secondary or tertiary recovery operations.</p><p class="depth0">Minor violation means noncompliance that does not rise to the level  of a major violation.</p><p class="depth0">New or resumed production under section 102(b)(3) of the Federal Oil  and Gas Royalty Management Act means the date on which a well commences  production, or resumes production after having been off production for  more than 90 days, and is to be construed as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> For an oil well, the date on which liquid hydrocarbons are first  sold or shipped from a temporary storage facility, such as a test tank,  or the date on which liquid hydrocarbons are first produced into a  permanent storage facility, whichever first occurs; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> For a gas well, the date on which gas is first measured through  sales metering facilities or the date on which associated liquid  hydrocarbons are first sold or shipped from a temporary storage  facility, whichever first occurs. For purposes of this provision, a gas  well shall not be considered to have been off of production unless it is  incapable of production.</p><p class="depth0">Notice to lessees and operators (NTL) means a written notice issued  by the authorized officer. NTL's implement the regulations in this part  and operating orders, and serve as instructions on specific item(s) of  importance within a State, District, or Area.</p><p class="depth0">Onshore oil and gas order means a formal numbered order issued by  the Director that implements and supplements the regulations in this  part.</p><p class="depth0">Operating rights owner means a person who owns operating rights in a  lease.
