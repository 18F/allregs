The remedies BSEE would require must be consistent with BSEE's statutory authority, regulations, and any limits thereon due to Congressional delegations to other agencies. Actions BSEE may take include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Ordering grantees and transporters to provide open and nondiscriminatory access to the complainant;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Assessing civil penalties of up to $10,000 per day under 30 CFR part 250, subpart N, for failure to comply with a BSEE order to provide open access or nondiscriminatory access. Penalties will begin to accrue 60 days after the

grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access if it has not provided such access by that time. However, if BSEE determines that requiring the construction of facilities would be an appropriate remedy under the OCSLA, penalties will begin to accrue 10 days after conclusion of diligent construction of needed facilities or 60 days after the grantee or transporter receives the order to provide open and nondiscriminatory access, whichever is later, if it has not provided such access by that time;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Requesting the Attorney General to institute a civil action in the appropriate United States District Court under 43 U.S.C. 1350(a) for a temporary restraining order, injunction, or other appropriate remedy to enforce the open and nondiscriminatory access requirements of 43 U.S.C. 1334(e) and (f)(1)(A); or</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Initiating a proceeding to forfeit the right-of-way grant under 43 U.S.C. 1334(e).</p>
