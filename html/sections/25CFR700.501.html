mandatory for all who serve with the Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission, and in order to implement the requirements of law, Executive Order 11222 and 5 CFR part 905. The rules promulgated by the Commission as essential to agency operations are in addition to the criminal laws and other laws governing conduct of Federal employees. Like the laws, they will be strictly interpreted and firmly enforced. Ignorance of these rules or laxity in observance or enforcement of them will not be condoned. They are the prime responsibility of all Commission personnel.</p>
