The form or record must show each period in which the individual received occupational exposure to radiation or radioactive material and must be signed by the individual who received the exposure. For each period for which the licensee obtains reports, the licensee shall use the dose shown in the report in preparing the NRC Form 4. For any period in which the licensee does not obtain a report, the licensee shall place a notation on the NRC Form 4 indicating the periods of time for which data are not available.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\4\ Licensees are not required to partition historical dose between external dose equivalent(s) and internal committed dose equivalent(s). Further, occupational exposure histories obtained and recorded on NRC Form 4 before January 1, 1994, might not have included effective dose equivalent, but may be used in the absence of specific information on the intake of radionuclides by the individual.---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If the licensee is unable to obtain a complete record of an individual's current and previously accumulated occupational dose, the licensee shall assume--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In establishing administrative controls under Sec. 20.1201(f) for the current year, that the allowable dose limit for the individual is reduced by 1.25 rems (12.5 mSv) for each quarter for which records were unavailable and the individual was engaged in activities that could have resulted in occupational radiation exposure; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> That the individual is not available for planned special exposures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The licensee shall retain the records on NRC Form 4 or equivalent until the Commission terminates each pertinent license requiring this record. The licensee shall retain records used in preparing NRC Form 4 for 3 years after the record is made. This includes records required under the standards for protection against radiation in effect prior to January 1, 1994.
