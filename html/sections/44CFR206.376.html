                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> FEMA shall cancel repayment of all or part of a Special  Community Disaster Loan to the extent that the Director of the Public  Assistance Division determines that revenues of the local government  during the three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster are  insufficient, as a result of the disaster, to meet the operating budget  for the local government, including additional unreimbursed disaster- related expenses of a municipal operating character.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. For loan cancellation purposes,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> ``Operating budget'' means actual revenues and expenditures of  the local government as published in the official financial statements  of the local government.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> ``Revenue'' means any source of income from taxes, fees, fines,  and other sources of income, and will be recognized only as they become  susceptible to accrual (measurable and available).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> ``Three-full-fiscal-year period following the disaster'' means  either a 36-month period beginning on September 1, 2005, or the 36  months of the applicant's fiscal year as established before the  disaster, at the applicant's discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> ``Operating expenses'' means those expenses and expenditures  incurred as a result of performing services, including salaries and  benefits, contractual services, and commodities. Capital expenditures  and debt service payments and capital leases are not considered  operating expenses. Under accrual accounting, expenses are recognized as  soon as a liability is incurred, regardless of the timing of related  cash flows.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Revenue Calculation procedures. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the tax rates and other  revenues or the tax assessment valuation of property which was not  damaged or destroyed by the disaster are reduced during the three full  fiscal years subsequent to the major disaster, the tax rates and other  revenues and tax assessment valuation factors applicable to such  property in effect at the time of the major disaster shall be used  without reduction for purposes of computing revenues received.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> At the applicant's discretion, the three-full-fiscal-year period  following the disaster is either a 36-month period beginning on  September 1, 2005 or the 36 months of the applicant's fiscal year as  established before the disaster. If the applicant's fiscal year is  changed   within the 36 months immediately following the disaster, the actual  period will be modified so that the required financial data submitted  covers an inclusive 36-month period. Should the applicant elect the 36- month period beginning September 1, 2005, FEMA will prorate the revenues  and expenses for the partial years based on the applicant's annual  financial statements.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the local government transfers funds from its operating funds  accounts to its capital funds account, utilizes operating funds for  other than routine maintenance purposes, or significantly increases  expenditures which are not disaster related, except increases due to  inflation, the annual operating budget or operating statement  expenditures will be reduced accordingly for purposes of evaluating any  request for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(3) of this section, the amount of  property taxes that are transferred to other funds for Debt Service or  Pension Obligations funding will not be excluded from the calculation of  the operating budget or from expenditures in calculation of the  operating deficit, to the extent that the property tax revenues in the  General Fund are less than they were pre-disaster. FEMA will consider  the impact of the loss of property tax revenue in Debt Service or  Pension Funds (non-operating funds) if all of the following conditions  are met:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The entity experienced a loss of property tax revenue as a  result of the disaster and the assessed value during the three years  following the disaster, in the aggregate, is less than the pre-disaster  assessed value;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> the entity has a property tax cap limitation on the ability to  raise property taxes post-disaster; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> the property taxes are levied through the General Operating  Fund and transfers for obligations mandated by law are made to fund Debt  Service or Pension Obligations which result in the entity experiencing a  reduction of property tax revenues in the General Fund.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> It is not the purpose of this loan program to underwrite pre- disaster budget or actual deficits of the local government.  Consequently, such deficits carried forward will reduce any amounts  otherwise eligible for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The provisions of this section apply to all Special Community  Disaster loans issued from the dates of enactment of Public Law 109-88  and Public Law 109-234.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disaster-related expenses of a municipal operation character.  </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For purposes of this loan, unreimbursed expenses of a municipal  operating character are those incurred for general government purposes,  including but not limited to police and fire protection, trash  collection, collection of revenues, maintenance of public facilities,  flood and other hazard insurance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disaster-related expenses do not include expenditures associated  with debt service, any major repairs, rebuilding, replacement or  reconstruction of public facilities or other capital projects,  intragovernmental services, special assessments, and trust and agency  fund operations. Disaster expenses which are eligible for reimbursement  under project applications or other Federal programs are not eligible  for loan cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Each applicant shall maintain records including documentation  necessary to identify expenditures for unreimbursed disaster-related  expenses. Examples of such expenses include but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Interest paid on money borrowed to pay amounts FEMA does not  advance toward completion of approved Project Applications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Unreimbursed costs to local governments for providing usable  sites with utilities for mobile homes used to meet disaster temporary  housing requirements.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Unreimbursed costs required for police and fire protection and  other community services for mobile home parks established as the result  of or for use following a disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The cost to the applicant of flood insurance required under  Public Law 93-234, as amended, and other hazard insurance required under  section 311, Public Law 93-288, as amended, as a condition of Federal  disaster assistance for the disaster under which the loan is authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The following expenses are not considered to be disaster-related  for   Special Community Disaster Loan purposes:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The local government's share for assistance provided under the  Stafford Act including flexible funding under section 406(c)(1) of the  Act (42 U.S.C. 5172).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Improvements related to the repair or restoration of disaster  public facilities approved on Project Applications.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Otherwise eligible costs for which no Federal reimbursement is  requested as a part of the applicant's disaster response commitment, or  cost sharing as specified in the FEMA-State Agreement for the disaster.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Expenses incurred by the local government which are reimbursed  on the applicant's Project Application.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cancellation application. A local government which has drawn  loan funds from the U.S. Treasury may request cancellation of the  principal and related interest by submitting an Application for Loan  Cancellation through the Governor's Authorized Representative to the  Regional Administrator prior to the expiration date of the loan.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Financial information submitted with the application shall  include the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Annual Operating Budgets for the fiscal year of the disaster and  the three subsequent fiscal years;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Annual Financial Reports (Revenue and Expense and Balance  Sheet) for each of the above fiscal years. Such financial records must  include copies of the local government's annual financial reports,  including operating statements and balance sheets and related  consolidated and individual presentations for each fund account. In  addition, the local government must include an explanatory statement  when figures in the Application for Loan Cancellation form differ from  those in the supporting financial reports.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following additional information concerning annual real  estate property taxes pertaining to the community for each of the above  fiscal years:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The market value of the tax base (dollars);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The assessment ratio (percent);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> The assessed valuation (dollars);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(D)</em> The tax levy rate (mils);</p><p class="depth4"><em>(E)</em> Taxes levied and collected (dollars).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Audit reports for each of the above fiscal years certifying to  the validity of the Operating Statements. The financial statements of  the local government shall be examined in accordance with generally  accepted auditing standards by independent certified public accountants.  The report should not include recommendations concerning loan  cancellation or repayment.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Other financial information specified in the Application for  Loan Cancellation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Narrative justification. The application may include a narrative  presentation to supplement the financial material accompanying the  application and to present any extenuating circumstances which the local  government wants the Director of the Public Assistance Division to  consider in rendering a decision on the cancellation request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Determination. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Director of the Public Assistance  Division will make a cancellation determination within 60 days of the  date the applicant submits all required and requested information,  including documentation in support of un-reimbursed disaster related  expenses.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If, based on a review of the Application for Loan Cancellation  and FEMA audit, the Director of the Public Assistance Division  determines that all or part of the Special Community Disaster Loan funds  should be canceled, the amount of principal canceled and the related  interest will be forgiven. The Director of the Public Assistance  Division's determination concerning loan cancellation will specify that  any uncancelled principal and related interest must be repaid in  accordance with the terms and conditions of the Promissory Note, and  that, if repayment will constitute a financial hardship, the local  government must submit for FEMA review and approval, a repayment  schedule for settling the indebtedness on a timely basis. Such  repayments must be made to the Treasurer of the United States and be  sent to FEMA, Attention: Office of the Chief Financial Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A loan or cancellation of a loan does not reduce or affect other  disaster-related grants or other disaster assistance. However, no  cancellation may be made that would result in a duplication of benefits  to the applicant.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The uncancelled portion of the loan must be repaid in accordance  with Sec. 206.377.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Appeals. If an Application for Loan Cancellation is disapproved,  in whole or in part, by the Director of the Public Assistance Division,  the local government may submit any additional information in support of  the application within 60 days of the date of disapproval. The decision  by the Assistant Administrator for the Disaster Assistance Directorate  on the additional information is final.  [75 FR 2818, Jan. 19, 2010]</p>
