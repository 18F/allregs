                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Goodwill, an unidentifiable intangible asset, originates under the  purchase method of accounting for a business combination when the price  paid by the acquiring company exceeds the   sum of the identifiable individual assets acquired less liabilities  assumed, based upon their fair values. The excess is commonly referred  to as goodwill. Goodwill may arise from the acquisition of a company as  a whole or a portion thereof. Any costs for amortization, expensing,  write-off, or write-down of goodwill (however represented) are  unallowable.  [49 FR 26743, June 29, 1984]    31.205-50  [Reserved]</p>
