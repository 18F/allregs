                            <p class="depth0">The food additive sorbitan monostearate, which is a mixture of partial stearic and palmitic acid esters of sorbitol anhydrides, may be safely used in or on food in accordance with the following prescribed conditions:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The food additive is manufactured by reacting stearic acid (usually containing associated fatty acids, chiefly palmitic) with sorbitol to yield essentially a mixture of esters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The food additive meets the following specifications:
Saponification number, 147-157Acid number, 5-10Hydroxyl number, 235-260</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> It is used or intended for use, alone or in combination with polysorbate 60 as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> As an emulsifier in whipped edible oil topping with or without one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Polysorbate 60;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 65;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Polysorbate 80;

whereby the maximum amount of the additive or additives used does not exceed 0.4 percent of the weight of the finished whipped edible oil topping; except that a combination of the additive with polysorbate 60 may be used in excess of 0.4 percent: Provided, That the

amount of the additive does not exceed 0.27 percent and the amount of polysorbate 60 does not exceed 0.77 percent of the weight of the finished whipped edible oil topping.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> As an emulsifier in cakes and cake mixes, with or without one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Polysorbate 65.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60.

When used alone, the maximum amount of sorbitan monostearate shall not exceed 0.61 percent of the cake or cake mix, on a dry-weight basis. When used with polysorbate 65 and/or polysorbate 60, it shall not exceed 0.61 percent, nor shall the polysorbate 65 exceed 0.32 percent or the polysorbate 60 exceed 0.46 percent, and no combination of the emulsifiers shall exceed 0.66 percent of the weight of the cake or cake mix, calculated on a dry-weight basis.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> As an emulsifier, alone or in combination with polysorbate 60 in nonstandardized confectionery coatings and standardized cacao products specified in Sec. Sec.  163.123, 163.130, 163.135, 163.140, 163.145, and 163.150 of this chapter, as follows:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> It is used alone in an amount not to exceed 1 percent of the weight of the finished nonstandardized confectionery coating or standardized cacao product.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> It is used with polysorbate 60 in any combination of up to 1 percent sorbitan monostearate and up to 0.5 percent polysorbate 60 provided that the total combination does not exceed 1 percent of the weight of the finished nonstandardized confectionery coating or standardized cacao product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> As an emulsifier in cake icings and cake fillings, with or without one or a combination of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Polysorbate 65.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Polysorbate 60.

When used alone, the maximum amount of sorbitan monostearate shall not exceed 0.7 percent of the weight of the cake icing or cake filling.
