                            <p class="depth0">When required by section 18(m) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, a Federal savings association (``you'') must file a notice (``Notice'') under part 116, subpart A of this chapter at least 30 days before establishing or acquiring a subsidiary or engaging in new activities in a subsidiary. The Notice should be filed with the appropriate OCC licensing office and must contain all of the information the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) requires under 12 CFR 362.15. Providing the OCC with a copy of the notice you file with the FDIC will satisfy this requirement. If the OCC notifies you within 30 days that the Notice presents supervisory concerns, or raises significant issues of law or policy, you must apply for and receive the OCC's prior written approval under the standard treatment processing procedures at part 116, subpart A and E of this chapter before establishing or acquiring the subsidiary or engaging in new activities in the subsidiary.</p>
