                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> What must the State agency do to ensure that local agencies meet  program requirements and objectives? The State agency must establish a  management review system to ensure that local agencies, subdistributing  agencies, and other agencies conducting program activities meet program  requirements and objectives. As part of the system, the State agency  must perform an on-site review of all local agencies, and of all storage  facilities utilized by local agencies, at least once every two years. As  part of the on-site review, the State agency must evaluate all aspects  of program administration, including certification procedures, nutrition  education, civil rights compliance, food storage practices, inventory  controls, and financial management systems. In addition to conducting  on-site reviews, the State agency must evaluate program administration  on an ongoing basis by reviewing financial reports, audit reports, food  orders, inventory reports, and other relevant information.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> What must the State agency do if it finds that a local agency is  deficient in a particular area of program administration? The State  agency must record all deficiencies identified during the review and  institute follow-up procedures to ensure that local agencies and  subdistributing agencies correct all deficiencies within a reasonable  period of time. To ensure improved program performance in the future,  the State agency may require that local agencies adopt specific review  procedures for use in reviewing their own operations and those of  subsidiaries or contractors. The State agency must provide copies of  review reports to FNS upon request.  (Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number  0584-0293)</p>
