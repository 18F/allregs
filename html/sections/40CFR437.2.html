                            <p class="depth0">As used in this part:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The general definitions and abbreviations in 40 CFR part 401 apply to this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Alternative effluent limitations or pretreatment standards mean effluent limitations determined on a case-by-case basis under section 402(a)(1) of the CWA or pretreatment standards developed as local limits by the control authority under 40 CFR Sec. 403.6(c) that apply to the discharge of wastewater subject to this provision. The permit writer (or control authority) will calculate these limitations or standards using a ``building block'' approach or the ``combined wastestream formula.'' Under this approach, the permit writer (or control authority) will develop flow-weighted effluent limitations or standards for the treated combined wastestream by applying the limitations or standards in 40 CFR subchapter N that would otherwise apply to a particular wastestream received from off-site if the wastestream were treated and discharged from the facility at which it was generated.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Centralized waste treatment (CWT) facility means any facility that treats (for disposal, recycling or recovery of material) any hazardous or non-hazardous industrial wastes, hazardous or non-hazardous industrial wastewater, and/or used material received from off-site. ``CWT facility'' includes both a facility that treats waste received exclusively from off-site and a facility that treats wastes generated on-site as well as waste received from off-site. For example, an organic chemical manufacturing plant may, in certain circumstances, be a CWT facility if it treats industrial wastes received from offsite as well as industrial waste generated at the organic chemical manufacturing plant. CWT facilities may also include re-refiners and may be owned by the federal government.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Centralized waste treatment wastewater means any wastewater generated as a result of CWT activities. CWT wastewater sources may include, but are not limited to: liquid waste receipts, solubilization water, used oil emulsion-breaking wastewater, tanker truck/drum/roll-off box washes, equipment washes, air pollution control scrubber blow-down, laboratory-derived wastewater, on-site landfill wastewaters, and contaminated storm water.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Contaminated storm water means storm water which comes in direct contact with CWT wastes, the waste handling and treatment areas, or other centralized waste treatment wastewater as defined in paragraph (d) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Discharger means a facility that discharges wastewater directly to waters of the United States or introduces wastewater to a publicly-owned treatment works.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Dry means not producing a wastewater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Equivalent treatment means a wastewater treatment system that achieves comparable pollutant removals to the applicable treatment technology selected as the basis for the limitations and pretreatment standards. Comparable removals may be demonstrated through literature, treatability tests, or self-monitoring data.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Fuel blending means the process of combining waste, wastewater, or used material for the purpose of regenerating a fuel for reuse. However, fuel blending may be loosely applied to any process where recovered hydrocarbons are combined as a fuel product where some pretreatment operations generate wastewater.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> High temperature metals recovery means a metals recovery process in which solid forms of metal-containing materials are processed with a heat-based pyrometallurgical technology to produce a metal product.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Marine generated waste means any waste, wastewater, and/or used material generated as part of the normal

Examples of these wastes are used oils, oil-water emulsions or mixtures, lubricants, coolants, contaminated groundwater clean-up from petroleum sources, used petroleum products, oil spill clean-up, bilge water, rinse/wash waters from petroleum sources, interceptor wastes, off-specification fuels, underground storage tank remediation waste, and tank clean out from petroleum or oily sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(q)</em> On-site means within the boundaries of a facility. A facility may encompass land areas that are bisected by public thoroughfares but are under the control of a common owner.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(r)</em> Organic wastes means wastes and/or used materials that contain organic pollutants, but not a significant quantity of oil and grease (generally less than 100 mg/L) from manufacturing or processing facilities or other commercial operations. Examples of these wastes are landfill leachate, contaminated groundwater clean-up from non-petroleum sources, solvent-bearing wastes, off-specification organic product, still bottoms, byproduct glycols, wastewater from paint washes, wastewater from adhesives and/or epoxies, wastewater from chemical product operations, and tank clean-out from organic, non-petroleum sources.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(s)</em> The following regulated parameters are listed with approved methods of analysis in Table 1B at 40 CFR 136.3, and are defined as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Antimony means total antimony.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Arsenic means total arsenic.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Barium means total barium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> BOD5 means 5-day biochemical oxygen demand.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Cadmium means total cadmium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Chromium means total chromium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cobalt means total cobalt.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Copper means total copper.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Cyanide means total cyanide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Lead means total lead.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Mercury means total mercury.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Molybdenum means total molybdenum.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Nickel means total nickel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(14)</em> O&G; means total recoverable oil and grease (n-hexane extractable material).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(15)</em> Selenium means total selenium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(16)</em> Silver means total silver.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(17)</em> Tin means total tin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(18)</em> Titanium means total titanium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(19)</em> TSS means total suspended solids.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(20)</em> Vanadium means total vanadium.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(21)</em> Zinc means total zinc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(t)</em> The following regulated parameters are listed with approved methods of analysis in Table 1C at 40 CFR 136.3:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Butylbenzyl phthalate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Fluoranthene.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Phenol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> 2,4,6-trichlorophenol.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(u)</em> The following regulated parameters are listed with approved methods of analysis (Methods 625 and 1625) at 40 CFR 136.3, appendix A:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Acetone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Acetophenone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Aniline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> 2-Butanone.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Carbazole.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> o-Cresol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> p-Cresol.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> n-Decane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> 2,3-dichloroaniline.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> n-Octadecane.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Pyridine.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(v)</em> Pipeline means an open or closed conduit used for the conveyance of material.
