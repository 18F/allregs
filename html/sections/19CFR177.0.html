                            <p class="depth0">This part relates to the issuance of rulings to importers and other  interested persons by the CBP, other than advance rulings under Article  509 of the North American Free Trade Agreement   (see subpart I of part 181 of this chapter). It describes the situations  in which a ruling may be requested, the procedures to be followed in  requesting a ruling, the conditions under which a ruling will be issued,  the effect of a ruling when it is issued, and the publication of rulings  in the Customs Bulletin. The rulings issued under the provisions of this  part will usually be prospective in application and, consequently, will  usually not relate to specific matters or situations presently or  previously under consideration by any CBP field office. Accordingly, the  rulings requested under the provisions of this part should be  distinguished from the administrative rulings, determinations, or  decisions which may be requested under procedures set forth elsewhere in  this chapter, including, but not limited to, those set forth in part 12  (relating to submissions of proof of admissibility of articles detained  under section 307 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307)), part 103  (relating to disclosure of information in Customs files), part 133  (relating to disputed claims of piratical copying of copyrighted  matter), subpart C of part 152 (relating to determinations concerning  the dutiable value of merchandise by Customs field officers), part 153  (relating to enforcement of the Antidumping Act, 1921, as amended), part  159 (insofar as it relates to countervailing duties), part 171 (relating  to fines, penalties, and forfeitures), part 172 (relating to liquidated  damages), part 174 (relating to protests), and part 175 (relating to  petitions filed by American manufacturers, producers, or wholesalers  pursuant to section 516 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended). Nor do  the provisions of part 177 apply to requests for decisions of an  operational, administrative, or investigative nature which are properly  within the cognizance of a CBP Headquarters Office other than  Regulations and Rulings, Office of International Trade.
