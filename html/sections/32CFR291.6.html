                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If HQ, DNA personnel receive a FOIA request that has not been  logged and processed through PAO, they will immediately handcarry the  request to PAO. TDNM and AFRRI personnel will forward all FOIA requests  to HQ, DNA, Attn: PAO. FCDNA will adhere to paragraph 6d and FCDNA  Supplement to DNA Instruction 5400.7C. \2\ ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">\2\ Copies can be obtained from Defense Nuclear Agency PAO or SSAB,  Defense Nuclear Agency, 6801 Telegraph Road, Alexandria, VA 22310-3398. ---------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a FOIA request is received by PAO, HQ, DNA, the following  procedures apply:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The request will be date stamped, reviewed to determine if it  meets the requirements of 5 U.S.C. 552, logged in, assigned an action  number, suspensed, and attached to a FOIA cover sheet with instructions  for forwarding to the appropriate office. A copy of DD Form 2086 or DD  Form 2086-1 will also be attached to the FOIA request.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A copy of the request will be handcarried by PAO to the  designated HQ, DNA, action office(s) or forwarded to AFRRI or FCDNA, as  appropriate. The office or component providing input for the FOIA  request must keep track of the request and meet the PAO suspense. The  HQ, DNA input, or negative response, if there are no records available,  will be handcarried to PAO. AFRRI will send the recommended response in  daily distribution. FCDNA will telefax the proposed response in addition  to mailing the original. All FOIA actions must include a completed DD  Form 2086 or 2086-1. Each office acting on FOIA requests will indicate  on the form the search, review/excise and coordination time spent  processing the FOIA action, and provide the number of pages copied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The DNA PAO will prepare the response to the requester and  coordinate it with the offices that provided input, the GC, and if  appropriate, ISCM, the IDA, the Director, DNA, OASD(PA), and outside  agencies, if involved. The PAO will maintain files of all FOIA actions  per DNA Instruction 5015.4B.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If a request is received by a DNA office which does not have  records responsive but office personnel believe another office would  have the records requested, they must contact the other office to  confirm the existence of the documents, forward the FOIA action to that  office and notify PAO.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> FOIAs involving classified information. When ISCM or contractor  security reviewers receive a classified document from PAO for processing  under the FOIA, they will conduct a security review to determine if the  document may be sanitized or declassified. Most DNA documents requested  under the FOIA are queued on a first-come, first-served basis and shall  be reviewed in that order. When security reviewers determine that part  or all of the information in a classified document may be sanitized or  declassified, they will ensure that the appropriate copies are ordered  from the Defense Technical Information Center (DTIC). The DTIC copy will  be marked up during review. Cases not placed in queue will be suspensed  by PAO. They may include documents with less than 10 pages or documents  under suspense from other organizations which require a DNA review. All  DNA documents reviewed will be marked with a special pen that does not  permit photocopying of the classified portions. Security review must  include a detailed response providing the appropriate exemption(s) and  justification for withholding.  When the Field Command Security Division (FCSS) receives a classified  document for processing under the FOIA, they will conduct a security  review to determine if the document may be sanitized or declassified.  When FCSS determines that part or all of the information in a classified  document may be sanitized or declassified, FCSS will make a copy which  will be marked up during review. Upon completion of its   review, FCSS will provide the marked up document and a sanitized version  of the document to PAO. FCSS review must include a detailed response  providing the appropriate exemption(s) and justification for  withholding. When ISCM/FCSS completes its review, ISCM/FCSS will forward  the master copy to the appropriate technical office(s) for review. That  office will determine whether the remaining unclassified information is  releaseable and provide its response to ISCM/FCSS. If the office  recommends that part or all of the information be withheld, then it must  forward a detailed response providing the appropriate exemption(s) and  justification for withholding. The technical office will return  documents with results of their review to ISCM. ISCM will forward the  results of both reviews to PAO for further processing. If either ISCM/ FCSS or the DNA office reviewing the action recommends additional review  by another agency, they will provide the full name and address of that  agency with a technical point-of-contact, if known. PAO will forward the  action to that organization for further review. When PAO receives that  organization's review determination, it will forward the results to  ISCM/FCSS. After all reviews are completed, ISCM/FCSS will sanitize the  document and handcarry (FCSS will forward) the sanitized as well as the  marked up copy to PAO for final processing.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> FOIAs involving unclassified information. The appropriate  technical office(s) will review unclassified documents for release under  the FOIA. If the office(s) determines that part or all of the document  should be withheld, it must provide PAO a written recommendation with  the appropriate exemption(s) (Sec. 291.8) and detailed reasons for  withholding the information. Upon PAO request, the technical office(s)  will sanitize the unclassified information that is being withheld.  Sanitization will be done on a photocopy of the document or on a  document that has been obtained from DTIC.</p>
