The justification must be submitted with the AP or other  acquisition request document--see 307.71. The Project Officer has  responsibility for preparing the justification with assistance, as  necessary, from the Contracting Officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Justifications for orders at or below the simplified acquisition   threshold may be in the form of a paragraph or paragraphs contained in  the requisition or other acquisition request document. Justifications  for orders in excess of the simplified acquisition threshold shall be in  the form of a separate, self-contained document, prepared in accordance  with FAR 8.405-6(g) and 308.405-6(g), and titled ``Limited Source  Justification'' (LSJ). HHS requires use of a standard format for an LSJ.  The template for the justification is available on the ASFR/OGAPA/DA  Internet Web site. Additional information may be included in the LSJ  template in accordance with OPDIV procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Regardless of dollar amount of the acquisition, justifications  shall--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Fully describe what is to be acquired;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Cite specific reasons that explain why it is necessary to  restrict consideration of sources;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Be supported by verifiable facts rather than untested or  unsubstantiated opinions or conclusions; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Be written in a manner to permit an individual without technical  knowledge of the requirement to understand the supporting rationale.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Preliminary arrangements with, or verbal or written  commitments to, a proposed contractor shall be avoided given the  requirement to obtain competition for FSS orders using the procedures in  FAR Subpart 8.4--see also FAR 6.102(d)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Justifications for non-FSS orders to be awarded without full  and open competition shall comply with FAR 6.303 and 306.303.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Justification approvals.</p><p class="depth0">Certification, concurrence, and approval requirements. The Project  Officer, the Project Officer's immediate supervisor, the head of the  sponsoring program office, and the Contracting Officer shall certify  that the justification is accurate and complete by signing the LSJ. For  acquisitions in the dollar amount cited in FAR 8.405-6(h)(2) through  (h)(4), the CCO, if applicable, and the HCA shall indicate their review  of, and concurrence with, the justification by signing the LSJ. The  approving officials for LSJs are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The Contracting Officer shall exercise this approval authority  unless a higher approval level is required by OPDIV procedures.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The CAs are listed in 306.501.
