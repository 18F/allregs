                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. In the assessment and evaluation of the toxic  characteristics of a gas, volatile substance, or aerosol/particulate,  determination of subchronic inhalation toxicity may be carried out after  initial information on toxicity has been obtained by acute testing. The  subchronic inhalation study has been designed to permit the  determination of the no-observed-effect level and toxic effects  associated with continuous or repeated exposure to a test substance for  a period of 90 days. The test is not capable of determining those  effects that have a long latency period for development (e.g.,  carcinogenicity and life shortening). It provides information on health  hazards likely to arise from repeated exposures by the inhalation route  over a limited period of time. It will provide information on target  organs, the possibilities of accumulation, and can be of use in  selecting dose levels for chronic studies and for establishing safety  criteria for human exposure. Hazards of inhaled substances are  influenced by the inherent toxicity and by physical factors such as  volatility and particle size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Subchronic inhalation toxicity is the adverse  effects occurring as a result of the repeated daily exposure of  experimental animals to a chemical by inhalation for part (approximately  10 percent) of a life span.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Aerodynamic diameter applies to the size of particles of  aerosols. It is the diameter of a sphere of unit density which behaves  aerodynamically as the particle of the test substance. It is used to  compare particles of different size and densities and to predict where  in the respiratory tract such particles may be deposited. This term is  used in contrast to measured or geometric diameter which is  representative of actual diameters which in themselves cannot be related  to deposition within the respiratory tract.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The geometric mean diameter or the median diameter is the  calculated aerodynamic diameter which divides the particles of an  aerosol in half based on the weight of the particles. Fifty percent of  the particles by weight will be larger than the median diameter and 50  percent of the particles will be smaller than the median diameter. The  median diameter describes the particle size distribution of any aerosol  based on the weight and size of the particles.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Inhalable diameter refers to that aerodynamic diameter of a  particle which is considered to be inhalable for the organism. It is  used to refer to particles which are capable of being inhaled and may be  deposited anywhere within the respiratory tract from the trachea to the  alveoli. For man, inhalable diameter is considered as 15 micrometers or  less.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Dose refers to an exposure level. Exposure is expressed as  weight or volume of test substance per volume of air (mg/l), or as parts  per million (ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> No-effect level/No-toxic-effect level/No-adverse-effect level/ No-observed-effect level is the maximum dose used in a test which  produces no observed adverse effects. A no-observed-effect level is  expressed in terms of weight or volume of test substance given daily per  unit volume of air (mg/l or ppm).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Cumulative toxicity is the adverse effects of repeated doses  occuring as a result of prolonged action on, or increased concentration  of the administered test substance or its metabolites in susceptible  tissues.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Principle of the test method. Several groups of experimental  animals are exposed daily for a defined period to the test substance in  graduated concentrations, one concentration being used per group, for a  period of 90 days. During the period of administration, the animals are  observed daily to detect signs of toxicity. Animals which die during the  test are necropsied and at the conclusion of the test, surviving animals  are sacrificed and necropsied and appropriate histopathological  examinations carried out.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Test procedures--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Animal selection--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Species and strain. A  mammalian species shall be used for testing. A variety of rodent species  may be used, although the rat is the preferred species. Commonly used  laboratory strains shall be employed. If another mammalian species is  used, the tester shall provide justification/ reasoning for its  selection.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Age. Young adult animals shall be used. At the commencement of  the study the weight variation of animals shall not exceed 20 percent of the mean weight for each sex.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Sex. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Equal numbers of animals of each sex shall be used at  each dose level.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Females shall be nulliparous and nonpregnant.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Numbers. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> At least 20 rodents (10 females and 10 males)  shall be used for each test group. If another mammalian species is  selected (e.g. dog, rabbit, or non-human primate), at least 8 animals (4  males and 4 females) shall be used.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If interim sacrifices are planned, the number of animals shall  be increased by the number of animals scheduled to be sacrificed before  the completion of the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Control groups. A concurrent control group is required. This  group shall be an untreated or sham-treated control group. Except for  treatment with the test substance, animals in the control group shall be  handled in a manner identical to the test group animals. Where a vehicle  is used to help generate an appropriate concentration of   the substance in the atmosphere, a vehicle control group shall be used.  If the toxic properties of the vehicle are not known or cannot be made  available, both untreated and vehicle control groups are required.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Satellite group. A satellite group of 20 animals (10 animals per  sex) may be treated with the high concentration level for 90 days and  observed for reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic  effects for a post-treatment period of appropriate length, normally not  less than 28 days.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Dose levels and dose selection. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> In subchronic toxicity  tests, it is desirable to have a concentration-response relationship as  well as a no-observed-toxic-effect level. Therefore, at least 3  concentration levels with a control and, where appropriate, a vehicle  control (corresponding to the concentration of vehicle at the highest  exposure level) shall be used. Concentrations should be spaced  appropriately to produce test groups with a range of toxic effects. The  data should be sufficient to produce a concentration-response curve.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The highest concentration should result in toxic effects but  not produce an incidence of fatalities which would prevent a meaningful  evaluation.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The lowest concentration should not produce any evidence of  toxicity. Where there is a usable estimation of human exposure the  lowest concentration should exceed this.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Ideally, the intermediate concentration level(s) should produce  minimal observable toxic effects. If more than one intermediate  concentration level is used, the concentrations should be spaced to  produce a gradation of toxic effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In the low and intermediate groups and in the controls the  incidence of fatalities should be low, to permit a meaningful evaluation  of the results.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> In the case of potentially explosive test substances, care  should be taken to avoid generating explosive concentrations.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Exposure conditions. The animals should be exposed to the test  substance, ideally for 6 hours per day on a 7-day per week basis, for a  period of 90 days. However, based primarily on practical considerations,  exposure on a 5-day-per-week basis for 6 hours per day is the minimum  acceptable exposure period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Observation period. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Duration of observation shall be for at  least 90 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Animals in a satellite group scheduled for followup  observations should be kept for at least 28 days further without  treatment to detect recovery from, or persistence of, toxic effects.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Inhalation exposure. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The animals shall be tested in  inhalation equipment designed to sustain a minimum dynamic air flow of  12 to 15 air changes per hour and ensure an adequate oxygen content of  19 percent and an evenly distributed exposure atmosphere. Where a  chamber is used, its design should minimize crowding of the test animals  and maximize their exposure to the test substance. This is best  accomplished by individual caging. To ensure stability of a chamber  atmosphere, the total ``volume'' of the test animals shall not exceed 5  percent of the volume of the test chamber. Oronasal or head-only  exposure may be used if it is desirable to avoid concurrent exposure by  the dermal or oral routes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A dynamic inhalation system with a suitable flow control system  shall be used. The rate of air flow shall be adjusted to ensure that  conditions throughout the exposure chamber are essentially the same.  Maintenance of slight negative pressure inside the chamber will prevent  leakage of the test substance into surrounding areas.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The temperature at which the test is performed should be  maintained at 22 [deg]C (2[deg]). Ideally, the  relative humidity should be maintained between 40 to 60 percent, but in  certain instances (e.g., tests of aerosols, use of water vehicle) this  may not be practicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Physical measurements. Measurements or monitoring shall be made  of the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The rate of air flow shall be monitored continuously and  recorded at least every 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The actual concentrations of the test substance shall be  measured in the breathing zone. During the exposure   period the actual concentrations of the test substance shall be held as  constant as practicable, monitored continuously or intermittently  depending on the method of analysis, and recorded at least at the  beginning, at an intermediate time, and at the end of the exposure  period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> During the development of the generating system, particle size  analysis shall be performed to establish the stability of aerosol  concentrations with respect to particle size. During exposure, analysis  shall be conducted as often as necessary to determine the consistency of  particle size distribution.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Temperature and humidity shall be monitored continuously but  shall be recorded at least every 30 minutes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Feed and water during exposure period. Feed shall be withheld  during exposure. Water may also be withheld during exposure.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Observation of animals. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Each animal shall be observed daily  and, if necessary, handled to appraise its physical condition.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Additional observations should be made daily with appropriate  actions taken to minimize loss of animals to the study (e.g., necropsy  or refrigeration of those animals found dead and isolation or sacrifice  of weak or moribund animals).</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Signs of toxicity shall be recorded as they are observed  including the time of onset, the degree, and duration.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Cage-side observations should include, but not be limited to,  changes in the skin and fur, eyes and mucous membranes, respiratory,  circulatory, autonomic and central nervous systems, somatomotor activity  and behavior pattern.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Animals shall be weighed weekly. Feed consumption shall also be  determined weekly if abnormal body weight changes are observed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> At the end of the study period all survivors in the  nonsatellite treatment groups shall be sacrificed. Moribund animals  shall be removed and sacrificed when noticed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Clinical examinations. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The following examinations shall be  made on all animals of each sex in each group:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Certain hematology determinations shall be carried out at least  two times during the test period on all groups of animals including  concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just prior to terminal  sacrifice at the end of the test period. Hematology determinations which  are appropriate to all studies: Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentration,  erythrocyte count, total and differential leukocyte count, and a measure  of clotting potential such as clotting time, prothrombin time,  thromboplastin time, or platelet count.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Certain clinical biochemistry determinations on blood should be  carried out at least two times during the test period on all groups of  animals including concurrent controls: After 30 days of test and just  prior to terminal sacrifice at the end of the test period. Clinical  biochemistry test areas which are considered appropriate to all studies:  Electrolyte balance, carbohydrate metabolism, and liver and kidney  function. The selection of specific tests will be influenced by  observations on the mode of action of the substance. Suggested  determinations: calcium, phosphorus, chloride, sodium, potassium,  fasting glucose (with period of fasting appropriate to the species),  serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, (now known as serum alanine  aminotransferase), serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (now known as  serum aspartate aminotransferase), ornithine decarboxylase, gamma  glutamyl transpeptidase, urea nitrogen, albumen, blood creatinine, total  bilirubin, and total serum protein measurements. Other determinations  which may be necessary for an adequate toxicological evaluation include:  Analyses of lipids, hormones, acid/base balance, methemoglobin, and  cholinesterase activity. Additional clinical biochemistry may be  employed, where necessary, to extend the investigation of observed  effects.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The following examinations shall be made on high dose and  control groups. If changes in the eyes are detected, all animals shall  be examined:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Ophthalmological examination, using an ophthalmoscope or  equivalent suitable equipment, shall be made prior to exposure to the  test substance and at the termination of the study.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Urinalysis is not recommended on a routine basis, but only when  there is an indication based on expected and/or observed toxicity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(12)</em> Gross pathology. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All animals shall be subjected to a full  gross necropsy which includes examination of the external surface of the  body, all orifices and the cranial, thoracic, and abdominal cavities and  their contents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> At least the liver, kidneys, adrenals, brain, and gonads shall  be weighed wet, as soon as possible after dissection to avoid drying. In  addition, for the rodent, the brain; for the non-rodent, the thyroid  with parathyroids also shall be weighed wet.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The following organs and tissues, or representative samples  thereof, shall be preserved in a suitable medium for possible future  histopathological examination: All gross lesions; lungs--which should be  removed intact, weighed, and treated with a suitable fixative to ensure  that lung structure is maintained (perfusion with the fixative is  considered to be an effective procedure); nasopharyngeal tissues;  brain--including sections of medulla/pons cerebellar cortex and cerebral  cortex; pituitary; thyroid/parathyroid; thymus; trachea; heart; sternum  with bone marrow; salivary glands; liver; spleen; kidneys; adrenals;  pancreas; gonads; uterus; accessory genital organs (epididymis,  prostate, and, if present, seminal vesicles); aorta; (skin); gall  bladder (if present); esophagus; stomach; duodenum; jejunum; ileum;  cecum; colon; rectum; urinary bladder; representative lymph node;  (mammary gland); (thigh musculature); peripheral nerve; (eyes); (femur-- including articular surface); (spinal cord at three levels--cervical,  midthoracic, and lumbar); and (zymbal and exorbital lachrymal glands).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(13)</em> Histopathology. The following histopathology shall be  performed:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Full histopathology on the respiratory tract and other organs  and tissues, listed above, of all animals in the control and high dose  groups.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All gross lesions in all animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Target organs in all animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The tissues mentioned in brackets (listed above) if indicated  by signs of toxicity or target organ involvement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Lungs of animals (rodents) in the low and intermediate dose  groups shall also be subjected to histopathological examination,  primarily for evidence of infection since this provides a convenient  assessment of the state of health of the animals.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> When a satellite group is used, histopathology shall be  performed on tissues and organs identified as showing effects in the  treated groups.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Data and reporting--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Treatment of results. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Data shall be  summarized in tabular form, showing for each test group the number of  animals at the start of the test, the number of animals showing lesions,  the types of lesions, and the percentage of animals displaying each type  of lesion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> All observed results, quantitative and incidental, should be  evaluated by an appropriate statistical method. Any generally accepted  statistical method may be used; the statistical methods should be  selected during the design of the study.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Evaluation of results. The findings of the subchronic inhalation  toxicity study should be evaluated in conjunction with the findings of  preceding studies and considered in terms of the observed toxic effects  and the necropsy and histopathological findings. The evaluation will  include the relationship between the concentration of the test substance  and duration of exposure, and the presence or absence, the incidence and  severity, of abnormalities, including behavioral and clinical  abnormalities, gross lesions, identified target organs, body weight  changes, effects on mortality and any other general or specific toxic  effects. A properly conducted subchronic test should provide a  satisfactory estimation of a no-effect level.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Test report.
