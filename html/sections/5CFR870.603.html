                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> When group coverage terminates for any reason other than voluntary cancellation, an employee may apply to convert all or any part of his or her Basic and Optional insurance to an individual policy; no medical examination is required. The premiums for the individual policy are based on the employee's age and class of risk. An employee is eligible to convert the policy only if he or she does not return, within 3 calendar days from the terminating event, to a position covered under the group plan. Exception: If an employee is unable to convert, a person having power of attorney for that employee may convert on his or her behalf. If insurance has been assigned under subpart I of this part, it is the assignee(s), not the employee, who has (have) the right to convert.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> When group coverage terminates for any reason other than voluntary cancellation, an employee may apply to convert all or any part of his or her Basic and Optional insurance to an individual policy; no medical examination is required.

OFEGLI must receive the request for conversion within 31 calendar days of the date on the conversion notification the employee receives from the employing agency (60 days if overseas) or within 60 calendar days after the date of the terminating event (90 days, if overseas), whichever is earlier.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If the employee does not request conversion information within the specified time period as described in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, the employee is considered to have refused coverage unless OFEGLI determines the failure was for reasons beyond the employee's control, as described in paragraph (a)(5) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> When an agency fails to provide the notification required in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or the employee/assignee fails to request conversion information within the time limit set in paragraph (a)(3) of this section for reasons beyond his or her control, the employee may make a belated request by writing to OFEGLI. The employee/assignee must make the request within 6 months after becoming eligible to convert the insurance. The employee/assignee must show that he or she was not notified of the loss of coverage and the right to convert and was not otherwise aware of it or that he or she was unable to convert to an individual policy for reasons beyond his or her control. OFEGLI will determine if the employee/assignee is eligible to convert. If the request is approved, the employee must convert within 31 calendar days of that determination.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The individual conversion policy is effective the day after the group coverage ends. The employee/assignee must pay the premiums for any period retroactive to that date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The 31-day extension of coverage provided under this subpart does not depend upon timely notification of the right to convert to an individual policy. The extension cannot be continued beyond 31 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Family members may convert Option C coverage (and name beneficiaries of their choice) if:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The employee dies; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The insurance stops under circumstances that allow the employee to convert Option C coverage but the employee does not convert.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If an employee with Option C coverage dies, the employing office must send a conversion notice to the family members at the employee's last address on file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Family members must submit the request for conversion information to OFEGLI. OFEGLI must receive the request for conversion within 31 calendar days of the date on the conversion notification the employee receives from his or her employing agency (60 days if overseas) or within 60 calendar days after the date of the terminating event (90 days, if overseas), whichever is earlier. There is no extension to these time limits. Family members are considered to have refused coverage if they do not request conversion within these time limits.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> The family members' conversion policy is effective at the end of the employee's 31-day extension of coverage.
