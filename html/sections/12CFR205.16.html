                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definition. Automated teller machine operator means any person that operates an automated teller machine

at which a consumer initiates an electronic fund transfer or a balance inquiry and that does not hold the account to or from which the transfer is made, or about which an inquiry is made.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General. An automated teller machine operator that imposes a fee on a consumer for initiating an electronic fund transfer or a balance inquiry shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide notice that a fee will be imposed for providing electronic fund transfer services or a balance inquiry; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Disclose the amount of the fee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Notice requirement. To meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section, an automated teller machine operator must comply with the following:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> On the machine. Post in a prominent and conspicuous location on or at the automated teller machine a notice that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A fee will be imposed for providing electronic fund transfer services or for a balance inquiry; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A fee may be imposed for providing electronic fund transfer services or for a balance inquiry, but the notice in this paragraph (c)(1)(ii) may be substituted for the notice in paragraph (c)(1)(i) only if there are circumstances under which a fee will not be imposed for such services; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Screen or paper notice.
