the time the pat-down search is required or in exigent circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Cross-gender pat-down searches of female detainees shall not be conducted unless in exigent circumstances.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> All cross-gender pat-down searches shall be documented.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Cross-gender strip searches or cross-gender visual body cavity searches shall not be conducted except in exigent circumstances, including consideration of officer safety, or when performed by medical practitioners.
