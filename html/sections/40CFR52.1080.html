                            <p class="depth0">On March 24, 1994 Maryland's Department of the Environment submitted a plan for the establishment and implementation of a Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program as a state implementation plan (SIP) revision, as required by section 182(c)(1) of the Clean Air Act. EPA approved the Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) Program on September 11, 1995 and made it part of Maryland SIP. As with all components of the SIP, Maryland must implement the program as submitted and approved by EPA.
