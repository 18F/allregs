(1) An accredited laboratory must expeditiously report analytical results, in the analyte category for which accreditation was granted, of official samples on designated forms to the Data Center Staff, USDA/FSIS Eastern Laboratory, Russell Research Center, P.O. Box 6085, Athens, GA 30604 (for U.S. Postal Service delivery), or Data Center Staff, USDA/FSIS Eastern Laboratory, Russell Research Center, 950 College Station Road, Athens, GA 30605 (for commercial carrier delivery). When so provided for by FSIS, analytical results may be reported to the Data Center Staff by facsimile at (706) 546-3589, or electronically. The Federal inspector at any establishment may assign the analysis of official samples to an FSIS laboratory if, in the inspector's judgment, there are delays in receiving test results on official samples from an accredited laboratory.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An accredited laboratory must expeditiously report analytical results, in the analyte category for which accreditation was granted, of official samples on designated forms to the Data Center Staff, USDA/FSIS Eastern Laboratory, Russell Research Center, P.O.

Supporting documentation must be made available to FSIS upon request.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Records. An accredited laboratory must:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Maintain laboratory quality control records for the most recent three years that samples have been analyzed under this Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Maintain complete records of the receipt, analysis, and disposition of official samples for the most recent three years that samples have been analyzed under this Program.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Maintain in a secure electronic format or in a standards book, which is preferably a permanently bound book with sequentially numbered pages, all records, readings, and calculations for standard solutions. All entries are to be dated and signed by the analyst immediately upon completion of the entry, and by the supervisor, or in the absence of the supervisor by the supervisor's designee, before use of the standard solution but no later than within one week. The standards book is to be retained for three years after the last recorded entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Maintain records and supervisor approvals of recoveries, and of instrument maintenance and calibration. The records are to be retained for three years after the last recorded entry.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> As provided in paragraph (f) of this section, records should be available for review by any duly authorized representative of the Secretary of Agriculture, including ALP personnel or their designees.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Check samples.
