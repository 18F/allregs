                            <p class="depth0">Prior to drilling, an oil or gas lessee must notify the other lessees of its intent to drill. When an oil lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation or zone having indications of possible gas production, or the gas lessee in drilling a well encounters a formation or zone having indication of possible oil production, the lessee must immediately notify the other lessee and the Superintendent. The lessee drilling the well must obtain all information that a prudent lessee would utilize to evaluate the productive capability of such formation or zone.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Gas well to be turned over to gas lessee. If an oil lessee drills a gas well, it must, without removing from the well any of the casing or other equipment, immediately shut the well in and notify the gas lessee and the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the gas lessee does not, within 45 calendar days after receiving notice and determining the cost of drilling, elect to take over such well and reimburse the oil lessee the cost of drilling, including all damages paid and the cost in-place of casing, tubing, and other equipment, the oil lessee must immediately confine the gas to the original stratum. The disposition of such well and the production therefrom will then be subject to the approval of the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, the Superintendent will apportion the cost between the oil and gas lessees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Oil well to be turned over to oil lessee. If a gas lessee drills an oil well, then it must immediately, without removing from the well any of the casing or other equipment, notify the oil lessee and the Superintendent.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the oil lessee does not, within 45 calendar days after receipt of notice and cost of drilling, elect to take over the well, it must immediately notify the gas lessee. From that point, the Superintendent must approve the disposition of the well, and any gas produced from it.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the oil lessee chooses to take over the well, it must pay to the gas lessee:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The cost of drilling the well, including all damages paid; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The cost in place of casing and other equipment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the oil lessee and the gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, the Superintendent will apportion the cost between the oil and gas lessees.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Lands not leased. If a gas lessee drills an oil well upon lands not leased for oil purposes or vice versa, the Superintendent may, until such time as said lands are leased, permit the lessee who drilled the well to operate and market the production therefrom. When said lands are leased, the lessee who drilled and completed the well must be reimbursed by the oil or gas lessee for the cost of drilling said well, including all damages paid and the cost of in-place casing, tubing, and other equipment. If the lessee does not elect to take over said well as provided above, the disposition of such well and the production therefrom will be determined by the Superintendent. In the event the oil lessee and gas lessee cannot agree on the cost of the well, such cost will be apportioned between the oil and gas lessee by the Superintendent.</p>
