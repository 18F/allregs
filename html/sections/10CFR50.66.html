                                Sec. 50.66  Requirements for thermal annealing of the reactor pressure
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> For those light water nuclear power reactors where neutron  radiation has reduced the fracture toughness of the reactor vessel  materials, a thermal annealing may be applied to the reactor vessel to  recover the fracture toughness of the material. The use of a thermal  annealing treatment is subject to the requirements in this section. A  report describing the licensee's plan for conducting the thermal  annealing must be submitted in accordance with Sec. 50.4 at least three  years prior to the date at which the limiting fracture toughness  criteria in Sec. 50.61 or appendix G to part 50 would be exceeded.  Within three years of the submittal of the Thermal Annealing Report and  at least thirty days prior to the start of the thermal annealing, the  NRC will review the Thermal Annealing Report and make available the  results of its evaluation at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov. The  licensee may begin the thermal anneal after:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Submitting the Thermal Annealing Report required by paragraph  (b) of this section;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The NRC makes available the results of its evaluation of the  Thermal Annealing Report at the NRC Web site, http://www.nrc.gov; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The requirements of paragraph (f)(1) of this section have been  satisfied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Thermal Annealing Report. The Thermal Annealing Report must  include: a Thermal Annealing Operating Plan; a Requalification  Inspection and Test Program; a Fracture Toughness Recovery and  Reembrittlement Trend Assurance Program; and an Identification of  Changes Requiring a License Amendment.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Thermal Annealing Operating Plan. The thermal annealing  operating plan must include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A detailed description of the pressure vessel and all structures  and components that are expected to experience significant thermal or  stress effects during the thermal annealing operation;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> An evaluation of the effects of mechanical and thermal stresses  and temperatures on the vessel, containment, biological shield, attached  piping and appurtenances, and adjacent equipment and components to  demonstrate that operability of the reactor will not be detrimentally  affected. This evaluation must include:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Detailed thermal and structural analyses to establish the time  and temperature profile of the annealing operation. These analyses must  include heatup and cooldown rates, and must   demonstrate that localized temperatures, thermal stress gradients, and  subsequent residual stresses will not result in unacceptable dimensional  changes or distortions in the vessel, attached piping and appurtenances,  and that the thermal annealing cycle will not result in unacceptable  degradation of the fatigue life of these components.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The effects of localized high temperatures on degradation of the  concrete adjacent to the vessel and changes in thermal and mechanical  properties, if any, of the reactor vessel insulation, and on detrimental  effects, if any, on containment and the biological shield. If the design  temperature limitations for the adjacent concrete structure are to be  exceeded during the thermal annealing operation, an acceptable maximum  temperature for the concrete must be established for the annealing  operation using appropriate test data.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The methods, including heat source, instrumentation and  procedures proposed for performing the thermal annealing. This shall  include any special precautions necessary to minimize occupational  exposure, in accordance with the As Low As Reasonably Achievable (ALARA)  principle and the provisions of Sec. 20.1206.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The proposed thermal annealing operating parameters, including  bounding conditions for temperatures and times, and heatup and cooldown  schedules.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The thermal annealing time and temperature parameters selected  must be based on projecting sufficient recovery of fracture toughness,  using the procedures of paragraph (e) of this section, to satisfy the  requirements of Sec. 50.60 and Sec. 50.61 for the proposed period of  operation addressed in the application.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The time and temperature parameters evaluated as part of the  thermal annealing operating plan, and supported by the evaluation  results of paragraph (b)(1)(ii) of this section, represent the bounding  times and temperatures for the thermal annealing operation. If these  bounding conditions for times and temperatures are violated during the  thermal annealing operation, then the annealing operation is considered  not in accordance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan, as required  by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, and the licensee must comply with  paragraph (c)(2) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The inspection and  test program to requalify the annealed reactor vessel must include the  detailed monitoring, inspections, and tests proposed to demonstrate that  the limitations on temperatures, times and temperature profiles, and  stresses evaluated for the proposed thermal annealing conditions of  paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of this section have not been exceeded, and to  determine the thermal annealing time and temperature to be used in  quantifying the fracture toughness recovery. The requalification  inspection and test program must demonstrate that the thermal annealing  operation has not degraded the reactor vessel, attached piping or  appurtenances, or the adjacent concrete structures to a degree that  could affect the safe operation of the reactor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(ii)</em> of this section.  Recovery and reembrittlement evaluations shall include:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Recovery Evaluations. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The percent recovery of both  RTNDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be determined by one  of the procedures described in paragraph (e) of this section, using the  proposed lower bound thermal annealing time and temperature conditions  described in the operating plan.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If the percent recovery is determined from testing surveillance  specimens or from testing materials removed from the reactor vessel,  then it shall be demonstrated that the proposed thermal annealing  parameters used in the test program are equal to or bounded by those  used in the vessel annealing operation.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(C)</em> If generic computational methods are used, appropriate  justification must be submitted as a part of the application.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reembrittlement Evaluations. </p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> The projected post-anneal  reembrittlement of RTNDT must be calculated using the  procedures in Sec. 50.61(c), or must be determined using the same basis  as that used for the pre-anneal operating period. The projected change  due to post-anneal reembrittlement for Charpy upper-shelf energy must be  determined using the same basis as that used for the pre-anneal  operating period.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The post-anneal reembrittlement trend of both RTNDT  and Charpy upper-shelf energy must be estimated, and must be monitored  using a surveillance program defined in the Thermal Annealing Report and  which conforms to the intent of appendix H of this part, ``Reactor  Vessel Material Surveillance Program Requirements.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Identification of Changes Requiring a License Amendment. Any  changes to the facility as described in the final safety analysis report  (as updated) which requires a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) of this part, and any changes to the Technical  Specifications, which are necessary to either conduct the thermal  annealing or to operate the nuclear power reactor following the  annealing must be identified. The section shall demonstrate that the  Commission's requirements continue to be complied with, and that there  is reasonable assurance of adequate protection to the public health and  safety following the changes.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Completion or Termination of Thermal Annealing. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the  thermal annealing was completed in accordance with the Thermal Annealing  Operating Plan and the Requalification Inspection and Test Program, the  licensee shall so confirm in writing to the Director, Office of Nuclear  Reactor Regulation. The licensee may restart its reactor after the  requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> and any changes to the Technical Specifications shall  also be identified.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If no changes requiring a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) or changes to Technical Specifications are identified, the  licensee may restart its reactor after the requirements of paragraph  (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If any changes requiring a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) or changes to the Technical Specifications are identified,  the licensee may not restart its reactor until approval is obtained from  the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and the requirements  of paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the thermal annealing was terminated prior to completion, the  licensee shall immediately notify the NRC of the premature termination  of the thermal anneal.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If the partial annealing was otherwise performed in accordance  with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the  Requalification Inspection and Test Program, and the licensee does not  elect to take credit for any recovery, the licensee need not submit the  Thermal Annealing Results Report required by paragraph (d) of this  section but instead shall confirm in writing to the Director, Office of  Nuclear Reactor Regulation that the partial annealing was otherwise  performed in accordance   with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the  Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The licensee may restart  its reactor after the requirements of paragraph (f)(2) of this section  have been met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the partial annealing was otherwise performed in accordance  with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant portions of the  Requalification Inspection and Test Program, and the licensee elects to  take full or partial credit for the partial annealing, the licensee  shall confirm in writing to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor  Regulation that the partial annealing was otherwise performed in  compliance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and relevant  portions of the Requalification Inspection and Test Program. The  licensee may restart its reactor after the requirements of paragraph  (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the partial annealing was not performed in accordance with  the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and the Requalification Inspection  and Test Program, the licensee shall submit a summary of lack of  compliance with the Thermal Annealing Operating Plan and the  Requalification Inspection and Test Program and a justification for  subsequent operation to the Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor  Regulation. Any changes to the facility as described in the final safety  analysis report (as updated) which are attributable to the  noncompliances and which require a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) and any changes to the technical specifications which are  required as a result of the noncompliances, shall also be identified.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> If no changes requiring a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) or changes to Technical Specifications are identified, the  licensee may restart its reactor after the requirements of paragraph  (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> If any changes requiring a license amendment pursuant to Sec.  50.59(c)(2) or changes to Technical Specifications are identified, the  licensee may not restart its reactor until approval is obtained from the  Director, Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and the requirements of  paragraph (f)(2) of this section have been met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Thermal Annealing Results Report. Every licensee that either  completes a thermal annealing, or that terminates an annealing but  elects to take full or partial credit for the annealing, shall provide  the following information within three months of completing the thermal  anneal, unless an extension is authorized by the Director, Office of  Nuclear Reactor Regulation:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The time and temperature profiles of the actual thermal  annealing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The post-anneal RTNDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy  values of the reactor vessel materials for use in subsequent reactor  operation;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The projected post-anneal reembrittlement trends for both  RTNDT and Charpy upper-shelf energy; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The projected values of RTPTS and Charpy upper-shelf  energy at the end of the proposed period of operation addressed in the  Thermal Annealing Report.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Procedures for Determining the Recovery of Fracture Toughness.
