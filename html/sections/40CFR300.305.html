                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The OSC is responsible for promptly initiating a preliminary  assessment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The preliminary assessment shall be conducted using available  information, supplemented where necessary and possible by an on-scene  inspection. The OSC shall undertake actions to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Evaluate the magnitude and severity of the discharge or threat  to public health or welfare of the United States or the environment;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Assess the feasibility of removal; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> To the extent practicable, identify potentially responsible  parties.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Where practicable, the framework for the response management  structure is a system (e.g., a unified command system), that brings  together the functions of the federal government, the state government,  and the responsible party to achieve an effective and efficient  response, where the OSC maintains authority.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Except in a case when the OSC is required to direct the response  to a discharge that may pose a substantial threat to the public health  or welfare of the United States (including but not limited to fish,  shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and private  beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC may allow the  responsible party to voluntarily and promptly perform removal actions,  provided the OSC determines such actions will ensure an effective and  immediate removal of the discharge or mitigation or prevention of a  substantial threat of a discharge. If the responsible party does conduct  the removal, the OSC shall ensure adequate surveillance over whatever  actions are initiated. If effective actions are not being taken to  eliminate the threat, or if removal is not being properly done, the OSC  should, to the extent practicable under the circumstances, so advise the  responsible party. If the responsible party does not respond properly  the OSC shall take appropriate response actions and should notify the  responsible party of the potential liability for federal response costs  incurred by the OSC pursuant to the OPA and CWA. Where practicable,  continuing efforts should be made to encourage response by responsible  parties.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> In carrying out a response under this section, the OSC may:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Remove or arrange for the removal of a discharge, and mitigate  or prevent a substantial threat of a discharge, at any time;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Direct or monitor all federal, state, and private actions to  remove a discharge; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Remove and, if necessary, destroy a vessel discharging, or  threatening to discharge, by whatever means are available.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the discharge results in a substantial threat to the public  health or welfare of the United States (including, but not limited to  fish, shellfish, wildlife, other natural resources, and the public and  private beaches and shorelines of the United States), the OSC must  direct all response efforts, as provided in Sec. 300.322(b) of this  part. The OSC should declare as expeditiously as practicable to spill  response participants that the federal government will   direct the response. The OSC may act without regard to any other  provision of the law governing contracting procedures or employment of  personnel by the federal government in removing or arranging for the  removal of such a discharge.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The OSC shall ensure that the natural resource trustees are  promptly notified in the event of any discharge of oil, to the maximum  extent practicable as provided in the Fish and Wildlife and Sensitive  Environments Plan annex to the ACP for the area in which the discharge  occurs. The OSC and the trustees shall coordinate assessments,  evaluations, investigations, and planning with respect to appropriate  removal actions. The OSC shall consult with the affected trustees on the  appropriate removal action to be taken. The trustees will provide timely  advice concerning recommended actions with regard to trustee resources  potentially affected. The trustees also will assure that the OSC is  informed of their activities in natural resource damage assessment that  may affect response operations. The trustees shall assure, through the  lead administrative trustee, that all data from the natural resource  damage assessment activities that may support more effective operational  decisions are provided in a timely manner to the OSC. When circumstances  permit, the OSC shall share the use of non-monetary response resources  (i.e., personnel and equipment) with the trustees, provided trustee  activities do not interfere with response actions. The lead  administrative trustee facilitates effective and efficient communication  between the OSC and the other trustees during response operations and is  responsible for applying to the OSC for non-monetary federal response  resources on behalf of all trustees. The lead administrative trustee is  also responsible for applying to the NPFC for funding for initiation of  damage assessment for injuries to natural resources.</p>
