                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Manufacturer's test equipment and facilities. The manufacturer shall provide the following test equipment and facilities for use in production tests and inspections:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A Constant Rate of Traverse tensile testing machine, capable of initial clamp separation of ten inches and a rate of separation of 30 cm (12 in.) per minute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Fletcher, Callaway, U.S. Rubber clamps, or equivalent cam-actuated clamps to prevent slippage and twist of the samples.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> An analytical balance or grain-yarn scale, accurate to within 0.25 percent of the measured value.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Lot size. Lot size must not exceed 460,000 meters (500,000 yds.) or 45 kg (100 lb.) of any color.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Sample selection. Samples must be selected at random by the manufacturer (or inspector, as applicable) after the entire lot of thread has been completed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Second sampling. A second sampling, where required, must consist of five times the original sample size.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Manufacturer's production tests. The component manufacturer shall perform the following tests on the samples indicated (each sample to include at least 5 specimens unless otherwise specified in the referenced test procedure) on each lot of thread:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Breaking strength. One sample must be tested in accordance with Sec. 164.023-7(a)(1) or Sec. 164.023-7(b)(1), as applicable.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length/weight ratio. One sample must be tested in accordance with Sec. 164.023-11(b)(1).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recognized laboratory production tests. Manufacturers shall ensure that the following tests and inspections are performed on non-standard components by a recognized laboratory:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Composition. At least annually, one sample of each accepted thread must be tested in accordance with Sec. 164.023-11(b)(2).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Breaking strength. At least quarterly, one sample in each of the lightest and darkest colors accepted must be tested in accordance with Sec. 164.023-7(a)(1) or Sec. 164.023-7(b)(1), as applicable. This test may be performed by a recognized laboratory, or witnessed by a recognized laboratory inspector at the manufacturer's plant, at the laboratory's discretion.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elongation. At least annually, one sample of each accepted thread in each of the lightest and darkest colors accepted must be tested in accordance with Sec. 164.023-11(b)(3). This test may be performed by a recognized laboratory, or witnessed by a recognized laboratory inspector at the manufacturer's plant, at the laboratory's discretion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Accept/reject criteria. Unless the alternate procedures as permitted by Sec. 164.019-013(m) are followed, the results

of required production testing on a lot must meet the following criteria for the lot to be shipped as Coast Guard-accepted thread:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Breaking strength test results must be within 10 percent below and 20 percent above the acceptance testing values but not less than the performance minimums.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Length/weight values must be within 5 percent of the acceptance testing values but not less than the performance minimums.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Elongation values must be within 20 percent of the acceptance testing values but not less than the performance minimums.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Composition testing must indicate that the sample tested is of identical composition to the sample tested for acceptance or in accordance with the performance specification.</p>
