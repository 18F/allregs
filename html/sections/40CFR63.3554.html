                            <p class="depth0">The capture efficiency of your emission capture system must be 100 percent to use the control efficiency/outlet concentration option. You may assume the capture system efficiency is 100 percent if both of the conditions in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section are met.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> The capture system meets the criteria in Method 204 of appendix M to 40 CFR part 51 for a PTE and directs all the exhaust gases from the enclosure to an add-on control device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> All coatings and thinners used in the coating operation are applied within the capture system, and coating solvent flash-off, curing, and drying occurs within the capture system. This criterion is not met if parts enter the open shop environment when being moved between a spray booth and a curing oven.</p>
