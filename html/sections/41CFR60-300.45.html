Quotas are expressly forbidden.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose: The purpose of establishing benchmarks is to create a  quantifiable method by which the contractor can measure its progress  toward achieving equal employment opportunity for protected veterans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Hiring benchmarks shall be set by the contractor on an annual  basis. Benchmarks shall be set using one of the two mechanisms described  below:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Establish a benchmark equaling the national percentage of  veterans in the civilian labor force, which will be published and  updated annually on the OFCCP Web site; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish a benchmark by taking into account:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The average percentage of veterans in the civilian labor force  in the State(s) where the contractor is located over the preceding three  years, as calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and published on  the OFCCP Web site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The number of veterans, over the previous four quarters, who  were participants in the employment service delivery system in the State  where the contractor is located, as tabulated by the Veterans'  Employment and Training Service and published on the OFCCP Web site;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The applicant ratio and hiring ratio for the previous year,  based on the data collected pursuant to Sec. 60-300.44(k);</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> The contractor's recent assessments of the effectiveness of its  external outreach and recruitment efforts, as set forth in Sec. 60- 300.44(f)(3); and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Any other factors, including but not limited to the nature of  the contractor's job openings and/or its location, which would tend to  affect the availability of qualified protected veterans.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The contractor shall document the hiring benchmark it has  established each year. If the contractor sets its benchmark using the  procedure in paragraph (b)(2) of this section, it shall document each of  the factors that it considered in establishing the hiring benchmark and  the relative significance of each of these factors. The contractor shall  retain these records for a period of three (3) years.</p>
