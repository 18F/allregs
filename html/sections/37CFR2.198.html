The Priority Mail Express procedure does not apply to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Applications for registration of marks;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Amendments to allege use under section 1(c) of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Statements of use under section 1(d) of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Requests for extension of time to file a statement of use under section 1(d) of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Affidavits of continued use under section 8 of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Renewal requests under section 9 of the Act;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> Requests to change or correct addresses; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> Affidavits of use under section 71 of the Act.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The date of deposit with USPS is shown by the ``date accepted'' on the Priority Mail Express label or other official USPS notation. If the USPS deposit date cannot be determined, the correspondence will be accorded the date of receipt in the Office as the filing date.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Correspondence should be deposited directly with an employee of the USPS to ensure that the person depositing the correspondence receives a legible copy of the Priority Mail Express mailing label with the ``date accepted'' clearly marked. Persons dealing indirectly with the employees of the USPS (such as by deposit in a Priority Mail Express drop box) do so at the risk of not receiving a copy of the Priority Mail Express mailing label with the desired ``date accepted'' clearly marked. The paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence should also include the Priority Mail Express mailing label number thereon. See paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Any person filing correspondence under this section that was received by the Office and delivered by the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS, who can show that there is a discrepancy between the filing date accorded by the Office to the correspondence and the date of deposit as shown by the ``date accepted'' on the Priority Mail Express mailing label or other official USPS notation, may petition the Director to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the ``date accepted'' on the Priority Mail Express mailing label or other official USPS notation, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The petition is filed within two months after the person becomes aware that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date other than the USPS deposit date;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of the Priority Mail Express mailing label was placed on the paper(s) or fee(s) that constitute the correspondence prior to the original mailing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The petition includes a true copy of the Priority Mail Express mailing label showing the ``date accepted,'' and of any other official notation by the USPS relied upon to show the date of deposit.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Any person filing correspondence under this section that was received by the Office and delivered by the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS, who can show that the ``date accepted'' on the Priority Mail Express mailing label or other official notation entered by the USPS was incorrectly entered or omitted by the USPS, may petition the Director to accord the correspondence a filing date as of the date the correspondence is shown to have been deposited with the USPS, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The petition is filed within two months after the person becomes aware that the Office has accorded, or will accord, a filing date based upon an incorrect entry by the USPS;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of the Priority Mail Express mailing label was placed on the paper(s) or fee(s) prior to the original mailing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The petition includes a showing that establishes, to the satisfaction of the Director, that the correspondence was deposited in the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service prior to the last scheduled pickup on the requested filing date. Any showing pursuant to this paragraph must be corroborated by evidence from the USPS or evidence that came into being within one business day after the deposit of the correspondence in the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> If correspondence is properly addressed to the Office pursuant to Sec.  2.190 and deposited with sufficient postage in the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service of the USPS, but not received by the Office, the party who mailed the correspondence may petition the Director to consider such correspondence filed in the Office on the USPS deposit date, provided that:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The petition is filed within two months after the person becomes aware that the Office has no evidence of receipt of the correspondence;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The number of the Priority Mail Express mailing label was placed on the paper(s) or fee(s) prior to the original mailing;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The petition includes a copy of the originally deposited paper(s) or fee(s) showing the number of the Priority Mail Express mailing label thereon, a copy of any returned postcard receipt, a copy of the Priority Mail Express mailing label showing the ``date accepted,'' a copy of any other official notation by the USPS relied upon to show the date of deposit, and, if the requested filing date is a date other than the ``date accepted'' on the Priority Mail Express mailing label or other official notation entered by the USPS, a showing pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section that the correspondence was deposited in the Priority Mail Express Post Office to Addressee service prior to the last scheduled pickup on the requested filing date; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The petition includes a statement that establishes, to the satisfaction of the Director, the original deposit of the correspondence and that the copies of the correspondence, the copy of the Priority Mail Express mailing label, the copy of any returned postcard receipt, and any official notation entered by the USPS are true copies of the originally mailed correspondence, original Priority Mail Express mailing label, returned postcard receipt, and official notation entered by the USPS.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> The Office may require additional evidence to determine whether the correspondence was deposited as Priority Mail Express with the USPS on the date in question.
