                                Sec. 63.7882  What site remediation sources at my facility does this subpart  affect?

                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(1)</em> through (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Process vents. The affected source is the entire group of  process vents associated with the in-situ and ex-situ remediation  processes used at your site to remove, destroy, degrade, transform, or  immobilize hazardous substances in the remediation material subject to  remediation. Examples of such in-situ remediation processes include, but  are not limited to, soil vapor extraction and bioremediation processes.  Examples of such ex-situ remediation processes include but are not  limited to, thermal desorption, bioremediation, and air stripping  processes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Remediation material management units. Remediation material  management unit means a tank, surface impoundment, container, oil-water  separator, organic-water separator, or transfer system, as defined in  Sec. 63.7957, and is used at your site to manage remediation material.  The affected source is the entire group of remediation material  management units used for the site remediations at your site. For the  purpose of this subpart, a tank or container that is also equipped with  a vent that serves as a process vent, as defined in Sec. 63.7957, is  not a remediation material management unit, but instead this unit is  considered to be a process vent affected source under paragraph (a)(1)  of this section.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)(i)</em> and (ii) of this section. If either of these conditions do not  apply to an equipment component, then that component is not part of the  affected source for equipment leaks.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The equipment component contains or contacts remediation  material having a concentration of total HAP listed in Table 1 of this  subpart equal to or greater than 10 percent by weight.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The equipment component is intended to operate for 300 hours or  more during a calendar year in remediation material service, as defined  in Sec. 63.7957.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each affected source for your site is existing if you commenced  construction or reconstruction of the affected source before July 30,  2002.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each affected source for your site is new if you commenced  construction or reconstruction of the affected source on or after July  30, 2002. An affected source is reconstructed if it meets the definition  of reconstruction in Sec. 63.2.</p>
