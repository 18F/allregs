The U.S. Copyright Office maintains a system of Deposit Accounts for the convenience of those who frequently use its services. The system allows an individual or firm to establish a Deposit Account in the U.S. Copyright Office and to make advance deposits into that account. Deposit Account holders can charge copyright fees against the balance in their accounts instead of sending separate remittances with each request for service. For information on Deposit Accounts, see Circular 5 on the U.S. Copyright Office's Web site, or request a copy at the address specified in Sec.  201.1.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Credit cards. For URAA filings the Copyright Office will accept VISA, MasterCard and American Express. Debit cards cannot be accepted for payment. With the NIE, a filer using a credit card must submit a separate cover letter stating the name of the credit card, the credit card number, the expiration date of the credit card, the total amount, and a signature authorizing the Office to charge the fees to the account. To protect the security of the credit card number, the filer must not write the credit card number on the Notice of Intent to Enforce.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Public online access.
