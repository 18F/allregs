                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The cost of certain influencing activities associated with  obtaining grants, contracts, cooperative agreements, or loans is an  unallowable cost. Lobbying with respect to certain grants, contracts,  cooperative agreements, and loans is governed by relevant statutes,  including among others, the provisions of 31 U.S.C. 1352, as well as the  common rule, ``New Restrictions on Lobbying'' published at 55 FR 6736  (February 26, 1990), including definitions, and the Office of Management  and Budget ``Governmentwide Guidance for New Restrictions on Lobbying''  and notices published at 54 FR 52306 (December 20, 1989), 55 FR 24540  (June 15, 1990), 57 FR 1772 (January 15, 1992), and 61 FR 1412 (January  19, 1996).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Executive lobbying costs. Costs incurred in attempting to  improperly influence either directly or indirectly, an employee or  officer of the executive branch of the Federal Government to   give consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or a regulatory  matter are unallowable. Improper influence means any influence that  induces or tends to induce a Federal employee or officer to give  consideration or to act regarding a Federal award or regulatory matter  on any basis other than the merits of the matter.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> In addition to the above, the following restrictions are  applicable to nonprofit organizations and IHEs:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Costs associated with the following activities are unallowable:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Attempts to influence the outcomes of any Federal, state, or  local election, referendum, initiative, or similar procedure, through  in-kind or cash contributions, endorsements, publicity, or similar  activity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Establishing, administering, contributing to, or paying the  expenses of a political party, campaign, political action committee, or  other organization established for the purpose of influencing the  outcomes of elections in the United States;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any attempt to influence:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em>The introduction of Federal or state legislation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state  legislation through communication with any member or employee of the  Congress or state legislature (including efforts to influence state or  local officials to engage in similar lobbying activity);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> The enactment or modification of any pending Federal or state  legislation by preparing, distributing, or using publicity or  propaganda, or by urging members of the general public, or any segment  thereof, to contribute to or participate in any mass demonstration,  march, rally, fund raising drive, lobbying campaign or letter writing or  telephone campaign; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(D)</em> Any government official or employee in connection with a  decision to sign or veto enrolled legislation;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Legislative liaison activities, including attendance at  legislative sessions or committee hearings, gathering information  regarding legislation, and analyzing the effect of legislation, when  such activities are carried on in support of or in knowing preparation  for an effort to engage in unallowable lobbying.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The following activities are excepted from the coverage of  paragraph (c)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Technical and factual presentations on topics directly related  to the performance of a grant, contract, or other agreement (through  hearing testimony, statements, or letters to the Congress or a state  legislature, or subdivision, member, or cognizant staff member thereof),  in response to a documented request (including a Congressional Record  notice requesting testimony or statements for the record at a regularly  scheduled hearing) made by the non-Federal entity's member of congress,  legislative body or a subdivision, or a cognizant staff member thereof,  provided such information is readily obtainable and can be readily put  in deliverable form, and further provided that costs under this section  for travel, lodging or meals are unallowable unless incurred to offer  testimony at a regularly scheduled Congressional hearing pursuant to a  written request for such presentation made by the Chairman or Ranking  Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee conducting such  hearings;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Any lobbying made unallowable by paragraph (c)(1)(iii) of this  section to influence state legislation in order to directly reduce the  cost, or to avoid material impairment of the non-Federal entity's  authority to perform the grant, contract, or other agreement; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Any activity specifically authorized by statute to be  undertaken with funds from the Federal award.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Any activity excepted from the definitions of ``lobbying'' or  ``influencing legislation'' by the Internal Revenue Code provisions that  require nonprofit organizations to limit their participation in direct  and ``grass roots'' lobbying activities in order to retain their  charitable deduction status and avoid punitive excise taxes, I.R.C.  Secs. 501(c)(3), 501(h), 4911(a), including:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Nonpartisan analysis, study, or research reports;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> Examinations and discussions of broad social, economic, and  similar problems; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(C)</em> Information provided upon request by a legislator for technical  advice and assistance, as defined by I.R.C.   Sec. 4911(d)(2) and 26 CFR 56.4911-2(c)(1)-(c)(3).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> When a non-Federal entity seeks reimbursement for indirect (F&A;)  costs, total lobbying costs must be separately identified in the  indirect (F&A;) cost rate proposal, and thereafter treated as other  unallowable activity costs in accordance with the procedures of  Sec. 200.413 Direct costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The non-Federal entity must submit as part of its annual  indirect (F&A;) cost rate proposal a certification that the requirements  and standards of this section have been complied with. (See also  Sec. 200.415 Required certifications.)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em></p><p class="depth0"><em>(A)</em> Time logs, calendars, or similar records are not required  to be created for purposes of complying with the record keeping  requirements in Sec. 200.302 Financial management with respect to  lobbying costs during any particular calendar month when:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> and (c)(2) of this section) 25 percent or less of the employee's  compensated hours of employment during that calendar month; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Within the preceding five-year period, the non-Federal entity  has not materially misstated allowable or unallowable costs of any  nature, including legislative lobbying costs.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(B)</em> When conditions in paragraph (c)(2)(vii)(A)(1) and (2) of this  section are met, non-Federal entities are not required to establish  records to support the allowability of claimed costs in addition to  records already required or maintained. Also, when conditions in  paragraphs (c)(2)(vii)(A)(1) and (2) of this section are met, the  absence of time logs, calendars, or similar records will not serve as a  basis for disallowing costs by contesting estimates of lobbying time  spent by employees during a calendar month.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(viii)</em> The Federal awarding agency must establish procedures for  resolving in advance, in consultation with OMB, any significant  questions or disagreements concerning the interpretation or application  of this section. Any such advance resolutions must be binding in any  subsequent settlements, audits, or investigations with respect to that  grant or contract for purposes of interpretation of this part, provided,  however, that this must not be construed to prevent a contractor or non- Federal entity from contesting the lawfulness of such a determination.</p>
