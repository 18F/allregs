                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line or granular triple superphosphate process line subject to the provisions of this subpart shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a monitoring system which can be used to determine and permanently record the mass flow of phosphorus-bearing feed material to the process. The monitoring system shall have an accuracy of q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line or granular triple superphosphate process line subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain a daily record of equivalent P2O5 feed by first determining the total mass rate in metric ton/hour of phosphorus bearing feed using a monitoring system for measuring mass flowrate which meets the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section and then by proceeding according to Sec.  63.626(c)(3).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing diammonium and/or monoammonium phosphate process line, granular triple superphosphate process line, or granular triple superphosphate storage building using a wet scrubbing emission control system shall install, calibrate, maintain, and operate the following monitoring systems:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> A monitoring system which continuously measures and permanently records the pressure drop across each scrubber in the process scrubbing system in 15-minute block averages. The monitoring system shall be certified by the manufacturer to have an accuracy of q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> A monitoring system which continuously measures and permanently records the flow rate of the scrubbing liquid to each scrubber in the process scrubbing system in 15-minute block averages. The monitoring system shall be certified by the manufacturer to have an accuracy of q5 percent over its operating range.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The owner or operator of any granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain an accurate account of granular triple superphosphate in storage to permit the determination of the amount of equivalent P2O5 stored.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)(1)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain a daily record of total equivalent P2O5 stored by multiplying the percentage P2O5 content, as determined by Sec.  63.626(d)(3), times the total mass of granular triple superphosphate stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Each owner or operator of a new or existing granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart shall maintain a daily record of total equivalent P2O5 stored by multiplying the percentage P2O5 content, as determined by Sec.  63.626(d)(3), times the total mass of granular triple superphosphate stored.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of any granular triple superphosphate storage building subject to the provisions of this subpart shall develop for approval by the Administrator a site-specific methodology including sufficient recordkeeping for the purposes of demonstrating compliance with Sec.  63.622(c)(2) or Sec.  63.623(c)(2), as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Following the date on which the performance test required in Sec.  63.626 is completed, the owner or operator of a new or existing affected source using a wet scrubbing emission control system and subject to emissions limitations for total fluorides or particulate matter contained in this subpart must establish allowable ranges for operating parameters using the methodology of either paragraph (f)(1) or (2) of this section:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The allowable range for the daily averages of the pressure drop across each scrubber and of the flow rate of the scrubbing liquid to each scrubber in the process scrubbing system is q20 percent of the baseline average value determined as a requirement of Sec.  63.626(c)(4) or (d)(4). The Administrator retains the right to reduce the q20 percent adjustment to the baseline average values of operating ranges in those instances where performance test results indicate that a source's level of emissions is near the value of an applicable emissions standard, but in no instance shall the adjustment be reduced to less than q10 percent. The owner or operator must notify the Administrator of the baseline average value and must notify the Administrator each time that the baseline value is changed as a result of the most recent performance test. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, the owner or operator shall determine whether new allowable ranges of baseline average values will be based upon the new performance test or (if the new performance test results are within the previously established range) whether there will be no change in the operating parameters derived from previous tests. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested and the performance test results are submitted to the Administrator pursuant to Sec. Sec.  63.627(c)(1), 63.7(g)(1), and/or 63.10(d)(2), the owner or operator will indicate whether the operating range will be based on the new performance test or the previously established range. If the Administrator has not denied approval of the new operating ranges within 30 days of submission of the performance test results, the new ranges shall be deemed approved and the new baseline value shall then be effective on the 31st day following submission.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The owner or operator of any new or existing affected source shall establish, and provide to the Administrator for approval, allowable ranges for the daily averages of the pressure drop across and of the flow rate of the scrubbing liquid to each scrubber in the process scrubbing system for the purpose of assuring compliance with this subpart. Allowable ranges may be based upon baseline average values recorded during previous performance tests using the test methods required in Sec.  63.626(c)(4) or (d)(4). As an alternative, the owner or operator can establish the allowable ranges using the results of performance tests conducted specifically for the purposes of this paragraph using the test methods required in this subpart and established in the manner required in Sec.  63.626(c)(4) or (d)(4). The source shall certify that the control devices and processes have not been modified subsequent to the testing upon which the data used to establish the allowable ranges were obtained. The allowable ranges developed pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph must be submitted to the Administrator for approval. The owner or operator must request and obtain approval of the Administrator for changes to the allowable ranges. When a source using the methodology of this paragraph is retested, the owner or operator shall determine new allowable ranges of baseline average values unless the retest indicates no change in the operating parameters outside the previously established ranges. If the Administrator has not denied approval of the new operating ranges within 30 days of submission of the performance test results, the new ranges shall be deemed approved and the new baseline value shall then be effective on the 31st day following submission.
