This action sets the emission limit applicable to the facility to 1.0 pound per million British thermal units (MMBtu) for units 4 and 5 if both are operated on coal, or to 1.5 lb/MMBtu for one unit if the other is operated on fuel oil, natural gas or is not operated at all, as set forth in the Certificates to Operate issued by NYSDEC on April 3, 1991. The SO2 emission limit, monitoring and recordkeeping requirements pertaining to the SO2 emissions are incorporated by reference into the Certificates to Operate.
