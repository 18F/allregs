This test shall begin under supported roof and progress no further than the location where the next support is to be installed.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When a hazardous roof, face, or rib condition is detected, the condition shall be corrected before there is any other work or travel in the affected area. If the affected area is left unattended, each entrance to the area shall be posted with a readily visible warning, or a physical barrier shall be installed to impede travel into the area.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A bar for taking down loose material shall be available in the working place or on all face equipment except haulage equipment.
