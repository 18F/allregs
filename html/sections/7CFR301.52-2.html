The Deputy Administrator shall list as regulated areas in a supplemental regulation designated as Sec. 301.52-2a, the quarantined States, territories, or districts, or portions thereof, in which pink bollworm has been found or in which there is reason to believe that pink bollworm is present, or which it is deemed necessary to regulate because of their proximity to infestation or their inseparability for quarantine enforcement purposes from infested localities. The Deputy Administrator, in the supplemental regulation, may divide any regulated area into a suppressive area and a generally infested area in accordance with the definitions thereof in Sec. 301.52-1. Less than an entire quarantined State, territory, or district will be designated as a regulated area only if the Deputy Administrator is of the opinion that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The State, territory, or district has adopted and is enforcing a quarantine or regulations which imposes restrictions on the intrastate movement of the regulated articles which are substantially the same as those which are imposed with respect to the interstate movement of such articles under this subpart; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> The designation of less than the entire State, territory, or district, as a regulated area will otherwise be adequate to prevent the interstate spread of the pink bollworm.
