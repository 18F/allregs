                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Application data sheet. An application data sheet is a sheet or sheets that may be submitted in a provisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(b), a nonprovisional application under 35 U.S.C. 111(a), a nonprovisional international design application, or a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 and must be submitted when required by Sec.  1.55 or 1.78 to claim priority to or the benefit of a prior-filed application under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, 365, or 386. An application data sheet must be titled ``Application Data Sheet.'' An application data sheet must contain all of the section headings listed in paragraph (b) of this section, except as provided in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, with any appropriate data for each section heading. If an application data sheet is provided, the application data sheet is part of the application for which it has been submitted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Bibliographic data. Bibliographic data as used in paragraph (a) of this section includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Inventor information. This information includes the legal name, residence, and mailing address of the inventor or each joint inventor.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Correspondence information. This information includes the correspondence address, which may be indicated by reference to a customer number, to which correspondence is to be directed (see Sec.  1.33(a)).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Application information. This information includes the title of the invention, the total number of drawing sheets, a suggested drawing figure for publication (in a nonprovisional application), any docket number assigned to the application, the type of application (e.g., utility, plant, design, reissue, provisional), whether the application discloses any significant part of the subject matter of an application under a secrecy order pursuant to Sec.  5.2 of this chapter (see Sec.  5.2(c)), and, for plant applications, the Latin name of the genus and species of the plant claimed, as well as the variety denomination. When information concerning the previously filed application is required under Sec.  1.57(a), application information also includes the reference to the previously filed application, indicating that the specification and any drawings of the application are replaced by the reference to the previously filed application, and specifying the previously filed application by application number, filing date, and the intellectual property authority or country in which the previously filed application was filed.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Representative information. This information includes the registration number of each practitioner having a power of attorney in the application (preferably by reference to a customer number).

This information includes the application number, the filing date, the status (including patent number if available), and relationship of each application for which a benefit is claimed under 35 U.S.C. 119(e), 120, 121, 365(c), or 386(c). Providing this information in the application data sheet constitutes the specific reference required by 35 U.S.C. 119(e) or 120 and Sec.  1.78.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Foreign priority information. This information includes the application number, country (or intellectual property authority), and filing date of each foreign application for which priority is claimed.

Providing assignment information in the application data sheet does not substitute for compliance with any requirement of part 3 of this chapter to have an assignment recorded by the Office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Correcting and updating an application data sheet. (1) Information in a previously submitted application data sheet, inventor's oath or declaration under Sec.  1.63, Sec.  1.64 or Sec.  1.67, or otherwise of record, may be corrected or updated until payment of the issue fee by a new

application data sheet providing corrected or updated information, except that inventorship changes must comply with the requirements of Sec.  1.48, foreign priority and domestic benefit information changes must comply with Sec.

The application data sheet must include the section headings listed in paragraph (b) of this section for each section included in the application data sheet, and must identify the information that is being changed, with underlining for insertions, and strike-through or brackets for text removed, except that identification of information being changed is not required for an application data sheet included with an initial submission under 35 U.S.C. 371.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Inconsistencies between application data sheet and other documents. For inconsistencies between information that is supplied by both an application data sheet under this section and other documents:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The most recent submission will govern with respect to inconsistencies as between the information provided in an application data sheet, a designation of a correspondence address, or by the inventor's oath or declaration, except that:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The most recent application data sheet will govern with respect to foreign priority (Sec.  1.55) or domestic benefit (Sec.  1.78) claims; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The naming of the inventorship is governed by Sec.  1.41 and changes to inventorship or the names of the inventors is governed by Sec.  1.48.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The information in the application data sheet will govern when inconsistent with the information supplied at the same time by a designation of correspondence address or the inventor's oath or declaration.

The requirement in Sec.  1.46 for the presentation of the name of the applicant under 35 U.S.C. 118 in an application data sheet will be satisfied by the presentation of the name of the applicant in the Patent Law Treaty Model International Request Form, Patent Law Treaty Model International Request for Recordation of Change in Name or Address Form, or Patent Law Treaty Model International Request for Recordation of Change in Applicant or Owner Form, as applicable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Patent Cooperation Treaty Request Form. The requirement in Sec.  1.78 for the presentation of a benefit claim under 35

U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, or 365 in an application data sheet will be satisfied in a national stage application under 35 U.S.C. 371 by the presentation of such benefit claim in the Patent Cooperation Treaty Request Form contained in the international application or the presence of such benefit claim on the front page of the publication of the international application under PCT Article 21(2). The requirement in Sec.  1.55 or Sec.  1.78 for the presentation of a priority or benefit claim under 35 U.S.C. 119, 120, 121, or 365 in an application data sheet and the requirement in Sec.  1.46 for the presentation of the name of the applicant under 35 U.S.C. 118 in an application data sheet will be satisfied in an application under 35 U.S.C. 111 by the presentation of such priority or benefit claim and presentation of the name of the applicant in a Patent Cooperation Treaty Request Form.
