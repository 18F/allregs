                            <p class="depth0">A mobile station authorized to operate on a mobile service frequency  above 25 MHz may be used as a mobile repeater to extend the  communications range of hand-carried units subject to the following:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Mobile repeaters and/or associated hand-carried transmitters may  be assigned separate base/mobile frequencies for this use in addition to  the   number of frequencies normally assignable to the licensee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)-(c)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> In the Industrial/Business Pool, on frequencies designated with  an ``LR'' in the coordinator column of the frequency table in Sec.  90.35(b)(3), use of mobile repeaters is on a secondary basis to the  stations of any other licensee. Hand carried units used in connection  with mobile repeaters on frequencies designated with an ``LR'' in the  coordinator column of the frequency table in Sec. 90.35(b)(3) may  operate only above 150 MHz and are limited to a maximum output power of  six watts. The frequency and maximum power shall be specified in the  station authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In the Industrial/Business Pool, on frequencies designated with  an ``LR'' in the coordinator column of the frequency table in Sec.  90.35(b)(3), the output power of a mobile repeater station, when  transmitting as a repeater station on the frequency used for  communication with its associated pack-carried or hand-carried units,  shall not exceed 6 watts except when the same frequency is also used by  the same station for direct communication with vehicular mobile units or  with one or more base stations.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> When automatically retransmitting messages originated by or  destined for hand-carried units, each mobile station shall activate the  mobile transmitter only with a continuous access signal, the absence of  which will de-activate the mobile transmitter. The continuous access  signal is not required when the mobile unit is equipped with a switch  that activates the automatic mode of the mobile unit and an automatic  time-delay device that de-activates the transmitter after any  uninterrupted transmission period in excess of 3 minutes. For the  purposes of this rule section the continuous access signal can be  achieved by use of digital or analog methods.
