                                Sec. 1.933-1  Exclusion of certain income from sources within Puerto Rico.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General rule. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> An individual (whether a United States citizen  or an alien), who is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico during the  entire taxable year, will exclude from gross income the income derived  from sources within Puerto Rico, except amounts received for services  performed as an employee of the United States or any agency thereof. For  purposes of section 933 and this section, an employee of the government  of Puerto Rico will not be considered an employee of the United States  or of an agency of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The following example illustrates the application of the general  rule in paragraph (a)(1) of this section:</p><p class="depth3">Example. E, a United States citizen, files returns on a calendar  year basis. In April 2008, E moves to Puerto Rico, where he purchases a  house and accepts a permanent position with a local employer. For the  remainder of the year and for the following three taxable years, E  continues to live and work in Puerto Rico and has a closer connection to  Puerto Rico than to the United States or any foreign country. Assuming  that E otherwise meets the requirements under section 937(a) and  Sec. 1.937-1(b) and (f)(1) (year-of-move exception), E is considered a  bona fide resident of Puerto Rico for 2008. Accordingly, under section  933(1) and paragraph (a)(1) of this section, E should exclude from his  2008 Federal gross income any income from sources within Puerto Rico, as  determined under section 937(b) and Sec. 1.937-2.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Taxable year of change of residence from Puerto Rico. A citizen  of the United States who changes his residence from Puerto Rico after  having been a bona fide resident thereof for a period of at least two  years immediately preceding the date of such change in residence shall  exclude from his gross income the income derived from sources within  Puerto Rico which is attributable to that part of such period of Puerto  Rican residence which preceded the date of such change in residence,  except amounts received for services performed as an employee of the  United States or any agency thereof.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Deductions and credits. In any case in which any amount  otherwise constituting gross income is excluded from gross income under  the provisions of section 933, there will not be allowed as a deduction  from gross income any items of expenses or losses or other deductions  (except the deduction under   section 151, relating to personal exemptions), or any credit, properly  allocable to, or chargeable against, the amounts so excluded from gross  income. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the rules of Sec. 1.861- 8 will apply (with creditable expenditures treated in the same manner as  deductible expenditures).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Definitions. For purposes of this section--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-1 will apply for determining whether an  individual is a bona fide resident of Puerto Rico; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The rules of Sec. 1.937-2 will apply for determining whether  income is from sources within Puerto Rico.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em>  of this section apply to taxable years ending after April 9, 2008.  [T.D. 6500, 25 FR 11910, Nov. 26, 1960; 25 FR 14021, Dec. 31, 1960, as  amended by T.D. 9194, 70 FR 18934, Apr. 11, 2005; T.D. 9391, 73 FR  19365, Apr. 9, 2008]</p>
