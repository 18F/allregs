the notice. The losing agency, at the same time, shall furnish a copy of the appeal to the prospective appointing officer, who shall withhold the proposed grant pending decision on the appeal. OPM shall determine whether the employee will be given reemployment rights and notify both agencies accordingly. If the losing agency does not appeal within 15 calendar days, the employee shall be granted reemployment rights.
