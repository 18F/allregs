Such  representation may include immigration law matters and domestic or  poverty law matters (such as obtaining civil protective orders, divorce,  paternity, child custody, child and spousal support, housing, public  benefits, employment, abuse and neglect, juvenile proceedings and  contempt actions).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)(2)(i)</em> or (ii) of this section  to be eligible for legal assistance under this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Relation of activity to the United States.

A  recipient may determine that an alien is qualified for assistance under  this section if there is evidentiary support that the alien falls into  any of the eligibility categories or if the recipient determines there  will likely be evidentiary support after a reasonable opportunity for  further investigation. If the recipient determines that an alien is  eligible because there will likely be evidentiary support, the recipient  must obtain evidence of support as soon as possible and may not delay in  order to provide continued assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Documentary evidence. Evidentiary support may include, but is  not limited to, affidavits or unsworn written statements made by the  alien; written summaries of statements or interviews of the alien taken  by others, including the recipient; reports and affidavits from police,  judges, and other court officials, medical personnel, school officials,  clergy, social workers, other social service agency personnel; orders of  protection or other legal evidence of steps taken to end abuse; evidence  that a person sought safe haven in a shelter or similar refuge;  photographs; documents; or other evidence of a series of acts that  establish a pattern of qualifying abuse.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Victims of severe forms of trafficking.

Recipients are not required by Sec. 1626.12 to  maintain records regarding the immigration status of clients represented  pursuant to this section. If a recipient relies on an immigration  document for the eligibility determination, the recipient shall document  that the client presented an immigration document by making a note in  the client's file stating that a staff member has seen the document, the  type of document, the client's alien registration number (``A number''),  the date of the document, and the date of the review, and containing the  signature of the staff member that reviewed the document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Changes in basis for eligibility. If, during the course of  representing an alien eligible pursuant to Sec. 1626.4(a)(1), a  recipient determines that the alien is also eligible under Sec.  1626.4(a)(2) or Sec. 1626.5, the recipient should treat the alien as  eligible under that section and may provide all the assistance available  pursuant to that section.</p>
