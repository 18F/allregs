                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Opening. Exclusion hearings shall be closed to the public, unless the alien at his or her own instance requests that the public, including the press, be permitted to attend; in that event, the hearing shall be open, provided that the alien states for the record that he or she is waiving the requirement in section 236 of the Act that the inquiry shall be kept separate and apart from the public. When the hearing is to be open, depending upon physical facilities, reasonable limitation may be placed upon the number in attendance

at any one time, with priority being given to the press over the general public. The immigration judge shall ascertain whether the applicant for admission is the person to whom Form I-122 was previously delivered by the examining immigration officer as provided in 8 CFR part 1235; enter a copy of such form in evidence as an exhibit in the case; inform the applicant of the nature and purpose of the hearing; advise him or her of the privilege of being represented by an attorney of his or her own choice at no expense to the Government, and of the availability of free legal services programs qualified under 8 CFR part 1003 and organizations recognized pursuant to Sec. 1292.2 of this chapter located in the district where his or her exclusion hearing is to be held; and shall ascertain that the applicant has received a list of such programs; and request him or her to ascertain then and there whether he or she desires representation; advise him or her that he or she will have a reasonable opportunity to present evidence in his or her own behalf, to examine and object to evidence against him or her, and to cross-examine witnesses presented by the Government; and place the applicant under oath.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Procedure. The immigration judge shall receive and adduce material and relevant evidence, rule upon objections, and otherwise regulate the course of the hearing.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Attorney for the Service. The Service shall assign an attorney to each case in which an applicant's nationality is in issue and may assign an attorney to any case in which such assignment is deemed necessary or advantageous. The duties of the Service counsel include, but are not limited to, the presentation of evidence and the interrogation, examination, and cross-examination of the applicant and other witnesses. Nothing contained in this section diminishes the authority of an immigration judge to conduct proceedings under this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Depositions. The procedures specified in Sec. 1240.48(e) shall apply.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Record. The hearing before the immigration judge, including the testimony, exhibits, applications, proffers, and requests, the immigration judge's decision, and all written orders, motions, appeals, and other papers filed in the proceeding shall constitute the record in the case. The hearing shall be recorded verbatim except for statements made off the record with the permission of the immigration judge.</p>
