Public Law 89-456 requires action by the National Mediation Board in the following circumstances:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designation of party member of PL Board. Public Law 89-456 provides that within thirty (30) days from the date a written request is made by an employee representative upon a carrier, or by a carrier upon an employee representative, for the establishment of a PL Board, an agreement establishing such a Board shall be made. If, however, one party fails to designate a member of the Board, the party making the request may ask the Mediation Board to designate a member on behalf of the other party. Upon receipt of such request, the Mediation Board will notify the party which failed to designate a partisan member for the establishment of a PL Board of the receipt of the request. The Mediation Board will then designate a representative on behalf of the party upon whom the request was made. This representative will be an individual associated in interest with the party he is to represent. The designee, together with the member appointed by the party requesting the establishment of the PL Board, shall constitute the Board.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Appointment of a neutral to determine matters concerning the establishment and/or jurisdiction of a PL Board.
