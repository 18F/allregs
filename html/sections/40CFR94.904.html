Additional requirements may apply for imported engines; these are described in subpart I of this part. Engines may also be exempted from the standards of this part under the provisions of 40 CFR part 1042 or part 1068.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)(1)</em> Any person may request a testing exemption subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.905.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any person may request a testing exemption subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.905.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any engine manufacturer may request a national security exemption subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.908.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Engines manufactured for export purposes are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.909, except as otherwise specified by Sec. 94.909.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Manufacturer-owned engines are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.906(a).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Display engines are exempt without application, subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.906(b). This does not apply to imported engines (see Sec. 94.804).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Engines used solely for competition are exempt, subject to the provisions of Sec. 94.906(c).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If you want to take an action with respect to an exempted or excluded engine that is prohibited by the exemption or exclusion, such as selling it, you need to certify the engine. We will issue a certificate of conformity if you send us an application for certification showing that you meet all the applicable requirements from this part 94 and pay the appropriate fee. Also, in some cases, we may allow manufacturers to modify the engine as needed to make it identical to engines already covered by a certificate. We would base such an approval on our review of any appropriate documentation. These engines must have emission control information labels that accurately describe their status.
