                            <p class="depth0">An indirect material, as defined in Sec. 10.1002(n) of this subpart, will be disregarded for the purpose of determining whether a good is originating.</p><p class="depth0">Example. Korean Producer A produces good C using non-originating material B. Producer A imports non-originating rubber

gloves for use by workers in the production of good C. Good C is subject to a tariff shift requirement. As provided in Sec. 10.1014(b)(1) of this subpart and General Note 33, each of the non-originating materials in good C must undergo the specified change in tariff classification in order for good C to be considered originating. Although non-originating material B must undergo the applicable tariff shift in order for good C to be considered originating, the rubber gloves do not because they are indirect materials and are disregarded for purposes of determining whether the good is originating.</p>
