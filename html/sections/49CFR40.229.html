                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">EBTs and ASDs on the NHTSA conforming products lists (CPL) for  evidential and non-evidential devices are the only devices you are  allowed to use to conduct alcohol screening tests under this part. You  may use an ASD that is on the NHTSA CPL for DOT alcohol tests only if  there are instructions for its use in this part. An ASD can be used only  for screening tests for alcohol, and may not be used for confirmation  tests.  [65 FR 79526, Dec. 19, 2000, as amended at 66 FR 41954, Aug. 9, 2001]</p>
