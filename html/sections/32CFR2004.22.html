                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Designation of Cognizant Security Authority (CSA). The CSA for a  contractor shall be determined by the preponderance of classified  contract activity per agreement by the CSAs. The responsible CSA shall  conduct oversight inspections of contractor security programs and  provide other support services to contractors as necessary to ensure  compliance with the NISPOM and that contractors are protecting  classified information as required. DoD, as Executive Agent, shall serve  as the CSA for all Executive Branch departments and agencies that are  not a designated CSA. As such, DoD shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide training to industry to ensure that industry understands  the responsibilities associated with protecting classified information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Validate the need for contractor access to classified  information, shall establish a system to request personnel security  investigations for contractor personnel, and shall ensure adequate  funding for investigations of those contractors under Department of  Defense cognizance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Maintain a system of eligibility and access determinations of  contractor personnel.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> General Responsibilities. Executive Branch departments and  agencies that issue contracts requiring industry to have access to  classified information and are not a designated CSA shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Include the Security Requirements clause, 52.204-2, from the FAR  in such contracts;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Incorporate a Contract Security Classification Specification (DD  254) into the contracts in accordance with the FAR subpart 4.4;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Sign agreements with the Department of Defense as the Executive  Agent for industrial security services; and,</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Ensure applicable department and agency personnel having NISP  implementation responsibilities are provided appropriate education and  training.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> National Interest Determinations (NIDs). Executive branch  departments and agencies shall make a National Interest Determination  (NID) before authorizing contractors, cleared or in process for  clearance under a Special Security Agreement (SSA), to have access to  proscribed information. To make a NID, the agency shall assess whether  release of the proscribed information is consistent with the national  security interests of the United States.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The requirement for a NID applies to new contracts, including  pre-contract activities in which access to proscribed information is  required, and to existing contracts when contractors are acquired by  foreign interests and an SSA is the proposed foreign ownership, control,  or influence mitigation method.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> If access to proscribed information is required to complete pre- contract award actions or to perform on a new contract, the Government  Contracting Activity (GCA) shall determine if release of the information  is consistent with national security interests.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For contractors that have existing contracts that require  access to proscribed information, have been or are in the process of  being acquired by foreign interests, and have proposed an SSA to  mitigate foreign ownership, the Cognizant Security Agency (CSA), or when  delegated, the Cognizant Security Office (CSO) shall notify the GCA of  the need for a NID.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The GCA(s) shall determine, within 30 days, per  Sec. 2004.22(c)(4)(i), or 60 days, per Sec. 2004.22(c)(4)(ii), whether  release of the proscribed information is   consistent with national security interests unless the GCA requires  additional time for the NID process due to special circumstances. The  GCA shall formally advise the CSA, if special circumstances apply.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In accordance with 10 U.S.C. 2536, DoD and the Department of  Energy (DOE) cannot award a contract involving access to proscribed  information to a contractor effectively owned or controlled by a foreign  government unless a waiver has been issued by the Secretary of Defense  or Secretary of Energy.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NIDs may be program-, project-, or contract-specific. For  program and project NIDs, a separate NID is not required for each  contract. The CSO may require the GCA to identify all contracts covered  by the NID. NID decisions shall be made by officials as specified by CSA  policy or as designated by the agency head.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> NID decisions shall be made within 30 days.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Where no interagency coordination is required because the  department or agency owns or controls all of the proscribed information  in question, the GCA shall provide a final documented decision to the  applicable CSO, with a copy to the contractor, within 30 days of the  date of the request for the NID.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> If the proscribed information is owned by, or under the control  of, a department or agency other than the GCA (e.g., National Security  Agency (NSA) for Communications Security, the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence (ODNI) for Sensitive Compartmented Information,  and DOE for Restricted Data), the GCA shall provide written notice to  that department or agency that its written concurrence is required. Such  notice shall be provided within 30 days of being informed by the CSO of  the requirement for a NID. The GCA shall provide a final documented  decision to the applicable CSO, with a copy to the contractor, within 60  days of the date of the request for the NID.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em>, will provide the CSA  or its designee with updates at 30-day intervals. The CSA, or its  designee, will, in turn, provide the contractor with updates at 30-day  intervals until the NID decision is made.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The CSO shall not delay implementation of an SSA pending  completion of a GCA's NID processing, provided there is no indication  that a NID will be denied either by the GCA or the owner of the  information (i.e., NSA, DOE, or ODNI). However, the contractor shall not  have access to additional proscribed information under a new contract  until the GCA determines that the release of the information is  consistent with national security interests and issues a NID.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The CSO shall not upgrade an existing contractor clearance under  an SSA to Top Secret unless an approved NID covering the prospective Top  Secret access has been issued.
