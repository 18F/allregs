                                Sec. 779.225  Leased departments.
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> As stated in section 3(r) of the enterprise includes ``departments of an establishment operated through leasing arrangements.'' This statutory provision is based on the fact that ordinarily the activities of such leased departments are related to the activities of the establishment in which they are located, and they are performed for a common business purpose either through ``unified operation'' or ``common control.'' A general discussion will be found in part 776 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> In the ordinary case, a retail or service establishment may control many of the operations of a leased department therein and unify its operation with its own. Thus, they may operate under a common trade name: The host establishment may determine, or have the power to determine, the leased department's space location, the type of merchandise it will sell, its pricing policy, its hours of operation and some or all of its hiring, firing and other personnel policies; advertising, adjustment and credit operations, may be unified, and insurance, taxes, and other matters may be included as a part of the total operations of the establishment. Some or all of these and other functions, which are the normal prerogatives of an independent businessman, may be controlled or unified with the store's other activities in such a way as to constitute a single enterprise under the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Since the definition specifically includes in the ``enterprise,'' for the purpose of this Act, ``departments of an establishment operated through leasing arrangements,'' any such department will be considered a part of the host establishment's enterprise in the absence of special facts and circumstances warranting a different conclusion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Whether, in a particular case, the relationship is such as to constitute the lessee's operation to be a separate establishment of a different enterprise rather than a ``leased department'' of the host establishment as described in the definition, will depend upon all the facts including the agreements and arrangements between the parties as well as the manner in which the operations are conducted. If, for example, the facts show that the lessee occupies a physically separate space with (or even without) a separate entrance, and operates under a separate name, with his own separate employees and records, and in other respects conducts his business independently of the lessor's, the lessee may be operating a separate establishment or place of business of his own and the relationship of the parties may be only that of landlord and tenant. In such a case, the lessee's operation will not be regarded as a ``leased department'' and will not be included in the same enterprise with the lessor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The employees of a leased department would not be covered on an enterprise basis if such leased department is located in an establishment which is not itself a covered enterprise or part of a covered enterprise. Likewise, the applicability of exemptions for certain retail or service establishments from the Act's minimum wage or overtime pay provisions, or both, to employees of a leased department would depend upon the character of the establishment in which the leased department is located. Other sections of this subpart discuss the coverage of leased retail and service departments in more detail while subpart D of this part explains how exemptions for certain retail and service establishments apply to leased department employees.</p>
