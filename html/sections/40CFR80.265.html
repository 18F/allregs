                                Sec. 80.265  How will the EPA approve or disapprove a hardship
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> EPA will evaluate each application for hardship extension on a case-by-case basis. The factors considered for a hardship extension may include: The refiner's financial position and efforts to obtain capital funding; the refiner's efforts to procure necessary equipment, obtain design and engineering services and construction contractors; the availability of desulfurization equipment; and any other relevant factor. An extension will be granted for a refinery for the 2008 averaging period if the small refiner who owns the refinery adequately demonstrates that severe economic hardship would result if compliance with the standards in Sec. 80.195 is required in 2008, or that compliance with the standard in 2008 is not feasible for reasons beyond the refiner's control, and that the refiner has made the best efforts possible to achieve compliance with the national standards by January 1, 2008. Upon reapplication by the refiner, if EPA determines that further relief is appropriate, EPA may grant a further extension through the 2009 averaging period. In no case will a further extension for the 2009 averaging period be granted unless the refiner demonstrates conclusively that it has financing in place and that it will be able to complete construction and meet the national gasoline sulfur standards no later than December 31, 2009.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> EPA may request more information, if necessary, for evaluation of the application. If requested information is not submitted within the time specified in EPA's request, or any extensions granted, the application may be denied.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> EPA will notify the refiner of approval or disapproval of hardship extension by letter.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If approved, EPA will also notify the refiner of the date that full compliance with the standards specified at Sec. 80.195 must be achieved or what interim sulfur levels or schedules apply, if any.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If disapproved, beginning January 1, 2008, the refinery is subject to the requirements in Sec. 80.195. Refiners who receive an extension for the 2008 averaging period shall meet the standards in Sec. 80.195 beginning on January 1, 2009, unless EPA grants an extension of the hardship relief for an additional year. If such an additional extension is granted, the refiner shall meet the standards in Sec. 80.195 on January 1, 2010.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Refiners who receive a hardship extension may be required to meet more stringent standards than those which apply to them during 2007, and/or could be required to offset excess sulfur levels. EPA may impose reasonable conditions on an extension, such as requiring segregation of the small refiner's gasoline or requiring the gasoline to be sold for use in older vehicles only.</p>
