                            <p class="depth0">FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 is responsible  for receiving and resolving all complaints concerning the construction  of dwellings and the construction, installation and set-up of units  financed by FmHA or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354. FmHA  or its successor agency under Public Law 103-354 must determine whether  defects are structural or non-structural. If the defect is structural  and is covered by the builder's/dealer-contractor's (the ``contractor'')  warranty, the contractor is expected to correct the defect. If the  contractor cannot or will not correct the defect, the costs of  correcting the defect may be paid by the Government, or the borrower may  be compensated for correcting the defect, under the provisions of this  subpart. If the defect is non-structural but is covered under the  provisions of the contractor's warranty or independent home warranty,  the contractor is still expected to correct the defect. FmHA or its  successor agency under Public Law 103-354 will assist the borrower in  obtaining assistance through the independent home warranty company's  and/or manufacturer's complaint resolution process. However, if the  contractor cannot or will not correct a non-structural defect covered  under the provisions of the contractor's warranty, the Government will  not pay the costs for correcting the defect, nor will the borrower be  compensated for doing so.</p>
