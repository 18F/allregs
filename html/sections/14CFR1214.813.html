Customers shall reimburse NASA an optional services fee for flights to nonstandard destinations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The customer's total Shuttle charge factor shall be the sum of the Shuttle charge factors for the customer's individual (dedicated, complete, or shared) elements, with the limitation that the customer's Shuttle charge factor shall not exceed 1.0.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> Customers contracting for pallet-only payloads are entitled to locate

minimal controls as agreed to by NASA in a pressurized area to be designated by NASA. There is no additional charge for this service.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(5)</em> NASA shall, at its discretion, adjust up or down the load factors and load fractions calculated according to the procedures defined in this section. Adjustments shall be made for special space or weight requirements which include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Sight clearances, orientation, or placement limits.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Clearances for movable payloads.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Unusual access clearance requirements.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Clearances extending beyond the bounds of the normal element envelope.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Extraordinary shapes.
The adjusted values shall be used as the basis for computing charge factors and prorating services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions used in computations--(1) LC = Chargeable payload length, m.
