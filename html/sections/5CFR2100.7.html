                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Requests to correct or amend a file shall be addressed to the  system manager in which the file is located. The request must reasonably  describe the record to be amended, the items to be changed as  specifically as possible, the type of amendment (e.g., deletion,  correction, amendment), and the reason for the amendment. The request  should also include the reasons why the requester believes the record is  not accurate, relevant, timely, or complete. The burden of proof will be  upon the individual to furnish sufficient facts to persuade the change  of the   record of the inaccuracy, irrelevancy, timeliness, or incompleteness of  the record. Normally all documents submitted, to include court orders,  shall be certified. Amendments under this part are limited to correcting  factual matters and not matters of official judgement or opinions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requirements of identification as outlined in Sec. 2100.4 apply  to requests to correct or amend a file.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Incomplete requests shall not be honored, but the requester  shall be contacted for the additional information needed to process the  request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The amendment process is not intended to permit the alteration  of evidence presented in the course of judicial or quasi-judicial  proceedings. Any amendments or changes to these records normally are  made through the specific procedures established for the amendment of  such records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When records sought to be amended are actually covered by  another issuance, the administrative procedures under that issuance must  be exhausted before using the procedures under the Privacy Act.</p>
