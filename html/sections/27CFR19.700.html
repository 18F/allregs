The method for computing required bond amounts  is as follows:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Small plants without production operations. A proprietor that  operates a small plant that receives not more than 10,000 proof gallons  of spirits per year and does not conduct bona fide production operations  must provide a bond with a penal sum of $1,000.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Medium plants. A proprietor that operates a medium plant that  produces and receives more than 10,000 but not more than 20,000 proof  gallons of spirits per year must provide a bond with a penal sum of at  least $2,000.00. The proprietor must increase the penal sum of the bond  by $1,000 for each additional 10,000 gallons, or fraction of 10,000  gallons, (over 20,000 gallons) that will be produced or received. The  maximum bond for a medium plant is $50,000.00, representing the penal  sum applicable to 500,000 proof gallons.
