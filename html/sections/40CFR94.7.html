                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Marine engines and vessels may not be equipped with a defeat device.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> An engine may not be equipped with an emission control system for the purpose of complying with emission standards if such a system will cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety in its operation or function.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> You may not design your engines with emission-control devices, systems, or elements of design that cause or contribute to an unreasonable risk to public health, welfare, or safety while operating. For example, this would apply if the engine emits a noxious or toxic substance it would otherwise not emit that contributes to such an unreasonable risk.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Manufacturers shall ensure that all engines subject to the emission standards of this part are equipped with a connection in the engine exhaust system that is located downstream of the engine and before any point at which the exhaust contacts water (or any other cooling/scrubbing medium) for the temporary attachment of gaseous and/or particulate emission sampling equipment. Use good engineering judgment to locate the connection. This connection shall be internally threaded with standard pipe threads of a size not larger than one-half inch, and shall be closed by a pipe-plug when not in use. Equivalent connections are allowed. Engine manufacturers may comply with this requirement by providing vessel manufacturers with clear instructions explaining how to meet this requirement, and noting in the instructions that failure to comply may subject the vessel manufacturer to federal penalties. Vessel manufacturers are required to comply with the engine manufacturer's instructions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Electronically controlled engines subject to the emission standards of this part shall broadcast on engine's controller area networks engine torque (as percent of maximum torque at that speed) and engine speed.
