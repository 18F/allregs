                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This fund was established to address priority constraints to  market access that arise because of unforeseen events; market conditions  in emerging markets are often less predictable than in more developed  countries. It allows responsiveness to time-sensitive marketing problems  or opportunities, such as a change in an import regime or the removal of  a trade embargo; an unexpected or unusual change in the political or  financial situation in a country; or a significant change in crop  conditions--any of which may have an immediate impact on the access of  particular commodities or products to specific markets.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Proposals for the Quick Response Marketing Fund must identify  specific market access issues that also face time constraints.  Application content, evaluation, and reporting requirements are the same  as for the Central Fund.</p>
