If a licensee fails to comply with the regulations, agreements, or awards, the authorized officer will take such action as may be appropriate under the provisions of the timber sale contract or cooperative agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A permittee who believes that a licensee is violating the provisions of such a timber sale contract or cooperative agreement pertaining to use of the permittee's roads, rights-of-way, or lands, may petition the authorized officer, setting forth the grounds for his belief, to take such action against the licensee as may be appropriate under the contract or the cooperative agreement. In such event the permittee shall

be bound by the decision of the authorized officer, subject, however, to a right of appeal pursuant to Sec. 2812.9 and subject, further, to the general provisions of law respecting review of administrative determinations. In the alternative, a permittee who believes that a licensee has violated the terms of the timber sale contract or cooperative agreement respecting the use of the permittee's roads may proceed against the licensee in any court of competent jurisdiction to obtain such relief as may be appropriate in the premises.</p>
