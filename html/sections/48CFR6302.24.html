                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Every subpoena shall state the name of the Board and the title of the appeal and shall command each person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony, and, if appropriate, to produce books, papers, documents, or tangible things, at a time and place therein specified. Subpoenas (including those calling for the production of documentary evidence) are signed by an Administrative Judge or by the Recorder of the Board but otherwise left blank when furnished to the party requesting the subpoena. The party to whom the subpoena is issued shall fill it in before service.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Subpoenas for attendance at hearing. At the request of any party, subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses at a hearing are issued. A subpoena requiring the attendance of a witness at a hearing may be served at any place within 100 miles of the place of hearing specified in the subpoena; but the Board, upon proper application and for good cause shown by the requesting party, may authorize the service of a subpoena at any other place.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Subpoenas for production of documentary evidence. A subpoena, in addition to requiring attendance to testify, may also command any person to whom it is directed to produce books, papers, documents, or tangible things designated therein. A subpoena calling for such production shall show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the evidence sought.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Subpoenas for taking depositions. Subpoenas in aid of depositions (including those for the production of books, papers, documents, or tangible

things) may be issued by the Recorder of the Board upon a showing that the parties have agreed to, or the Board has ordered, the taking of depositions under Rule 18. The service of subpoenas in aid of depositions shall be limited to the city or county wherein the witness resides or is employed or transacts business in person. If a subpoena is desired at other locations, a specific ruling of the Board is required.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Request to quash or modify. Upon written request by a person under subpoena or by a party, made within 10 days after service but in any event not later than the time specified in the subpoena for compliance, the Board may (1) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and oppressive or for other good cause shown, or (2) require the person in whose behalf the subpoena was issued to advance the reasonable costs of producing subpoenaed books and papers. Where circumstances require, the Board may act upon such a request at any time after a copy has been served upon the opposing party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Foreign country. A subpoena directed to a witness in a foreign country shall issue under the circumstances and in the manner, and be served as provided in 28 U.S.C. 1781-1784.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Service. A subpoena may be served by a United States Marshal or a deputy, or by any person not a party who is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena upon a person named therein shall be made by tendering the subpoena to that person with the fees for one day's attendance and the mileage allowed by law (28 U.S.C. 1821). When the subpoena is issued on behalf of the United States or an officer or agency of the United States, fees and mileage need not be tendered.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Fees. The party at whose instance a subpoena is issued shall be responsible for the payment of witness fees and mileage, as well as the fees and mileage of the officer who serves the subpoena. The failure to make payment of such charges on demand may be deemed by the Board as a sufficient ground for striking the testimony of the witness and the books, papers, documents, or tangible things produced.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(i)</em> Contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena by a person who resides, is found, or transacts business within the jurisdiction of a United States District Court, the Board will apply to the court through the Attorney General of the United States for an order requiring the person to appear before the Board or a member thereof to give testimony or produce evidence or both. Any failure of any such person to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
