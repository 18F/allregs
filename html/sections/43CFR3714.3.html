                            <p class="depth0">The Act in section 7 provides as follows:</p><p class="depth0">Nothing in this Act shall be construed in any manner to limit or restrict or to authorize the limitation or restriction of any existing rights of any claimant under any valid mining claim heretofore located, except as such rights may be limited or restricted as a result of a proceeding pursuant to section 5 of this Act, or as a result of a waiver and relinquishment pursuant to section 6 of this Act; and nothing in this act shall be construed in any manner to authorize inclusion in any patent hereafter issued under the mining laws of the United States for any mining claim heretofore or hereafter located, of any reservation, limitation, or restriction not otherwise authorized by law, or to limit or repeal any existing authority to include any reservation, limitation, or restriction in any such patent, or to limit or restrict any use of the lands covered by any patented or unpatented mining claim by the United States, its lessees, permittees, and licensees which is otherwise authorized by law.

This section makes it clear that all of the rights of mining claimants existing on the date of the Act are preserved and will continue unless: (a) Claimant fails, subject, however, to the provisions of Sec. 3712.2-7, to file a verified statement in response to a published notice as provided in section 5(b) of the Act and Sec. 3712.2-9; (b) it is determined as a result of a hearing pursuant to section 5(c) that such rights asserted in a verified statement are not valid and effective; (c) the claimant waives and relinquishes his rights pursuant to section 6. It also preserves to all mining claimants the right to a patent unrestricted by anything in the Act and provides that no limitation, reservation or restriction may be inserted in any mineral patent unless authorized by law, but it also makes it clear that all laws in force on the date of its enactment which provide for any such reservation, limitation, or restriction in such patents and all authority of law then existing for the use of lands embraced in unpatented mining claims by the United States, its lessees, permittees, and licensees continue in full force and effect.</p><p class="depth0">Subpart 3715_Use and Occupancy Under the Mining Laws</p><p class="depth0">Authority: 18 U.S.C. 1001, 3571 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 22, 42, 612; 43 U.S.C. 1061 et seq., 1201, 1457, 1732 (b) and (c), 1733 (a) and (g).</p><p class="depth0">Source: 61 FR 37125, July 16, 1996, unless otherwise noted.



Sec. 3715.0-1  What are the purpose and the scope of this subpart?</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The purpose of this subpart is to manage the use and occupancy of the public lands for the development of locatable mineral deposits by limiting such use or occupancy to that which is reasonably incident. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) will prevent abuse of the public lands while recognizing valid rights and uses under the Mining Law of 1872 (30 U.S.C. 22 et seq.) and related laws governing the public lands, regardless of when those rights were created. BLM will take appropriate action to eliminate invalid uses, including unauthorized residential occupancy of the public lands.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. This subpart applies to public lands BLM administers. They do not apply to state or private lands in which the mineral estate has been reserved to the United States. They do not apply to Federal lands administered by other Federal agencies, even though those lands may be subject to the operation of the mining laws.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> This subpart does not impair the right of any person to engage in recreational activities or any other authorized activity on public lands BLM administers.


Sec. 3715.0-3  What are the legal authorities for this subpart?</p><p class="depth0">The authorities for this subpart are 18 U.S.C. 1001, 3571 et seq.; 30 U.S.C. 22, 42, 612; 43 U.S.C. 1061 et seq., 1201, 1457, 1732 (b) and (c), 1733 (a) and (g).


Sec. 3715.0-5  How are certain terms in this subpart defined?</p><p class="depth0">As used in this subpart the term:</p><p class="depth0">Mining laws means all laws that apply to mining of locatable minerals on public lands and which make public lands available for development of locatable minerals. This includes, but is not limited to, the general authorities relating to mining of locatable minerals or to the public lands on which this subpart is based and case law which interprets those authorities.</p><p class="depth0">Mining operations means all functions, work, facilities, and activities reasonably incident to mining or processing of mineral deposits. It includes building roads and other means of access to a mining claim or millsite on public lands.</p><p class="depth0">Occupancy means full or part-time residence on the public lands. It also means activities that involve residence; the construction, presence, or maintenance of temporary or permanent structures that may be used for such purposes; or the use of a watchman or caretaker for the purpose of monitoring activities. Residence or structures include, but are not limited to, barriers to access, fences, tents, motor homes, trailers, cabins, houses, buildings, and storage of equipment or supplies.</p><p class="depth0">Permanent structure means a structure fixed to the ground by any of the various types of foundations, slabs, piers, poles, or other means allowed by building codes. The term also includes a structure placed on the ground that lacks foundations, slabs, piers, or poles, and that can only be moved through disassembly into its component parts or by techniques commonly used in house moving. The term does not apply to tents or lean-tos.</p><p class="depth0">Public lands means lands open to the operation of the mining laws which BLM administers, including lands covered by unpatented mining claims or millsites.</p><p class="depth0">Prospecting or exploration means the search for mineral deposits by geological, geophysical, geochemical, or other techniques. It also includes, but is not limited to, sampling, drilling, or developing surface or underground workings to evaluate the type, extent, quantity, or quality of mineral values present.</p><p class="depth0">Reasonably incident means the statutory standard ``prospecting, mining, or processing operations and uses reasonably incident thereto'' (30 U.S.C. 612). It is a shortened version of the statutory standard. It includes those actions or expenditures of labor and resources by a person of ordinary prudence to prospect, explore, define, develop, mine, or beneficiate a valuable mineral deposit, using methods, structures, and equipment appropriate to the geological terrain, mineral deposit, and stage of development and reasonably related activities.</p><p class="depth0">Substantially regular work means work on, or that substantially and directly benefits, a mineral property, including

nearby properties under your control. The work must be associated with the search for and development of mineral deposits or the processing of ores. It includes active and continuing exploration, mining, and beneficiation or processing of ores. It may also include assembly or maintenance of equipment, work on physical improvements, and procurement of supplies, incidental to activities meeting the conditions of Sec. Sec. 3715.2 and 3715.2-1. It may also include off-site trips associated with these activities. The term also includes a seasonal, but recurring, work program.</p><p class="depth0">Unnecessary or undue degradation, as applied to unauthorized uses, means those activities that are not reasonably incident and are not authorized under any other applicable law or regulation. As applied to authorized uses, the term is used as defined in 43 CFR 3802.0-5 and 3809.0-5.

Sec. 3715.0-9  Information collection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> BLM has submitted to the Office of Management and Budget the information collection requirements contained in this subpart under 44 U.S.C. 3507 and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and assigned clearance number 1004-0169. BLM collects the information so that it may manage use and occupancy of public lands under the mining laws by prohibiting unauthorized uses and occupancies. A response to BLM is mandatory and required to obtain the benefit of occupying the public lands for reasonably incident activities.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> BLM estimates the public reporting burden for this information to average two hours per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding this burden estimate or any other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Information Collection Clearance Officer (DW-110), Bureau of Land Management, Building 50, Denver Federal Center, Denver, Colorado 80225-0047, and the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, 1004-0169, Washington, DC 20503.</p>
