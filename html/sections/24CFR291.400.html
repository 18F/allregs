                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. HUD seeks to assist individuals and families who are  homeless by providing them with transitional housing and appropriate  supportive services with the goal of helping them move to independent  living. Therefore, HUD will make available, to applicants approved by  HUD, certain HUD-acquired single family properties for use by the  homeless.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Applicant preapproval. Before a field office may notify an  applicant of eligible properties, the applicant must be preapproved by  HUD, according to procedures available from the field office.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Property available for lease with option to purchase. HUD will  make available up to 10 percent of its total inventory of properties,  before or after they are listed for sale to the public.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Property available under a McKinney Act Supportive Housing  program lease-option agreement. Eligible properties will be available  under a lease-option to purchase agreement to Supportive Housing program  applicants for acquisition grants under 24 CFR part 583.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Properties available for sale. Eligible properties will be  available for competitive sale or direct sale for fair market value,  less a discount determined appropriate by the Secretary but not less  than 10 percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Concentration of properties. To the extent practicable and  possible, HUD will avoid excessive concentration in a single  neighborhood of properties leased or sold under this subpart.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Failure to comply with requirements. Failure to comply with this  subpart, or a lease issued under this subpart, may result in termination  from the program.
