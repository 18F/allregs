                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Method of testing. Methods for determining the sediment content of the milk of individual producers shall be those described in the latest edition of Standard Methods for the Examination of Dairy Products. Sediment content shall be based on comparison with applicable charts of the United States Sediment Standards for Milk and Milk Products, available from USDA, AMS, Dairy Programs, Dairy Standardization Branch.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Sediment content classification. Milk in cans shall be classified for sediment content, regardless of the results of the appearance and odor examination required in Sec. 58.133(a), as follows:</p><p class="depth2">USDA SEDIMENT STANDARD</p><p class="depth2">No. 1 (acceptable)--not to exceed 0.50 mg. or equivalent.</p><p class="depth2">No. 2 (acceptable)--not to exceed 1.50 mg. or equivalent.</p><p class="depth2">No. 3 (probational, not over 10 days)--not to exceed 2.50 mg. or equivalent.</p><p class="depth2">No. 4 (reject)--over 2.50 mg. or equivalent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Frequency of tests. At least once each month, at irregular intervals, one or more cans of milk selected at random from each producer shall be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Acceptance or rejection of milk. If the sediment disc is classified as No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3, the producer's milk may be accepted. If the sediment disc is classified No. 4 the milk shall be rejected: Provided that, If the shipment of milk is commingled with other milk in a transport tank the next shipment shall not be accepted until its quality has been determined before being picked up; however, if the person making the test is unable to get to the farm before the next shipment it may be accepted but no further shipments shall be accepted unless the milk meets the requirements of No. 3 or better. In the case of milk classified as No. 3 or No. 4, all cans shall be tested. Producers of No. 3 or No. 4 milk shall be notified immediately and shall be furnished applicable sediment discs and the next shipment shall be tested.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Retests. On test of the next shipment all cans shall be tested. Milk classified as No. 1, No. 2, or No. 3 may be accepted, but No. 4 milk shall be rejected. The producers of No. 3 or No. 4 milk shall be notified immediately, furnished applicable sediment discs and the next shipment tested. This procedure of retesting successive shipments and accepting probational (No. 3) milk and rejecting No. 4 milk may be continued for not more than 10 calendar days. If at the end of this time all of the producer's milk does not meet the acceptable sediment content classification (No. 1 or No. 2), it shall be rejected.This procedure of retesting successive shipments and accepting probational (No. 3) milk and rejecting No. 4 milk may be continued for not more than 10 calendar days. If at the end of this time all of the producer's milk does not meet the acceptable sediment content classification (No. 1 or No. 2), it shall be rejected.
