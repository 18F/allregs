                            <p class="depth0">When prescribed in an applicable Standard Requirement or in the filed Outline of Production, a live virus vaccine shall meet the applicable requirements in this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purity tests--(1) Bacteria and fungi. Final container samples of completed product and comparable samples of each lot of Master Seed Virus shall be tested for bacteria and fungi in accordance with the test provided in Sec. 113.27.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Bacteria and fungi. Final container samples of completed product and comparable samples of each lot of Master Seed Virus shall be tested for bacteria and fungi in accordance with the test provided in Sec. 113.27.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Mycoplasma. Final container samples of completed product and comparable samples of each lot of Master Seed Virus shall be tested for mycoplasma in accordance with the test provided in Sec. 113.28.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Avian Origin Vaccine. Samples of each lot of Master Seed Virus and bulk pooled material or final container samples from each serial shall also be tested for:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Salmonella contamination as prescribed in Sec. 113.30; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Lymphoid leukosis virus contamination as prescribed in Sec. 113.31; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Hemagglutinating viruses as prescribed in Sec. 113.34.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Extraneous viruses. Each lot of Master Seed Virus used to prepare live virus vaccine recommended for animals other than poultry shall meet the requirements for extraneous viruses as prescribed in Sec. 113.55</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Safety tests. Samples of each lot of Master Seed Virus and final container samples of completed product from each serial or first subserial of live virus vaccine recommended for animals other than poultry shall be tested for safety in at least one species for which the vaccine is intended using methods prescribed in Sec. Sec. 113.39, 113.40, 113.41, 113.44, and 113.45 or in a filed Outline of Production. The mouse safety test prescribed in Sec. 113.33(a) shall also be conducted unless the virus or agent in the vaccine is inherently lethal for mice.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Virus identity test. At least one of the virus identity tests provided in this paragraph or a suitable identity test prescribed in the filed Outline of Production shall be conducted on the Master Seed Virus and final container samples from each serial or first subserial of biological product.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Fluorescent antibody test. The fluorescent antibody test shall be conducted using virus inoculated cells and uninoculated control cells. Cells shall be stained with fluorochrome conjugated specific antiserum. Fluorescence typical of the virus concerned shall be demonstrated in the inoculated cells. The control cells shall remain free of such fluorescence.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Serum neutralization test. The serum neutralization test shall be conducted using the constant serum-decreasing virus method with specific antiserum. For positive identification, at least 100 ID50 of vaccine virus shall be neutralized by the antiserum.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Cell Culture Requirements. If cell cultures are used in the preparation of Master Seed Virus or of the vaccine, primary cells shall meet the requirements prescribed in Sec. 113.51, cell lines shall meet the requirements prescribed in Sec. 113.52, and ingredients of animal origin shall meet the applicable requirements in Sec. 113.53.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Moisture content. (1) The maximum moisture content in desiccated vaccines must be stated in the filed Outline of Production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The maximum moisture content in desiccated vaccines must be stated in the filed Outline of Production.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Final container samples of completed product from each serial or subserial must be tested for moisture content in accordance with the test prescribed in Sec. 113.29.
