                                Sec. 127.400  What is an eligibility examination?
                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose of examination. Eligibility examinations are  investigations that verify the accuracy of any certification made or  information provided as part of the certification process (including  third-party certifications) or in connection with an EDWOSB or WOSB  requirement. In addition, eligibility examinations may verify that a  concern meets the EDWOSB or WOSB eligibility requirements at the time of  the examination. SBA will, in its sole discretion, perform eligibility  examinations at any time after a concern self-certifies in SAM (or any  successor system) that it is an EDWOSB or WOSB. SBA may conduct the  examination, or parts of the examination, at one or all of the concern's  offices.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Determination on conduct of an examination. SBA may consider  protest allegations set forth in a protest in determining whether to  conduct an examination of a concern pursuant to subpart D of this part,  notwithstanding a dismissal or denial of a protest pursuant to  Sec. 127.604. SBA may also consider information provided to the D/GC by  a third-party that questions the eligibility of a WOSB or EDWOSB that  has certified its status in SAM in determining whether to conduct an  eligibility examination.
