A.281(VII)), the ARPA should comply with the following minimum performance standards.</p><p class="depth0">2 Definitions</p><p class="depth0">2.1 Definitions of terms in these performance standards are given in Annex 1.</p><p class="depth0">3 Performance Standards</p><p class="depth0">3.1 Detection</p><p class="depth0">3.1.1 Where a separate facility is provided for detection of targets, other than by the radar observer, it should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the use of the radar display.</p><p class="depth0">3.2 Acquisition</p><p class="depth0">3.2.1 Target acquisition may be manual or automatic. However, there should always be a facility to provide for manual acquisition and cancellation. ARPA with automatic acquisition should have a facility to suppress acquisition in certain areas. On any range scale where acquisition is suppressed over a certain area, the area of acquisition should be indicated on the display.</p><p class="depth0">3.2.2 Automatic or manual acquisition should have a performance not inferior to that which could be obtained by the user of the radar display.</p><p class="depth0">3.3 Tracking</p><p class="depth0">3.3.1 The ARPA should be able to automatically track, process, simultaneously display and continuously update the information on at least:</p><p class="depth0">.1 20 targets, if automatic acquisition is provided, whether automatically or manually acquired; or</p><p class="depth0">.2 10 targets, if only manual acquisition is provided.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.2 If automatic acquisition is provided, description of the criteria of selection of targets for tracking should be provided to the user. If the ARPA does not track all targets visible on the display, targets which are being tracked should be clearly indicated on the display. The reliability of tracking should not be less than that obtainable using manual recording of successive target positions obtained from the radar display.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.3 Provided the target is not subject to target swop, the ARPA should continue to track an acquired target which is clearly distinguishable on the display for 5 out of 10 consecutive scans.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.4 The possibility of tracking errors, including target swop, should be minimized by ARPA design. A qualitative description of the effects of error sources on the automatic tracking and corresponding errors should be provided to the user, including the effects of low signal to noise and low signal to clutter ratios caused by sea returns, rain, snow, low clouds and non-synchronous emission.</p><p class="depth0">3.3.5 The ARPA should be able to display on request at least four equally time-spaced past positions of any targets being tracked over a period of at least eight minutes.</p><p class="depth0">3.4 Display</p><p class="depth0">3.4.1 The Display may be a separate or integral part of the ship's radar. However, the ARPA display should include all the data required to be provided by a radar display in accordance with the performance standards for navigational radar equipment adopted by the Organization.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.2 The design should be such that any malfunction of ARPA parts producing information additional to information to be produced by the radar as required by the performance standards for navigational equipment adopted by IMO should not affect the integrity of the basic radar presentation.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.3 The display on which ARPA information is presented should have an effective diameter of at least 340 mm.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.4 The ARPA facilities should be available on at least the following range scales:</p><p class="depth0">.1 12 or 16 miles;</p><p class="depth0">.2 3 or 4 miles.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.5 There should be a positive indication of the range scale in use.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.6 The ARPA should be capable of operating with a relative motion display with ``north-up'' and either ``head-up'' or ``course-up'' azimuth stabilization. In addition, the ARPA may also provide for a true motion display. If true motion is provided, the operator should be able to select for his display either true or relative motion. There should be a positive indication of the display mode and orientation in use.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.7 The course and speed information generated by the ARPA for acquired targets should be displayed in a vector or graphic form which clearly indicates the target's predicted motion. In this regard:</p><p class="depth0">.1 ARPA presenting predicted information in vector form only should have the option of both true and relative vectors;</p><p class="depth0">.2 An ARPA which is capable of presenting target course and speed information in graphic form, should also, on request, provide the target's true and/or relative vector;</p><p class="depth0">.3 Vectors displayed should be either time adjustable or have a fixed time-scale;</p><p class="depth0">.4 A positive indication of the time-scale of the vector in use should be given.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.8 The ARPA information should not obscure radar information in such a manner as to degrade the process of detecting targets.

It should be possible to cancel the display of unwanted ARPA data.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.9 Means should be provided to adjust independently the brilliance of the ARPA data and radar data, including complete elimination of the ARPA data.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.10 The method of presentation should ensure that the ARPA data is clearly visible in general to more than one observer in the conditions of light normally experienced on the bridge of a ship by day and by night. Screening may be provided to shade the display from sunlight but not to the extent that it will impair the observer's ability to maintain a proper lookout. Facilities to adjust the brightness should be provided.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.11 Provisions should be made to obtain quickly the range and bearing of any object which appears on the ARPA display.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.12 When a target appears on the radar display and, in the case of automatic acquisition, enters within the acquisition area chosen by the observer or, in the case of manual acquisition, has been acquired by the observer, the ARPA should present in a period of not more than one minute an indication of the target's motion trend and display within three minutes the target's predicted motion in accordance with paragraphs 3.4.7, 3.6, 3.8.2 and 3.8.3.</p><p class="depth0">3.4.13 After changing range scales on which the ARPA facilities are available or resetting the display, full plotting information should be displayed within a period of time not exceeding four scans.</p><p class="depth0">3.5 Operational Warnings</p><p class="depth0">3.5.1 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any distinguishable target which closes to a range or transits a zone chosen by the observer. The target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.2 The ARPA should have the capability to warn the observer with a visual and/or audible signal of any tracked target which is predicted to close to within a minimum range and time chosen by the observer. The

target causing the warning should be clearly indicated on the display.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.3 The ARPA should clearly indicate if a tracked target is lost, other than out of range, and the target's last tracked position should be clearly indicated on the display.</p><p class="depth0">3.5.4 It should be possible to activate or de-activate the operational warnings.</p><p class="depth0">3.6 Data Requirements</p><p class="depth0">3.6.1 At the request of the observer the following information should be immediately available from the ARPA in alphanumeric form in regard to any tracked target:
1. Present range to the target;2. Present bearing of the target;..3 Predicted target range at the closest point of approach (CPA);.4 Predicted time to CPA (TCPA);.5 Calculated true course of target;.6 Calculated true speed of target.</p><p class="depth0">3.7 Trial Manoeuvre</p><p class="depth0">3.7.1 The ARPA should be capable of simulating the effect on all tracked targets of an own ship manoeuvre without interrupting the updating of target information. The simulation should be initiated by the depression either of a spring-loaded switch, or of a function key, with a positive identification on the display.</p><p class="depth0">3.8 Accuracy</p><p class="depth0">3.8.1 The ARPA should provide accuracies not less than those given in paragraphs 3.8.2 and 3.8.3 for the four scenarios defined in Annex 2.
