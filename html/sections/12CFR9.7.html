                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Acting in a fiduciary capacity in more than one state. Pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 92a and this section, a national bank may act in a fiduciary capacity in any state. If a national bank acts, or proposes to act, in a fiduciary capacity in a particular state, the bank may act in the following specific capacities:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Any of the eight fiduciary capacities expressly listed in 12 U.S.C. 92a(a), unless the state prohibits its own state banks, trust companies, and other corporations that compete with national banks in that state from acting in that capacity; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Any other fiduciary capacity the state permits for its own state banks, trust companies, or other corporations that compete with national banks in that state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Serving customers in other states. While acting in a fiduciary capacity in one state, a national bank may market its fiduciary services to, and act as fiduciary for, customers located in any state, and it may act as fiduciary for relationships that include property located in other states. The bank may use a trust representative office for this purpose.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Offices in more than one state. A national bank with fiduciary powers may establish trust offices or trust representative offices in any state.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Determination of the state referred to in 12 U.S.C. 92a. For each fiduciary relationship, the state referred to in section 92a is the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for that relationship. A national bank acts in a fiduciary capacity in the state in which it accepts the fiduciary appointment, executes the documents that create the fiduciary relationship, and makes discretionary decisions regarding the investment or distribution of fiduciary assets. If these activities take place in more than one state, then the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity for section 92a purposes is the state that the bank designates from among those states.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Application of state law--(1) State laws used in section 92a. The state laws that apply to a national bank's fiduciary activities by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a are the laws of the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> State laws used in section 92a. The state laws that apply to a national bank's fiduciary activities by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a are the laws of the state in which the bank acts in a fiduciary capacity.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Other state laws. Except for the state laws made applicable to national banks by virtue of 12 U.S.C. 92a, state laws limiting or establishing preconditions on the exercise of fiduciary powers are not applicable to national banks.
