The employee must provide the employer with a written copy of the  physician's decision signed by the physician. If the decision recommends  that the employee not be permitted to enter those areas, the decision  must include the examining physician's opinion as to when the employee  may be permitted to reenter those areas and the requirements for future  medical examinations to review the decision.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Within six months of the date a decision in compliance with  paragraph (h)(2) of this section not to permit reentry is made, the  employee must be provided with a follow-up examination and a decision of  the examining physician (based on the follow-up examination and  consultation with a hematologist or internist) as to whether reentry  should be permitted and, if so, when, or whether it should be  permanently prohibited.
