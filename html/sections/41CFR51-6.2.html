                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In those cases where a direct order authorization has not been  issued as described in Sec. 51-6.1, the contracting activity shall  submit written requests for allocation to the appropriate central  nonprofit agency indicated by the Procurement List at the address listed  below:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth2">Agency                           Agency symbol ------------------------------------------------------------------------ National Industries for the Blind, 1901 North  NIB</p><p class="depth2">Beauregard Street, Suite 200, Alexandria,</p><p class="depth2">Virginia 22311-1727. NISH, 2235 Cedar Lane, Vienna, Virginia 22182- NISH</p><p class="depth2">5200. ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Requests for allocations shall contain, as a minimum:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For commodities. Name, stock number, latest specification,  quantity, unit price, and place and time of delivery.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For services. Type and location of service required, latest  specification,   work to be performed, estimated volume, and time for completion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Contracting activities shall request allocations in sufficient  time for the central nonprofit agency to reply, for the order(s) to be  placed, and for the nonprofit agencies to furnish the commodity or  service (see paragraph (i) of this section).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> When a commodity on the Procurement List also appears on the  Federal Prison Industries' ``Schedule of Products,'' the contracting  activity shall obtain clearance from the Federal Prison Industries prior  to requesting an allocation or placing an order directly to the  nonprofit agency(ies).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The central nonprofit agency shall make allocations to the  appropriate nonprofit agency(ies) upon receipt of a request from the  contracting activity and instruct that the orders be forwarded to the  central nonprofit agency or direct to the nonprofit agency(ies) with a  copy provided promptly to the central nonprofit agency.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Central nonprofit agencies shall reply promptly to requests for  allocation. When a request for allocation provides a delivery schedule  (based on established lead times and time required for processing the  allocation request) which cannot be met, the central nonprofit agency  shall request a revision, which the contracting activity shall grant, if  feasible, or the central nonprofit agency shall issue a purchase  exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as provided in  Sec. 51-5.4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> An allocation is not an obligation to supply a commodity or  service, or an obligation for the contracting activity to issue an  order. Nonprofit agencies are not authorized to commence production  until receipt of an order.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Upon receipt of an allocation, the contracting activity shall  promptly submit an order to the appropriate central nonprofit agency or  designated nonprofit agency(ies). Where this cannot be done promptly,  the contracting activity shall advise the central nonprofit agency and  the nonprofit agency(ies) immediately.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> An order for commodities or services shall provide leadtime  sufficient for purchase of materials, production or preparation, and  delivery or completion.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> The Central nonprofit agency shall keep the contracting activity  informed of any changes in leadtime experienced by its nonprofit  agency(ies) in order to keep to a minimum requests for extensions once  an order is placed. Where, due to unusual conditions, an order does not  provide sufficient leadtime, the central nonprofit agency or nonprofit  agency may request an extension of delivery or completion date which  should be granted, if feasible. If extension of delivery or completion  date is not feasible, the contracting activity shall:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Notify the central nonprofit agency and nonprofit agency(ies) as  appropriate.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Request the central nonprofit agency to reallocate or to issue a  purchase exception authorizing procurement from commercial sources as  provided in Sec. 51-5.4 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> In those instances where the central nonprofit agency is the  prime contractor rather than the nonprofit agency, the central nonprofit  agency will designate the nonprofit agency(ies) authorized by the  Committee to furnish definite quantities of commodities or specific  services upon receipt of an order from the contracting activity.
