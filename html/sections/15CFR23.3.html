The authorized types of penalty mail include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> All envelopes; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Self-mailer publications (newsletters, bulletins, etc.) with a shelf-life of no more than 90 days.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The manner in which pictures and biographical data may be used includes:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Printing on envelopes at the time they are initially printed with the United States Postal Service (USPS) required postal code identification;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Printed inserts that are placed in envelopes along with other mailing material;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Stickers that are printed and placed on envelopes prior to mailing; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Printing as part of the content of self-mailers such as bureau newsletters, bulletins, etc.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Missing children information will not be placed on letter-size envelopes in the areas described as the ``Penalty Indicia Area,'' ``OCR Read Area,'' ``Bar Code Read Area,'' and ``Return Address Area'' per Appendix A of the OJJDP guidelines.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (National Center) will be the sole source from which the Department of Commerce will obtain the camera-ready and other photographic and biographical materials for use by organizational units.

The Department of Commerce will not include missing children information on blank pages or covers of items such as those to be included in the Superintendent of Documents' Sales Program, or to be distributed to Depository Libraries, as such material generally could not be withdrawn from use within 90 days of notification.

The Department Contact Person shall conduct biannual meetings of departmental representatives to discuss the current plan and recommendations for future plans.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> This shall be the sole regulation implementing this program for the Department of Commerce.</p>
