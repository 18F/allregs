                            <p class="depth0">The definitions in subpart A of this part apply to this subpart. The  following definitions also apply to this subpart:</p><p class="depth0">Averaging for marine SI engines means the exchange of emission  credits among engine families within a given manufacturer's product  line.</p><p class="depth0">Banking means the retention of marine SI engine emission credits by  the manufacturer generating the emission credits for use in future model  year averaging or trading as permitted by these regulations.</p><p class="depth0">Eligible sales means marine SI engines sold for purposes of being  used in the United States and include any engine introduced into  commerce in the U.S. to be sold for use in the U.S.</p><p class="depth0">Emission credits represent the amount of emission reduction or  exceedance, by a marine SI engine family, below or above the applicable  emission standard, respectively. Emission reductions below the standard  are considered as ``positive credits,'' while emission exceedances above  the standard are considered as ``negative credits.'' In addition,  ``projected credits'' refer to emission credits based on the projected  applicable production/sales volume of the engine family. ``Reserved  credits'' are emission credits generated within a model year waiting to  be reported to EPA at the end of the model year. ``Actual credits''  refer to emission   credits based on actual applicable production/sales volume as contained  in the end-of-year reports submitted to EPA. Some or all of these  credits may be revoked if EPA review of the end-of-year reports or any  subsequent audit action(s) uncovers problems or errors.</p><p class="depth0">Point of first retail sale means the point at which the engine is  first sold directly to an end user. Generally, this point is the retail  boat or engine dealer. If the engine is sold first to a boat or vessel  manufacturer for installation in a boat or vessel, the boat or vessel  manufacturer may be the point of first retail sale if the boat or vessel  manufacturer can determine if the engine is or is not exported once they  have sold the boat or vessel. If the boat or vessel manufacturer cannot  determine if the engine is or is not exported once they have sold the  boat or vessel, the engine is presumed to not be exported, unless the  engine manufacturer can demonstrate otherwise. Engine manufacturers must  include engines in their average if the engine is exported and  subsequently imported into the United States installed in a boat or  vessel and introduced into United States commerce.</p><p class="depth0">Trading means the exchange of marine engine emission credits between  manufacturers.</p>
