                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Purpose. The regulations of this part are intended to carry out the Commission's mandate under section 9 of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40701-40706), as amended by the Ocean Shipping Reform Act of 1998, to monitor the practices of controlled carriers and ensure that they do not:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Maintain rates or charges in their tariffs and service contracts that are below a level that is just and reasonable; nor</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Establish, maintain or enforce unjust or unreasonable classifications, rules or regulations in those tariffs or service contracts which result or are likely to result in the carriage or handling of cargo at rates or charges that are below a just and reasonable level.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Scope. The regulations contained in this part set forth the special procedures whereby controlled carriers' tariffs and service contracts become effective and are reviewed by the Commission. These regulations in no way exempt controlled carriers from other Commission regulations or statutory authority to which they may otherwise be subject as ocean common carriers. These regulations apply to all controlled carriers operating in the foreign commerce of the United States unless excepted under section 9(f) of the Shipping Act of 1984 (46 U.S.C. 40706), as reflected by Sec. 565.5.
