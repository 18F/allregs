                            <p class="depth0">Marine mammals, whenever known to be primarily social in the wild,  must be housed in their primary enclosure with at least one compatible  animal of the same or biologically related species, except when the  attending veterinarian, in consultation with the husbandry/training  staff, determines that such housing is not in the best interest of the  marine mammal's health or well-being. However, marine mammals that are  not compatible must not be housed in the same enclosure. Marine mammals  must not be housed near other animals that cause them unreasonable  stress or discomfort or interfere with their good health. Animals housed  separately must have a written plan, approved by the attending  veterinarian, developed in consultation with the husbandry/training  staff, that includes the justification for the length of time the animal  will be kept separated or isolated, information on the type and  frequency of enrichment and   interaction, if appropriate, and provisions for periodic review of the  plan by the attending veterinarian. Marine mammals that are separated  for nonmedical purposes must be held in facilities that meet minimum  space requirements as outlined in Sec. 3.104.  [66 FR 253, Jan. 3, 2001]</p>
