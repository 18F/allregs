                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> A person who lost a period of eligibility on a register because  he has served on active military duty since June 30, 1950, is entitled  to have his name restored to that register or a successor register when  he meets the following conditions:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> He has not served more than four years following the date of his  entrance on active military duty, exclusive of any additional service  imposed pursuant to law. The date of entrance on duty means the first  date between June 30, 1950, and July 1, 1971, on which he began a new  period of active military duty, whether it was by original entry,  reentry or extension.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> He is honorably separated from active military duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> He applies for restoration of eligibility within 90 days after  discharge from active military duty or from hospitalization continuing  for 1 year or less following separation from active military duty.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> He is still qualified to perform the duties of the position for  which the register is used.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> When a person is entitled to have his name restored to a  register under paragraph (a) of this section, OPM shall enter his name  at the top of the appropriate group on the register if another eligible  standing lower on the register on which his name formerly appeared was  given a career or career-conditional appointment from that register. For  professional and scientific positions in GS-9 and above and in  comparable pay levels under other pay-fixing authorities, all eligibles  are in one group. For all other positions, preference eligibles with a  compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more are in  one group and all other eligibles in another.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> When there is no appropriate existing register, OPM may  establish special registers containing the names of persons entitled to  priority of certification under paragraph (b) of this section, together  with the names of eligibles described in Sec. 332.311, and use these  registers for certification to fill appropriate vacancies.
