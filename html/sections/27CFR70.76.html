See 26 U.S.C. 7101 and Sec. 70.281, relating to the form of  bond and the sureties thereon. The bond shall be conditioned upon the  payment of the amount (together with interest thereon), for which the  collection is stayed, at the time at which, but for the making of the  jeopardy assessment, such amount would be due.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Upon the filing of a bond in accordance with this section, the  collection of so much of the assessment as is covered by the bond will  be stayed. The taxpayer may at any time waive the stay of collection of  the whole or of any part of the amount covered by the bond. If as a  result of such waiver any part of the amount covered by the bond is  paid, or if any portion of the jeopardy assessment is abated by the  appropriate TTB officer, then the bond shall (at the request of the  taxpayer) be proportionately reduced.
