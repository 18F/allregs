                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> You may reduce monitoring to the level specified in the table in this paragraph (a) any time the LRAA is <=0.040 mg/L for TTHM and <=0.030 mg/L for HAA5 at all monitoring locations. You may only use data collected under the provisions of this subpart or subpart L of this part to qualify for reduced monitoring. In addition, the source water annual average TOC level, before any treatment, must be <=4.0 mg/L at each treatment plant treating surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water, based on monitoring conducted under either Sec.  141.132(b)(1)(iii) or Sec.  141.132(d).
