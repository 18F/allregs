For the purpose of accepting all swap  data as required by part 45 and part 43, the registered swap data  repository shall adopt policies and procedures, including technological  protocols, which provide for electronic connectivity between the swap  data repository and   designated contract markets, derivatives clearing organizations, swaps  execution facilities, swap dealers, major swap participants and/or  certain other non-swap dealer/non-major swap participant counterparties  who report such data. The technological protocols established by a swap  data repository shall provide for the receipt of swap creation data,  swap continuation data, real-time public reporting data, and all other  data and information required to be reported to such swap data  repository. The swap data repository shall ensure that its mechanisms  for swap data acceptance are reliable and secure.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A registered swap data repository shall set forth in its  application for registration as described in Sec. 49.3 the specific  asset class or classes for which it will accept swaps data.

The policies and procedures must  ensure that the swap data repository's user agreements are designed to  prevent any such invalidation or modification.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A registered swap data repository shall establish procedures and  provide facilities for effectively resolving disputes over the accuracy  of the swap data and positions that are recorded in the registered swap  data repository.</p>
