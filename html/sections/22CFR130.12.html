                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> In order to determine whether it is obliged under Sec. 130.9 to  furnish the information specified in Sec. 130.10 with respect to a  sale, every applicant or supplier must obtain from each vendor, from or  through whom the applicant acquired defense articles or defense services  forming the whole or a part of the sale, a full disclosure by the vendor  of all political contributions or fees or commission paid, by vendor  with respect to such sale. Such disclosure must include responses to all  the information pertaining to vendor required to enable applicant or  supplier, as the case may be, to comply fully with Sec. Sec. 130.9 and  130.10. If so required, they must include the information furnished by  each vendor in providing the information specified.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Any vendor which has been requested by an applicant or supplier  to furnish an initial statement under paragraph (a) of this section  must, except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, furnish such  statement in a timely manner and not later than 20 days after receipt of  such request.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> If the vendor believes that furnishing information to an  applicant or supplier in a requested statement would unreasonably risk  injury to the vendor's commercial interests, the vendor may furnish in  lieu of the statement an abbreviated statement disclosing only the  aggregate amount of all political contributions and the aggregate amount  of all fees or commissions which have been paid, or offered or agreed to  be paid, or offered or agreed to be paid, by the vendor with respect to  the sale. Any abbreviated statement furnished to an applicant or  supplier under this paragraph must be accompanied by a certification  that the requested information has been reported by the vendor directly  to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The vendor must  simultaneously report fully to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls  all information which the vendor would otherwise have been required to  report to the applicant or supplier under this section. Each such report  must clearly identify the sale with respect to which the reported  information pertains.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em></p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If upon the 25th day after the date of its request to vendor,  an applicant or supplier has not received from the vendor the initial  statement required by paragraph (a) of this section, the applicant or  supplier must submit to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls a  signed statement attesting to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The manner and extent of applicant's or supplier's attempt to  obtain from the vendor the initial statement required under paragraph  (a) of this section;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Vendor's failure to comply with this section; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The amount of time which has elapsed between the date of  applicant's or supplier's request and the date of the signed statement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The failure of a vendor to comply with this section does not  relieve any applicant or supplier otherwise required by Sec. 130.9 to  submit a report to the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls from  submitting such a report.
