                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> If no agreement is reached during the mandatory negotiation  period, an ET licensee may initiate involuntary relocation procedures  under the Commission's rules. ET licensees are obligated to pay to  relocated only the specific microwave links to which their systems pose  an interference problem. Under involuntary relocation, the FMS licensee  is required to relocate, provided that the ET licensee:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Guarantees payment of relocation costs, including all  engineering, equipment, site and FCC fees, as well as any legitimate and  prudent transaction expenses incurred by the FMS licensee that are  directly attributable to an involuntary relocation, subject to a cap of  two percent of the hard costs involved. Hard costs are defined as the  actual costs associated with providing a replacement system, such as  equipment and engineering expenses. ET licensees are not required to pay  FMS licensees for internal resources devoted to the relocation process.  ET licensees are not required to pay for transaction costs incurred by  FMS licensees during the voluntary or mandatory periods once the  involuntary period is initiated, or for fees that cannot be legitimately  tied to the provision of comparable facilities;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Completes all activities necessary for implementing the  replacement facilities, including engineering and cost analysis of the  relocation procedure and, if radio facilities are used, identifying and  obtaining, on the incumbents' behalf, new microwave frequencies and  frequency coordination; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Builds the replacement system and tests it for comparability  with the existing 2 GHz system.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Comparable facilities. The replacement system provided to an  incumbent during an involuntary relocation must be at least equivalent  to the existing FMS system with respect to the following three factors:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Throughput. Communications throughput is the amount of  information transferred within a system in a given amount of time. If  analog facilities are being replaced with analog, the ET licensee is  required to provide the FMS licensee with an equivalent number of 4 kHz  voice channels. If digital facilities are being replaced with digital,  the ET licensee must provide the FMS licensee with equivalent data  loading bits per second (bps). ET licensees must provide FMS licensees  with enough throughput to satisfy the FMS licensee's system use at the  time   of relocation, not match the total capacity of the FMS system.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Reliability. System reliability is the degree to which  information is transferred accurately within a system. ET licensees must  provide FMS licensees with reliability equal to the overall reliability  of their system. For digital data systems, reliability is measured by  the percent of time the bit error rate (BER) exceeds a desired value,  and for analog or digital voice transmissions, it is measured by the  percent of time that audio signal quality meets an established  threshold. If an analog voice system is replaced with a digital voice  system, only the resulting frequency response, harmonic distortion,  signal-to-noise ratio and its reliability will be considered in  determining comparable reliability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Operating costs. Operating costs are the cost to operate and  maintain the FMS system. ET licensees must compensate FMS licensees for  any increased recurring costs associated with the replacement facilities  (e.g., additional rental payments, increased utility fees) for five  years after relocation. ET licensees may satisfy this obligation by  making a lump-sum payment based on present value using current interest  rates. Additionally, the maintenance costs to the FMS licensee must be  equivalent to the 2 GHz system in order for the replacement system to be  considered comparable.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The FMS licensee is not required to relocate until the  alternative facilities are available to it for a reasonable time to make  adjustments, determine comparability, and ensure a seamless handoff.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> are available to FMS licensees relocated from the 2110- 2150 MHz and 2160-2200 MHz bands, and may be invoked whenever the FMS  licensee demonstrates that its replacement facility is not comparable,  subject to no time limit.
