                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Demand Deposit securities are one-day certificates of indebtedness that are automatically rolled over each day until you request redemption.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> How is the rate for Demand Deposit securities determined? Each security shall bear a rate of interest based on an adjustment of the average yield for 13-week Treasury bills at the most recent auction. A new annualized effective Demand Deposit rate and daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate are effective on the first business day following the regular auction of 13-week Treasury bills and are shown in the SLGS rate table. Interest is accrued and added to the principal daily. Interest is computed on the balance of the principal, plus interest accrued through the preceding day.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> How is the interest rate calculated? (i) First, you calculate the annualized effective Demand Deposit rate in decimals, designated ``I'' in Equation 1, as follows:[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TR30JN05.001


(Equation 1)
Where:
I = Annualized effective Demand Deposit rate in decimals. If the rate is determined to be negative, such rate will be reset to zero.P = Average auction price for the most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill, per hundred, to six decimals.Y = 365 (if the year following issue date of the 13-week Treasury bill does not contain a leap year day) or 366 (if the year following issue date of the 13-week Treasury bill does contain a leap year day).DTM = The number of days from date of issue to maturity for the most recently auctioned 13-week Treasury bill.MTR = Estimated marginal tax rate, in decimals, of purchasers of tax-exempt bonds.TAC = Treasury administrative costs, in decimals.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Then, you calculate the daily factor for the Demand Deposit rate as follows:
DDR = (1 + I)1/Y -1

(Equation 2)</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Where can I find additional information? Information on the estimated average marginal tax rate and Treasury administrative costs for administering Demand Deposit securities, both to be

determined by Treasury from time to time, will be published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> What happens to Demand Deposit securities during a Debt Limit Contingency? At any time the Secretary determines that issuance of obligations sufficient to conduct the orderly financing operations of the United States cannot be made without exceeding the statutory debt limit, we will invest any unredeemed Demand Deposit securities in special ninety-day certificates of indebtedness. Funds invested in the ninety-day certificates of indebtedness earn simple interest equal to the daily factor in effect at the time Demand Deposit security issuance is suspended, multiplied by the number of days outstanding. When regular Treasury borrowing operations resume, the ninety-day certificates of indebtedness, at the owner's option, are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Payable at maturity;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Redeemable before maturity, provided funds are available for redemption; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Reinvested in Demand Deposit securities.
