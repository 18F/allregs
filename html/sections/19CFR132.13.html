                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Procedure when nearing fulfillment. To secure for each importer the rightful quota priority and status for his quota-class merchandise, and to close the quota simultaneously at all ports of entry:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For release of merchandise--(i) Tariff-rate. When instructed by Headquarters, the port director shall require an importer to present an entry summary for consumption, with estimated duties attached, at the over-quota rate of duty until Headquarters has determined the quantity, if any of the merchandise entitled to the quota rate. If any of the merchandise entered at the over-quota rate is entitled to the quota rate, Customs shall amend the entry summary and refund to the importer any excess duties paid. This section does not prohibit an importer from obtaining release of the merchandise under the immediate delivery procedure. If an importer desires to enter only that quantity entitled to the quota rate, he may request that the merchandise not be released from Customs custody until Headquarters has determined the quantity entitled to the quota rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Tariff-rate. When instructed by Headquarters, the port director shall require an importer to present an entry summary for consumption, with estimated duties attached, at the over-quota rate of duty until Headquarters has determined the quantity, if any of the merchandise entitled to the quota rate. If any of the merchandise entered at the over-quota rate is entitled to the quota rate, Customs shall amend the entry summary and refund to the importer any excess duties paid. This section does not prohibit an importer from obtaining release of the merchandise under the immediate delivery procedure. If an importer desires to enter only that quantity entitled to the quota rate, he may request that the merchandise not be released from Customs custody until Headquarters has determined the quantity entitled to the quota rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Absolute. Except as provided for in Sec. 142.21 (e)(2) and (g) of this chapter, absolute quota merchandise shall not be released under the immediate delivery procedure. An entry summary for consumption, with estimated duties attached, setting forth the quantity desired to be entered, shall be presented. However, the merchandise shall not be released until Customs has determined the quantity entitled to absolute quota status and priority.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Quota Proration. When it is determined that entry summaries for consumption or withdrawals for consumption must be amended to permit only the quantity of tariff-rate and absolute quota merchandise determined to be within the quota, the entry summaries for consumption or withdrawals for consumption must be returned to the importer for adjustment. The time of presentation for quota purposes in that event shall be the same as the time of the initial presentation of the entry summaries for consumption or withdrawals for consumption provided:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> An adjusted entry summary for consumption, or withdrawals for consumption, with estimated duties attached, is deposited within 5 working days after Headquarters authorizes release of the merchandise, and</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> The importer takes delivery of the merchandise within 15 working days after release is authorized.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Report of time of presentation. The date, hour and minute that an entry summary for consumption or withdrawal for consumption is presented at a port of entry must be indicated on the document by a method deemed acceptable by Customs. The appropriate Customs officer shall report this information to Headquarters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Closing of the quota. Except as provided by Sec. 132.12, at the closing of a quota all entries or withdrawals for consumption which have acquired quota status due to priority of presentation shall be entitled to quota benefits. All other entries or withdrawals are without quota status and are not entitled to any quota benefits. All the latter shall be disposed of in accordance with Sec. 132.5.
