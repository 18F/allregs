The information to be evaluated shall include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The relevant data furnished from the evaluating railroad's own records, if the person was previously an employee of that railroad;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The relevant data furnished by any other railroad formerly employing the person; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The relevant data furnished by any governmental agency with pertinent motor vehicle driving records.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The railroad's process for evaluating information concerning prior safety conduct shall be designed to conform wherever necessary with the procedural requirements of Secs. 240.111, 240.113, 240.115, 240.117, 240.119, and 240.217.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> When evaluating a person's motor vehicle driving record or a person's railroad employment record, a railroad shall not consider information concerning motor vehicle driving incidents or prior railroad safety conduct that
