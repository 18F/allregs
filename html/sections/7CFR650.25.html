                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">Through proper planning, flood plains can be managed to reduce the  threat to human life, health, and property in ways that are  environmentally sensitive. Most flood plains are valuable for  maintaining agricultural and forest products for food and fiber, fish  and wildlife habitat, temporary floodwater storage, park and recreation  areas, and for maintaining and improving environmental values. NRCS  technical and financial assistance is provided to land users primarily  on non-Federal land through local conservation districts and other State  and local agencies. Through its programs, NRCS encourages sound flood- plain management decisions by land users.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Policy--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> General. NRCS provides leadership and takes action,  where practicable, to conserve, preserve, and restore existing natural  and beneficial values in base (100-year) flood plains as part of  technical and financial assistance in the programs it administers. In  addition, 500-year flood plains are taken into account where there are  ``critical actions'' such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes,  utilities, and facilities producing or storing volatile, toxic, or  water-reactive materials.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Technical assistance. NRCS provides leadership, through  consultation and advice to conservation districts and land users, in the  wise use, conservation, and preservation of all land, including flood  plains. Handbooks, manuals, and internal memoranda set forth specific  planning criteria for addressing flood-plain management in NRCS-assisted  programs. The general procedures and guidelines in this part   comply with Executive Order (E.O.) 11988, Floodplain Management, dated  May 24, 1977, and are consistent with the Water Resources Council's  Unified National Program for Floodplain Management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Compatible land uses. The NRCS Administrator has determined that  providing technical and financial assistance for the following land uses  is compatible with E.O. 11988:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Agricultural flood plains that have been used for producing  food, feed, forage, fiber, or oilseed for at least 3 of the 5 years  before the request for assistance; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Agricultural production in accordance with official State or  designated area water-quality plans.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Nonproject technical and financial assistance programs. The NRCS  Administrator has determined that NRCS may not provide technical and  financial assistance to land users if the results of such assisted  actions are likely to have significant adverse effects on existing  natural and beneficial values in the base flood plain and if NRCS  determines that there are practicable alternatives outside the base  flood plain. NRCS will make a case-by-case decision on whether to limit  assistance whenever a land user proposes converting existing  agricultural land to a significantly more intensive agricultural use  that could have significant adverse effects on the natural and  beneficial values or increase flood risk in the base flood plain. NRCS  will carefully evaluate the potential extent of the adverse effects and  any increased flood risk.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Project technical and financial assistance programs. In planning  and installing land and water resource conservation projects, NRCS will  avoid to the extent possible the long and short-term adverse effects of  the occupancy and modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS  also will avoid direct or indirect support of development in the base  flood plain wherever there is a practicable alternative. As such, the  environmental evaluation required for each project action (Sec. 650.5  of this part) will include alternatives to avoid adverse effects and  incompatible development in base flood plains. Public participation in  planning is described in Sec. 650.6 of this part and will comply with  section 2(a)(4) of E.O. 11988. Flood-plain management requires the  integration of these concerns into NRCS's National Environmental Policy  Act (NEPA) process for project assistance programs as described in  Section 650 of this part.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Real property and facilities under NRCS ownership or control.  NRCS owns or controls about 30 properties that are used primarily for  the evaluation and development of plant materials for erosion control  and fish and wildlife habitat plantings (7 CFR Part 613, Plant Materials  Centers, 16 U.S.C. 590 a-e, f, and 7 U.S.C. 1010-1011). If NRCS real  properties or facilities are located in the base flood plain, NRCS will  require an environmental evaluation when new structures and facilities  or major modifications are proposed. If it is determined that the only  practicable alternative for siting the proposed action may adversely  affect the base flood plain, NRCS will design or modify its action to  minimize potential harm to or within the flood plain and will prepare  and circulate a notice explaining why the action is proposed to be  located in the base flood plain. Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) flood insurance maps, other available maps,  information, or an onsite analysis will be used to determine whether the  proposed NRCS action is in the base flood plain. Public participation in  the action will be the same as described in Sec. 650.6 of this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Responsibility. NRCS provides technical and financial assistance  to land users primarily through conservation districts, special purpose  districts, and other State or local subdivisions of State government.  Acceptance of this assistance is voluntary on the part of the land user.  NRCS does not have authority to make land use decisions on non-Federal  land. NRCS provides the land user with technical flood hazard data and  information on flood-plain natural values. NRCS informs the land user  how alternative land use decisions may affect the aquatic and terrestial  ecosystems, human safety, property, and public welfare. Alternatives to  flood-plain occupancy, modification, and development are discussed  onsite with the land user by NRCS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> NRCS National Office. (Sec. 600.2 of this part). The NRCS  Administrator, state conservationist, and district conservationist are  the responsible Federal officials in NRCS for implementing the policies  expressed in these rules. Any deviation from these rules must be  approved by the Administrator. The Deputy Administrator for Programs has  authority to oversee the application of policy in NRCS programs.  Oversight assistance to state conservationists for flood-plain  management will be provided by the NRCS technical service centers (Sec.  600.3 of this part).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> NRCS state offices. (Sec. 600.4 of this part). Each state  conservationist is the responsible Federal official in all NRCS-assisted  programs administered within the State. He or she is also responsible  for administering the plant materials centers within the State. The  state conservationist will assign a staff person who has basic knowledge  of landforms, soils, water, and related plant and animal ecosystems to  provide technical oversight to ensure that assistance to land users and  project sponsors on the wise use, conservation, and preservation of  flood plains is compatible with national policy. For NRCS-assisted  project actions, the staff person assigned by the state conservationist  will consult with the local jurisdictions, sponsoring local  organizations, and land users, on the basis of an environmental  evaluation, to determine what constitutes significant adverse effects or  incompatible development in the base flood plain. The state  conservationist is to prepare and circulate a written notice for NRCS- assisted actions for which the only practicable alternative requires  siting in a base flood plain and may result in adverse effects or  incompatible development. The NRCS NEPA process will be used to  integrate flood-plain management into project planning and consultations  on land use decisions by land users and project sponsors.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> NRCS field offices. The district conservationist (Sec. 600.6 of  this part) is delegated the responsibility for providing technical  assistance and approving financial assistance to land users in  nonproject actions, where applicable, and for deciding what constitutes  an adverse effect or incompatible development of a base flood plain.  This assistance will be based on official NRCS policy, rules,  guidelines, and procedures in NRCS handbooks, manuals, memoranda, etc.  For NRCS-assisted nonproject actions, the district conservationist, on  the basis of the environmental evaluation, will advise recipients of  technical and financial assistance about what constitutes a significant  adverse effect or incompatible development in the base flood plain.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Coordination and implementation. All planning by NRCS staffs is  interdisciplinary and encompasses the six NEPA policy statements, the  WRC Principles and Standards, and an equivalent of the eight-step  decisionmaking process in the WRC's February 1978 Floodplain Management  Guidelines. NRCS internal handbooks, manuals, and memoranda provide  detailed information and guidance for NRCS planning and environmental  evaluation.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Steps for nonproject technical and financial assistance  programs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NRCS assistance programs are voluntary and are carried out  through local conservation districts (State entities) primarily on non- Federal, privately owned lands.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> After the land user decides the type, extent, and location of  the intended action for which assistance is sought, the district  conservationist will determine if the intended action is in the base  flood plain by using HUD flood insurance maps, and other available maps  and information or by making an onsite determination of the approximate  level of the 100-year flood if maps or other usable information are  lacking.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> If the district conservationist determines that the land  user's proposed location is outside the base flood plain, and would not  cause potential harm within the base flood plain, NRCS will continue to  provide assistance, as needed.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> If the district conservationist determines that the land user's  proposed action is within the base flood plain and would likely result  in adverse effects, incompatible development, or an increased flood  hazard, it is the responsibility of the district conservationist to  determine and point out to the land   user alternative methods of achieving the objective, as well as  alternative locations outside the base flood plain. If the alternative  locations are determined to be impractical, the district conservationist  will decide whether to continue providing assistance. If the decision is  to terminate assistance for the proposed action, the land user and the  local conservation district, if one exists, will be notified in writing  about the decision.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> If the district conservationist decides to continue providing  technical and financial assistance for a proposed action in the base  flood plain, which is the only practicable alternative, NRCS may require  that the proposed action be designed or modified so as to minimize  potential harm to or within the flood plain. The district  conservationist will prepare and circulate locally a written notice  explaining why the action is proposed to be located in the base flood  plain.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Steps for project assistance programs. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> NRCS project  assistance to local sponsoring organizations (conservation districts and  other legal entities of State government) and land users is carried out  primarily on non-Federal land in response to requests for assistance.  NRCS helps the local sponsoring organizations prepare a plan for  implementing the needed resource measures.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> NRCS uses an interdisciplinary environmental evaluation (Sec.  650.6 of this part) as a basis for providing recommendations and  alternatives to project sponsors. Flood-plain management is an integral  part of every NRCS environmental evaluation. NRCS delineates the base  flood plain by using detailed HUD flood insurance maps and other  available data, as appropriate, and provides recommendations to sponsors  on alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in  base flood plains. NRCS will develop, as needed, detailed 100-year and  500-year flood-plain maps where there are none.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> NRCS's NEPA process (part 650 of this chapter) is used to  integrate the spirit and intent of E.O. 11988 Sections 2(a) and 2(c)  into agency planning and recommendations for land and water use  decisions by local sponsoring organizations and land users.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> NRCS will terminate assistance to a local sponsoring  organization in project programs if it becomes apparent that decisions  by land users and local jurisdictions concerning flood-plain management  would likely result in adverse effects or incompatible development and  the environmental evaluation reveals that there are practicable  alternatives to the proposed project that would not cause adverse  effects on the base flood plain.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> In carrying out the planning and installation of land and water  resource conservation projects, NRCS will avoid, to the extent possible,  the long-term and short-term adverse effects associated with the  occupancy and modification of base flood plains. In addition, NRCS will  also avoid direct or indirect support of development in the base flood  plain wherever there is a practicable alternative. Where appropriate,  NRCS will require design modifications to minimize harm to or within the  base flood plain. NRCS will provide appropriate public notice and public  participation in the continuing planning process in accordance with NRCS  NEPA process.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> NRCS may require the local government to adopt and enforce  appropriate flood plain regulations as a condition to receiving project  financial assistance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Actions on property and facilities under NRCS ownership or  control. For real property and facilities owned by or under the control  of NRCS, the following actions will be taken:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Locate new structures, facilities, etc., outside the base flood  plain if there is a practicable alternate site.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Require public participation in decisions to construct  structures, facilities, etc., in flood plains that might result in  adverse effects and incompatible development in such areas if no  practicable alternatives exist.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> New construction or rehabilitation will be in accordance with  the standards and criteria of the National Flood Insurance Program and  will include floodproofing and other flood protection measures as  appropriate.
