                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General. Each State agency shall submit reports on the  performance of quality control reviews in accordance with the  requirements outlined in this section. These reports are designed to  enable FNS to monitor the State agency's compliance with Program  requirements relative to the Quality Control Review System. Every case  selected for review during the sample month must be accounted for and  reflected in the appropriate report(s).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Individual cases. The State agency shall report the review  findings on each case selected for review during the sample month. For  active cases, the State agency shall submit the edited findings of the  Form FNS-380-1. For negative cases, the State agency shall submit a  summary report which is produced from the edited findings on individual  cases which are coded on the Negative Quality Control Review   Schedule, Form FNS-245. The review findings shall be reported as  follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The State agency shall input and edit the results of each active  and negative case into the FNS supplied computer terminal and transmit  the data to the host computer. For State agencies that do not have FNS  supplied terminals, the State agency shall submit the results of each QC  review in a format specified by FNS. Upon State agency request, FNS will  consider approval of a change in the review results after they have been  reported to FNS.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The State agency shall have at least 115 days from the end of  the sample month to dispose of and report the findings of all cases  selected in a sample month. FNS may grant additional time as warranted  upon request by a State agency for cause shown to complete and dispose  of individual cases.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The State agency shall supply the FNS Regional Office with  individual household case records and the pertinent information  contained in the individual case records, or legible copies of that  material, as well as legible hard copies of individual Forms FNS-380,  FNS-380-1, and FNS-245 or other FNS-approved report forms, within 10  days of receipt of a request for such information.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> For each case that remains pending 115 days after the end of the  sample month, the State agency shall immediately submit a report that  includes an explanation of why the case has not been disposed of,  documentation describing the progress of the review to date, and the  date by which it will be completed. If FNS extends the time frames in  paragraph (b)(2) of this section, this date will be extended  accordingly. If FNS determines that the above report does not  sufficiently justify the case's pending status, the case shall be  considered overdue. Depending upon the number of overdue cases, FNS may  find the State agency's QC system to be inefficient or ineffective and  suspend and/or disallow the State agency's Federal share of  administrative funds in accordance with the provisions of Sec. 276.4.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Monthly status. The State agency shall report in a manner  directed by the regional office the monthly progress of sample selection  and completion within 125 days after the end of the sample month. Each  report shall reflect sampling and review activity for a given sample  month. If FNS extends the time frames in paragraph (b)(2) of this  section, this date will be extended accordingly.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Demonstration projects/SSA processing. The State agency shall  identify the monthly status of active and negative demonstration  project/SSA processed cases (i.e., those cases described in  Sec. 275.11(g)) in accordance with paragraph (c) of this section.
