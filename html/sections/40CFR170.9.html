                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)(2)(G)</em> it is unlawful for any  person ``to use any registered pesticide in a manner inconsistent with  its labeling.'' When this part is referenced on a label, users must  comply with all of its requirements except those that are inconsistent  with product-specific instructions on the labeling. For the purposes of  this part, EPA interprets the term ``use'' to include:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Preapplication activities, including, but not limited to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Arranging for the application of the pesticide;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Mixing and loading the pesticide; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Making necessary preparations for the application of the  pesticide, including responsibilities related to worker notification,  training of handlers, decontamination, use and care of personal  protective equipment, emergency information, and heat stress management.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Application of the pesticide.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Post-application activities necessary to reduce the risks of  illness and injury resulting from handlers' and workers' occupational  exposures to pesticide residues during the restricted-entry interval  plus 30 days. These activities include, but are not limited to,  responsibilities related to worker training, notification, and  decontamination.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Other pesticide-related activities, including, but not limited  to, providing emergency assistance, transporting or storing pesticides  that have been opened, and disposing of excess pesticides, spray mix,  equipment wash waters, pesticide containers, and other pesticide- containing materials.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> A person who has a duty under this part, as referenced on the  pesticide product label, and who fails to perform that duty, violates  FIFRA section 12(a)(2)(G) and is subject to a civil penalty under  section 14. A person who knowingly violates section 12(a)(2)(G) is  subject to section 14 criminal sanctions.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> FIFRA section 14(b)(4) provides that a person is liable for a  penalty under FIFRA if another person employed by or acting for that  person violates any provision of FIFRA. The term ``acting for'' includes  both employment and contractual relationships.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> The requirements of this part, including the decontamination  requirements, shall not, for the purposes of section 653(b)(1) of title  29 of the U.S. Code, be deemed to be the exercise of statutory authority  to prescribe or enforce standards or regulations affecting the general  sanitary hazards addressed by the OSHA Field Sanitation Standard, 29 CFR  1928.110, or other agricultural, nonpesticide hazards.</p>
