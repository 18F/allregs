                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Additional interest based on net appreciated value. Any mortgage  for which the mortgagee has chosen the shared premium option  (Sec. 206.107) may provide for shared appreciation. At the time the  mortgage becomes due and payable or is paid in full, whichever occurs  first, the mortgagor shall pay an additional amount of interest equal to  a percentage of any net appreciated value of the property during the  life of the mortgage. The percentage of net appreciated value to be paid  to the mortgagee, referred to as the appreciation margin, shall be no  more than twenty-five percent, subject to an effective interest rate cap  of no more than twenty percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Computation of mortgagee share. The mortgagee's share of net  appreciated value is computed as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the mortgage balance at the time the mortgagee's share of net  appreciated value becomes payable is less than the appraised value of  the property at the time of loan origination, the mortgagee's share is  calculated by subtracting the appraised value at the time of loan  origination from the adjusted sales proceeds (i.e., sales proceeds less  transfer costs and capital improvement costs incurred by the mortgagor,  but excluding any liens) and multiplying by the appreciation margin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the mortgage balance is greater than the appraised value at  the time of loan origination but less than the adjusted proceeds, the  mortgagee's share is calculated by subtracting the mortgage balance from  the adjusted sales proceeds and multiplying by the appreciation margin.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If the mortgage balance is greater than the adjusted sales  proceeds, the net appreciated value is zero.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> If there has been no sale or transfer involving satisfaction of  the mortgage at the time the mortgagee's share of net appreciated value  becomes payable, sales proceeds for purposes of this section shall be  the appraised value as determined in accordance with procedures approved  by the Secretary.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Effective interest rate. To determine the effective interest  rate, the amount of interest which accrued in the twelve months prior to  the sale of the property or the prepayment is added to the mortgagee's  share of the net appreciated value. The sum of the mortgagee's share of  the net appreciated value and the interest, when divided by the sum of  the mortgage balance at the beginning of the twelve month period prior  to sale or prepayment plus the payments to or on behalf of the mortgagor  (but not including interest) in the twelve months prior to the sale or  prepayment, shall not exceed an effective interest rate of twenty  percent.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Disclosure. At the time the mortgagee provides the mortgagor  with a loan application for a mortgage with shared appreciation, the  mortgagee shall disclose to the mortgagor the principal limit, payments  and interest rate which are applicable to a comparable mortgagee offered  by the mortgagee without shared appreciation.
