Manufacturers incorporating N2O and CH4 emissions in their fleet average carbon-related exhaust emissions as allowed under Sec. 86.1818 of this chapter shall also submit N2O and CH4 emission data where applicable.

Additionally, in lieu of submitting actual data from a test vehicle, a manufacturer may provide fuel economy, CO2 emissions, and carbon-related exhaust emission values derived from an analytical expression, e.g., regression analysis.
