This includes administrative proceedings at the  Federal and state level but only in connections with performance of a  Federal contract or grant. It does not include agency actions such as  contract audits, site visits, corrective plans, or inspection of  deliverables.</p><p class="depth0">Surveying activity, as used in this subpart, means the cognizant  contract administration office or, if there is no such office, another  organization designated by the agency to conduct preaward surveys.
