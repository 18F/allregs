Sec.  216.106 and 217.57 must be implemented. These mitigation measures include, but are not limited to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must not enter pinniped haul-out sites below the missile's predicted flight path for 2 hours prior to planned missile launches.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must avoid, whenever possible, launch activities during harbor seal pupping season (February to April), unless constrained by factors including, but not limited to, human safety, national security, or for vehicle launch trajectory necessary to meet mission objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must limit, whenever possible, launch activities during other pinniped pupping seasons, unless constrained by factors including, but not limited to, human safety, national security, or for vehicle launch trajectory necessary to meet mission objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must not launch vehicles from the Alpha Complex at low elevation (less than 1,000 feet (305 m)) on launch azimuths that pass close to pinniped haul-out sites when occupied.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must avoid, where practicable, launching multiple target missiles in quick succession over haul-out sites, especially when young pups are present.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> The holder of the Letter of Authorization must limit launch activities during nighttime hours, except when required by the test objectives.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Aircraft and helicopter flight paths must maintain a minimum altitude of 1,000 feet (305 m) from pinniped haul-outs and rookeries, except in emergencies or for real-time security incidents (e.g., search-and-rescue, fire-fighting), which may require approaching pinniped haul-outs and rookeries closer than 1,000 feet (305 m).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> If post-launch surveys determine that an injurious or lethal take of a marine mammal has occurred or there is an indication that the distribution, size, or productivity of the potentially affected pinniped populations has been affected, the launch procedure and the monitoring methods must be reviewed, in cooperation with NMFS, and, if necessary, appropriate changes must be made through modification to a Letter of Authorization, prior to conducting the next launch of the same vehicle under that Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Additional mitigation measures as contained in a Letter of Authorization.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> [Reserved]</p>
