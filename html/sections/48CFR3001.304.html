Each HCA may supplement the HSAR with Component guidance. Supplementation should be kept to a minimum. Components proposing to issue

regulatory supplements or use solicitation or contract clauses on a repetitive basis must obtain legal review by the Component's legal counsel and forward supplements to the CPO for concurrence prior to publication in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> The CPO is responsible for evaluating all regulatory coverage in agency acquisition regulations to determine if the substance could apply to other agencies and to make recommendation for inclusion in the FAR.
