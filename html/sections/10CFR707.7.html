HRP employees will be  subject to the drug testing standards of this part and any additional  requirements of the HRP rule.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Positions identified by the contractor which entail duties where  failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position could  significantly harm the environment, public health or safety, or national  security, such as:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Pilots;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Firefighters;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Protective force personnel, exclusive of those covered in  paragraphs (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, in positions involving use  of firearms where the duties also require potential contact with, or  proximity to, the public at large;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Personnel directly engaged in construction, maintenance, or  operation of nuclear reactors; or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Personnel directly engaged in production, use, storage,  transportation, or disposal of hazardous materials sufficient to cause  significant harm to the environment or public health and safety.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Other positions determined by the DOE, after consultation with  the contractor, to have the potential to significantly affect the  environment, public health and safety, or national security.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Each contractor shall require random testing of any individual,  whether or not an employee, who is allowed unescorted access to the  control areas   of the following DOE reactors: Advanced Test Reactor (ATR); C Production  Reactor (C); Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II); Fast Flux Test  Facility (FFTF); High Flux Beam Reactor (HFBR); High Flux Isotope  Reactor (HFIR); K Production Reactor (K); L Production Reactor (L); N  Production Reactor (N); Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR); and P  Production Reactor (P). A confirmed positive test shall result in such  an individual being denied unescorted access. If such an individual is  not an employee of the contractor, that individual may be granted  unescorted access only after the individual meets the conditions  established in Sec. 707.14(d) of this part. If, after restoration of  unescorted access, such an individual is determined to have used illegal  drugs for a second time, unescorted access shall be denied for a period  of not less than three (3) years. Such an individual thereafter shall be  granted unescorted access only upon a determination by DOE that a grant  of unescorted access to the individual presents no unacceptable safety  or security risk. If such an individual is an employee, that individual  is subject to the other requirements of this part, including appropriate  disciplinary measures.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> A position otherwise subject to testing under this part may be  exempted from such testing if it is within the scope of another  comparable Federal drug testing program, as determined by DOE, after  consultation with the contractor, to avoid unnecessary multiple tests.
