                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Full-time students. A full-time student for the purpose of this subpart is defined as one who meets the accepted definition of a full-time student of the institution of higher education which employs him/her. A full-time student retains that status during the student's Christmas, summer and other vacations, even when a student is taking one or more courses during his/her summer or other vacation. The phrase in section 14(b) of the statute ``regardless of age but in compliance with applicable child labor laws'', among other things restricts the employment in an

institution of higher education to full-time students who are at least 14 years of age because of the application of section 3(1) of the Act.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Institution of higher education. An institution of higher education is an institution above the secondary level, such as a college or university, a junior college, or a professional school of engineering, law, library science, social work, etc. It is one that is recognized by a national accrediting agency or association as determined by the U.S. Commissioner of Education. Generally, an institution of higher education: (1) Admits as regular students only individuals having a certificate of graduation from a high school or the recognized equivalent of such a certificate; and (2) is legally authorized within a State to provide a program of education beyond high school; and (3) provides an educational program for which it normally awards a bachelor's degree, or provides not less than a two-year program which is acceptable for full credit toward such a degree or offers a two-year program in engineering, mathematics, or the physical or biological sciences which is designed to prepare the student to work as a technician and at a semi-professional level in engineering, scientific, or other technological fields which require the understanding and application of basic engineering, scientific, or mathematical principles of knowledge.
