If HUD determines that a State, tribal or  local law, ordinance, code or regulation provides for evaluation or  hazard reduction in a manner that provides a comparable level of  protection from the hazards of lead-based paint poisoning to that  provided by the requirements of subparts B, C, D, F through M and R of  this part and that adherence to the requirements of subparts B, C, D, F  through M, and R of this part, would be duplicative or otherwise cause  inefficiencies, HUD may modify or waive some or all of the requirements  of the subparts in a manner that will promote efficiency while ensuring  a comparable level of protection.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Participant responsibility. Nothing in this part is intended to  relieve any participant in a program covered by this subpart of any  responsibility for compliance with State, tribal or local laws,  ordinances, codes or regulations governing evaluation and hazard  reduction. If a State, tribal or local law, ordinance, code or  regulation defines lead-based paint differently than the Federal  definition, the more protective definition (i.e., the lower level) shall  be followed in that State, tribal or local jurisdiction.</p>
