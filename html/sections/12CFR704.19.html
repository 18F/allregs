                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual disclosure. A corporate credit union must annually prepare and maintain a disclosure of the dollar amount of compensation paid to its most highly compensated employees, including compensation from any corporate CUSO in which the corporate has invested or made a loan, in accordance with the following schedule:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For corporate credit unions with forty-one or more full time employees, disclosure is required of the compensation paid to the five most highly compensated employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For corporate credit unions with between thirty and forty-one full time employees, disclosure is required of the compensation paid to the four most highly compensated employees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For corporate credit unions with thirty or fewer full time employees, disclosure is required of the compensation paid to the three most highly compensated employees; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> In all cases, compensation paid to the corporate credit union's chief executive officer must also be disclosed, if the chief executive officer is not already included among the most highly compensated employees described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (a)(3) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Availability of disclosure. Any member may obtain a copy of the most current disclosure, and all disclosures for the previous three years, on request made in person or in writing.

With respect to any merger involving a corporate credit union that would result in a material increase in compensation, i.e., an increase of more than 15 percent or $10,000, whichever is greater, for any senior executive officer or director of the merging corporate, the corporate must:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Describe the compensation arrangement in the merger plan documents submitted to NCUA for approval of the merger, pursuant to Sec. 708b of this part; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the case of any federally chartered corporate credit union, describe the compensation arrangement in the materials provided to the membership of the merging credit union before the member vote on approving the merger.
