                            <p class="depth0">Any credit union which is insured pursuant to title II of the Act must:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Adhere to the requirements stated in part 723 of this chapter concerning member business loans, Sec. 701.21(c)(8) of this chapter concerning prohibited fees, and Sec. 701.21(d)(5) of this chapter concerning nonpreferential loans. State-chartered, NCUSIF-insured credit unions in a given state are exempt from these requirements if the state supervisory authority for that state adopts substantially equivalent regulations as determined by the NCUA Board or, in the case of the member business loan requirements, if the state supervisory authority adopts member business loan regulations that are approved by the NCUA Board pursuant to Sec. 723.20. In nonexempt states, all required NCUA reviews and approvals will be handled in coordination with the state credit union supervisory authority; and</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Adhere to the requirements stated in part 722 of this chapter concerning appraisals.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Adhere to the requirements stated in Sec. 701.21(h) of this chapter concerning third-party servicing of indirect vehicle loans. Before a state-chartered credit union applies to a regional director for a waiver under Sec. 701.21(h)(2), it must first notify its state supervisory authority. The regional director will not grant a waiver unless the appropriate state official concurs in the waiver. The 45-day period for the regional director to act on a waiver request, as described Sec. 701.21(h)(3), will not begin until the regional director has received the state official's concurrence and any other necessary information.
