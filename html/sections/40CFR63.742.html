There are no fugitive emissions from a total enclosure. The only openings in a total enclosure are forced makeup air and exhaust ducts and any natural draft openings such as those that allow raw materials to enter and exit the enclosure for processing. All access doors or windows are closed during routine operation of the enclosed source. Brief, occasional openings of such doors or windows to accommodate process equipment adjustments are acceptable, but if such openings are routine or if an access door remains open during the entire operation, the access door must be considered a natural draft opening. The average inward face velocity

across the natural draft openings of the enclosure must be calculated including the area of such access doors. The drying oven itself may be part of the total enclosure. An enclosure that meets the requirements found in Sec.  63.750(g)(4) is a permanent total enclosure.</p><p class="depth0">Touch-up and repair operation means that portion of the coating operation that is the incidental application of coating used to cover minor imperfections in the coating finish or to achieve complete coverage.

Where such a method also inadvertently measures compounds that are exempt solvent, an owner or operator may exclude these exempt solvents when determining compliance with an emission standard.</p><p class="depth0">Waterborne (water-reducible) coating means any coating that contains more than 5 percent water by weight as applied in its volatile fraction.</p><p class="depth0">Waterwash system means a control system that utilizes flowing water (i.e., a conventional waterwash system) or a pumpless system to remove particulate emissions from the exhaust air stream in spray coating application or dry media blast depainting operations.</p><p class="depth0">Nomenclature for determining carbon adsorber efficiency--The nomenclature defined below is used in Sec.  63.750(g):</p><p class="depth1"><em>(1)</em> Ak = the area of each natural draft opening (k) in a total enclosure, in square meters.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(2)</em> Caj = the concentration of HAP or VOC in each gas stream (j) exiting the emission control device, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(3)</em> Cbi = the concentration of HAP or VOC in each gas stream (i) entering the emission control device, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(4)</em> Cdi = the concentration of HAP or VOC in each gas stream (i) entering the emission control device from the affected source, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(5)</em> Cfk = the concentration of HAP or VOC in each uncontrolled gas stream (k) emitted directly to the atmosphere from the affected source, in parts per million by volume.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(6)</em> Cgv = the concentration of HAP or VOC in each uncontrolled gas stream entering each individual carbon adsorber vessel (v), in parts per million by volume.
