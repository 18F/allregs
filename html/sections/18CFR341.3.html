                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Tariffs may be filed either by dividing the tariff into tariff  sections or as an entire document.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Contents of tariff. All tariff publications must contain the  following information in the following order:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Title page. The title page of each tariff must contain the  following information:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> The FERC tariff number designation, in the upper right hand  corner, numbered consecutively, and the FERC tariff number designation  of the tariff that is canceled, if any, under it;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> The corporate name of the carrier;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The type of rates, e.g., local, joint, or proportional, and  the commodity to which the tariff applies, e.g., crude, petroleum  product, or jet fuel;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Governing tariffs, e.g., separate ``rules and regulations''  tariffs, if any;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> The specific Commission order pursuant to which the tariff is  issued;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> The issue date, which must be shown on the lower left side, and  the effective date, which must be shown on the lower right side;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vii)</em> The expiration date, if applicable;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(viii)</em> The name of the issuing officer or duly appointed official  issuing the tariff, the complete street and mailing address of the  carrier, and the name and phone number of the individual responsible for  compiling the tariff publication.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Table of contents. Tariffs of more than nine pages in length  must contain a table of contents. A table of contents is optional for  tariffs which are less than 10 pages in length.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> A list of carriers participating in joint tariffs.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Index of Commodities.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Explanatory statements. These statements must explain the proper  application of rates and rules.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Rules governing tariff publications. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All rules affecting the  rates or the services provided for in the tariff publication must be  included. A special rule affecting a particular item or rate must be  referred to specifically in that item or in connection with that rate.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Each rule must be given a separate item number, (e.g., Item No.  1), and the title of each rule must be distinctive.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Except as provided in Sec. 341.10, tariffs may not include  any rules that substitute for any rates named in the tariff or found in  any other tariff. Rules may not provide that traffic of any nature will  be ``transported only by special agreement'' or any other provision of  similar meaning.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Rules may be separately published in a general rules tariff  when it is not desirable or practicable to include the governing rules  in the rate tariff. Rate tariffs that do not contain rules must make  specific reference, by FERC Tariff number, to the governing general  rules tariff.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When joint rate tariffs refer to a separate governing rules  tariff, such separate tariff must be concurred in by all joint carriers.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Statement of rates. Rates must be stated explicitly in cents, or  in dollars and cents, per barrel or other specified unit. The names or  designations of the places from and to which the rates apply must be  arranged in a simple and systematic manner. Any related services  performed by the carrier in connection with the rates must be clearly  identified and explained. Duplicative or conflicting rates for the same  service are prohibited.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(8)</em> Routing. Routing over which the rates apply must be stated so  that the actual routes may be ascertained. This may be accomplished by  stating that the rates apply via all routes of the carrier except as  otherwise specifically stated in the tariff.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(9)</em> Explanation of abbreviations and reference marks. Reference  marks, abbreviations, and note references must be explained at the end  of each tariff publication. U.S. Postal Service state   abbreviations and other commonly used abbreviations need not be  explained.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(10)</em> Changes to be indicated in tariff or supplement.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> All tariff publications must identify where changes have been  made in existing rates or charges, rules, regulations or practices, or  classifications. One of the following letter designations or uniform  symbols may be used to indicate the change, and insertions, other than  to tables and rates, must be indicated by either highlight, background  shading, bold, or underline, with deleted text indicated by strike- through:  ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth4">Description                   Option 1         Option 2 ------------------------------------------------------------------------ Increase..............................        [I] Decrease..............................  <                [D] Change in wording only................  [caret]          [W] Cancel................................  /                [C] Reissued Item.........................                   [R] Unchanged Rate........................  =                [U] New...................................  +                [N] ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Reissued items must include in the square or brackets the  number of the tariff supplement where the item was first issued or  amended. If the letter designation is used, the number of the supplement  must be shown together with the letter. The references must be explained  at the end of the tariff. For example: ``[R2] Reissued from Supplement  No. 2, effective [specify date].''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> The symbols and letter designations contained in paragraph  (b)(10)(i) of this section must not be used for any other purpose.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> When the same change is made in all or in substantially all  rates in a tariff, a tariff supplement, or a tariff or tariff supplement  page, that fact and the nature of the change must be indicated in  distinctive type at the top of the title page of the issue, or at the  top of each page, as appropriate. For example: ``All rates in this issue  are increased,'' or ``All rates on this page are reduced unless  otherwise indicated.''</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> When a tariff publication that cancels a previous tariff  publication does not include points of origin or destination, or rates,  rules, or routes that were contained in the prior tariff publication,  the new tariff publication must indicate the cancellation. If such  omissions effect changes in charges or services, that fact must be  indicated by the use of the symbols prescribed in paragraph (b)(10)(i)  of this section.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(vi)</em> Only revisions to tariff provisions identified in the filing  constitute the tariff filing. Revisions to unidentified portions of the  rate schedule or tariff are not considered part of the filing nor will  any acceptance of the filing by the Commission constitute acceptance of  such unmarked changes.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(11)</em> Tariff publications must be consecutively numbered.
