                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0">When any land which has been contaminated with explosive objects, or chemical/biological agents, is released for disposal to, or use by, the general public in addition to the clearance statement furnished to the disposal agency, the DE will publicize, to the fullest extent practicable, the possibility of contaminants remaining on the land and the inherent danger of handling explosives or other contaminants. Such publication should be in the form of articles in official news media, or posting of the premises whenever the later is considered most feasible. Such publicity should include instructions that, in the event of the discovery of an explosive missile, or an object resembling an explosive missile, or other contaminant, or in the event of an injury caused by an explosion or exposure to toxic agents, such discovery or injury should be reported immediately to the DE. An effort should be made to obtain the cooperation of local law enforcing agencies to insure the prompt reporting of an accident, or the discovery of an explosive missile. The majority of accidents are the result of the removal of explosive missiles by individuals for sale to scrap dealers. Scrap dealers in the vicinity of contaminated lands should be informed of the inherent dangers and asked to cooperate by refusing to buy military scrap from private parties.</p>
