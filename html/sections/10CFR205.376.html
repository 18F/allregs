In the event that the DOE determines that an emergency exists under section 202(c), and the ``entities'' are unable to agree on the rates to be charged, the DOE shall prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issues to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for determination by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures.</p>
