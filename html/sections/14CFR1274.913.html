                            <p class="depth0">Patent Rights--Retention by the Recipient (Small Business)</p><p class="depth0">July 2002</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Definitions. (1) Invention, as used in this clause, means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S.C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Invention, as used in this clause, means any invention or discovery which is or may be patentable or otherwise protectable under title 35 of the U.S.C.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Made, as used in this clause, when used in relation to any invention means the conception or first actual reduction to practice such invention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Nonprofit organization, as used in this clause, means a university or other institution of higher education or an organization of the type described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)) and exempt from taxation under section 501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. 501(a)) or any nonprofit scientific or educational organization qualified under a state nonprofit organization statute.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Practical application, as used in this clause, means to manufacture, in the case of

a composition of product; to practice, in the case of a process or method, or to operate, in the case of a machine or system; and, in each case, under such conditions as to establish that the invention is being utilized and that its benefits are, to the extent permitted by law or Government regulations, available to the public on reasonable terms.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Small business firm, as used in this clause, means a small business concern as defined at Section 2 of Pub. L. 85-536 (15 U.S.C. 632) and implementing regulations of the Administrator of the Small Business Administration. For the purpose of this clause, the size standards for small business concerns involved in Government procurement and subcontracting at 13 CFR 121.901 through 121.911 will be used.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Subject invention, as used in this clause, means any invention of the Subcontractor conceived or first actually reduced to practice in the performance of work under this Agreement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Manufactured substantially in the United States means the product must have over 50 percent of its components manufactured in the United States. This requirement is met if the cost to the Recipient of the components mined, produced, or manufactured in the United States exceeds 50 percent of the cost of all components required to make the product. (In making this determination only the product and its components shall be considered.) The cost of each component includes transportation costs to the place of incorporation into the product and any applicable duty (whether or not a duty-free entry certificate is issued). Components of foreign origin of the same class or kind for which determinations have been made in accordance with FAR 25.102(a)(3) and (4) are treated as domestic. Scrap generated, collected, and prepared for processing in the United States is considered domestic.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Allocation of principal rights. The Recipient may retain the entire right, title, and interest throughout the world to each subject invention subject to the provisions of this clause and 35 U.S.C. 203. With respect to any subject invention in which the Recipient retains title, the Federal Government shall have a nonexclusive, nontransferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States the subject invention throughout the world.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Invention disclosure, election of title, and filing of patent application by Recipient. (1) The Recipient will disclose each subject invention to NASA within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Recipient will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any sale or public use planned by the Recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Recipient will disclose each subject invention to NASA within two months after the inventor discloses it in writing to Recipient personnel responsible for patent matters. The disclosure to the agency shall be in the form of a written report and shall identify the contract under which the invention was made and the inventor(s). It shall be sufficiently complete in technical detail to convey a clear understanding to the extent known at the time of the disclosure, of the nature, purpose, operation, and the physical, chemical, biological or electrical characteristics of the invention. The disclosure shall also identify any publication, on sale or public use of the invention and whether a manuscript describing the invention has been submitted for publication and, if so, whether it has been accepted for publication at the time of disclosure. In addition, after disclosure to the agency, the Recipient will promptly notify the agency of the acceptance of any manuscript describing the invention for publication or of any sale or public use planned by the Recipient.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Recipient will elect in writing whether or not to retain title to any such invention by notifying NASA within two years of disclosure to the Federal agency. However, in any case where publication, on sale or public use has initiated the one-year statutory period wherein valid patent protection can still be obtained in the United States, the period for election of title may be shortened by the agency to a date that is no more than 60 days prior to the end of the statutory period.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Recipient will file its initial patent application on a subject invention to which it elects to retain title within one year after election of title or, if earlier, prior to the end of any statutory period wherein valid patent protection can be obtained in the United States after a publication, on sale, or public use. The Recipient will file patent applications in additional countries or international patent offices within either 10 months of the corresponding initial patent application of six months from the date permission is granted by the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to file foreign patent applications where such filing has been prohibited by a Secrecy Order.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Requests for extension of the time for disclosure election, and filing under paragraphs (c)(1), (2), and (3) of this section may, at the discretion of the agency, be granted.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Conditions when the Government may obtain title. The Recipient will convey to NASA, upon written request, title to any subject invention--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> If the Recipient fails to disclose or elect title to the subject invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this section, or elects not to retain title; provided, that the agency may only request title within 60 days after learning of the failure of the Recipient to disclose or elect within the specified times.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In those countries in which the Recipient fails to file patent applications within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this section; provided, however, that if the Recipient has filed a patent application in a

country after the times specified in paragraph (c) of this section, but prior to its receipt of the written request of the Federal agency, the Recipient shall continue to retain title in that country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> In any country in which the Recipient decides not to continue the prosecution of any application for, to pay the maintenance fees on, or defend in reexamination or opposition proceeding on, a patent on a subject invention.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Minimum rights to Recipient and protection of the Recipient right to file. (1) The Recipient will retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Recipient fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the agreement was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of NASA, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Recipient will retain a nonexclusive, royalty-free license throughout the world in each subject invention to which the Government obtains title, except if the Recipient fails to disclose the invention within the times specified in paragraph (c) of this section. The Recipient's license extends to its domestic subsidiary and affiliates, if any, within the corporate structure of which the Recipient is a party and includes the right to grant sublicenses of the same scope to the extent the Recipient was legally obligated to do so at the time the agreement was awarded. The license is transferable only with the approval of NASA, except when transferred to the successor of that part of the Recipient's business to which the invention pertains.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Contractor's domestic license may be revoked or modified by NASA to the extent necessary to achieve expeditious practical application of subject invention pursuant to an application for an exclusive license submitted in accordance with applicable provisions at 37 CFR Part 404 and agency licensing regulations (if any). This license will not be revoked in that field of use or the geographical areas in which the Subcontractor has achieved practical application and continues to make the benefits of the invention reasonable accessible to the public. The license in any foreign country may be revoked or modified at the discretion of NASA to the extent the Subcontractor, its licensees, or the domestic subsidiaries or affiliates have failed to achieve practical application in that foreign country.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Before revocation or modification of the license, NASA will furnish the Recipient a written notice of its intention to revoke or modify the license, and the Recipient will be allowed 30 days (or such other time as may be authorized by NASA for good cause shown by the Recipient) after the notice to show cause why the license should not be revoked or modified. The Recipient has the right to appeal, in accordance with applicable regulations in 37 CFR Part 404 and 14 CFR Subpart 1245.1, concerning the licensing of Government-owned inventions, any decision concerning the revocation or modification of the license.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Recipient action to protect the Government's interest. (1) The Recipient agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to NASA all instruments necessary to:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Recipient agrees to execute or to have executed and promptly deliver to NASA all instruments necessary to:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> establish or confirm the rights the Government has throughout the world in those subject inventions to which the Subcontractor elects to retain title, and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> convey title to the Federal agency when requested under paragraph (d) of this section and to enable the Government to obtain patent protection throughout the world in that subject invention.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Recipient agrees to require, by written agreement, its employees, other than clerical and nontechnical employees, to disclose promptly in writing to personnel identified as responsible for the administration of patent matters and in a format suggested by the Recipient each subject invention made under contract in order that the Recipient can comply with the disclosure provisions of paragraph (c) of this section, and to execute all papers necessary to file patent applications on subject inventions and to establish the Government's rights in the subject inventions. This disclosure format should require, as a minimum, the information required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section. The Recipient shall instruct such employees, through employee agreements or other suitable educational programs, on the importance of reporting inventions in sufficient time to permit the filing of patent applications prior to U.S. or foreign statutory bars.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Recipient will notify NASA of any decisions not to continue the prosecution of a patent application, pay maintenance fees, or defend in a reexamination or opposition proceeding on a patent, in any country, not less than 30 days before the expiration of the response period required by the relevant patent office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The Recipient agrees to include, within the specification of any United States patent application and any patent issuing thereon covering a subject invention the following statement, ``This invention was made with Government support under (identify the agreement) awarded by NASA. The Government has certain rights in the invention.''</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> The Recipient shall provide the Agreement Officer the following:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> A listing every 12 months (or such longer period as the Agreement Officer may specify) from the date of the Agreement, of all subject inventions required to be disclosed during the period.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> A final report prior to closeout of the Agreement listing all subject inventions or certifying that there were none.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Upon request, the filing date, serial number, and title, a copy of the patent application, and patent number and issue date for any subject invention in any country in which the Recipient has applied for patents.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> An irrevocable power to inspect and make copies of the patent application file,

by the Government, when a Federal Government employee is a co-inventor.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Subcontracts. (1) Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Unless otherwise authorized or directed by the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Include this clause (Patent Rights--Retention by the Recipient (Small Business)), suitably modified to identify the parties, in all subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work to be performed by a small business firm or domestic nonprofit organization; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Include in all other subcontracts, regardless of tier, for experimental, developmental, or research work the patent rights clause (Patent Rights--Retention by the Recipient (Large Business).</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> In the event of a refusal by a prospective subcontractor to accept such a clause the Recipient--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Shall promptly submit a written notice to the Agreement Officer setting forth the subcontractor's reasons for such refusal and other pertinent information that may expedite disposition of the matter; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Shall not proceed with such subcontract without the written authorization of the Agreement Officer.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The Recipient shall promptly notify the Agreement Officer in writing upon the award of any subcontract at any tier containing a patent rights clause by identifying the subcontractor, the applicable patent rights clause, the work to be performed under the subcontract, and the dates of award and estimated completion. Upon request of the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall furnish a copy of such subcontract, and, no more frequently than annually, a listing of the subcontracts that have been awarded.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> The subcontractor will retain all rights provided for the Recipient in the clause under paragraph (g)(1)(i) or (g)(1)(ii) of this section, whichever is included in the subcontract, and the Recipient will not, as part of the consideration for awarding the subcontract, obtain rights in the subcontractor's subject inventions.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Notwithstanding paragraph (g)(4) of this section, and in recognition of the contractor's substantial contribution of funds, facilities and/or equipment to the work performed under this cooperative agreement, the Recipient is authorized, subject to the rights of NASA set forth elsewhere in this clause, to--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Acquire by negotiation and mutual agreement rights to a subcontractor's subject inventions as the Recipient may deem necessary to obtaining and maintaining of such private support; and</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Request, in the event of inability to reach agreement pursuant to paragraph (g)(5)(i) of this section that NASA invoke exceptional circumstances as necessary pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) if the prospective subcontractor is a small business firm or organization, or for all other organizations, request that such rights for the Recipient be included as an additional reservation in a waiver granted pursuant to 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1. Any such requests to NASA should be prepared in consideration of the following guidance and submitted to the contract office:</p><p class="depth4"><em>(A)</em> Exceptional circumstances. A request that NASA make an ``exceptional circumstances'' determination pursuant to 37 CFR 401.3(a)(2) must state the scope of rights sought by the Recipient pursuant to such determination; identify the proposed subcontractor and the work to be performed under the subcontract; and state the need for the determination.</p><p class="depth4"><em>(B)</em> Waiver petition. The subcontractor should be advised that unless it requests a waiver of title pursuant to the NASA Patent Waiver Regulations (14 CFR part 1245, subpart 1), NASA will acquire title to the subject invention (42 U.S.C. 2457, as amended, sec. 305). If a waiver is not requested or granted, the Recipient may request a license from NASA (see licensing of NASA inventions, 14 CFR part 1245, subpart 3). A subcontractor requesting a waiver must follow the procedures set forth in the REQUESTS FOR WAIVER OF RIGHTS--LARGE BUSINESS provision.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(h)</em> Reporting on utilization of subject inventions. The Recipient agrees to submit, on request, periodic reports no more frequently than annually on the utilization of a subject invention or on efforts at obtaining such utilization that are being made by the Recipient or its licensees or assignees. Such reports shall include information regarding the status of development, date of first commercial sale or use, gross royalties received by the Recipient, and such other data and information as the agency may reasonably specify. The Recipient also agrees to provide additional reports as may be requested by the agency in connection with any march-in proceeding under-taken by the agency in accordance with paragraph (i) of this section. As required by 35 U.S.C. 202(c)(5), the agency agrees it will not disclose such information to persons outside the Government without permission of the Recipient.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(i)</em> Preference for United States manufacture. The Recipient agrees that any products embodying subject inventions or produced through the use of subject inventions shall be manufactured substantially in the United States. However, in individual cases, the requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States may be waived by the Assistant Administrator for Procurement (Code HS) with the concurrence of the Associate General Counsel for Intellectual Property upon a showing by the Recipient that under the circumstances domestic manufacture is not commercially feasible.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(j)</em> March-in rights. The Recipient agrees that, with respect to any subject invention in which it has acquired title, NASA has the right in accordance with the procedures in 37 CFR 401.6 and any supplemental regulations of the agency to require the Recipient, an assignee or exclusive licensee of a subject invention to grant a nonexclusive, partially exclusive, or exclusive license in any field of use to a responsible applicant or applicants, upon terms that are reasonable under the circumstances, and if the Subcontractor, assignee, or exclusive licensee refuses such a request NASA has the right to grant such a license itself if the Federal agency determines that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Such action is necessary because the Recipient or assignee has not taken, or is not expected to take within a reasonable time, effective steps to achieve practical application of the subject invention in such field of use;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Such action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs which are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or their licensees;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Such action is necessary to meet requirements for public use specified by Federal regulations and such requirements are not reasonably satisfied by the Recipient, assignee, or licensees; or</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Such action is necessary because the agreement required by paragraph (i) of this section has not been obtained or waived or because a licensee of the exclusive right to use or sell any subject invention in the United States is in breach of such agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(k)</em> Special provisions for Agreements with nonprofit organizations. If the Recipient is a nonprofit organization, it agrees that--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Rights to a subject invention in the United States may not be assigned without the approval of NASA, except where such assignment is made to an organization which has one of its primary functions the management of inventions; provided, that such assignee will be subject to the same provisions as the Recipient;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> The Recipient will share royalties collected on a subject invention with the inventor, including Federal employee co-inventors (when NASA deems it appropriate) when the subject invention is assigned in accordance with 35 U.S.C. 202(e) and 37 CFR 401.10;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> The balance of any royalties or income earned by the Recipient with respect to subject inventions, after payment of expenses (including payments to inventors) incidental to the administration of subject inventions will be utilized for the support of scientific research or education; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> It will make efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to attract licensees of subject inventions that are small business firms, and that it will give a preference to a small business firm when licensing a subject invention if the Recipient determines that the small business firm has a plan or proposal for marketing the invention which, if executed, is equally as likely to bring the invention to practical application as any plans or proposals from applicants that are not small business firms; provided that the Recipient is also satisfied that the small business firm has the capability and resources to carry out its plan or proposal. The decision whether to give a preference in any specific case will be at the discretion of the Recipient. However, the Recipient agrees that the Secretary of Commerce may review the Contractor's licensing program and decisions regarding small business applicants, and the Recipient will negotiate changes to its licensing policies, procedures, or practices with the Secretary of Commerce when the Secretary's review discloses that the Recipient could take reasonable steps to more effectively implement the requirements of this paragraph.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(l)</em> Documentation submissions. A copy of all submissions or requests required by this clause, plus a copy of any reports, manuscripts, publications, or similar material bearing on patent matters, shall be sent to the installation Patent Counsel in addition to any other submission requirements in the cooperative agreement. If any reports contain information describing a ``subject invention'' for which the Recipient has elected or may elect title, NASA will use reasonable efforts to delay public release by NASA or publication by NASA in a NASA technical series, in order for a patent application to be filed, provided that the Recipient identify the information and the ``subject invention'' to which it relates at the time of submittal. If required by the Agreement Officer, the Recipient shall provide the filing date, serial number and title, a copy of the patent application, and a patent number and issue date for any ``subject invention'' in any country in which the Recipient has applied for patents.</p><p class="depth2">[End of provision]</p>
