                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Part 817 of this chapter, Permanent Program Performance  Standards--Underground Mining Activities, as modified by paragraphs (b)- (f) of this section, shall apply to any person who conducts underground  mining activities in the State of Tennessee.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> The permittee shall comply with the site-specific terms of the  permit except that references to provisions of the Tennessee State  program shall be   read to require compliance with the relevant provisions of this part.  Where the permit does not specify site-specific standards with which  compliance is required, the permittee shall comply with the standards of  this part.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Diversions. In lieu of the requirements of Sec. 817.43(a)(4) of  this chapter diversion design shall incorporate the following  requirements:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Channel lining shall be designed using standards engineering  practices to pass safely the design velocities. Riprap shall comply with  the requirements of Sec. 817.71(f)(3) of this chapter, except for sand  and gravel.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Freeboard shall be no less than 0.3 feet. Protection shall be  provided for transition of flows and for critical areas such as swales  and curves. Where the area protected is a critical area as determined by  the Office, the design freeboard may be increased.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Energy dissipators shall be installed when necessary at  discharge points, where diversions intersect with natural streams and  exit velocity of the diversion ditch flow is greater than that of the  receiving stream.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Excess excavated material not utilized in diversion channel  geometry or regrading of the channel shall be disposed of in accordance  with Sec. Sec. 817.71 through 817.74 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Hydrologic balance: Siltation structures. In lieu of the  requirements of Sec. 817.46(c)(1)(ii)(A) of this chapter, sedimentation  ponds shall provide a storage volume of no less than 0.2 acre feet per  distributed acre draining into the basin. The Office may approve less  sediment storage volumes equal to the sediment calculated to enter the  pond between planned cleanout intervals upon submission and approval of  a plan for removing sediment from the pond which includes a description  of the equipment to be used. The minimum sediment storage volume shall  be equal to 0.1 acre feet per disturbed acre.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> In lieu of the requirements of Sec. 817.116 (b)(1) through  (b)(3) of this chapter, the following revegetation success standards and  sampling techniques shall be used by this Office.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> For areas developed for use as pasture or hay production, the  ground cover shall be at least ninety percent (90%) and crop production  shall be equal to or greater than the average county yield as stated by  the Tennessee Crop Reporting Service for the county in which the permit  area is located.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> For areas developed for use as cropland, crop production shall  be equal to or greater than the average county yield as stated by the  Tennessee Crop Reporting Service for the county in which the permit area  is located. Adjustment for local yield variation within the county may  be made for disease, pests, weather-induced variations, and differences  in crop management practices.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> For areas developed for wildlife habitat, undeveloped land,  recreation, or forestry, the stocking of woody plants must be at least  equal to the rates specified in the approved reclamation plan. To  minimize competition with woody plants, herbaceous ground cover should  be limited to that necessary to control erosion and support the  postmining land use. Seed mixes and seeding rates will be specified in  the permit.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Minimum stocking levels and planting arrangements shall be  specified by the Office on the basis of local and regional conditions  and after consultation with the State agencies responsible for the  administration of forestry and wildlife programs.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Trees and shrubs that will be used in determining the success  of stocking and the adequacy of plant arrangement shall have utility for  the approved postmining land use. At the time of bond release, such  trees and shrubs shall be healthy, and at least eighty percent (80%)  shall have been in place for at least three growing seasons. No trees  and shrubs in place for less than two growing seasons shall be counted  in determining stocking adequacy.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Vegetative ground cover shall not be less than that required  to achieve the approved postmining land use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Bare areas shall not exceed one-sixteenth (1/16) acre in size  and total not more than ten percent (10%) of the area seeded, except for  areas developed for wildlife habitat, undeveloped land, recreation, or  forestry.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> Distribution of woody plants within the permit area shall be  consistent with the post-mining land use.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> Sampling techniques for measuring woody plant stocking and  ground cover shall be in accordance with techniques approved by the  Office. Actual crop yields shall be used to determine production.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Roads. In lieu of the requirements of Sec. 817.150(c) of this  chapter, roads shall be designed and constructed or reconstructed in  compliance with the following standards in order to control subsequent  erosion and disturbance of the hydrologic balance.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Primary roads. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Except for existing roads and where lesser  grades are necessary to control site-specific conditions, the overall  grade shall not exceed lv:10h (10 percent), the maximum pitch grade  shall not exceed lv:6.5h (15 percent), and there shall be not more than  three hundred (300) feet of pitch grade exceeding ten (10) percent  within any consecutive one thousand (1,000) feet of primary roads. In no  case shall there be any pitch grade over fifteen (15) percent.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Culvert spacing shall not exceed one thousand (1,000) feet on  grades of zero (0) to three (3) percent, eight hundred (800) feet on  grades of three (3) to six (6) percent, and five hundred (500) feet on  grades of six (6) to ten (10) percent, and three hundred (300) feet on  grades of ten (10) percent or greater. Culverts shall be installed at  closer intervals than the maximum in this part if required by the Office  as appropriate for the erosive properties of the soil or to accommodate  flow from small intersecting drainages. Culverts may be constructed at  greater intervals than the maximum indicated in this part if approved by  the Office upon a finding that greater spacing will not increase  erosion.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Culverts shall be covered by compacted fill to a minimum depth  of one foot.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Ancillary roads. </p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Field design methods may be utilized for  ancillary roads.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Where lesser grades are necessary to control site-specific  condition, overall grade shall not exceed lv:10h (10 percent). Pitch  grade shall not exceed 1v:5h (20 percent). There shall not be more than  one thousand (1,000) consecutive feet of maximum pitch grade.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Ancillary roads may meander so as to avoid large growths of  vegetation and other natural obstructions.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Compaction on road embankments shall be only to the exten  necessary to control erosion and maintain the road.</p><p class="depth3"><em>(v)</em> Temporary culverts and bridges shall be sized to safely pass the  one (1) year, six (6) hour precipitation event.
