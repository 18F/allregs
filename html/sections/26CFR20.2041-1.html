                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Introduction. A decedent's gross estate includes under section  2041 the value of property in respect of which the decedent possessed,  exercised, or released certain powers of appointment. This section  contains rules of general application; Sec. 20.2041-2 contains rules  specifically applicable to general powers of appointment created on or  before October 21, 1942; and Sec. 20.2041-3 sets forth specific rules  applicable to powers of appointment created after October 21, 1942.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definition of ``power of appointment''--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In general. The term  ``power of appointment'' includes all powers which are in substance and  effect powers of appointment regardless of the nomenclature used in  creating the power and regardless of local property law connotations.  For example, if a trust instrument provides that the beneficiary may  appropriate or consume the principal of the trust, the power to consume  or appropriate is a power of appointment. Similarly, a power given to a  decedent to affect the beneficial enjoyment of trust property or its  income by altering, amending, or revoking the trust instrument or  terminating the trust is a power of appointment. If the community  property laws of a State confer upon the wife a power of testamentary  disposition over property in which she does not have a vested interest  she is considered as having a power of appointment. A power in a donee  to remove or discharge a trustee and appoint himself may be a power of  appointment. For example, if under the terms of a trust instrument, the  trustee or his successor has the power to appoint the principal of the  trust for the benefit of individuals including himself, and the decedent  has the unrestricted power to remove or discharge the trustee at any  time and appoint any other person including himself, the decedent is  considered as having a power of appointment. However, the decedent is  not considered to have a power of appointment if he only had the power  to appoint a successor, including himself, under limited conditions  which did not exist at the time of his death, without an accompanying  unrestricted power of removal. Similarly, a power to amend only the  administrative provisions of a trust instrument, which cannot  substantially affect the beneficial enjoyment of the trust property or  income, is not a power of appointment. The mere power of management,  investment, custody of assets, or the power to allocate receipts and  disbursements as between income and principal, exercisable in a  fiduciary capacity, whereby the holder has no power to enlarge or shift  any of the beneficial interests therein except as an incidental  consequence of the discharge of such fiduciary duties is not a power of  appointment. Further, the right in a beneficiary of a trust to assent to  a periodic accounting, thereby relieving the trustee from further  accountability, is not a power of appointment if the right of assent  does not consist of any power or right to enlarge or shift the  beneficial interest of any beneficiary therein.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Relation to other sections. For purposes of Sec. Sec. 20.2041-1  to 20.2041-3, the term ``power of appointment'' does not   include powers reserved by the decedent to himself within the concept of  sections 2036 through 2038. (See Sec. Sec. 20.2036-1 to 20.2038-1.) No  provision of section 2041 or of Sec. Sec. 20.2041-1 to 20.2041-3 is to  be construed as in any way limiting the application of any other section  of the Internal Revenue Code or of these regulations. The power of the  owner of a property interest already possessed by him to dispose of his  interest, and nothing more, is not a power of appointment, and the  interest is includable in his gross estate to the extent it would be  includable under section 2033 or some other provision of Part III of  Subchapter A of Chapter 11. For example, if a trust created by S  provides for payment of the income to A for life with power in A to  appoint the remainder by will and, in default of such appointment for  payment of the income to A's widow, W, for her life and for payment of  the remainder to A's estate, the value of A's interest in the remainder  is includable in his gross estate under section 2033 regardless of its  includability under section 2041.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Powers over a portion of property. If a power of appointment  exists as to part of an entire group of assets or only over a limited  interest in property, section 2041 applies only to such part or  interest. For example, if a trust created by S provides for the payment  of income to A for life, then to W for life, with power in A to appoint  the remainder by will and in default of appointment for payment of the  remainder to B or his estate, and if A dies before W, section 2041  applies only to the value of the remainder interest excluding W's life  estate. If A dies after W, section 2041 would apply to the value of the  entire property. If the power were only over one-half the remainder  interest, section 2041 would apply only to one-half the value of the  amounts described above.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Definition of ``general power of appointment''--(1) In general.  The term ``general power of appointment'' as defined in section  2041(b)(1) means any power of appointment exercisable in favor of the  decedent, his estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his estate,  except (i) joint powers, to the extent provided in Sec. Sec. 20.2041-2  and 20.2041-3, and (ii) certain powers limited by an ascertainable  standard, to the extent provided in subparagraph (2) of this paragraph.  A power of appointment exercisable to meet the estate tax, or any other  taxes, debts, or charges which are enforceable against the estate, is  included within the meaning of a power of appointment exercisable in  favor of the decedent's estate, his creditors, or the creditors of his  estate. A power of appointment exercisable for the purpose of  discharging a legal obligation of the decedent or for his pecuniary  benefit is considered a power of appointment exercisable in favor of the  decedent or his creditors. However, for purposes of Sec. Sec. 20.2041-1  to 20.2041-3, a power of appointment not otherwise considered to be a  general power of appointment is not treated as a general power of  appointment merely by reason of the fact that an appointee may, in fact,  be a creditor of the decedent or his estate. A power of appointment is  not a general power if by its terms it is either--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Exercisable only in favor of one or more designated persons or  classes other than the decedent or his creditors, or the decedent's  estate or the creditors of his estate, or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Expressly not exercisable in favor of the decedent or his  creditors, or the decedent's estate or the creditors of his estate.  A decedent may have two powers under the same instrument, one of which  is a general power of appointment and the other of which is not. For  example, a beneficiary may have a power to withdraw trust corpus during  his life, and a testamentary power to appoint the corpus among his  descendants. The testamentary power is not a general power of  appointment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Powers limited by an ascertainable standard. A power to consume,  invade, or appropriate income or corpus, or both, for the benefit of the  decedent which is limited by an ascertainable standard relating to the  health, education, support, or maintenance of the decedent is, by reason  of section 2041(b)(1)(A), not a general power of appointment. A power is  limited by such a standard if the extent of the holder's duty to  exercise and not to exercise the power is reasonably measurable in   terms of his needs for health, education, or support (or any combination  of them). As used in this subparagraph, the words ``support'' and  ``maintenance'' are synonymous and their meaning is not limited to the  bare necessities of life. A power to use property for the comfort,  welfare, or happiness of the holder of the power is not limited by the  requisite standard. Examples of powers which are limited by the  requisite standard are powers exercisable for the holder's ``support,''  ``support in reasonable comfort,'' ``maintenance in health and  reasonable comfort,'' ``support in his accustomed manner of living,''  ``education, including college and professional education,'' ``health,''  and ``medical, dental, hospital and nursing expenses and expenses of  invalidism.'' In determining whether a power is limited by an  ascertainable standard, it is immaterial whether the beneficiary is  required to exhaust his other income before the power can be exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Certain powers under wills of decedents dying between January 1  and April 2, 1948. Section 210 of the Technical Changes Act of 1953  provides that if a decedent died after December 31, 1947, but before  April 3, 1948, certain property interests described therein may, if the  decedent's surviving spouse so elects, be accorded special treatment in  the determination of the marital deduction to be allowed the decedent's  estate under the provisions of section 812(e) of the Internal Revenue  Code of 1939. See Sec. 81.47a (h) of Regulations 105 (26 CFR (1939)  81.47a(h)). The section further provides that property affected by the  election shall, for the purpose of inclusion in the surviving spouse's  gross estate, be considered property with respect to which she has a  general power of appointment. Therefore, notwithstanding any other  provision of law or of Sec. Sec. 20.2041-1 to 20.2041-3, if the present  decedent (in her capacity as surviving spouse of a prior decedent) has  made an election under section 210 of the Technical Changes Act of 1953,  the property which was the subject of the election shall be considered  as property with respect to which the present decedent has a general  power of appointment created after October 21, 1942, exercisable by deed  or will, to the extent it was treated as an interest passing to the  surviving spouse and not passing to any other person for the purpose of  the marital deduction in the prior decedent's estate.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Definition of ``exercise''. Whether a power of appointment is in  fact exercised may depend upon local law. For example, the residuary  clause of a will may be considered under local law as an exercise of a  testamentary power of appointment in the absence of evidence of a  contrary intention drawn from the whole of the testator's will. However,  regardless of local law, a power of appointment is considered as  exercised for purposes of section 2041 even though the exercise is in  favor of the taker in default of appointment, and irrespective of  whether the appointed interest and the interest in default of  appointment are identical or whether the appointee renounces any right  to take under the appointment. A power of appointment is also considered  as exercised even though the disposition cannot take effect until the  occurrence of an event after the exercise takes place, if the exercise  is irrevocable and, as of the time of the exercise, the condition was  not impossible of occurrence. For example, if property is left in trust  to A for life, with a power in B to appoint the remainder by will, and B  dies before A, exercising his power by appointing the remainder to C if  C survives A, B is considered to have exercised his power if C is living  at B's death. On the other hand, a testamentary power of appointment is  not considered as exercised if it is exercised subject to the occurrence  during the decedent's life of an express or implied condition which did  not in fact occur. Thus, if in the preceding example, C dies before B,  B's power of appointment would not be considered to have been exercised.  Similarly, if a trust provides for income to A for life, remainder as A  appoints by will, and A appoints a life estate in the property to B and  does not otherwise exercise his power, but B dies before A, A's power is  not considered to have been exercised.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Time of creation of power. A power of appointment created by  will is, in general, considered as created on the date of the testator's  death. However, section 2041(b)(3) provides that a power   of appointment created by a will executed on or before October 21, 1942,  is considered a power created on or before that date if the testator  dies before July 1, 1949, without having republished the will, by  codicil or otherwise, after October 21, 1942. A power of appointment  created by an inter vivos instrument is considered as created on the  date the instrument takes effect. Such a power is not considered as  created at some future date merely because it is not exercisable on the  date the instrument takes effect, or because it is revocable, or because  the identity of its holders is not ascertainable until after the date  the instrument takes effect. However, if the holder of a power exercises  it by creating a second power, the second power is considered as created  at the time of the exercise of the first. The application of this  paragraph may be illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class="depth0">Example (1). A created a revocable trust before October 22, 1942,  providing for payment of income to B for life with remainder as B shall  appoint by will. Even though A dies after October 21, 1942, without  having exercised his power of revocation, B's power of appointment is  considered a power created before October 22, 1942.</p><p class="depth0">Example (2). C created an irrevocable inter vivos trust before  October 22, 1942, naming T as trustee and providing for payment of  income to D for life with remainder to E. T was given the power to pay  corpus to D and the power to appoint a successor trustee. If T resigns  after October 21, 1942, and appoints D as successor trustee, D is  considered to have a power of appointment created before October 22,  1942.</p><p class="depth0">Example (3). F created an irrevocable inter vivos trust before  October 22, 1942, providing for payment of income to G for life with  remainder as G shall appoint by will, but in default of appointment  income to H for life with remainder as H shall appoint by will. If G  died after October 21, 1942, without having exercised his power of  appointment, H's power of appointment is considered a power created  before October 22, 1942, even though it was only a contingent interest  until G's death.</p><p class="depth0">Example (4). If in example (3) above G had exercised his power of  appointment by creating a similar power in J, J's power of appointment  would be considered a power created after October 21, 1942.
