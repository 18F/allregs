The purpose of this procedure is to determine the chemical compatibility and permeability of liquid hazardous materials packaged in plastic packaging and receptacles. Alternatives for this procedure are permitted as specified in Sec. 173.24(e)(3)(iii) of this subchapter.</p><p class="depth0">2. Compatibility and rate of permeation are determined by subjecting full size plastic containers (or smaller containers as permitted in paragraph 4 of this appendix) and hazardous material lading to one of the following combinations of time and temperature:</p><p class="depth0">a. Test Method 1: 180 days at a temperature no lower than 18 C. (64 F.)</p><p class="depth0">b. Test Method 2: 28 days at a temperature no lower than 50 C. (122 F.)</p><p class="depth0">c. Test Method 3: 14 days at a temperature no lower than 60 C. (140 F.)</p><p class="depth0">3. Regardless of which test method is used, at least three sample containers shall be tested for each combination of hazardous material and size and design of container. Fill containers to rated capacity with the specific hazardous material (at the concentration to be transported) and close as for shipment. For the first and last 24 hours of storage under the selected test method, place the containers with closures downward, except that containers fitted with a vent are so

placed on each occasion for five minutes only.</p><p class="depth0">4. For testing under Test Method 2 or 3 in those instances where it is not practicable to use full size containers, smaller containers may be used. The small container shall be manufactured by the same process as the larger container (for example, using the same method of molding and processing temperatures) and be made of identical resins, pigments and additives.</p><p class="depth0">5. Determine filled container weight or net weight of contents both before and after storage under the selected test method. Rate of permeation is determined from loss of hazardous materials contents, during the conduct of the test, expressed as a percentage of the original weight.</p><p class="depth0">6. After storage under the selected test method, the container shall be drained, rinsed, filled to rated capacity with water and, with filled container at ambient temperature, dropped from a height determined in accordance with Sec. 178.603(e) of this subchapter onto a rigid non-resilient, flat and horizontal surface.</p><p class="depth0">7. Each of the following constitute test failure:</p><p class="depth0">a. Visible evidence of permanent deformation due to vapor pressure build-up or collapse of walls, deterioration, swelling, crazing, cracking, excessive corrosion, oxidization, embrittlement, leakage, rupture or other defects likely to cause premature failure or a hazardous condition.</p><p class="depth0">b. For materials meeting the definition of a poison according to this subchapter, a rate of permeation in excess of 0.5% determined over the test period. For all other hazardous materials, a rate of permeation in excess of 2.0% determined over the test period.

Three sample packagings, selected at random, must be filled and closed as for shipment. A non-hazardous material may be used in place of the hazardous material if it has essentially the same physical characteristics.</p><p class="depth0">2. The three packages must be placed on a vibrating platform that has a vertical double-amplitude (peak-to-peak displacement) of one inch. The packages should be constrained horizontally to prevent them from falling off the platform, but must be left free to move vertically, bounce and rotate.</p><p class="depth0">3. The test must be performed continuously for one hour at a frequency that causes each package to be raised from the vibrating platform to such a degree that a piece of material of approximately 1.6 mm (0.063 inch) thickness (such as steel strapping or paperboard) can be passed between the bottom of any package and the platform.</p><p class="depth0">4. Immediately following the period of vibration, each package shall be removed from the platform, turned on its side and observed for any evidence of leakage.</p><p class="depth0">5. Rupture or leakage from any of the packages constitutes failure of the test.

Method</p><p class="depth0">The method describes a procedure for determining if the material when heated under the test conditions and exposed to an external source of flame applied in a standard manner sustains combustion.</p><p class="depth0">2. Principle of the method</p><p class="depth0">A metal block with a concave depression (test portion well) is heated to a specified temperature. A specified volume of the material under test is transferred to the well, and its ability to sustain combustion is noted after application and subsequent removal of a standard flame under specified conditions.</p><p class="depth0">3. Apparatus</p><p class="depth0">A combustibility tester consisting of a block of aluminum alloy or other corrosion-resistant metal of high thermal conductivity is used. The block has a concave well and a pocket drilled to take a thermometer. A small gas jet assembly on a swivel is attached to the block. The handle and gas inlet for the gas jet may be fitted at any convenient angle to the gas jet. A suitable apparatus is shown in Figure 32.5.2.1 of the UN Manual of Test and Criteria (IBR, see (171.7 of this subchapter), and the essential dimensions are given in Figures 32.5.2.1 and 32.5.2.2

of the UN Manual and Tests and Criteria. The following equipment is needed:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Gauge, for checking that the height of the center of the gas jet above the top of the test portion well is 2.2 mm (see Figure 32.5.2.1);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Thermometer, mercury in glass, for horizontal operation, with a sensitivity not less than 1 mm/ C, or other measuring device of equivalent sensitivity permitting reading at 0.5 C intervals. When in position in the block, the thermometer bulb must be surrounded with thermally conducting thermoplastic compound;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Hotplate, fitted with a temperature-control device. (Other types of apparatus with suitable temperature-control facilities may be employed to heat the metal block);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Stopwatch, or other suitable timing device;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Syringe, capable of delivering 2 mL to an accuracy of [0.1 mL; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> Fuel source, butane test fuel.</p><p class="depth0">4. Sampling</p><p class="depth0">The sample must be representative of the material to be tested and must be supplied and kept in a tightly closed container prior to test. Because of the possibility of loss of volatile constituents, the sample must receive only the minimum treatment necessary to ensure its homogeneity. After removing each test portion, the sample container must be immediately closed tightly to ensure that no volatile components escape from the container; if this closure is incomplete, an entirely new sample must be taken.</p><p class="depth0">5. Procedure</p><p class="depth0">Carry out the determination in triplicate.</p><p class="depth0">WARNING--Do not carry out the test in a small confined area (for example a glove box) because of the hazard of explosions.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> It is essential that the apparatus be set up in a completely draft-free area (see warning) and in the absence of strong light to facilitate observation of flash, flame, etc.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Place the metal block on the hotplate or heat the metal block by other suitable means so that its temperature, as indicated by the thermometer placed in the metal block, is maintained at the specified temperature within a tolerance of [1 C. For the appropriate test temperature, see paragraph 5.(h) of this appendix. Correct this temperature for the difference in barometric pressure from the standard atmospheric pressure (101.3 kPa) by raising the test temperature for a higher pressure or lowering the test temperature for a lower pressure by 1.0 C for each 4 kPa difference. Ensure that the top of the metal block is exactly horizontal. Use the gauge to check that the jet is 2.2 mm above the top of the well when in the test position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Light the butane test fuel with the jet away from the test position (i.e. in the ``off'' position, away from the well). Adjust the size of the flame so that it is 8 mm to 9 mm high and approximately 5 mm wide.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Using the syringe, take from the sample container at least 2 mL of the sample and rapidly transfer a test portion of 2 mL [0.1 mL to the well of the combustibility tester and immediately start the timing device.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> After a heating time of 60 seconds (s), by which time the test portion is deemed to have reached its equilibrium temperature, and if the test fluid has not ignited, swing the test flame into the test position over the edge of the pool of liquid. Maintain it in this position for 15 s and then return it to the ``off'' position while observing the behavior of the test portion. The test flame must remain lighted throughout the test.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> For each test observe and record:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> whether there is ignition and sustained combustion or flashing, or neither, of the test portion before the test flame is moved into the test position;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> whether the test portion ignites while the test flame is in the test position, and, if so, how long combustion is sustained after the test flame is returned to the ``off'' position.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> If sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with paragraph 6. of this appendix is not found, repeat the complete procedure with new test portions, but with a heating time of 30 s.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> If sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with paragraph 6. of this appendix is not found at a test temperature of 60 C (140 F), repeat the complete procedure with new test portions, but at a test temperature of 75 C (167 F). In the case of a material which has a flash point above 60 C (140 F) and below 93 C (200 F), if sustained combustion interpreted in accordance with paragraph 6. of this appendix is not found at a test temperature of 5 C (9 F) above its flash point, repeat the complete procedure with new test portions, but at a test temperature of 20 C (36 F) above its flash point.</p><p class="depth0">6. Interpretation of observations</p><p class="depth0">The material must be assessed either as not sustaining combustion or as sustaining combustion. Sustained combustion must be reported at either of the heating times if one of the following occurs with either of the test portions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> When the test flame is in the ``off'' position, the test portion ignites and sustains combustion;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> The test portion ignites while the test flame is in the test position for 15 s, and sustains combustion for more than 15 s after the test flame has been returned to the ``off'' position.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph 6 of this appendix: Intermittent flashing may not be interpreted as sustained combustion. Normally, at the end of 15 s, the combustion has either clearly ceased or continues. In cases of doubt, the material must be deemed to sustain combustion.
