                            </h3>
                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> General. (1) For the purpose of determining hours of overtime work outside an agent's regular tour of duty in order to apply Sec. Sec. 550.1624, 550.1625, and 550.1626, CBP must apply the applicable biweekly overtime threshold prescribed in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section. An agent's total hours of work (as determined under paragraph (a)(2) of this section) must be compared to the applicable threshold, and hours in excess of that threshold are overtime hours in applying Sec. Sec. 550.1624, 550.1625, and 550.1626. The 8-hour daily and 40-hour weekly overtime thresholds under 5 U.S.C. 5542(a) and Sec. 550.111 are not applicable to agents.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> An agent's total hours of work in a pay period for the purpose of applying applicable overtime thresholds is equal to the sum of:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Time determined to be hours of work in duty status (regular time or overtime), subject to this subpart, 5 U.S.C. 4109 and 5 CFR 410.402 (related to training periods), and 5 U.S.C. 5542(b) and Sec. 550.112 (establishing general rules), except that paragraphs (d) and (e) of Sec. 550.112 are superseded by Sec. 550.1626;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Paid leave or other paid time off during a period of nonduty status within an agent's regular time;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Obligated overtime hours during which no work is performed (creating a debt of hours) and for which no substitution is made under Sec. 550.1626(b);</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> Nonwork hours deemed to be hours of work during obligated overtime hours on a day of advanced training under Sec. 550.1622(b); and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> Overtime hours normally scheduled within an agent's regular tour of duty that an agent is not obligated to work because the agent performs no work during regular time on that day (as provided in paragraphs (a)(3) and (b)(3) of Sec. 550.1621).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Overtime thresholds for standard tours. (1) The applicable biweekly overtime threshold prescribed in paragraph (b)(2) of this section applies during a pay period to an agent whose regular tour of duty is fixed at one of the three standard tours for the entire pay period. (2) For an agent covered by paragraph (b)(1) of this section, the threshold used to determine whether an agent has performed overtime work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is--</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> 100 hours for a Level 1 regular tour of duty;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> 90 hours for a Level 2 regular tour of duty; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> 80 hours for a Basic regular tour of duty.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Overtime threshold for hybrid pay period. (1) For a hybrid pay period in which an agent has one type of regular tour of duty in effect for one part of the period and another type for another part of the period, the threshold used to determine whether an agent has performed overtime work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is equal to the sum of the regular time hours (paid or unpaid) and the number of normally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty (whether obligated or not and whether worked or not) in the pay period. For example, if an agent has a Level 1 regular tour of duty in the first week of a pay period and a Level 2 regular tour of duty in the second week, the agent's regular time hours would be 40 in the first week and 40 in the second week and the normally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty would be 10 (5 days times 2 hours each day) in the first week and 5 (5 days times 1 hour each day) in second week, resulting in an biweekly overtime threshold of 95 hours.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> For a hybrid pay period in which an individual is employed as a Border Patrol agent for only part of the pay period, the threshold used to determine

whether an agent has performed overtime work outside the regular tour of duty in a given pay period is equal to the sum of the paid regular time hours (paid or unpaid) and the number of normally scheduled overtime hours within a regular tour of duty (whether obligated or not and whether worked or not) during the portion of the pay period the individual was employed as an agent. For example, if an individual is employed as an agent only during the second week of a pay period and has a Level 1 regular tour of duty, the overtime threshold would be 50 hours (40 regular time hours plus 10 normally scheduled overtime hours) in determining whether the agent has overtime hours in that week that are compensable under Sec. Sec. 550.1624, 550.1625, and 550.1626.</p>
