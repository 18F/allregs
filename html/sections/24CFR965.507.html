                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Annual review. The PHA shall review at least annually the basis  on which utility allowances have been established and, if reasonably  required in order to continue adherence to the standards stated in Sec.  965.505, shall establish revised allowances. The review shall include  all changes in circumstances (including completion of modernization and/ or other energy conservation measures implemented by the PHA) indicating  probability of a significant change in reasonable consumption  requirements and changes in utility rates.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Revision as a result of rate changes. The PHA may revise its  allowances for resident-purchased utilities between annual reviews if  there is a rate change (including fuel adjustments) and shall be  required to do so if such change, by itself or together with prior rate  changes not adjusted for, results in a change of 10 percent or more from  the rates on which such allowances were based. Adjustments to resident  payments as a result of such changes shall be retroactive to the first  day of the month following the month in which the last rate change taken  into account in such revision became effective. Such rate changes shall  not be subject to the 60 day notice requirement of Sec. 965.502(c).</p>
