Habitat development and restoration techniques can be used to minimize adverse impacts and to compensate for destroyed habitat. Additional criteria for compensation measures are provided in subpart J of this part. Use techniques that have been demonstrated to be effective in circumstances similar to those under consideration wherever possible. Where proposed development and restoration techniques have not

yet advanced to the pilot demonstration stage, initiate their use on a small scale to allow corrective action if unanticipated adverse impacts occur;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Timing discharge to avoid spawning or migration seasons and other biologically critical time periods;</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Avoiding the destruction of remnant natural sites within areas already affected by development.
