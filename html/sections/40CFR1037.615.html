                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> This section applies for hybrid vehicles with regenerative braking, vehicles equipped with Rankine-cycle engines, electric vehicles, and fuel cell vehicles. You may not generate credits for engine features for which the engines generate credits under 40 CFR part 1036.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Generate advanced technology emission credits for hybrid vehicles that include regenerative braking (or the equivalent) and energy storage systems, fuel cell vehicles, and vehicles equipped with Rankine-cycle engines as follows:</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Measure the effectiveness of the advanced system by chassis testing a vehicle equipped with the advanced system and an equivalent conventional vehicle, or by testing the hybrid systems and the equivalent non-hybrid systems as described in Sec.  1037.550. Test the vehicles as specified in subpart F of this part. For purposes of this paragraph (b), a conventional vehicle is considered to be equivalent if it has the same footprint (as defined in 40 CFR 86.1803), vehicle service class, aerodynamic drag, and other relevant factors not directly related to the hybrid powertrain. If you use Sec.  1037.525 to quantify the benefits of a hybrid system for PTO operation, the conventional vehicle must have the same number of PTO circuits and have equivalent PTO power. If you do not produce an equivalent vehicle, you may create and test a prototype equivalent vehicle. The conventional vehicle is considered Vehicle A and the advanced vehicle is considered Vehicle B. We may specify an alternate cycle if your vehicle includes a power take-off.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Calculate an improvement factor and g/ton-mile benefit using the following equations and parameters:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Improvement Factor = [(Emission Rate A) - (Emission Rate B)] / (Emission Rate A)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> g/ton-mile benefit = Improvement Factor x (GEM Result B)</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Emission Rates A and B are the g/ton-mile CO2 emission rates of the conventional and advanced vehicles, respectively, as measured under the test procedures specified in this section. GEM Result B is the g/ton-mile CO2 emission rate resulting from emission modeling of the advanced vehicle as specified in Sec.  1037.520.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> If you apply an improvement factor to multiple vehicle configurations using the same advanced technology, use the vehicle configuration with the smallest potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the hybrid capability.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> Use the equations of Sec.  1037.705 to convert the g/ton-mile benefit to emission credits (in Mg). Use the g/ton-mile benefit in place of the (Std-FEL) term.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> See Sec.  1037.525 for special testing provisions related to hybrid vehicles equipped with power take-off units.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> You may use an engineering analysis to calculate an improvement factor for fuel cell vehicles based on measured emissions from the fuel cell vehicle.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> For electric vehicles, calculate CO2 credits using an FEL of 0 g/ton-mile.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> As specified in subpart H of this part, credits generated under this section may be used under this part 1037 outside of the averaging set in which they were generated or used under 40 CFR part 1036.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> You may certify using both provisions of this section and the innovative technology provisions of Sec.  1037.610, provided you do not double count emission benefits.
