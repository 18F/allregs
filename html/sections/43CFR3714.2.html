The execution and acknowledgement of such a waiver and  relinquishment by such owner or owners and the recordation thereof in  the office where the notice or certificate of location of such mining  claim is of record shall render such mining claim thereafter and prior  to issuance of patent subject to the limitations and restrictions in  section 4 of this Act in all respects as if said mining claim had been  located after enactment of this act, but no such waiver or  relinquishment shall be deemed in any manner to constitute any  concession as to the date of priority of rights under said mining claim  or as to the validity thereof.</p>
