These  regulations may be enforced for the duration of each event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Notifications will be made to the local maritime community  through the Local Notice to Mariners well in advance of the events. If  the event does not have a date listed, then exact dates and times of the  enforcement period will be announced through a Notice of Enforcement in  the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">Note to paragraph (a): Although listed in the Code of Federal  Regulations, sponsors of events listed in the Table shall submit an  application each year in accordance with 33 CFR 100.15.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Definitions. The following definitions apply to this section:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Designated representative. A ``designated representative'' is  any Coast Guard commissioned, warrant or petty officer of the U.S. Coast  Guard who has been designated by the Captain of the Port, Southeastern  New England (COTP), to act on his or her behalf. The designated  representative may be on an official patrol vessel or may be on shore  and will communicate with vessels via VHF-FM radio or loudhailer. In  addition, members of the Coast Guard Auxiliary may be present to inform  vessel operators of this regulation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Official patrol vessels. Official patrol vessels may consist of  any Coast Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement  vessels assigned or approved by the COTP.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Spectators. All persons and vessels not registered with the  event sponsor as participants or official patrol vessels.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> The Coast Guard may patrol each event area under the direction  of a designated Coast Guard Patrol Commander. The Patrol Commander may  be contacted on Channel 16 VHF-FM (156.8 MHz) by the call sign  ``PATCOM.'' The ``official patrol vessels'' may consist of any Coast  Guard, Coast Guard Auxiliary, state, or local law enforcement vessels  assigned or approved by the Captain of the Port, Southeastern New  England.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(d)</em> Vessels may not transit the regulated areas without Patrol  Commander approval. Vessels permitted to transit must operate at a no  wake speed, in a manner which will not endanger participants or other  crafts in the event.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Spectators or other vessels shall not anchor, block, loiter, or  impede the movement of event participants or official patrol vessels in  the regulated areas during the effective dates and times, or dates and  times as modified through a Notice of Enforcement published in the  Federal Register, unless authorized by an official patrol vessel.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The Patrol Commander may control the movement of all vessels in  the regulated area. When hailed or signaled by an official patrol  vessel, a vessel shall come to an immediate stop and comply with the  lawful directions issued. Failure to comply with a lawful direction may  result in expulsion from the area, citation for failure to comply, or  both.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(g)</em> The Patrol Commander may delay or terminate any event in this  subpart at any time to ensure safety. Such action may be justified as a  result of weather, traffic density, spectator operation or participant  behavior.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> For all fireworks displays listed below, the regulated area is  that area of navigable waters within the specified radius of the launch  platform or launch site for each fireworks display, unless modified  later in a Notice of Enforcement published in the Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0">Table to Sec. 165.173 ------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p class="depth0">------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.0 365 DAY JANUARY-DECEMBER ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.1 Provincetown Fireworks........   Event Type: Fireworks Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: Enforced on any day during</p><p class="depth0">the duration of the event as</p><p class="depth0">specified by a Notice of</p><p class="depth0">Enforcement published in the</p><p class="depth0">Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: Approximately 5:00 p.m. to</p><p class="depth0">11:59 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: From a barge in the</p><p class="depth0">vicinity of the Provincetown</p><p class="depth0">Harbor, Provincetown, MA.</p><p class="depth0"> Position: Within 500 yards of</p><p class="depth0">412844" N, 0701083" W (NAD 83).</p><p class="depth0"> Safety Zone Dimension:</p><p class="depth0">Approximately 300 yard radius</p><p class="depth0">circle around the fireworks barge. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.2 Providence Fireworks..........   Event Type: Fireworks Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: Enforced on any day during</p><p class="depth0">the duration of the event as</p><p class="depth0">specified by a Notice of</p><p class="depth0">Enforcement published in the</p><p class="depth0">Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: Approximately 5:00 p.m. to</p><p class="depth0">11:59 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: From a barge in the</p><p class="depth0">vicinity of the Hurricane Barrier</p><p class="depth0">in the Providence River,</p><p class="depth0">Providence, RI.</p><p class="depth0"> Position: Within 500 yards of</p><p class="depth0">414850" N, 0712343" W (NAD 83).</p><p class="depth0"> Safety Zone Dimension:</p><p class="depth0">Approximately 300 yard radius</p><p class="depth0">circle around the fireworks barge. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 1.3 Fall River Fireworks..........   Event Type: Fireworks Display.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: Enforced on any day during</p><p class="depth0">the duration of the event as</p><p class="depth0">specified by a Notice of</p><p class="depth0">Enforcement published in the</p><p class="depth0">Federal Register.</p><p class="depth0"> Time: Approximately 5:00 p.m. to</p><p class="depth0">11:59 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: From a barge in the</p><p class="depth0">vicinity of Battleship Cove, Fall</p><p class="depth0">River, MA.</p><p class="depth0"> Position: Within 500 yards of</p><p class="depth0">414237" N, 0710953" W (NAD 83).</p><p class="depth0"> Safety Zone Dimension:</p><p class="depth0">Approximately 200 yard radius</p><p class="depth0">circle around the fireworks barge. ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 5.0 MAY ------------------------------------------------------------------------ 5.1 RI National Guard Air Show....   Event Type: Air Show.</p><p class="depth0"> Date: One weekend (Friday,</p><p class="depth0">Saturday, and Sunday) in May, June,</p><p class="depth0">or July, as announced in the local</p><p class="depth0">Notice to Mariners..</p><p class="depth0"> Time: Approximately 9:00 a.m. to</p><p class="depth0">7:00 p.m.</p><p class="depth0"> Location: (1) All waters over the</p><p class="depth0">West Passage of Narragansett Bay,</p><p class="depth0">in the vicinity of the Quonset</p><p class="depth0">State Airport, North Kingston, RI</p><p class="depth0">which are within a 4000-yard radius</p><p class="depth0">arc extending from position 413544"</p><p class="depth0">N, 0712414" W (NAD 83);
