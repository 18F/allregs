                            <p class="depth0">The Agency will develop, revise, suspend, or terminate grade  standards if it   determines that such action is in the public interest. Any  standardization action should reflect the broad interest of individuals  or an industry involved in manufacturing, producing, packaging,  distributing, testing, consuming, or using the product; or the interest  of a Federal, State, or local agency. Proposed actions should always be  based on sound technical and marketing information and should include  careful consideration of the factors that determine a commodity's  quality and condition and that will allow trained personnel to determine  objectively conformance or non-conformance.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> AMS encourages interested parties to participate in the review,  development, and revision of grade standards. Interested parties include  growers, producers, processors, shippers, distributors, consumers,  individuals or groups, trade associations, companies, and State or  Federal agencies. Such groups and individuals may at any time recommend  that AMS develop, revise suspend, or terminate a grade standard.  Requests for Agency action should be in writing, preferably accompanied  by a draft of the suggested change.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> The Agency, in cooperation with interested parties, as  applicable, will:</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Determine the need for new or revised standards;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> Collect technical, marketing, or other appropriate data;</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iii)</em> Conduct research regarding new or revised standards, as  appropriate; and,</p><p class="depth3"><em>(iv)</em> Draft the proposed standards;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> [Reserved]</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> If the Agency determines that new standards are needed, existing  standards need to be revised, or the suspension or termination of  existing standards is justified, it will undertake the action, with  input from all interested parties.</p>
