                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Establishment. The ``Yellow Ribbon G.I. Education Enhancement Program'', known as the ``Yellow Ribbon Program,'' permits an institution of higher learning (IHL), at the IHL's option, to enter into an agreement with VA to allow the two parties to provide matching funds to cover a portion of the outstanding amount of established charges not covered under 38 U.S.C. chapter 3313(c)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Eligible individuals. This program is only available to individuals entitled to the 100 percent educational assistance rate (based on service requirements) as shown in the chart in Sec. 21.9640(a) or to their designated dependents using entitlement transferred under Sec. 21.9570, who are pursuing training at an eligible IHL.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Eligible IHLs. This program is only available at IHLs located in the United States or at a branch of such IHL that is located outside the United States.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Agreements. VA will enter into an agreement with an eligible IHL located in the United States seeking to participate in the Yellow Ribbon Program based on a general agreement format developed by VA in which the IHL must agree to--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Provide contributions to eligible individuals who apply for such program at that institution (in a manner prescribed by the institution) on a first-come-first-served basis, regardless of the rate at which the individual is pursuing training (i.e., full-time versus less than full-time), during the academic year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Provide contributions during the current academic year and all subsequent academic years in which the IHL participates in the Yellow Ribbon Program and the student maintains satisfactory progress, conduct, and attendance according to the regularly prescribed standards of the institution;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Limit contributions made on behalf of a participant to funds under the unrestricted control of the IHL (e.g., a scholarship sent directly to an IHL on behalf of an individual or specific group of individuals from a third party may not be included in Yellow Ribbon Program contributions). Funds received directly or indirectly from Federal sources may not be counted toward contributions;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(4)</em> State the maximum number of individuals for whom contributions will be made during the academic year;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(5)</em> State the manner (whether by direct grant, scholarship, or otherwise) contributions will be made under the Yellow Ribbon Program;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(6)</em> State the maximum dollar amount of contributions that may be provided on behalf of any particular individual during the academic year regardless of the rate at which the individual is pursuing training. IHLs may specify different contributions amounts--</p><p class="depth3"><em>(i)</em> Based on student status (i.e. , undergraduate, graduate, doctoral), or</p><p class="depth3"><em>(ii)</em> For each subelement of the institution (i.e., college or professional school). The maximum amount specified for each subelement of the IHL will apply to all programs and disciplines offered under such subelement.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(7)</em> Provide the maximum amount of contributions payable toward the unmet established charges to all participating individuals during each term, quarter, or semester the individual is enrolled if the IHL's total contribution toward the individual's unmet established charges for the term, quarter, or semester, do not exceed the maximum dollar amount payable during the academic year as specified in paragraph (d)(6) of this section.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(e)</em> Centralized Agreements. IHLs with multiple campuses may enter into a single Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement if all participating branches and extensions--</p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Are listed in the agreement;</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> Are subject to the authority of the authorizing official signing the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement; and</p><p class="depth2"><em>(3)</em> Have a certifying official or other employee who meets the requirements of Sec. 21.4266(f)(3)(ii) and who has access to the terms of the Yellow Ribbon Program Agreement.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(f)</em> Matching Contributions. VA will match each dollar provided by the school on behalf of an individual; however, the combined amount of contributions under the Yellow Ribbon Program may not exceed the remaining

amount of established charges not covered under 38 U.S.C. chapter 3313(c)(1)(A).</p><p class="depth1"><em>(g)</em> Outreach. The most current list of colleges and universities participating in the Yellow Ribbon Program will be available at VA's GI Bill Web site at http://www.gibill.va.gov. The list will include specific information on each school's agreement with VA.
