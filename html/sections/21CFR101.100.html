                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The following foods are exempt from compliance with the  requirements of section 403(i)(2) of the act (requiring a declaration on  the label of the common or usual name of each ingredient when the food  is fabricated from two or more ingredients).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> An assortment of different items of food, when variations in the  items that make up different packages packed from such assortment  normally occur in good packing practice and when such variations result  in variations in the ingredients in different packages, with respect to  any ingredient that is not common to all packages. Such exemption,  however, shall be on the condition that the label shall bear, in  conjunction with the names of such ingredients as are common to all  packages, a statement (in terms that are as informative as practicable  and that are not misleading) indicating by name other ingredients which  may be present.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> A food having been received in bulk containers at a retail  establishment, if displayed to the purchaser with either:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The labeling of the bulk container plainly in view, provided  ingredient information appears prominently and conspicuously in  lettering of not less than one-fourth of an inch in height; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> A counter card, sign, or other appropriate device bearing  prominently and conspicuously, but in no case with lettering of less  than one-fourth of an inch in height, the information required to be  stated on the label pursuant to section 403(i)(2) of the Federal Food,  Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the act).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em>, incidental additives are:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Substances that have no technical or functional effect but are  present in a food by reason of having been incorporated into the food as  an ingredient of another food, in which the substance did have a  functional or technical effect.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Processing aids, which are as follows:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Substances that are added to a food during the processing of  such food but are removed in some manner from the food before it is  packaged in its finished form.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Substances that are added to a food during processing, are  converted into constituents normally present in the food, and do not  significantly increase the amount of the constitutents naturally found  in the food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Substances that are added to a food for their technical or  functional effect in the processing but are present in the finished food  at insignificant levels and do not have any technical or functional  effect in that food.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> Substances migrating to food from equipment or packaging or  otherwise affecting food that are not food additives as defined in  section 201(s) of the act; or if they are food additives as so defined,  they are used in conformity with regulations established pursuant to  section 409 of the act.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(4)</em> For the purposes of paragraph (a)(3) of this section, any  sulfiting agent (sulfur dioxide, sodium sulfite, sodium bisulfite,  potassium bisulfite, sodium metabisulfite, and potassium metabisulfite)  that has been added to any food or to any ingredient in any food and  that has no technical effect in that food will be considered to be  present in an insignificant amount only if no detectable amount of the  agent is present in the finished food. A detectable amount of sulfiting  agent is 10 parts per million or more of the sulfite in the finished  food. Compliance with this paragraph will be determined using sections  20.123-20.125, ``Total Sulfurous Acid,'' in ``Official Methods of  Analysis of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists,'' 14th Ed.  (1984), which is incorporated by reference and the refinements of the  ``Total Sulfurous Acid'' procedure in the ``Monier-Williams Procedure  (with Modifications) for Sulfites in Foods,'' which is appendix A to  part 101.

Such  person and such operator shall each keep a copy of such agreement until  2 years after the final shipment or delivery of such food from such  establishment, and shall make such copies available for inspection at  any reasonable hour to any officer or employee of the Department who  requests them.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> The article is an egg product subject to a standard of identity  promulgated in part 160 of this chapter, is to be shipped under the  conditions specified in paragraph (d) (1) or (2) of this section and for  the purpose of pasteurization or other treatment as required in such  standard, and each container of such egg product bears a conspicuous tag  or label reading ``Caution--This egg product has not been pasteurized or  otherwise treated to destroy viable Salmonella microorganisms''. In  addition to safe and suitable bactericidal processes designed  specifically for Salmonella destruction in egg products, the term  ``other treatment'' in the first sentence of this paragraph shall  include use in acidic dressings in the processing of which the pH is not  above 4.1 and the acidity of the aqueous phase, expressed as acetic  acid, is not less than 1.4 percent, subject also to the conditions that:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The agreement required in paragraph (d)(2) of this section shall  also state that the operator agrees to utilize such unpasteurized egg  products in the processing of acidic dressings according to the  specifications for pH and acidity set forth in this paragraph, agrees  not to deliver the acidic dressing to a user until at least 72 hours  after such egg product is incorporated in such acidic dressing, and  agrees to maintain for inspection adequate records covering such  processing for 2 years after such processing.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> In addition to the caution statement referred to above, the  container of such egg product shall also bear the statement  ``Unpasteurized ------ for use in acidic dressings only'', the blank  being filled in with the applicable name of the eggs or egg product.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(e)</em> Conditions affecting expiration of exemptions:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> or (3) of this section shall, at the beginning of the  act of removing such shipment or delivery, or any part thereof, from  such establishment become void ab initio if the food comprising such  shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or misbranded within the  meaning of the act when so removed.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> or  (3) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> of this section shall expire:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> At the beginning of the act of removing such shipment or  delivery, or any part thereof, from such establishment if the food  constituting such shipment, delivery, or part is adulterated or  misbranded within the meaning of the act when so removed; or</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Upon refusal by the operator of the establishment where such  food is to be processed, labeled, or repacked, to make available for  inspection a copy of the agreement, as required by such paragraph.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(f)</em> The word ``processed'' as used in this paragraph shall include  the holding of cheese in a suitable warehouse at a temperature of not  less than 35 F for the purpose of aging or curing to bring   the cheese into compliance with requirements of an applicable definition  and standard of identity. The exemptions provided for in paragraph (d)  of this section shall apply to cheese which is, in accordance with the  practice of the trade, shipped to a warehouse for aging or curing, on  condition that the cheese is identified in the manner set forth in one  of the applicable following paragraphs, and in such case the provisions  of paragraph (e) of this section shall also apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> In the case of varieties of cheese for which definitions and  standards of identity require a period of aging whether or not they are  made from pasteurized milk, each such cheese shall bear on the cheese a  legible mark showing the date at which the preliminary manufacturing  process has been completed and at which date curing commences, and to  each cheese, on its wrapper or immediate container, shall be affixed a  removable tag bearing the statement ``Uncured ------ cheese for  completion of curing and proper labeling'', the blank being filled in  with the applicable name of the variety of cheese.
