                            <p class="depth0">Whenever any person(s) contributing to the formation of an entity are subject to the requirements of the Act by reason of Sec. 801.40 or Sec. 801.50 of this chapter, the new entity need not file the notification required by the Act and Sec. 803.1 of this chapter.</p><p class="depth0">Examples: 1. Corporations A and B, each having sales of in excess of $100 million (as adjusted), each propose to contribute in excess of $50 million (as adjusted) in cash in exchange for 50 percent of the voting securities of a new corporation, N. Under this section, the new corporation need not file notification, although both ``A'' and ``B'' must do so and observe the waiting period prior to receiving any voting securities of N.</p><p class="depth0">2. In addition to the facts in Example 1 of this section, A and B have agreed that upon creation N will purchase 100 percent of the voting securities of corporation C for in excess of $50 million (as adjusted). Because N's purchase of C is not a transaction in connection with N's formation, and because in any event C is not a contributor to the formation of N, ``A,'' ``B'' and ``C'' must file with respect to the proposed acquisition of C and must observe the waiting period.
