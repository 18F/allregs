                            <p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> Privileged communications. Upon application of any person, the  Administrative Law Judge may limit discovery or introduction of evidence  or enter such protective or other orders as in the Judge's judgment may  be consistent with the objective of protecting privileged communications  and of protecting data and other material the disclosure of which would  unreasonably prejudice a party, witness, or third party.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Classified or sensitive matter. </p><p class="depth2"><em>(1)</em> Without limiting the  discretion of the Administrative Law Judge to give effect to any other  applicable privilege, it shall be proper for the Administrative Law  Judge to limit discovery or introduction of evidence or to enter such  protective or other orders as in the Judge's judgment may be consistent  with the objective of preventing undue disclosure of classified or  sensitive matter. When the Administrative Law Judge determines that  information in documents containing sensitive matter should be made  available the Judge may direct the producing party to prepare an  unclassified or nonsensitive summary or extract of the original. The  summary or extract may be admitted as evidence in the record.</p><p class="depth2"><em>(2)</em> If the Administrative Law Judge determines that this procedure  is inadequate and that classified or otherwise sensitive matter must  form part of the record in order to avoid prejudice to any party, the  Judge may so advise the parties and provide an opportunity for  arrangements to permit a party or a representative to have access to  such matter. Such arrangements may include obtaining security clearances  or giving counsel for a party access to sensitive information and  documents subject to assurances against further disclosure.
