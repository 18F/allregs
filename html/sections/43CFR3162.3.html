The cement operation monitoring report must be provided at least

48 hours prior to commencing hydraulic fracturing operations unless the authorized officer approves a shorter time.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> For any well completed pursuant to an APD that did not authorize hydraulic fracturing operations, the operator must submit documentation to demonstrate that adequate cementing was achieved for all casing strings designed to isolate and protect usable water. The operator must submit the documentation with its request for approval of hydraulic fracturing operations, or no less than 48 hours prior to conducting hydraulic fracturing operations if no prior approval is required, pursuant to paragraph (a) of this section.

A continuous record of all annuli pressure during the fracturing operation must be submitted with the required Subsequent Report Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5) identified in paragraph (i) of this section.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> If during any hydraulic fracturing operation any annulus pressure increases by more than 500 pounds per square inch as compared to the pressure immediately preceding the stimulation, the operator must stop the hydraulic fracturing operation, take immediate corrective action to control the situation, orally notify the authorized officer as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours following the incident, and determine the reasons for the pressure increase. Prior to recommencing hydraulic fracturing operations, the operator must perform any remedial action required by the authorized officer, and successfully perform a mechanical integrity test under paragraph (f) of this section. Within 30 days after the hydraulic fracturing operations are completed, the operator must submit a report containing all details pertaining to the incident, including corrective actions taken, as part of a Subsequent Report Sundry Notice (Form 3160-5).</p><p class="depth0"><em>(h)</em> Management of Recovered Fluids. Except as provided in paragraphs (h)(1) and ((2) of this section, all fluids recovered between the commencement of hydraulic fracturing operations and the authorized officer's approval of a produced water disposal plan under BLM requirements must be stored in rigid enclosed, covered, or netted and screened above-ground tanks. The tanks may be vented, unless Federal law, or State regulations (on Federal lands) or tribal regulations (on Indian lands) require vapor recovery or closed-loop systems. The tanks must not exceed a 500 barrel (bbl) capacity unless approved in advance by the authorized officer.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> The authorized officer may approve an application to use lined pits only if the applicant demonstrates that use of a tank as described in this paragraph (h) is infeasible for environmental, public health or safety reasons and only if, at a minimum, all of the following conditions apply:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> The distance from the pit to intermittent or ephemeral streams or water sources would be at least 300 feet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> The distance from the pit to perennial streams, springs, fresh water sources, or wetlands would be at least 500 feet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iii)</em> There is no usable groundwater within 50 feet of the surface in the area where the pit would be located;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(iv)</em> The distance from the pit to any occupied residence, school, park, school bus stop, place of business, or other areas where the public could reasonably be expected to frequent would be greater than 300 feet;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(v)</em> The pit would not be constructed in fill or unstable areas;</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vi)</em> The construction of the pit would not adversely impact the hydrologic functions of a 100-year floodplain; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(vii)</em> Pit use and location complies with applicable local, State (on Federal lands), tribal (on Indian lands) and other Federal statutes and regulations including those that are more stringent than these regulations.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Pits approved by the authorized officer must be:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(i)</em> Lined with a durable, leak-proof synthetic material and equipped with a leak detection system; and</p><p class="depth0"><em>(ii)</em> Routinely inspected and maintained, as required by the authorized officer, to ensure that there is no fluid leakage into the environment.

The decision whether to grant or deny the variance request must be in writing and is entirely within the BLM's discretion.

Sec. 3162.3-4  Well abandonment.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> The operator shall promptly plug and abandon, in accordance with a plan first approved in writing or prescribed by the authorized officer, each newly completed or recompleted well in which oil or gas is not encountered in paying quantities or which, after being completed as a producing well, is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the authorized officer to be no longer capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities, unless the authorized officer shall approve the use of the well as a service well for injection to recover additional oil or gas or for subsurface disposal of produced water. In the case of a newly drilled or recompleted well, the approval to abandon may be written or oral with written confirmation.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Completion of a well as plugged and abandoned may also include conditioning the well as water supply source for lease operations or for use by the surface owner or appropriate Government Agency, when authorized by the authorized officer. All costs over and above the normal plugging and abandonment expense will be paid by the party accepting the water well.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> No well may be temporarily abandoned for more than 30 days without the prior approval of the authorized officer. The authorized officer may authorize a delay in the permanent abandonment of a well for a period of 12 months. When justified by the operator, the authorized officer may authorize additional delays, no one of which may exceed an additional 12

months. Upon the removal of drilling or producing equipment from the site of a well which is to be permanently abandoned, the surface of the lands disturbed in connection with the conduct of operations shall be reclaimed in accordance with a plan first approved or prescribed by the authorized officer.
