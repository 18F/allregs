                            <p class="depth0">Each licensed freight forwarder shall maintain in an orderly and systematic manner, and keep current and correct, all records and books of account in connection with its forwarding business. These records must be kept in the United States in such manner as to enable authorized Commission personnel to readily determine the licensed freight forwarder's cash position, accounts receivable and accounts payable. The licensed freight forwarder may maintain these records in either paper or electronic form, which shall be readily available in usable form to the Commission; the electronically maintained records shall be no less accessible than if they were maintained in paper form. These recordkeeping requirements are independent of the retention requirements of other federal agencies. The licensed freight forwarder must maintain the following records for a period of five years:</p><p class="depth1"><em>(a)</em> General financial data. A current running account of all receipts and disbursements, accounts receivable and payable, and daily cash balances, supported by appropriate books of account, bank deposit slips, canceled checks, and monthly reconciliation of bank statements.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(b)</em> Types of services by shipment. A separate file shall be maintained for each shipment. Each file shall include a copy of each document prepared, processed, or obtained by the licensee, including each invoice for any service arranged by the licensee and performed by others, with respect to such shipment.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(c)</em> Receipts and disbursements by shipment. A record of all sums received and/or disbursed by the licensee for services rendered and out-of-pocket expenses advanced in connection with each shipment, including specific dates and amounts.</p><p class="depth1"><em>(d)</em> Special contracts. A true copy, or if oral, a true and complete memorandum, of every special arrangement or contract between a licensed freight forwarder and a principal, or modification or cancellation thereof. Bona fide shippers shall also have access to such records upon reasonable request.</p>
