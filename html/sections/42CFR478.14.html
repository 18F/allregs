                            <p class="depth0"><em>(a)</em> Basic provision. This subpart applies to reconsiderations and hearings of a QIO initial denial determination involving the following issues:</p><p class="depth0"><em>(1)</em> Reasonableness of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Medical necessity of services.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(3)</em> Appropriateness of the inpatient setting in which services were furnished or are proposed to be furnished.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(b)</em> Concurrent appeal. A reconsideration or hearing provided under this subpart fulfills the requirements of any other review, hearing, or appeal under the Act to which a party may be entitled with respect to the same issues.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(c)</em> Nonapplicability of rules to related determinations. (1) A QIO may not reconsider its decision whether to grant grace days.</p><p class="depth0"><em>(2)</em> Limitation of liability determinations on excluded coverage of certain services are made under section 1879 of the Act. Initial determinations under section 1879 and further appeals are governed by the reconsideration and appeal procedures in part 405, subpart G of this chapter for determinations under Medicare Part A, and part 405, subpart H of this chapter for determinations under Medicare Part B. References in those subparts to initial and reconsidered determinations made by an intermediary, carrier or CMS should be read to mean initial and reconsidered determinations made by a QIO.
