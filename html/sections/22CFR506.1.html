                            <p class="depth0">Many individuals in society possess great productive potential which  goes unrealized because they cannot meet the requirements of a standard  workweek. Permanent part-time employment also provides benefits to other  individuals in a variety of ways, such as providing older individuals  with a gradual transition into retirement, providing employment  opportunities to handicapped individuals or others who require a reduced  workweek, providing parents opportunities to balance family  responsibilities with the need for additional income, providing  employment opportunities for women returning to the workforce and  assisting students who must finance their own education or vocational  training. In view of this, the Broadcasting Board of Governors will  operate a part-time career employment program, consistent with the needs  of its beneficiaries and its responsibilities.</p>
